## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The words διὰ θελ. θεοῦ point probably to the depreciation of Paul’s apostolic authority at Corinth."
2. "Chrys., referring it to κλητός, says, ἐπειδὴ αὐτῷ ἔδοξεν, ἐκλήθημεν, οὐκ ἐπειδὴ ἄξιοι ἦμεν."
3. "Perhaps some slight may have been put upon him by the parties at Corinth, and for that reason Paul puts him forward."

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "In assuming the ministerial office a man should see he does so not of his own impulse, but by the will of God."
2. "Paul if left to his own will would never have been an apostle."
3. "Saul the persecutor turned into Paul the apostle, and Sosthenes the leader in persecution against that apostle, were two trophies of divine grace that, side by side, would appeal with double power to the Church at Corinth."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Paul often refers to the fact that he had received a direct commission from God, and that he did not act on his own authority."

3. "It is evident that Sosthenes was not an apostle, nor is there any reason to think that he was inspired. Some circumstances are known to have existed respecting Paul’s manner of writing to the churches, which may explain it."

### Marvin Vincent:

2. "John does not use the word apostle, but gives the idea." 
3. "Not distinguishing him from other apostles."

### John Calvin:
1. "We believe much more readily the man whom we look upon as regarding us with affection, and as faithfully endeavoring to promote our welfare."
2. "For as no man can lawfully assume the designation and rank of a minister, unless he be called, so it were not enough for any one to be called, if he does not also fulfill the duties of his office."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Called to be an apostle (κλητος αποστολος). Literally, a called apostle (Romans 1:1), not so-called, but one whose apostleship is due not to himself or to men (Galatians 1:1), but to God, through the will of God (δια θεληματος του θεου)."
2. "Paul knows that he is not one of the twelve apostles, but he is on a par with them because, like them, he is chosen by God."
