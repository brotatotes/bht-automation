## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "These designations are not used as pointing to actual parties formed and subsisting among the Corinthians, but as representing the spirit with which they contended against one another, being the sayings of individuals, and not of parties."
2. "Such persons would contend for [Paul's] apostolic authority, and maintain doctrinally his teaching, so far being right; but, as usual with partisans, would magnify into importance practices and sayings of his which were in themselves indifferent."
3. "It would certainly appear that some occasion had been taken by this difference [between Paul and Apollos], to set too high a value on external and rhetorical form of putting forth the gospel of Christ."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Paul will not allow himself to be flattered even by those who made his name their party cry, so as to connive at the dishonor thereby done to Christ."
2. "Apollos, doubtless, did not willingly foster this spirit of undue preference; nay, to discourage it, he would not repeat his visit just then."
3. "If it be wrong to boast 'I am of Peter,' how much more so to boast 'I am of the Pope!'"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Now I say that there are contentions, because you are ranged under different leaders." - Calvin

2. "Paul is not referring so particularly to the factions or parties existing in the church, as he is to the necessity of modesty and humility." 

3. "It can scarcely be doubted that Paul here meant to say that there were parties existing in the church at Corinth, who were called by the names of himself, of Apollos, of Cephas, and of Christ."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The state of the Corinthian church offered the most favorable ground for Paul's Jewish-Christian adversaries, who took advantage of the reaction created by the looser views and practice of Gentile Christians, and by the differences of opinion on important questions, to press the necessity of legal regulation, and of ceremonial observances in non-essentials."

2. "Many modern authorities hold that Paul thus designates a fourth and quite distinct party. This view rests mainly on the form of statement in this verse, and has no support in the epistle."

3. "It seems more probable that those who were 'of Christ' belonged to the party of Peter: that they were native Jews, coming from abroad with letters of recommendation to Corinth, representing themselves as ministers and apostles of Christ, and using His name as the watchword under which they could most successfully prosecute their opposition to Paul and the gospel which he preached."

### John Calvin:
1. "My reason for saying that there are contentions among you is, because every one of you glories in the name of some individual."
2. "For as nothing is more effectual for uniting us, and there is nothing that tends more to draw our minds together, and keep them in a state of peace, than agreement in religion, so, on the other hand, if any disagreement has arisen as to matters of this nature, the effect necessarily is, that men’s minds are straightway stirred up for combat."
3. "His object is, to maintain Christ’s exclusive authority in the Church, so that we may all exercise dependence upon him, that he alone may be recognized among us as Lord and Master, and that the name of no individual be set in opposition to his."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "People naturally have different tastes about styles of preaching and that is well." 
2. "Apollos refused to be a party to this strife and soon returned to Ephesus and refused to go back to Corinth."
3. "This partisan use of the name of Christ may have been made in the name of unity against the other three factions, but it merely added another party to those existing."

### John Gill:
1. "One part of them said, 'I am of Paul'; he had been instrumental in their conversion... they were desirous of being called and distinguished by his name."
2. "Another party said, 'I am of Apollos'; they despised Paul, as a man whose aspect was mean... they chose to be called after him, and in distinction from others."
3. "Whilst another company of them said, 'I am of Cephas'; who with them were new upstart ministers, in comparison of Peter... they fixed on Peter as their minister, and to be called by his name."

These quotes highlight the factions within the Corinthian church, with some aligning themselves with Paul, Apollos, or Peter. They reveal the reasons behind their preferences, such as personal connections, eloquence, or apostolic authority. This commentary sheds light on the divisions and rivalries present in the early church.

### John Wesley:
1. "There are various parties among you, who set themselves, one against another, in behalf of the several teachers they admire."
2. "They spoke well, if they had not on this pretence despised their teachers."
3. "Perhaps they valued themselves on having heard Christ preach in his own person."
