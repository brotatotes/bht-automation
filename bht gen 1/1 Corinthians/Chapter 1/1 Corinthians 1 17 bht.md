# 1 Corinthians 1:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This verse describes the mission and preaching style of the apostle Paul. His focus was not on baptizing, but on preaching the gospel and the cross of Christ. He saw preaching the cross of Christ as his central theme and priority, and he intentionally avoided using human wisdom and eloquence in order to preserve the power and effectiveness of the message. The verse also highlights the importance of the plain declaration of Christ's sacrificial death and its impact on our sins for the success of Paul's ministry.

1. "His mission was not to baptize: a trace already, of the separation of the offices of baptizing and preaching."

3. "Perhaps, as hinted above, the eloquence of Apollos was extolled to Paul’s disadvantage."
4. "In wisdom of speech (i.e. the speculations of philosophy: that these are meant, and not mere eloquence or rhetorical form, appears by what follows, which treats of the subject, and not merely of the manner of the preaching) in order that the Cross of Christ might not be deprived of its effect."
