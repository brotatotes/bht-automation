# 1 Corinthians 1:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The preaching of the cross, though seen as foolishness and despised by many, holds the wisdom and power of God. It is a doctrine that is both aversive and impolite, yet it has the ability to save and is the great instrument of God's power. While some perceive it as sheer absurdity, others recognize it as divinely efficacious, capable of transforming lives and leading to everlasting salvation. The preaching of the cross appeals or repels based on one's judgment and objectives in life.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The preaching of the cross must denote more than [Christ's death as a martyr]; and must mean: (1) That Christ died as an atoning sacrifice for the sins of people, and that it was this which gave its speciality to his sufferings on the cross. (2) That people can be reconciled to God, pardoned, and saved only by the merits and influence of this atoning sacrifice."
2. "To the great mass of the Jews, and to the pagan philosophers, and indeed, to the majority of the people of this world, [the preaching of the cross] has ever appeared foolishness, for the following reasons: (1) The humble origin of the Lord Jesus. (2) They despise him who was put to death, as an impostor, at the instigation of his own countrymen, in an ignominious manner on the cross. (3) They see not why there should be any particular efficacy in his death. (4) They are blind to the true beauty of his personal character; to the true dignity of his nature; to his power over the sick, the lame, the dying, and the dead; they see not the bearing of the work of atonement on the law and government of God; they believe not in his resurrection, and his present state of exalted glory."
3. "The preaching of the cross is 'the power of God;' and every minister may present it with the assurance that he is presenting, not 'a cunningly devised fable,' but a system 'really suited' to save people; and yet, that its reception by the human mind depends on the promised presence of the Holy Spirit."

2. "He indirectly reproves, however, the perverted judgment of the Corinthians, who, while they were, through seduction of words, too easily allured by ambitious teachers, regarded with disdain an Apostle who was endowed with the power of God for their salvation, and that simply because he devoted himself to the preaching of Christ."
3. "In what way the preaching of the cross is the power of God unto salvation, we have explained in commenting upon Romans 1:16."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "For if to bid them change their whole course of life would startle them, to expect them to do it by believing in one who died a malefactor’s death would seem nothing less than sheer absurdity."
