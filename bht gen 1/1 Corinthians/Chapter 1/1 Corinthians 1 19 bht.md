# 1 Corinthians 1:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This verse highlights the temporary nature of human wisdom and understanding. Even the most knowledgeable individuals can lose their wisdom as it is ultimately brought to nothing by God. God's wisdom, however, rises above human philosophizing and the worldly statesmanship, shining through in the Cross of Christ. The reception of the gospel demands an humble mind, as it often confounds human prudence and shows that God is not dependent on the wisdom of man.
