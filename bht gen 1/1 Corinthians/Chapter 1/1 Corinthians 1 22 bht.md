# 1 Corinthians 1:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse describes a striking contrast between the demands of the Jews and the Greeks. The Jews, characterized by their insistent nature, seek miraculous signs as proof of Jesus' Messiahship. On the other hand, the Greeks, marked by their philosophical curiosity, pursue worldly wisdom and knowledge. This comparison highlights the transformative power of faith in Christ crucified, which may appear foolish and scandalous to some, but holds the essence of salvation and forgiveness for those who believe.

The sign required was not, as I have observed on Matthew 12:38, a mere miracle, but some token from Heaven, substantiating the word preached."
