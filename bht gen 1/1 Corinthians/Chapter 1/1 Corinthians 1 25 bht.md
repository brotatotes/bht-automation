Although some see it as foolishness or weakness, the gospel's transformative power triumphs over human wisdom and strength, confounding the presumptions and limitations of the world. It is through the crucifixion of Christ that God's apparent foolishness and weakness manifest His unparalleled wisdom and strength, demonstrating His unmatched glory.
