### Philip Schaff:

It challenges our human tendency to value worldly wisdom and status, and instead highlights the inclusive nature of God's grace.

2. "It is the peculiar usage of the New Testament, and it is thrice so used in this very Epistle." - The commentary points out the specific language used in this verse, emphasizing that the imperative rendering of "behold your calling" is more accurate than the indicative rendering of "ye see." This linguistic detail adds depth to our understanding of the verse.

3. "It is the peculiar usage of the New Testament." - This statement highlights the uniqueness of the language used in the New Testament, indicating that the choice of words and phrasing in this verse is intentional and significant.

2. "It is a clinching illustration of Paul's argument, an argumentum ad hominen." 
3. "After the flesh (κατα σαρκα). According to the standards of the flesh and to be used not only with σοφο (wise, philosophers), but also δυνατο (men of dignity and power), ευγενεις (noble, high birth), the three claims to aristocracy (culture, power, birth)."

### John Gill:
1. "For ye see your calling, brethren,.... That is, those that were called by the grace of God among them; for as circumcision and uncircumcision stand for circumcised and uncircumcised persons, and election for elect persons, and righteousness for righteous persons, Romans 3:30 so here 'calling' designs men called by grace."

2. "The apostle does not say that there were none of the wise, the mighty, and noble called; for there were Crispus, and Sosthenes, rulers of the synagogue, and Gains a rich hospitable man, and Erastus the chamberlain of the city, and it may be some others of a like or better figure in life; but there were not many of them."

3. "Instances of this kind are but few recorded in the Scripture; as Joseph of Arimathea a rich counsellor, Paulus Sergius a Roman deputy, Dionysius the Areopagite, and some in Caesar's palace; which show that nobility, riches, and learning, as they do not at all contribute towards a man's salvation, so neither can they hinder it where grace takes place; but, generally speaking, God has thought fit, for wise reasons, to choose and call persons of different characters."

### John Wesley:
1. "Behold your calling — What manner of men they are whom God calls."
2. "That not many wise men after the flesh — In the account of the world."
3. "Not many mighty — Men of power and authority."
