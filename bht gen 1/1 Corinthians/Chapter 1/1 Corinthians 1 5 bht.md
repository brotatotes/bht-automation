# 1 Corinthians 1:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Bible verse being described is about the Corinthians being enriched in both the preaching and understanding of the word. They were blessed with able preachers, intelligent hearers, and the power of speaking languages as a means of testifying for Christ. Their richness in utterance (speech), knowledge, and divine truth was regarded as a subject of thanksgiving and admiration. Despite any perversions, the Corinthians were marvellously endowed with gifts that qualified them to share the Gospel with others. This congratulation from the apostle Paul aimed to soften their spirits and pave the way for forthcoming reproofs.
