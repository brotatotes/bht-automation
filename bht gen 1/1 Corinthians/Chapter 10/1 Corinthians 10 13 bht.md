# 1 Corinthians 10:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we are reminded that the temptations we face are not extraordinary or unbearable, but rather within the limits of our human strength. God, who is faithful, has entered into a covenant with us and will not allow us to be tempted beyond what we can handle. He provides a way of escape, ensuring that we are never left without help in the face of temptation. It is through our dependence on God and his promises that we can overcome any challenge and find comfort in knowing that we are not alone in our struggles.
