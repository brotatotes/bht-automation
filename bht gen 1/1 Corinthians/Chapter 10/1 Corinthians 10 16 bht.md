# 1 Corinthians 10:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, there is a focus on the cup of blessing over which Christians bless God and set it apart as an emblem of the blood of Christ. The communion is a participation in the blood and body of Christ, symbolized by the cup and bread. Through the act of breaking the bread, we remember the sacrifice and brokenness of Christ's body for our redemption. It is a celebration of our unity with Christ and with one another, as we partake together in the Lord's Supper.
