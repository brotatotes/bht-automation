# 1 Corinthians 10:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Through the act of baptism, the Israelites were both physically and spiritually united with Moses, acknowledging him as their leader and committing to follow the religion he taught them. This initiation into the teachings and beliefs of Moses was symbolized by their passage through the cloud and the sea, which may have served as physical manifestations of water, underscoring their commitment to God and His covenant. Just as Christians are baptized into Christ, the Israelites were baptized unto Moses, signifying their devotion to him and the laws he presented to them.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Entered by the act of such immersion into a solemn covenant with God, and became His church under the law as given by Moses."
2. "Just as we Christians by our baptism are bound in a solemn covenant with God, and enter His Church under the Gospel as brought in by Christ."
3. "The cloud and the sea were both aqueous; and this point of comparison being obtained, serves the Apostle to indicate the outward symbols of their initiation into the church under the government of Moses as the servant of God, and to complete the analogy with our baptism."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The people were led to believe in Moses as God's servant by the miracle of the cloud protecting them, and by their being conducted under him safely through the Red Sea; therefore they are said to be 'baptized unto' him."
2. "There is a resemblance between the symbols also: for the cloud and sea consist of water, and as these took the Israelites out of sight, and then restored them again to view, so the water does to the baptized."
3. "Christ is the pillar cloud that screens us from the heat of God's wrath. Christ as 'the light of the world' is our 'pillar of fire' to guide us in the darkness of the world. As the rock when smitten sent forth the waters, so Christ, having been once for all smitten, sends forth the waters of the Spirit."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "They were baptized 'in the cloud' and 'in the sea,' and this cannot be understood as a religious rite administered by the hand of man." 
2. "It means that they were thus devoted or dedicated to Moses; they received and acknowledged him as their ruler and guide; they professed subjection to his laws, and were brought under his authority." 
3. "The whole case is met by the simple supposition that the apostle means that they were initiated in this way into the religion of Moses, recognized his divine mission, and under the cloud became his followers and subject to his laws."

2. "The immersion was complete for all of them in the sea around them and the cloud over them."

### John Gill:
1. "The Israelites, when they passed through the Red sea, hid the waters on each side of them, which stood up as a wall higher than they, and the cloud over them, so that they were as persons immersed in and covered with water; and very fitly represented the ordinance of baptism as performed by immersion." 

2. "Their following Moses into the sea, which is meant by their being 'baptized into him', was an acknowledgment of their regard unto him, as their guide and governor, as baptism is a following of Christ, who has left us an example that we should tread in his steps."

3. "The descent of the Israelites into the sea, when they seemed as buried in the waters, and their ascent out of it again on the shore, has a very great agreement with baptism, as administered by immersion, in which the person baptized goes down into the water, is buried with Christ therein, and comes up out of it as out of a grave."
