## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "οὐ δύνασθε applies of course to the real spiritual participation of the table of the Lord so as to profit by it: to moral possibility."
2. "The ποτήριον δαιμονίων is said as corresponding to the cup of which mention has been already made, not as Grot., al., and De Wette fancy, referring to the libation at an idol feast."
3. "From this passage probably, the τράπεζα κυρίου became an expression current in all ages of the Christian Church."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Ye cannot drink the cup of the Lord—really and spiritually; though ye may outwardly." 
2. "The Lord's Supper stands, however, in the same relation, analogically, to Christ's sacrifice, as the Jews' sacrificial feasts did to their sacrifices."
3. "Our one sacrifice of Christ is the only substantial reality; therefore, while the partaker of the Jew's sacrificial feast partook rather 'of the altar' than of GOD manifested fully, and the heathen idol-feaster had fellowship really with demons, the communicant in the Lord's Supper has in it a real communion of, or fellowship in, the body of Christ once sacrificed, and now exalted as the Head of redeemed humanity."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It must mean that they could not 'consistently' do it. It was not fit, proper, decent."
2. "The custom of drinking 'toasts' at feasts and celebrations arose from this practice of pouring out wine, or drinking in honor of the pagan gods."
3. "Either the sentiment is unmeaning, or it is a prayer offered to a pagan god, or it is mockery of Yahweh; and in either case it is improper and wicked."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The cup of devils. Representing the heathen feast."
2. "The Lord's table. Representing the Lord's Supper."
3. "The sacredness of the table in heathen worship is apparent from the manner in which it is combined with the altar in solemn formulae."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Ye cannot drink the cup of the Lord, and the cup of the devils." - This quote highlights the impossibility and incongruity of trying to partake in both the communion of Christ and the fellowship of evil. It emphasizes the need to choose between the rightful Sovereign and the base usurper.

2. "Feast upon a sacrifice... spread upon a 'table'." - This quote challenges the notion that the Lord's Supper is a sacrificial act. It suggests that the language used in the New Testament intentionally avoids any reference to an altar, indicating that the focus is on a feast rather than a sacrifice.

3. "If the Lord's Supper is not a sacrifice, the New Testament language about it is just what we should expect: if it is, that language is unaccountable." - This quote raises the question of whether the Lord's Supper is truly a sacrifice. It suggests that the intentional avoidance of sacrificial language in the New Testament supports the idea that the Lord's Supper is not meant to be understood as a sacrificial act.

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Morally impossible to drink the Lord's cup and the cup of demons, to partake of the Lord's table and the table of demons." 
2. "Here the reference is plainly to the Lord's Supper." 
3. "See allusions in O.T. to use of the table in heathen idol feasts."

### John Gill:
1. "Not only they ought not, but they could not rightly, truly, and really drink the cup of wine in the Lord's supper, in the true faith of Christ's bloodshed, and his sacrifice offered up for them, in remembrance of his love, and to the honour of his name."
2. "These things are utterly inconsistent; no man can serve two masters, God and mammon, or God and Baal; nor is there any concord between Christ and Belial, or agreement between the temple of God and idols."
3. "No man can spiritually, however he may externally partake of the entertainment provided, on the table of the Lord, at his supper instituted and kept in commemoration of him; and also with gust and pleasure, and without any concern for the peace of weak minds, and the honour of God, eat things set upon a table in an idol's temple, and before the idol, and as sacrificed unto it."

### John Wesley:
1. "You cannot have communion with both."
2. "To partake of the cup of the Lord is to participate in the fellowship and blessings of Christ."
3. "Drinking the cup of devils represents participation in the sinful and corrupt practices of the world."
4. "This verse emphasizes the need for believers to make a clear choice between following Christ or indulging in worldly pleasures."
5. "It reminds us that we cannot serve two masters and that our allegiance should be solely to God."
