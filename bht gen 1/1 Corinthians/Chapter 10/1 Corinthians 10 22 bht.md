# 1 Corinthians 10:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Bible verse being described highlights the consequences of provoking the Lord to jealousy by dividing our worship between Him and other idols or entities. It poses the question of whether we are stronger than Him, suggesting that we cannot risk defying His power. Provoking God challenges Him to assert His authority and power, but it is well beyond our strength and foolish to contest or expose ourselves to His wrath. Our actions can cause God to be jealous when we prioritize other things over our relationship with Him, and it is futile to challenge His strength and authority.
