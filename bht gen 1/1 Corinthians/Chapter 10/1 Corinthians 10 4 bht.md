### Henry Alford:
1. "they drank from a (or, after a preposition, the) [spiritual, or] miraculous rock which followed them: and I cannot consent to depart from what appears to me the only admissible sense of these words."
2. "the Rock was Christ."
3. "That the MESSIAH, the ANGEL OF THE COVENANT, was present with the church of the Fathers, and that His upholding power was manifested in miraculous interferences for their welfare, was a truth acknowledged no less by the Jew than by the Christian."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The literal water typified 'spiritual drink,' and is therefore so called." 
2. "Christ, the 'Spiritual Rock,' accompanied them." 
3. "'Followed' implies His attending on them to minister to them; thus, though mostly going before them, He, when occasion required it, followed 'behind'."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "There can be no doubt that by 'spiritual drink' here, the apostle refers to the water that was made to gush from the rock that was smitten by Moses... But it must mean that it was bestowed in a miraculous and supernatural manner; and the word 'spiritual' must be used in the sense of supernatural, or that which is immediately given by God." 

2. "The Rock here is called 'spiritual,' not from anything special in the nature of the rock, but because it was the source to them of supernatural mercies, and became thus the emblem and demonstration of the divine favor, and of spiritual mercies conferred upon them by God."

3. "The gushing fountain of water might be regarded as a representation of the Messiah, and of the blessings which result from him... He evidently does mean to say that the rock was a vivid and affecting representation of the Messiah; that the Jews did partake of the mercies that flow from him; and that even in the desert they were under his care, and had in fact among them a vivid representation of him in some sense corresponding with the emblematic representation of the same favors which the Corinthian and other Christians had in the Lord’s Supper."

### Marvin Vincent:

2. "That spiritual rock... a detached fragment of rock about fifteen feet high, with twelve or more fissures in its surface, from which the water is said to have gushed out for the twelve tribes."
3. "Showing that he does not believe the legend, but only uses it allegorically. The important point is that Christ the Word was with His people under the old covenant."

### John Calvin:
1. "The objection that they make — that the rock is spoken of as spiritual, is a frivolous one, inasmuch as that epithet is applied to it simply that we may know that it was a token of a spiritual mystery."
2. "Away, then, with that foolish fancy by which contentious men choose rather to show their impudence, than admit that they are sacramental forms of expression!"
3. "I answer, that though his flesh did not as yet exist, it was, nevertheless, food for them. Nor is this an empty or sophistical subtilty, for their salvation depended on the benefit of his death and resurrection."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "This 'meat' and 'drink' are called 'spiritual,' perhaps primarily, as having been supplied supernaturally, but mainly because under this merely outward and visible sustenance, by which the chosen people were enabled to pursue their way to the Promised Land, is couched the higher nutriment of God's true people which certainly is 'Christ' in their progress towards the 'better country.'" 
2. "The question is...whether the tradition is not itself of later date than our Epistle, and was not suggested by it. As to the actual matter of fact, all we know for certain is, that they had two miraculous supplies of water...one may well say that they had an unfailing supply, or (in the apostle's way of putting it), that 'the Rock followed them.'"
3. "The reader should observe how, five times in the course of these four opening verses, the word 'all' is ominously repeated, the more emphatically to make the sad contrast between the commencement and the close of the journey...in the case of most of them, far from a common end."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Change to the imperfect επινον shows their continual access to the supernatural source of supply."
2. "Paul adopts this 'Rabbinical legend that the water-bearing Rephidim rock journeyed onwards with the Israelites' (Findlay). That is hard to believe, though it is quite possible that Paul alludes to this fancy and gives it a spiritual turn as a type of Christ in allegorical fashion."
3. "He definitely states here in symbolic form the preexistence of Christ. But surely 'we must not disgrace Paul by making him say that the pre-incarnate Christ followed the march of Israel in the shape of a lump of rock' (Hofmann)."

### John Gill:
1. "By which is meant the water out of the rock, which was typical of the blood of Christ, which is drink indeed, and not figurative, as this was, for which reason it is called spiritual."
2. "The communication of the blessings of grace from Christ is through his being smitten by divine justice with the rod of the law; through his being, stricken for the transgressions of his people, and being made sin, and a curse of the law in their room and stead."
3. "The grace of Christ is always sufficient for his people; a continual supply is afforded them; goodness and mercy follow them all the days of their lives."
