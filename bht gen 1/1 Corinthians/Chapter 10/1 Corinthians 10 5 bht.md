# 1 Corinthians 10:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this passage, we are reminded that despite the abundance of divine signs and presence, the majority faced God's displeasure and were overthrown. It serves as a cautionary tale, showing that privileges and signs alone do not ensure security from consequences. The verse emphasizes the importance of obedience and faith, as those who had a different spirit, like Caleb and Joshua, were spared from the devastating consequences experienced by the rest.
