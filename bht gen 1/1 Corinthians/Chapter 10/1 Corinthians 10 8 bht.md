# 1 Corinthians 10:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we are reminded of the severe consequences of disobedience, as seen in the example of the Israelites. The judgment was swift and decisive, resulting in the death of twenty-three thousand people in just one day. This serves as a sobering reminder of God's justice, which extended not only to the initial offenders but also to those who continued in rebellion. The total death toll of twenty-four thousand serves as a stark warning of the importance of obedience and the seriousness of sin to all generations.

"Four and twenty thousand, says Numbers 25:9; but as the actual number would probably be between the two, the thing is here stated in round numbers." - The discrepancy in the number of those who fell (between 23,000 and 24,000) suggests that the focus is not on the exact number, but rather on the seriousness of the consequences of their actions.
