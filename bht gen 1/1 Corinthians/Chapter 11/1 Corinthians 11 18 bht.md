# 1 Corinthians 11:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Within the context of this verse, the commentators emphasize the presence of divisions and factions within the church assembly. These divisions are not merely differences of opinion, but rather uncharitable and disruptive behaviors that hinder unity among the believers. The divisions are seen in their gatherings and are not to be confused with separate churches, but rather as conflicts within the same body of believers. The commentary also highlights the concern for the abuse of spiritual gifts and the impact it had on the orderly worship of the assembly.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
