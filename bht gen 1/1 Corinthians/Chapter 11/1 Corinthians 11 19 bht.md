# 1 Corinthians 11:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the midst of the Corinthians, dissensions and divisions were inevitable, manifesting not only as disagreements but deliberate separations into opposing parties. These separations were characterized by confirmed schisms and theoretical schism. While these divisions may lead to strife and testing, they serve a purpose as they reveal the true friends of God, distinguishing between the sincere followers with upright hearts and those who hold false doctrines. Ultimately, these divisions were allowed by God to display the integrity and faithfulness of individuals within the community.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "There must be (not only dissensions, but) even heresies... indicating a further and more matured separation, where not only is there present dissension, but a deliberate choice and maintenance of party distinction."
2. "It does not appear... that such separations had yet taken place among the Corinthians. Nor even in Clement’s Epistle, forty years after this, do we find any allusion to such, but only, as here, to a general spirit of dissension and variance."
3. "That the approved [also] may be made manifest among you; viz. through a better and nobler spirit being shown by them, than by the contentious and separatists."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Heresies" had not yet its technical sense ecclesiastically, referring to doctrinal errors: it means confirmed schisms.
2. The "must be" arises from sin in professors necessarily bearing its natural fruits: these are overruled by God to the probation of character of both the godly and the ungodly, and to the discipline of the former for glory.
3. ST. AUGUSTINE'S rule is a golden rule as regards questions of heresy and catholicity: "In doubtful questions, liberty; in essentials, unity; in all things, charity."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Such is human nature, such are the corrupt passions of men, the propensity to ambition and strifes, that [divisions] are to be expected, and they serve the purpose of showing who are, and who are not, the true friends of God."
2. "The foundation of this necessity is not in the Christian religion itself, for that is pure, and contemplates and requires union; but the existence of sects, and denominations, and contentious may be traced to the following causes: the love of power and popularity, showing more respect to a religious teacher than to Christ, the multiplication of tests, and the passions of people - their pride, and ambition, and bigotry, and unenlightened zeal."
3. "The effect of divisions and separations would be to show who were the friends of order, and peace, and truth. It seems to have been assumed by Paul, that they who made divisions could not be regarded as the friends of order and truth; or that their course could not be approved by God."

3. "For we ought not to ascribe this advantage to heresies, which, being evil, can produce nothing but what is evil, but to God, who, by his infinite goodness, changes the nature of things, so that those things are salutary to the elect, which Satan had contrived for their ruin."
