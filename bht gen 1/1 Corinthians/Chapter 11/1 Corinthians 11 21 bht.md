# 1 Corinthians 11:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
During communal meals in the early church, there were instances of individuals prioritizing their own needs, bringing their own suppers and partaking without waiting for others. This behavior diminished the sense of unity and neglected the needs of the poor, who were left with nothing. It resembles the gluttonous feasts of the non-believers, reflecting a departure from the spiritual significance of the gathering.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The poor had no ἴδιον δεῖπνον to take, and were the losers by the selfishness of the rich."
2. "One is craving (the poor), another is drunken (the rich)."
3. "There is no need to soften the meaning of μεθύει: as Meyer says, 'Paul draws the picture in strong colours, and who can say that the reality was less strong?'"

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Instead of 'tarrying for one another' (1 Corinthians 11:33); hence the precept." 
2. "His own supper—'His own' belly is his God." 
3. "The one has more than is good for him, the other less."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "They had entirely mistaken the nature of the ordinance, and had converted it into an occasion of ordinary festivity, and even intemperance."
2. "It had become a scene where every man ate by himself; and where the very idea that there was anything like a 'common' celebration, or a celebration 'together,' was abandoned."
3. "Their professed celebration of the Lord’s Supper became a mere revel... similar scenes of gluttony and intemperance would naturally follow."


### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Taketh before other" - This phrase highlights the importance of taking action and not waiting for opportunities to come to us. It encourages us to be proactive in reaching out to those in need and not simply relying on them to seek help from us.

2. "Not waiting for the coming of the poor to participate" - This quote emphasizes the need to actively engage with the less fortunate instead of passively waiting for them to approach us. It reminds us that true compassion requires us to take the initiative and extend a helping hand without hesitation.

3. "Participate" - This word suggests that our involvement should go beyond mere charity or giving material assistance. It implies a deeper level of engagement, where we actively participate in the lives of the poor, understanding their struggles, and working alongside them to find solutions. It calls us to be present and involved in their journey towards a better life.

### John Calvin:
1. "It is truly wonderful, and next to a miracle, that Satan could have accomplished so much in so short a time."
2. "With what liberty Satan must have sported himself."
3. "Paul would have them in no way mix up this spiritual banquet with common feasts."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "In apostolic times it was never observed by itself, so far as appears, but always in connection with those friendly meals called ‘Agapse’ or ‘Love Feasts,’ designed partly to exhibit and exemplify the equality of all Christians rich and poor, slaves and masters alike but also as a way of helping the poorer members without creating the feeling of pauperism."
2. "The idea of this was taken from the way in which the Jewish Passover was celebrated a sumptuous meal at which were taken successive cups of wine with bread, after a fixed form, and with eucharistic chantings of portions of the Psalms."
3. "Thus, in place of a simultaneous observance of the Lord’s Supper, every one might be seen 'taking his own supper before other' 'one hungry,' namely, the poor, who were put off with a sorry portion, another 'drinking freely.'"

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "It was conduct like this that led to the complete separation between the Love-feast and the Lord's Supper."
2. "It was not even a common meal together, not to say a Lord's δειπνον. It was a mere grab-game."
3. "Such disgusting conduct was considered shameful in heathen club suppers."

### John Gill:
1. "But instead of that, he sat down and ate it himself, and would not stay till the rest came, to eat together."
2. "One would sit down and fill himself before another came; so that some went without, whilst others had too much."
3. "He that came late had nothing to eat, and so was hungry; when he that was first either eat and drank to excess, or at least very plentifully."

These quotes highlight the selfish and disorderly behavior of some individuals during communal meals in the place of divine worship. They illustrate how people prioritized their own needs and desires over the well-being and unity of the community.

### John Wesley:
1. "Instead of all partaking of one bread, each person brings his own supper, and eats it without staying for the rest." 
2. "And hereby the poor, who cannot provide for themselves, have nothing." 
3. "While the rich eat and drink to the full just as the heathens use to do at the feasts on their sacrifices."
