In this verse, we find the institution of the Lord's Supper, a meal that distinguishes itself from ordinary meals. It represents the new covenant established between God and humanity, confirmed by the shedding of Christ's blood. As believers partake in this symbolic act, they remember Christ's sacrifice for the forgiveness of sins. This ordinance serves not only as a profession before others but as an inward aid to faith, assuring believers of their salvation and their participation in the eternal inheritance promised by Christ.
