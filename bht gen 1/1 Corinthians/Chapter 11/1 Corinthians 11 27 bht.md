# 1 Corinthians 11:27 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The act of partaking in the Lord's Supper should be done with reverence and understanding of its significance. Whoever partakes of it in an improper or unworthy manner is guilty of profaning that which represents the body and blood of the Lord. To treat the bread and wine with irreverence is to treat the body and blood of Christ in the same manner. This sacrament should not be taken lightly or without regard for its purpose and design.

### Henry Alford:
1. "The death of the Lord was brought about by the breaking of His body and shedding His blood: this Death we proclaim in the ordinance by the bread broken the wine poured out, of which we partake." 
2. "Whoever therefore shall either eat the bread or drink the cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the Body and Blood of the Lord: i.e. 'crimini et pœnæ corporis et sanguinis Christi violati obnoxius erit.'" 
3. "Such an one proclaims the death of Christ, and yet in an unworthy spirit with no regard to that Death as his atonement, or a proof of Christ’s love: he proclaims that Death as an indifferent person: he therefore partakes of the guilt of it."

3. "Unworthiness in the person, is not what ought to exclude any, but unworthily communicating: However unworthy we be, if we examine ourselves so as to find that we penitently believe in Christ's Gospel, we may worthily communicate."

### Albert Barnes:
