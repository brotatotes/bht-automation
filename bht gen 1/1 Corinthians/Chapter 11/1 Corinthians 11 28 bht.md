# 1 Corinthians 11:28 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, individuals are urged to engage in self-examination before partaking in a significant act. By examining their own minds, feelings, and state of being, they can discern their true understanding, beliefs, and motives in relation to a pivotal event. This examination should be meticulous and sincere, penetrating into every aspect of their character and conduct. The purpose of such introspection is to ensure that they possess the necessary qualifications, knowledge, repentance, faith, and desire to actively participate. Ultimately, self-examination allows for personal growth, deeper spiritual understanding, and the development of a closer relationship with God.
