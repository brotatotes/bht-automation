# 1 Corinthians 11:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, individuals are advised not to cover their heads when praying or prophesying in public. This act of veiling the head is seen as a symbol of submission and respect for authority. By uncovering the head, a person acknowledges their role as representatives of Christ and demonstrates their freedom and boldness in approaching God. This practice is in contrast to the customs of certain groups, such as the Greeks and some Jewish worshippers, who covered their heads during public worship.

3. "Rather the reason should be, because Christ, the believer's head, appears for him in heaven, opens a way of access for him, gives him audience and acceptance in his person, and through his blood and righteousness; and therefore should appear with open face and head uncovered, as a token of freedom and boldness."
