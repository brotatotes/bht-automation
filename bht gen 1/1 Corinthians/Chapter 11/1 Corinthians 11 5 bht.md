# 1 Corinthians 11:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, the commentator highlights the significance of women covering their heads during prayer and prophesy. They emphasize that a woman dishonors her head by casting off the headship of the man and disclaiming subjection. The wearing of a veil is seen as a mark of modesty and proper distinction between genders. It is compared to shaving the head, which is associated with mourning and shame. This custom of veiling reflects both social and religious expectations in the ancient context.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "She, if she uncovers herself in such an assembly, dishonours her head by apparently casting off his headship."
2. "But if this be acknowledged to be shameful, let the further decency of the additional covering be conceded likewise."
3. "The neuter is used because the identity is generic, not individual."

(Note: The commentary is discussing the concept of covering and uncovering in relation to the woman's head. It emphasizes the dishonor of the woman casting off the headship of the man and the importance of additional covering for decency. The use of the neuter form is explained as a way to convey a generic identity.)
