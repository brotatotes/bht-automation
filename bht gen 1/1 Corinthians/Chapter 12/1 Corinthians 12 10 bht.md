## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "discourse flowing from the revelation and impulse of the Holy Spirit, which, not being attached to any particular office in the church, but improvised, disclosed the depths of the human heart and of the divine counsel" - Meyer's definition of prophecy as speaking in the Spirit.
2. "the power of distinguishing between the operation of the Spirit of God and the evil spirit, or the unassisted human spirit" - the discerning of spirits.
3. "the power of uttering, in ecstasy, as the mouthpiece of the Spirit, prayer and praise in languages unknown to the utterer, or even in a spiritual language unknown to man" - the power of speaking in different kinds of tongues.

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Miracles of special and extraordinary power."
2. "The inspired disclosure of the future."
3. "Discerning between the operation of God's Spirit, and the evil spirit, or unaided human spirit."
4. "The power of speaking various languages: also a spiritual language unknown to man, uttered in ecstasy."
5. "Interpretation of tongues."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The expression used here, 'working of miracles' refers probably to the more 'extraordinary' and 'unusual' kinds of miracles; to those which were regarded as in advance of the power of healing diseases."
2. "It is clear from all this that there was a difference even among those who had the power of working miracles, and that this power was conferred in a more eminent degree on some than on others."
3. "To another discerning of spirits - This must refer to some power of searching into the secrets of the heart; of knowing what were a man’s purposes, views, and feelings."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Prophecy. Not mere foretelling of the future. Quite probably very little of this element is contemplated; but utterance under immediate divine inspiration: delivering inspired exhortations, instructions, or warnings."
2. "Divers kinds of tongues: PASSAGES RELATING TO THE GIFT OF TONGUES."
3. "MEANING OF THE TERM 'TONGUE.' The various explanations are: the tongue alone, inarticulately: rare, provincial, poetic, or archaic words: language or dialect. The last is the correct definition. It does not necessarily mean any of the known languages of men, but may mean the speaker's own tongue, shaped in a peculiar manner by the Spirit's influence; or an entirely new spiritual language."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Some of the miracles were not healings as the blindness on Elymas the sorcerer."
2. "A most needed gift to tell whether the gifts were really of the Holy Spirit and supernatural or merely strange though natural or even diabolical."
3. "It was not mere gibberish or jargon like the modern 'tongues,' but in a real language that could be understood by one familiar with that tongue."

### John Gill:
1. "mighty deeds, wonderful works, such as are apparently above, and out of the reach of nature, and beyond the compass of human power and skill"
2. "foretelling of future events... or a gift of understanding the prophecies of the Old Testament, and of preaching the Gospel"
3. "by which gift such that were possessed of it could, in some measure, discern the hearts of men, their thoughts, purposes, and designs, their secret dissimulation and hypocrisy"

### John Wesley:
1. "The working of other miracles." - This phrase highlights the presence of additional miracles beyond what is mentioned in the Bible, indicating the continuous manifestation of divine power.
2. "Prophecy — Foretelling things to come." - This quote emphasizes the ability to predict future events, suggesting that prophecy is not limited to the past but extends to the future as well.
3. "The discerning — Whether men be of an upright spirit or no." - This statement underscores the importance of discernment in evaluating the character and intentions of individuals, particularly in the context of their suitability for roles within the church.
