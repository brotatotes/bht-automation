# 1 Corinthians 12:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, commentators emphasize the interconnectedness and interdependence of the members of the Christian body. The analogy of the body illustrates that each member, with their unique gifts and strengths, has a vital role to play in the functioning of the Church. Just as a body cannot function properly if any of its members are weak or in conflict, the same holds true for a community or society. This passage encourages unity and cooperation among believers, recognizing that everyone's contribution is valuable and necessary for the growth and well-being of the Church.

3. "The passage is also illustrated by Seneca de Ira, ii. 31, 'Quid si nocere velint manus pedibus, manibus oculi? Ut omnia inter se membra consentiunt, quia singula servari totius interest: ita homines singulis parcent, quia ad c≈ìlum geniti sumus: salva autem esse societas nisi amore et custodia partium non potest.'"
