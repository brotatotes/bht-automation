# 1 Corinthians 12:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This verse challenges comparisons and exclusions within the body of Christ. It emphasizes the importance of valuing and recognizing the unique contributions of each member, regardless of their perceived importance or role. The verse dynamically presents the argument by using both affirmative and interrogative forms, inviting readers to reflect on their attitude towards other members of the body. It reminds us that each person plays a vital role in the Church, and that no one should be disregarded or undervalued based on their perceived significance or gifts.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The ὅτι is rightly rendered in E. V. because."
2. "These words [may be taken, here and in the next verse, 'it is not therefore not of the body.' But they] are best taken as a question, appealing to the sense of the reader: they thus have more of the vigour of the Apostle’s style."
3. "The double negation strengthens."

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "The humbler members ought not to disparage themselves, or to be disparaged by others more noble."
2. "The humble speaks of the more honorable member which most nearly resembles itself."
3. "As in life each compares himself with those whom he approaches nearest in gifts, not those far superior."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The same figure and illustration which Paul here uses occurs also in pagan writers."
2. "The idea here is, that as the foot and the ear could not pretend that they were not parts of the body, and even not important, because they were not the eye, etc."
3. "No Christian, however humble his endowments, could pretend that he was useless because he was not more highly gifted and did not occupy a more elevated rank."

### John Calvin:
1. "Each member ought to rest satisfied with its own place and station, and not envy the others."
2. "He institutes a comparison between the more distinguished members and those that have less dignity."
3. "Lest ambition or misdirected emulation and envy should be the occasion of bad feeling among us."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "If the foot shall say, Because I am not the hand, I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the body?" - This verse challenges the idea of comparison and exclusion within the body of Christ. It highlights the importance of recognizing and valuing the unique contributions of each member, regardless of their perceived importance or role. [1]

2. "The grammatical principle is undoubtedly correct; but since very much depends in such cases on how the statement is concerned by the writer, we incline to think that the real sense is conveyed quite as correctly by the interrogative form as by the affirmative." - The commentary suggests that the interrogative form of the verse may be just as valid as the affirmative form. This highlights the dynamic and lively nature of the argument being made in the passage. [1]

3. "And if legitimate at all, there can be little doubt that it is most accordant with the lively style and strain of the argument." - The commentary emphasizes that the interrogative form aligns better with the vibrant and persuasive style of the argument being presented. This further reinforces the idea that the verse is meant to provoke thought and challenge preconceived notions. [1]

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "I am independent of the body, not dependent on the body."
2. "Thinking or saying so does not change the fact."
3. "The two negatives (ου--ουκ) do not here destroy one another. Each retains its full force."

### John Gill:
1. "The meanest person in the mystical body, the church, though he should say, that because he is not so handy and useful as another, cannot give so largely, nor do so much as another, therefore he is no proper member of the church; it does not follow that so it is, for Christ, the head of the church, regards such as members."
2. "He admires the 'beauty' of his church's 'feet', and has provided for the covering, ornament, and security of them, being himself clothed with 'a garment down to the feet', which equally covers and adorns that part of the body as the rest."
3. "He does not break the bruised reed, nor quench the smoking flax, or despise the day of small things; he regards their prayers, and takes notice and accepts of their meanest services; and they are, and should be considered as members of the body, by the rest and by themselves."

### John Wesley:
1. "The foot is elegantly introduced as speaking of the hand; the ear, of the eye; each, of a part that has some resemblance to it." 

2. "So among men each is apt to compare himself with those whose gifts some way resemble his own, rather than with those who are at a distance, either above or beneath him."

3. "Is it therefore not of the body — Is the inference good? Perhaps the foot may represent private Christians; the hand, officers in the church; the eye, teachers; the ear, hearers."
