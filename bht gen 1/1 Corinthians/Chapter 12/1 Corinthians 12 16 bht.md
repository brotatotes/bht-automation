## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The verse highlights the importance of unity and diversity within the body of Christ. Just as the body is made up of different parts, each with its own unique function, so too is the church made up of diverse individuals with different gifts and talents." 

2. "This verse reminds us that every member of the body is necessary and valuable. No one should feel inferior or insignificant because their role may seem less prominent or glamorous. Each person has a vital role to play in the overall functioning and growth of the body." 

3. "The verse also emphasizes the interdependence of the members. Just as the eye cannot say to the hand, 'I don't need you,' so too should we recognize our need for one another. We are designed to work together, supporting and complementing each other's strengths and weaknesses."

### John Gill:
1. "Those who hear so as to love, savour, and relish [the word of God]; so as to understand and believe it, and to act in compliance with it; and distinguish it for themselves, though they may not be able to give a distinct account of it to others, or instruct others in it."
2. "[Ministers of the Gospel] are the light of the world, have a clear insight into the doctrines of the Gospel, and communicate their light to others; they are set in the highest place in the church, and as watchmen and overseers there, to instruct; guide, and direct the members of it."
3. "Such as are only hearers of the Gospel, being affectionate, believing, understanding and fruitful hearers; though they have not such large knowledge and clear light, so as to be capable of overseeing and instructing others, yet are true and useful members of the church, are highly respected by Christ the head, and to be had in esteem by their fellow members, who may be superior to them."
