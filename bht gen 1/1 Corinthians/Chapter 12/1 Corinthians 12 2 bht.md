# 1 Corinthians 12:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the commentators highlight the stark contrast between the former idolatrous practices of the Gentiles and the current belief in the living and speaking God. The idols of the past were described as "dumb idols," leading their worshippers blindly and without any fixed principles. The commentators emphasize that these idols were an illusion, never uttering any oracles or having any real influence. The Gentiles were carried away by their false guides, the priests and magistrates, while remaining ignorant of the true God who bestows gifts by His grace.
