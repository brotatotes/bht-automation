# 1 Corinthians 12:26 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, the commentators emphasize the interconnectedness and unity of the body. The sufferings and joys of one member affect the entire body, as all members are intimately connected. This interconnectedness calls for empathy, support, and a sense of shared responsibility among the members. In times of affliction, the other members are called to sympathize, help, and bear part of the distress. Similarly, when one member is honored, all members are encouraged to rejoice, as it reflects the unity and mutual benefit within the body of Christ.
