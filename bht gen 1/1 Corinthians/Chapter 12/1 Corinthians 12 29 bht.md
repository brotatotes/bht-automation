# 1 Corinthians 12:29 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Within the text, there is an emphasis on the diversity of gifts and roles within the community. It is acknowledged that not everyone possesses the same level of understanding or abilities, and this should be accepted and celebrated. Each individual contributes their unique aspect to the community, forming a complete and harmonious body. While there are various roles and gifts, not everyone falls into each category, and exceptions can be found within each group. The emphasis is on unity and acceptance, rather than judgment or exclusion based on differences.
