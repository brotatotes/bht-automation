# 1 Corinthians 12:30 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Within the body of Christ, there are diverse gifts and roles, including prophecy, speaking in tongues, and the gift of interpretation. These gifts are not possessed by all, emphasizing the uniqueness and importance of each individual's contribution. The ability to interpret messages spoken in tongues is crucial for understanding and applying these messages within the church. This verse also highlights the distinctions between members, as not everyone has the gift of interpretation or other gifts such as healing through anointing with oil.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The question 'Do all interpret?' implies that not everyone has the gift of interpretation, just as not everyone has the gift of prophecy or speaking in tongues." 

2. "The gift of interpretation is essential for the proper functioning of the body of Christ, as it allows for the understanding and application of messages spoken in tongues." 

3. "This verse highlights the importance of diversity within the body of Christ, as each member has different gifts and roles to play in the edification of the church."

### John Gill:
1. "When anointing with oil, in order to heal the sick, was in use, it was only performed by the elders of the church, not by the common members of it."
2. "Do all speak with tongues? No; it was not true in fact, as they well knew; though this was greatly coveted after."
3. "Do all interpret? That is, unknown tongues, strange languages; or can they? No. This also was a peculiar gift bestowed on some persons only."
