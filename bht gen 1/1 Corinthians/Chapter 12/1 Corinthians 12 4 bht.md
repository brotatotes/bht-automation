# 1 Corinthians 12:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This verse highlights the diverse and varied spiritual gifts bestowed upon believers. These gifts are of different types, functions, and operations, all originating from the same Holy Spirit. The unity of the Church is represented through the combination and harmony of these diverse gifts, analogous to different sounds in music coming together to create harmony. Each gift is significant and should not be despised, as they all serve a purpose within the body of Christ.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "diversities of gifts—that is, varieties of spiritual endowments peculiar to the several members of the Church"
2. "The Holy Trinity appears here: the Holy Spirit in this verse; Christ in 1 Corinthians 12:5; and the Father in 1 Corinthians 12:6."
3. "The terms 'gifts,' 'administrations,' and 'operations,' respectively correspond to the Divine Three."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The design for which he refers to these various endowments is evidently to show those whom he addressed, that since they are all produced by the same Holy Spirit, have all the same divine origin, and are all intended to answer some important purpose and end in the Christian church, that, therefore, none are to be despised; nor is one man to regard himself as authorized to treat another with contempt."

2. "The Spirit has divided and conferred those gifts according to his sovereign will; and his arrangements should be regarded with submission, and the favors which he confers should be received with thankfulness."

3. "That the Holy Spirit - the third person of the adorable Trinity - is here intended by the word 'Spirit,' seems to be manifest on the face of the passage, and has been the received interpretation of the church until it was called in question by some recent German commentators, at the head of whom was Eichhorn."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "A distribution of gifts implying a diversity."
2. "Gifts... commonly of spiritual service of an official character."
3. "Ministrations... of spiritual service of an official character."

### John Calvin:
1. "The symmetry of the Church consists, so to speak, of a manifold unity, that is, when the variety of gifts is directed to the same object, as in music there are different sounds, but suited to each other with such an adaptation, as to produce concord."
2. "He prohibits them from going beyond their own limits by a foolish ambition. In fine, he exhorts that every one should consider how much has been given him, what measure has been allotted to him, and to what he has been called."
3. "The sum of what he states amounts to this — that gifts are not distributed thus variously among believers, in order that they may be used apart, but that in the division there is a unity, inasmuch as one Spirit is the source of all those gifts, one God is the Lord of all administrations, and the author of all exercises of power."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Diversities (διαιρεσεις). Old word for distinctions, differences, distributions." This quote highlights the meaning of the word "diversities" in the verse, emphasizing that it refers to various distinctions and differences among individuals.

2. "Of gifts (χαρισματων). Late word and chiefly in Paul... It means a favour bestowed or received without any merit." This quote provides insight into the term "gifts," explaining that it refers to favors or blessings given without any deserving on the part of the recipient.

3. "From χαριζομα) bestowed or received without any merit as in Romans 1:11." This quote further reinforces the idea that the gifts mentioned in the verse are given or received without any merit, drawing a parallel to a similar concept mentioned in Romans 1:11.

### John Gill:
1. "The gifts are different, some have greater, and others lesser, none have all, but all have some, yet not alike."
2. "The same Spirit is the author and giver of all as he pleases; the lesser gifts, and the smallest degree of them, come from the Spirit of God, as well as the greater."
3. "Gifts here seem to be the general name for all that follow; and administrations and operations are the two species of them; and of these a particular account is afterwards given."

### John Wesley:
1. "Divers streams, but all from one fountain."
2. "The apostle treats of the Spirit, Christ, and God."
3. "There are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit."
