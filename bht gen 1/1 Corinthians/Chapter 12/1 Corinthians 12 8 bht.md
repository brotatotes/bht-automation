# 1 Corinthians 12:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Believers are endowed with different gifts, as Henry Alford explains, including σοφία and γνῶσις, which are practical and theoretical aspects of wisdom. Albert Barnes adds that σοφία is the ability to comprehend and explain the scheme of redemption, while John Gill mentions the deep doctrines of the Gospel and knowledge of future events. These gifts, as John Wesley suggests, provide believers with a deeper understanding of God's wisdom and the fulfillment of prophecies in the Old Testament. Together, these gifts enrich believers' comprehension of the gospel and equip them to share its truths with others.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "According to Neander, σοφία is the skill, which is able to reduce the whole practical Christian life into its due order in accordance with its foundation principles."
2. "Both, as De W. remarks, have their grounds in usage: σοφία is practical, as is γνῶσις, but they are theoretical respectively in ch. 1 Corinthians 1:17 ff. and 1 Corinthians 8:1."
3. "Meyer says, 'σοφία is the higher Christian wisdom in and of itself; so that discourse which expresses its truths, makes them clear, applies them, &c. is λόγος σοφίας. But this does not necessarily imply the speculative penetration of these truths, the philosophical treatment of them by deeper and more scientific investigation, in other words, γνῶσις: and discourse which aims at this is λόγος γνώσεως.'"
