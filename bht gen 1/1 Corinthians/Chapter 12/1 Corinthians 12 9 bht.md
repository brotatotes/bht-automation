# 1 Corinthians 12:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, commentators highlight the nature and power of faith. They emphasize that faith is not just about doctrinal beliefs, but also about confidence in the power of miracles and a deep trust in God's promises. It is an active force that produces wonder and awe, leading to a transformation of the heart and mind. This wonder-working faith goes beyond human limitations and circumstances, rooted in the unlimited power and sovereignty of God. It is through this kind of faith that we can experience the presence and miracles of God in our lives.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Faith, as Chrysostom explains, is not referring to doctrinal beliefs, but to the belief in the power of miracles, as Jesus says, 'If you have faith like a mustard seed' (Mat 17:20). The apostles also asked for this kind of faith, saying, 'Increase our faith' (Luk 17:5). This kind of faith is the mother of miracles." (Hom. xxix. p. 263)

2. "In, i.e. by and through, as the effective cause and the medium." 

3. "Gifts of (miraculous) healings; plur., to indicate the different kinds of diseases, requiring different sorts of healing."

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Faith...confidence in God, by the impulse of His Spirit, that He would enable them to perform any required miracle."
2. "Its nature, or principle, is the same as that of saving faith, namely, reliance on God."
3. "Saving faith does not save by its intrinsic merit, but by the merits of Him who is the object of it."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Many of the most useful people in the church are distinguished mainly for their simple confidence in the promises of God; and often accomplish more by prayer and by their faith in God than others do who are distinguished for their wisdom and learning."
2. "Humble piety and reliance in the divine promises, and that measure of ardor, fearlessness, and zeal which result from such confidence; that belief that all obstacles must be and will be overcome that oppose the gospel; and that God will secure the advancement of his cause, will often do infinitely more in the promotion of his kingdom than the most splendid endowments of learning and talent."
3. "Faith is one of the highest endowments of the Christian life; and yet, though all may obtain it, it is one of the rarest endowments. Perhaps by many it is despised, because it may be obtained by all; because it is a grace in which the poor and the humble may be as much distinguished as the man of splendid talents and profound learning."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Faith is not just a passive belief, but an active force that produces wonder and awe in the believer."

2. "This wonder-working faith goes beyond mere intellectual assent and leads to a transformation of the heart and mind."

3. "It is through wonder-working faith that we experience the power and presence of God in our lives, and are able to witness His miracles and supernatural workings."

4. "This kind of faith moves beyond doubt and skepticism, and allows us to fully trust in God's promises and His ability to do the impossible."

5. "Wonder-working faith is not limited by human limitations or circumstances, but is rooted in the unlimited power and sovereignty of God."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Faith (πιστις). Not faith of surrender, saving faith, but wonder-working faith like that in 1 Corinthians 13:2 (Matthew 17:20; Matthew 21:21)."

2. "Note here εν τω αυτω πνευματ (in the same Spirit) in contrast with δια and κατα in verse 1 Corinthians 12:8."

3. "Gifts of healings (χαρισματα ιαματων). Ιαμα, old word from ιαομα, common in LXX, in N.T. only in this chapter. It means acts of healing as in Acts 4:30 (cf. James 5:14) and Luke 7:21 (of Jesus). Note εν here as just before."

### John Gill:
1. "Not the grace of faith, which is common to all believers, though given by the same Spirit: but rather the doctrine of faith, and ability to preach it, and boldness and intrepidity of spirit to assert and defend it in the face of all opposition; all which are from the Spirit of God." 

2. "Though generally this is understood of a faith of working miracles, as in 1 Corinthians 13:2 but the working of miracles is mentioned afterwards as distinct, unless it can be thought that this is the general name for miracles, and the rest that follow the particulars of them."

3. "These gifts were bestowed in common, by the Spirit, on apostles, prophets, and pastors, or elders of the church, in those early times."

### John Wesley:
1. "Faith may here mean an extraordinary trust in God under the most difficult or dangerous circumstances."
2. "The gift of healing need not be wholly confined to the healing diseases with a word or a touch."
3. "And thus it may be with regard to other gifts likewise...the power of God exerts itself in a more covert manner, under human studies and helps."
