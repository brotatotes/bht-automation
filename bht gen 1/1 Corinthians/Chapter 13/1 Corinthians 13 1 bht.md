# 1 Corinthians 13:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse being described focuses on the surpassing importance of love as the guiding principle of our actions. Without love, even the most impressive abilities and gifts lose their value. Love is not limited to a specific group; it encompasses all people, reflecting both love for God and love for others. The verse also highlights how lacking love renders our words and actions empty and meaningless, like the clash of metal or musical instruments played without purpose.

2. "The speaking with tongues was ever in an articulate language."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

### Albert Barnes:
1. "To correct this, and to show them that all this would be vain without love, and to induce them, therefore, to seek for love as a more valuable endowment, was the design of the apostle in this passage."

2. "Even though a man had a far higher faculty of speaking languages than would be included in the endowment of speaking all the languages of human beings as people speak them, and even had the higher and more perfect mode of utterance which the angels have, and yet were destitute of love, all would be nothing."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Charity follows the caritas of the Vulgate, and is not used consistently in the A. V. On the contrary, in the gospels, ajgaph is always rendered love, and mostly elsewhere, except in this epistle, where the word occurs but twice."
2. "There is no more reason for saying 'charity envieth not,' than for saying 'God is charity;' 'the charity of Christ constraineth us;'' 'the charity of God is shed abroad in our hearts.'"
