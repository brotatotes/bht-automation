# 1 Corinthians 13:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, there is a vivid contrast drawn between our present limited understanding and the future perfect knowledge that awaits us. Commentators describe this contrast as between seeing through imperfect mirrors in the ancient world to a direct, face-to-face view in the future. The current knowledge we have of God and His divine plans is like looking through a dim, unclear medium, while the future promises a clear and distinct understanding. In this future state, there will be no need for enigmas, dark discourses, or obscured forms - we will fully know and see God as He truly is.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Contrast between our present sight and knowledge, and those in the future perfect state."
2. "We must think, not of our mirrors of glass, but of the imperfectly-reflecting metallic mirrors of the ancients."
3. "There is a reference to ref. Num., στόμα κατὰ στόμα λαλήσω αὐπῷ ἐν εἴδει, καὶ οὐ διʼ αἰνιγμάτων. Many take the words adverbially, 'enigmatically' (so E. V., 'darkly'): but this cannot be [the strict rendering], because αἴνιγμα is objective, not subjective: 'a dark hint given by words.'"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The contrast is between the inadequate knowledge of an object gained by seeing it reflected in a dim mirror (such as ancient mirrors were), compared with the perfect idea we have of it by seeing itself directly."
2. "But neither 'eye nor ear' can fully represent (though the believer's soul gets a small revelation now of) 'the things which God hath prepared for them that love Him.'"
3. "God's communications with Moses were 'not in enigmas.' But compared with the intuitive and direct vision of God hereafter, even the revealed word now is 'a dark discourse,' or a shadowing forth by enigma of God's reflected likeness."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Compared with what it will be in the future world, it is like the imperfect view of an object which we have in looking through an obscure and opaque medium compared with the view which we have when we look at it 'face to face.'"
2. "It is not improbable, I think, that even in the time of Paul the ancients had the knowledge of glass, though it was probably at first very imperfect and obscure."
3. "But then shall I know - My knowledge shall be clear and distinct. I shall have a clear view of those objects which are now so indistinct and obscure."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The thought of imperfect seeing is emphasized by the character of the ancient mirror, which was of polished metal, and required constant polishing, so that a sponge with pounded pumice-stone was generally attached to it."
2. "The figure of the mirror, illustrating the partial vision of divine things, is frequent in the rabbinical writings, applied, for instance, to Moses and the prophets."
3. "Darkly [εν αινιγματι]. Lit., in a riddle or enigma, the word expressing the obscure form in which the revelation appears."

### John Calvin:
1. "The ministry of the word, I say, is like a looking-glass...we behold the image of God as it is presented before us in the word, in the sacraments, and, in fine, in the whole of the service of the Church." 
2. "The knowledge of God, which we now have from his word, is indeed certain and true, and has nothing in it that is confused, or perplexed, or dark, but is spoken of as comparatively obscure, because it comes far short of that clear manifestation to which we look forward."
3. "Then we shall see God — not in his image, but in himself, so that there will be, in a manner, a mutual view."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The mirrors of those days were not like ours, but polished metallic surfaces, reflecting objects but imperfectly; and since the figure seemed to be behind the mirror, the observer seemed to see 'through' it." 
2. "Bengel notes an allusion here to Numbers 12:8, 'With him (Moses) will I speak face to face, and not in dark speeches' (or 'in enigmas')." 
3. "Now I know in part, but then shall I know (or 'know fully') even as also I have been known (or 'known fully')."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "To see a friend's face in a cheap mirror would be very different from looking at the friend."
2. "Face to face. Note triple use of προς which means facing one as in John 1:1."
3. "I shall fully (επι-) know."

### John Gill:
1. "In this present life, they that are enlightened by the Spirit of God, see God, the perfections and glory of his nature, the riches of his grace and goodness, as displayed in Christ."
2. "It is only in his Son, and through the glass of the Gospel, he is to be beheld in this light."
3. "There will be no intervening mediums of vision; not the glass of the word and ordinances; there will be no need of them, God and Christ will be seen as they are."

### John Wesley:
1. "But by means of a glass - Or mirror, which reflects only their imperfect forms, in a dim, faint, obscure manner; so that our thoughts about them are puzzling and intricate, and everything is a kind of riddle to us." 

2. "But then — We shall see, not a faint reflection, but the objects themselves. Face to face — Distinctly." 

3. "Now I know in part — Even when God himself reveals things to me, great part of them is still kept under the veil. But then I shall know even as also I am known — In a clear, full, comprehensive manner; in some measure like God, who penetrates the centre of every object, and sees at one glance through my soul and all things."
