# 1 Corinthians 13:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, Paul speaks of three enduring graces: faith, hope, and love. According to commentators, these graces surpass the temporary gifts mentioned earlier. Faith is described as a steadfast trust in God that continues both on earth and in heaven. Hope is seen as a combination of desire and expectation, which finds fulfillment in the future joys of heaven. Love, the greatest of these graces, is highlighted for its eternal nature, its positive effects on others, and its resemblance to the attribute of God Himself.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Some gifts shall pass away but these three great graces shall remain for ever FAITH, HOPE, LOVE."
2. "In the form of holy confidence and trust, faith will abide even there. The stay of all conscious created being, human or angelic, is dependence on God."
3. "The greater, because it contains in itself the root of the other two: we believe only one whom we love, we hope only that which we love."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Whereas it is the case that the three gifts, 'prophecy,' 'tongues,' and 'knowledge' (cited as specimens of the whole class of gifts) 'fail' (1 Corinthians 13:8), there abide permanently only these three—faith, hope, charity."
2. "Charity, or love, alone never faileth (1 Corinthians 13:8)."
3. "Even hereafter faith in the sense of trust in God 'abideth'; also 'hope,' in relation to ever new joys in prospect, and at the anticipation of ever increasing blessedness, sure never to be disappointed. But love alone in every sense 'abideth'; it is therefore 'the greatest' of the three."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "And the connection certainly requires us to understand him as saying that faith, hope, and love would survive 'all' those things of which he had been speaking, and must, therefore, include knowledge... as well as miracles and the other endowments of the Holy Spirit." 
2. "Faith is 'confidence' in God and in Christ; and there will be as much necessity of 'confidence' in heaven as on earth... heaven could not subsist a moment without 'confidence;' and faith, therefore, must be eternal." 
3. "Hope is a compound emotion, made up of a 'desire' for an object and an 'expectation' of obtaining it. But both these will exist in heaven... if there is anything 'future' that is an object of desire, there will be hope."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Now is logical and not temporal."
2. "The essential permanence of the three graces is asserted."
3. "In their nature they are eternal."

### John Calvin:
1. "But now remaineth faith, hope, love. This is a conclusion from what goes before — that love is more excellent than other gifts; but in place of the enumeration of gifts that he had previously made, he now puts faith and hope along with love, as all those gifts are comprehended under this summary." 
2. "For what is the object of the entire ministry, but that we may be instructed as to these things? Hence the term faith has a larger acceptation here, than in previous instances; for it is as though he had said — 'There are, it is true, many and various gifts, but they all point to this object, and have an eye to it.'"
3. "The greatest of these is love. It is so, if we estimate its excellence by the effects which he has previously enumerated; and farther, if we take into view its perpetuity. For every one derives advantage from his own faith and hope, but love extends its benefits to others."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The cardinal graces of faith and hope and love, without which the Christian character cannot exist, will abide on earth as long as the Church itself is left there."
2. "Those Jewish scholars who refuse to accept Christians may produce from their rabbinical writings single passages embodying maxims akin to those of the New Testament; but the two have only to be put together to shew which alone has the stamp of Heaven upon it."
3. "Whoever will read this chapter with a simple mind will be unable to resist the conviction that the true secret of what alone unites all hearts was in possession of the writer of it, that he felt himself commissioned to open this secret to others, and that he even exulted in doing it."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "The other gifts pass away, but these abide forever."
2. "Love is necessary for both faith and hope."
3. "Greatest, Dr. Jones holds, because love is an attribute of God."

### John Gill:
1. "Faith is the grace by which a soul sees Christ, goes unto him, lays hold on him, receives him, relies on him, and lives upon him."
2. "Hope is that grace by which saints wait for things promised, and rejoice in the believing views of glory and happiness."
3. "Charity is the greatest of these graces because of its peculiar properties and effects, its usefulness in serving others, and its durability in the other world."

Note: The commentary also mentions the comparison made by the Jews between humility and charity, but it is not necessary to include that quote in the response.

### John Wesley:
1. "Faith, hope, love — Are the sum of perfection on earth." 
2. "Love alone is the sum of perfection in heaven." 
3. "Love is the greatest virtue that transcends all others."
