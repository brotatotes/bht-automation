# 1 Corinthians 13:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This verse speaks of the importance of love in the exercise of spiritual gifts and understanding of mysteries. The gifts of prophecy and knowledge may be impressive, but without love, they lack true significance. Faith that moves mountains and the ability to perform miracles are futile without love. The verse emphasizes that love is the essential ingredient that brings value and purpose to all other spiritual abilities and gifts.
