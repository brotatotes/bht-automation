# 1 Corinthians 13:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the commentator's insights indicate that the actions described - giving all possessions to the poor or even undergoing martyrdom - are meaningless without genuine love. They emphasize that love should be the driving force behind these actions, rather than selfish motives or desires for recognition. The importance of love is highlighted as the foundation for true spirituality, with the absence of love rendering other achievements insignificant.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "If I bestow in food all my substance... Both the deeds mentioned in this verse are such as ordinarily are held to be the fruits of love, but they may be done without it, and if so, are worthless." 
2. "He evidently means in self-sacrifice: for country, or friends." 
3. "The objections to it seem to me to be, (1) It leaves παραδῶ standing in a very vague and undefined meaning 'deliver, to what?' (2) It introduces an irrelevant and confusing element, a boastful motive, into a set of hypotheses which put forward merely an act or set of acts on the one side, and the absence of love on the other."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "One of the highest functions of the 'helps'." 
2. "These are most noble exemplifications of love in giving and in suffering."
3. "Men will fight for Christianity, and die for Christianity, but not live in its spirit, which is love."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Charity or alms to the poor, was usually distributed at one’s gate... There would be many more to be thankful, and to celebrate one’s praises."
2. "To make the case as strong as possible, Paul says that if all that a man had were dealt out in this way, in small portions, so as to benefit as many as possible, and yet were not attended 'with true love toward God and toward man,' it would be all false, hollow, hypocritical, and really of no value in regard to his own salvation."
3. "Though I should be willing to lay down my life in the most painful manner, and have not charity, it would profit me nothing."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The verb means to feed out in morsels, dole out." 
2. "The change to burned might have been suggested by the copyist's familiarity with Christian martyrdoms." 
3. "Martyrdom for the sake of ambition was a fact of early occurrence in the Church."

### John Calvin:
1. "Liberality in many cases proceeds from ambition — not from true generosity, or even the man that is liberal is destitute of the other departments of love."
2. "Even martyrdom, which is the most lovely and excellent act of all, is regarded as nothing by God if the mind is destitute of love."
3. "As love is the only rule of our actions, and the only means of regulating the right use of the gifts of God, nothing, in the absence of it, is approved of by God, however magnificent it may be in the estimation of men."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor...yet without love, this will avail me nothing." 
2. "Fundamentally, it can only be what Israel was familiar with even from the days of their wilderness journeyings: 'Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart and soul and mind and strength, and thy neighbour as thyself.'"
3. "This love takes possession of our hearts by being shed abroad in them by the Holy Ghost 'given unto us,' whereupon 'we love Him because He first loved us;' and from Him this love flows down upon our fellow-men."

These quotes highlight the importance of love in actions, the biblical commandment to love God and neighbor, and the source of this love being from God Himself.

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "To be burned (ινα καυθησωμα). First future passive subjunctive (Textus Receptus), but D καυθησομα (future passive indicative of καιω, old word to burn). There were even some who courted martyrdom in later years (time of Diocletian). This Byzantine future subjunctive does not occur in the old MSS."
2. "Aleph A B here read καυχησωμα, first aorist middle subjunctive of καυχαομα (so Westcott and Hort), 'that I may glory.' This is correct."
3. "It profiteth me nothing (ουδεν ωφελουμα). Literally, I am helped nothing. Ουδεν in the accusative case retained with passive verb. See two accusatives with ωφελεω in 1 Corinthians 14:6. Verb is old and from οφελος (profit)."

### John Gill:
1. "But of what avail was all this, when what these men did, they did not from a principle of love to God, nor to Christ, nor even to the poor, to whom they gave their substance; but to have honour and applause from men, and have and obtain eternal life hereafter?"
2. "The apostle here respects martyrdom, and by a prophetic spirit has respect to future times, when burning men's bodies for religion would be in use, which then was not; and suggests that there might be some, as according to ecclesiastical history there seems to have been some, who, from a forward and misguided zeal, and to get themselves a name, and leave one behind them, have exposed themselves to the flames, and yet 'have not' had 'charity', true love to God, a real affection for Christ, or to his saints."
3. "Such things may profit others, but not a man's self; giving all his goods to the poor may be of advantage to them, and giving his body to be burned in the cause of religion may be of service to others, to confirm their faith, and encourage them to like sufferings when called to them; but can be of no avail to themselves in the business of salvation."

### John Wesley:
1. "And though I — Deliberately, piece by piece. Give all my goods to feed the poor, yea, though I deliver up my body to be burned - Rather than I would renounce my religion." 
2. "And have not the love — Hereafter described." 
3. "It profiteth me nothing — Without this, whatever I speak, whatever I have, whatever I know, whatever I do, whatever I suffer, is nothing."
