# 1 Corinthians 13:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Love is a virtue that encompasses many qualities and attitudes. It is patient and kind, withholding anger and extending kindness towards others. It does not boast or seek attention for its own accomplishments. Love is not envious or jealous, rejoicing in the happiness and well-being of others. It is not arrogant or self-important, but humble and accommodating. Love does not act rashly or violently, but exercises moderation and restraint. Ultimately, love seeks to promote peace, harmony, and unity in all relationships.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "μακροθυμεῖ is the negative side, χρηστεύεται the positive, of a loving temper: the former, the withholding of anger; the latter, the exercise of kindness."
2. "οὐ ζηλοῖ, 'knows neither envy nor jealousy:' both are included under the more general sense of ζῆλος."
3. "περπερεύεται... displays not itself."


### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "suffereth long—under provocations of evil from others. The negative side of love."
2. "is kind—the positive side. Extending good to others."
3. "vaunteth not—in words, even of gifts which it really possesses; an indirect rebuke of those at Corinth who used the gift of tongues for mere display."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The 'reason' why he made use of this illustration, rather than its nature as evinced toward 'God,' was, probably, because it was especially necessary for them to understand in what way it should be manifested toward each other."
2. "Love is benignant. It wishes well. It is not harsh, sour, morose, ill-natured. Tyndale renders it, 'is courteous.' The idea is, that under all provocations and ill-usage it is gentle and mild."
3. "Love does not envy others the happiness which they enjoy; it delights in their welfare; and as their happiness is increased by their endowments, those who are influenced by love 'rejoice' in all this."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The high charity which makes us servants Prompt to the counsel which controls the world." - Dante, "Paradiso," 21, 70, 71.
2. "Vaunteth. From perperov a braggart. Used of one who sounds his own praises."
3. "Puffed up. Of inward disposition, as the previous word denotes outward display."

### John Calvin:
1. "The first commendation of love is this — that, by patient endurance of many things, it promotes peace and harmony in the Church."
2. "A third excellence is — that it counteracts emulation, the seed of all contentions."
3. "Paul, therefore, ascribes to love moderation, and declares that it is a bridle to restrain men, that they may not break forth into ferocity, but may live together in a peaceable and orderly manner."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Love suffereth long. This long-suffering is the protracted endurance of wrong, such as is fitted to provoke resentment. It is that command over natural impulse which keeps just displeasure from breaking forth into action."
2. "Love is kind. The word means to ‘shew oneself benignant, gentle, good, meek.’ Though used only here as a verb, it occurs frequently as an adjective, and precisely as it occurs here, in conjunction with long-suffering, the one being the negative, the other the positive side of the same quality."
3. "Love envieth not. The word signifies both 'envy' and 'jealousy,' qualities which though distinct are inseparable, so that only the context can shew which in any given case is intended. Here 'envy' is plainly meant that miserable feeling of chagrin at the good of another, not possessed by ourselves, which corrodes the heart."

2. "He is easy and yielding to the tempers and humours of men; accommodates himself to their infirmities, capacities, manners, and circumstances."
3. "Charity...does not envy the temporal happiness of others, though it is what he has not, or is greater than he enjoys."

### John Wesley:
1. "The love of God, and of our neighbour for God's sake, is patient toward all men."
2. "Love acteth not rashly — Does not hastily condemn any one; never passes a severe sentence on a slight or sudden view of things."
3. "Nor does it ever act or behave in a violent, headstrong, or precipitate manner."
