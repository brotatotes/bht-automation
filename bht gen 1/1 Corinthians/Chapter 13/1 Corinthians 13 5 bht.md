# 1 Corinthians 13:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Love is a beautiful virtue that guides our actions and relationships. It is not boastful or rude, but rather seeks to uphold what is proper and appropriate in all circumstances. Love is unselfish, not concerned with personal gain or advantage. It is a restraining force, preventing quarrels and disputes, and instead chooses to put the best possible interpretation on the actions of others. Love does not think evil of others, but rather chooses to see the good in them.
