# 1 Corinthians 13:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Love is a powerful force described by various commentators in their insights on a Bible verse. It bears all things and endures personal hardships without speaking of them. Love is patient, not easily angered, and refrains from revenge. It rejoices in the happiness of others and believes the best about them, even against hope. Love covers faults and imperfections, protecting and concealing them. It hopes for the fulfillment of promises and perseveres through all trials. Ultimately, love, as described in the verse, is a selfless and enduring commitment that strengthens believers in their relationships with others.
