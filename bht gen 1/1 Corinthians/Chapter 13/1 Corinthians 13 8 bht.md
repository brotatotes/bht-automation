# 1 Corinthians 13:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Love is an enduring and unchanging virtue that will never cease to exist. It surpasses temporary gifts and will continue to be present in eternity. Prophecies and tongues, as well as our current knowledge, will fade away as they are no longer necessary in the perfection of heaven. However, love will persist, even beyond the last day, being eternal in its essence.

3. "A primary fulfilment of Paul's statement took place when the Church attained its maturity; then 'tongues' entirely 'ceased,' and 'prophesyings' and 'knowledge,' so far as they were supernatural gifts of the Spirit, were superseded as no longer required."

### Albert Barnes:

3. "The power of speaking foreign languages...shall cease" - In heaven, the mode of communication will be different, and the diversity of tongues, a result of sin, will no longer be a disadvantage.
4. "All the knowledge which we now possess...will be lost" - Our current knowledge will be obscured and rendered comparatively valueless in the fuller splendors of the eternal world.
5. "Love shall live there" - Love will continue to be necessary and will live forever, even as other things fade away in the light of heaven.

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Faileth [εκπιπει] . Falls off [εκ] like a leaf or flower, as James 1:11; 1 Peter 1:24."
2. "In classical Greek it was used of an actor who was hissed off the stage."
3. "But the correct reading is piptei falls, in a little more general sense, as Luke 16:17."

### John Calvin:
1. "Love never faileth...Hence love must be preferred before temporary and perishable gifts."
2. "While [temporary gifts] fail, [love] survives."
3. "The perpetuity of love...will be after the last day, and has nothing to do with the time that is intermediate."

These quotes highlight the enduring nature of love and its superiority over temporary gifts. They also address the misconception that the souls of the deceased pray for us, emphasizing that love's perpetuity does not necessarily mean constant exercise.

1. "Charity never faileth...it may be left, but not lost; the fervour of it may be remitted and abated; it may wax cold through the prevalence of sin...but this grace never fails as to its principle." 

2. "Love will be the same, only act in a higher sphere, and to a greater degree, and in a perfect manner."

3. "Whether there be prophecies, they shall fail...or else the gifts of explaining the prophecies of the Old Testament, and of preaching the doctrines of the Gospel, will be no more, because there will be no need of them in a state of perfection."

### John Wesley:
1. "Love never faileth — It accompanies to, and adorns us in, eternity; it prepares us for, and constitutes, heaven."
2. "Whether there be prophecies, they shall fail — When all things are fulfilled, and God is all in all."
3. "Whether there be tongues, they shall cease — One language shall prevail among all the inhabitants of heaven, and the low and imperfect languages of earth be forgotten. The knowledge likewise which we now so eagerly pursue, shall then vanish away - As starlight is lost in that of the midday sun, so our present knowledge in the light of eternity."
