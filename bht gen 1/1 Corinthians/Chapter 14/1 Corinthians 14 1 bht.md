# 1 Corinthians 14:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the commentators emphasize the importance of love as the highest pursuit. Love should be actively pursued with zeal and determination. While desiring spiritual gifts is also encouraged, the focus is on their role in serving and expressing love. Prophesying, not as predicting the future, but as preaching and applying the word of God, is highlighted as a particularly valuable spiritual gift.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Follow after love, yet desire earnestly spiritual gifts" - This verse reminds us that while love should be our ultimate pursuit, we should also eagerly desire spiritual gifts. Love should not diminish our desire for spiritual gifts, but rather, it should guide and shape our pursuit of them.

2. "If I exalt love above all mere gifts, this is not meant to disparage the gifts" - The emphasis on love does not diminish the value of spiritual gifts. Love and spiritual gifts are not in opposition to each other; rather, love should be the foundation and motivation for the exercise of these gifts.

3. "Only in doing so, forget not that the best and most useful of them all is prophecy" - While all spiritual gifts are valuable, prophecy is highlighted as the most useful gift. This reminds us to prioritize the gift of prophecy, which involves speaking forth God's truth and guidance, for the edification and encouragement of the church.
