# 1 Corinthians 14:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The church in Corinth is encouraged to eagerly pursue the spiritual gifts that are edifying and beneficial to the community. While some Corinthians were overly zealous and competitive in their pursuit, the focus should be on using these gifts for the purpose of building up the church, not for personal gain or attention. This requires seeking excellence in these gifts, desiring to excel in conveying truth in a clear and intelligible manner. Ultimately, the goal is to contribute to the growth and unity of the church, rather than promoting division or self-promotion.
