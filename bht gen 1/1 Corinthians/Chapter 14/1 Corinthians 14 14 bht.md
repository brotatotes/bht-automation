# 1 Corinthians 14:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Praying in an unknown tongue is a deeply personal and spiritual act of communication with God, encompassing the individual's spirit and guided by the Holy Spirit. While the speaker may understand the meaning, the understanding may not extend to others, limiting its edification for the community. The practice highlights the intimate connection between the individual and God, emphasizing personal devotion and spiritual empowerment rather than communal understanding or edification.
