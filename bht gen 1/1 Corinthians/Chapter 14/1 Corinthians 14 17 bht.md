# 1 Corinthians 14:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, the Apostle Paul addresses the act of giving thanks in a language that others cannot understand. Paul does not condemn the act of thanksgiving itself, recognizing that it is an expression of gratitude inspired by the Spirit. However, he cautions against doing so without considering the edification of others. The verse emphasizes the importance of using appropriate and pertinent words when giving thanks, as well as the need for communal growth and benefit. Ultimately, true thanksgiving goes beyond personal satisfaction to positively impact the spiritual development of the community.
