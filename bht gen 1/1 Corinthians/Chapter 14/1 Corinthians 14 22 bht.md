# 1 Corinthians 14:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Drawing from a variety of commentators, the Bible verse described in these quotes highlights the purpose and significance of speaking in tongues and prophesying. The verse emphasizes that speaking in tongues is intended as a sign or evidence for unbelievers, necessitating their attention and confirming the divine origin of the message. On the other hand, prophesying is primarily designed to strengthen the faith and confirmation of those who believe. The use of tongues serves as a captivating tool to engage the interest of non-believers, compelling them to explore the message further.

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "For a sign": This phrase indicates that the event mentioned in the verse is meant to serve as a sign or symbol. It implies that there is a deeper meaning or significance behind the event, beyond its literal interpretation.

2. "Like the Hebrew and occasional Koine idiom also": This comment suggests that the use of "for a sign" is not unique to this verse but is a common idiom in both Hebrew and Koine Greek.

3. "The event mentioned in the verse is meant to serve as a sign or symbol": This statement emphasizes that the purpose of the event is not merely to convey information but to convey a deeper meaning or message.

### John Gill:
1. "Tongues are for a sign of wrath and punishment inflicted on a rebellious and unbelieving people, and not of grace and kindness."
2. "Speaking with divers tongues was used in a miraculous way, not to them that believe, but to them that believe not."
3. "Prophesying serveth not for them that believe not; it is profitable to, and serves for them which believe: it is for their edification, exhortation, and comfort."

These quotes emphasize that speaking in tongues is a sign of judgment for unbelievers, while prophesying is for the edification and comfort of believers. Tongues are not necessary among believers, but rather should be used among unbelievers to capture their attention and confirm their faith. Prophesying, on the other hand, is beneficial for believers in building their faith and providing guidance.
