## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The supposition is this: that all the (Corinthian) church is assembled, and all its members speak with tongues...then ἰδιῶται, ‘plain believers,’ persons unacquainted with the gift and its exercise, come in."
2. "The ἰδ. plainly cannot be, as De W. maintains, an unbeliever, for his case is separately mentioned. Such plain men, or perhaps a company of unbelievers, have come in: they have no understanding of what is going on: the γλῶσσαι sound to them an unmeaning jargon."
3. "They come to the conclusion, ‘These men are mad;’ just as men did infer, on the day of Pentecost, that the speakers were drunken."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The more there are assembled, and the more that speak in unknown tongues, the more will the impression be conveyed to strangers 'coming in' from curiosity ('unbelievers'), or even from a better motive ('unlearned'), that the whole body of worshippers is a mob of fanatical 'madmen'." 
2. "The Church is like the company of builders of Babel after the confusion of tongues, or like the cause tried between two deaf men before a deaf judge, celebrated in the Greek epigram."
3. "Unlearned - having some degree of faith, but not gifts."

2. "Those that are unacquainted with foreign languages, and to whom, therefore, what was said would be unintelligible."
3. "They will not understand what is said; it will be a confused jargon; and they will infer that it is the effect of insanity."

2. "At the same time he adds, that it is owing to their wickedness, that they look upon the sign as madness."
