# 1 Corinthians 14:30 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When multiple prophets gather, if one receives a clearer revelation or deeper understanding on a matter that is being discussed, they should be given the opportunity to share it. At that moment, the one who was previously speaking should respectfully cease and allow the one with the revelation to speak, benefiting the entire community. These revelations, sometimes received suddenly and in an extraordinary manner, serve to remove difficulties in understanding and shed light on important matters. The goal is for the church to receive the full benefit of these revelations and deepen their understanding of spiritual truths.

3. "The rendering of Grot., al., 'let him (the second) wait till the first has done speaking,' q. d., 'let the first have left off,' is ungrammatical."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "If, while one is speaking, an important truth is revealed to another, or is suggested to his mind by the Holy Spirit, which he feels it to be important to communicate."
2. "Let the first hold his peace - That is, let him that was speaking conclude his discourse, and let there not be the confusion arising from two persons speaking at the same time."
3. "The man that was speaking was to close his discourse and be silent. It does not follow, however, that he was to be rudely interrupted. He might close his discourse deliberately, or perhaps by an intimation from the person to whom the revelation was made."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The image of sitting signifies a position of authority and power, indicating that the speaker is in a position of superiority over those who are standing. This highlights the speaker's sovereignty and control over the situation."

2. "The act of sitting also suggests a sense of calmness and stability. It implies that the speaker is firmly established and unwavering in their position, which adds weight and credibility to their words."

3. "By contrast, those who are standing are in a position of submission and readiness to receive instructions or guidance. This emphasizes the humility and obedience expected from those who are listening to the speaker."

4. "The contrast between sitting and standing serves to emphasize the distinction between the speaker's authority and the submissiveness of the listeners. It reminds us of the importance of recognizing and respecting the authority of God and being willing to submit to His guidance and instructions."

### John Calvin:
1. "Here is another advantage — that whenever there will be occasion, the way will also be open to them. Hence they have no longer any occasion to complain, that the Spirit is bound, or that his mouth is shut." (866)
2. "For this only is the true liberty of the Spirit — not that every one be allowed to blab out rashly whatever he pleases, but that all, from the highest to the lowest, voluntarily allow themselves to be under control, and that the one Spirit be listened to, by whatever mouth he speaks." (867)
3. "If something be revealed to some minister, who hath a seat among those that teach...then let the first be silent, let him be silent who hath a psalm, and give way to him." (Lightfoot)
