1. "On the subject of women officiating in the public assemblies, there is an apparent discrepancy between chap. 11 and chap. 14.

2. "The practice of these prophesying females at Corinth seems to have been to put off their head-dress on rising to 'pray' or 'prophesy in the spirit,' that being the usual practice of the male speakers. But in a woman that 'would be instinctively felt to be indecorous, and the impression would gradually arise that by such public appearances woman was drawn out of her natural sphere."
