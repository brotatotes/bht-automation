# 1 Corinthians 14:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This verse emphasizes the significance of effective communication in order to edify and benefit others. It explores different means of achieving this goal, including revelation, knowledge, prophecy, and teaching. By unveiling hidden truths, shedding light on symbols and prophecies, offering glimpses into the future, and providing guidance on doctrine and righteous living, the speaker aims to bring understanding, clarity, and spiritual growth to the listeners. Without proper interpretation and communication, the speaker's presence and message would be of little use to the audience.
