## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:

2. "The renderings, ‘even things without life’ (E. V.), or ‘things which, though without life, yet give sound’ (Winer, edn. 6, § 61. 5. f.), are inadmissible."
3. "If they (the ἄψυχα φ . δ .) shall not have yielded a distinction (of musical intervals) in their tones, how shall be known that which is being played on the flute or that which is being played on the harp?"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "And things without life-giving sound, whether pipe or harp, YET (notwithstanding their giving sound) if they give not a distinction in the tones (that is, notes) how?" - This quote highlights the importance of distinction in the tones or notes produced by musical instruments, emphasizing the need for clarity and precision in communication.

2. "What is piped or harped—that is, what tune is played on the pipe or harp." - This quote clarifies that the phrase "what is piped or harped" refers to the specific tune or melody being played on the musical instruments. It emphasizes the significance of conveying a clear message through the choice of music.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Unless they give a difference in the sounds - Unless they give a difference in the 'tones,' such as are indicated in the gamut for music."
2. "How shall it be known... - That is, there would be no time, no music. Nothing would be indicated by it. It would not be suited to excite the emotions of sorrow or of joy."
3. "All music is designed to excite emotions; but if there be no difference in the tones, no emotion would be produced. So it would be in words uttered. Unless there was something that was suited to excite thought or emotion; unless what was spoken was made 'intelligible,' no matter how important in itself it might be, yet it would be useless."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Voice [φωνην] . See on sound, Romans 10:18. The sound generally."
2. "Used sometimes of sounds emitted by things without life, as a trumpet or the wind. See Matthew 24:31; John 3:8."
3. "Distinction [διαστολην] . Proper modulation. Compare the use of the word in Romans 3:22; Romans 10:12."

### John Calvin:
1. "A man cannot give life to a harp or flute, but he makes it give forth a sound that is regulated in such a manner, that it can be distinguished."
2. "How absurd then it is, that even men, endowed with intelligence, should utter a confused, indistinguishable sound!"
3. "To speak into the air is to beat the air to no purpose. 'Thy voice will not reach either God or man, but will vanish into air.'"
