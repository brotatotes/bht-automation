## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The giving the signal for battle with the trumpet is called by Dio Cassius τὸ πολεμικὰν βοᾷν." 
2. "A particular succession of notes of the trumpet then, as now, gave the signals for attack, and retreat, and the various evolutions of an army." 
3. "The meaning of ἄδηλον is uncertain, as it refers to the specific signals given by the trumpet during battle."

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "For if also" is an additional step in the argument.
2. "Uncertain sound" refers to a sound that has no definite meaning.
3. The trumpet should be so marked that each succession of notes has a specific purpose, such as summoning soldiers to attack or retreat.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The trumpet was used commonly in war...It therefore employed a 'language' which was intelligible to an army."
2. "An uncertain sound was one in which none of these things were indicated, or in which it could not be determined what was required."
3. "Foreign tongues spoken in their assembly would be just as useless in regard to their duty, their comfort, and edification, as would be the sound of a trumpet when it gave one of the usual and intelligible sounds by which it was known what the soldiers were required to do."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The trumpet, properly, a war-trumpet." This quote highlights the significance of the trumpet in a military context, emphasizing its association with war and battle.

2. "Preserving the distinction between the mere sound of the trumpet and the modulated notes." This quote emphasizes the importance of recognizing the difference between the simple sound of the trumpet and the intentional and purposeful notes played on it.

3. "The case might be illustrated by the bugle calls or points by which military commands are issued." This quote draws a parallel between the trumpet in biblical times and the bugle calls used in modern military commands, suggesting that the trumpet served as a means of communication and direction in warfare.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Since in all ages the advance and retreat of armies have been directed by sound of trumpet, it is indispensable that the notes expressing each should be sufficiently distinct, the one from the other, and easily understood." 

2. "The word signifies ‘war’ in general, but is also used for ‘battle’ in particular, as seems plainly the sense here." 

3. "The trumpet is meant to be a clear and certain sound, signaling the troops to prepare for battle. If the sound is uncertain or muddled, it will create confusion and hinder proper preparation."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "An uncertain voice" - This phrase suggests that the voice being referred to is not clear or distinct, possibly indicating a lack of confidence or clarity in the message being conveyed.

2. "Military trumpet is louder than pipe or harp" - This comparison highlights the importance of a clear and powerful voice in conveying a message effectively. Just as a military trumpet is louder and more attention-grabbing than a pipe or harp, a strong and confident voice is more likely to capture the listener's attention.

3. "Shall prepare himself" - This phrase implies that the one speaking needs to make an effort to prepare and equip themselves before delivering their message. It emphasizes the importance of proper preparation and readiness in effectively communicating the intended message.

### John Gill:
1. "The sound of the trumpet was the alarm of war." 
2. "The Gospel...gathers souls to Christ, directs saints in their journeying, and prepares and animates them for battle with their spiritual enemies."
3. "When the Gospel gives a certain and even sound, it magnifies the grace of God, exalts the person of Christ, debases the creature, and expresses the nature, use, and necessity of efficacious grace."

These quotes emphasize the importance of a clear and certain message in the Gospel, which gathers and prepares believers for spiritual battle.

### John Wesley:
1. "Understanding the sound of the trumpet is crucial for preparing oneself for battle. Without this understanding, one may mistake a retreat for a march or vice versa, leading to confusion and potential defeat."

2. "The trumpet serves as a signal, a call to action, and a means of communication on the battlefield. It is through this instrument that orders are given, strategies are coordinated, and unity is maintained among the troops."

3. "Just as soldiers must be trained to recognize and interpret the different sounds of the trumpet, believers must also be equipped with knowledge and understanding of God's Word to navigate the spiritual battles they face."
