## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "With the humiliating conviction of his own unworthiness is united the consciousness of that higher Power which worked on and in him, and this introduces his chastened self-consciousness of the extent and success of his apostolic labours." 
2. "The position of χάριτι δὲ θεοῦ, and the repetition of ἡ χάρις αὐτοῦ afterwards, shew the emphatic prominence which he assigns to the divine Grace."
3. "The Grace of God worked with him in so overwhelming a measure, compared to his own working, that it was no longer the work of himself but of divine Grace."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

2. "Though 'not meet to be called an apostle,' grace has given him, in Christ, the meetness needed for the office."
3. "The 'not I, but grace,' implies, that though the human will concurred with God when brought by His Spirit into conformity with His will, yet 'grace' so preponderated in the work, that his own co-operation is regarded as nothing, and grace as virtually the sole agent."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "By the 'favor' or mercy of God. What I have is to be traced to him, and not to any native tendency to goodness, or any native inclination to his service, or to any merit of my own."
2. "Nothing is more common in the writings of Paul, than a disposition to trace all that he had to the mere mercy and grace of God. And nothing is a more certain indication of true piety than such a disposition."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The phrase 'was not found' emphasizes the absence or lack of something, suggesting that despite expectations or assumptions, it did not come to pass or materialize as anticipated."

### John Calvin:
1. "I maintain, however, that these words of Paul give no support to their error, for he does not here claim anything as his own, as if he had himself, independently of God, done anything praiseworthy."
2. "I maintain, nevertheless, that there is no reason on that account, why we should divide between him and God the praise, that ought to be ascribed wholly to God, inasmuch as he confers upon us not merely the power of doing well, but also the inclination and the accomplishment."
3. "A remarkable passage certainly, both for laying low the pride of man, and for magnifying the operation of Divine grace in us. For Paul, as though he had improperly made himself the author of anything good, corrects what he had said, and declares the grace of God to have been the efficient cause of the whole."
