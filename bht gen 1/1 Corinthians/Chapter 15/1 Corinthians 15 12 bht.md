2. "How is it that some of you deny that which is a necessary consequence of Christ's resurrection, namely, the general resurrection?"
3. "Gentile reasoners who would not believe it because they did not see 'how' it could be."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "If this was the doctrine on which the church was based, that the Lord Jesus rose from the dead, how could the resurrection of the dead be denied?"
2. "The argument here is twofold: (1) That Christ rose was one 'instance' of a fact which demonstrated that there 'had been' a resurrection, and of course that it was possible. (2) That such was the connection between Christ and his people that the admission of this fact involved also the doctrine that all his people would also rise."
3. "The doctrine of the resurrection, therefore, does not rest on a metaphysical subtilty; it does not depend on human reasoning; it does not depend on analogy; it rests just as the sciences of astronomy, chemistry, anatomy, botany, and natural philosophy do, 'on well ascertained facts.'"

### Marvin Vincent:

### John Calvin:
1. "Christ did not die, or rise again for himself, but for us: hence his resurrection is the foundation of ours, and what was accomplished in him, must be fulfilled in us also."
2. "Otherwise he would have risen again needlessly and to no purpose, because the fruit of it is to be sought, not in his own person, but in his members."
3. "The resurrection is not from nature, and comes from no other quarter than from Christ alone. For in Adam we die, and we recover life only in Christ; hence it follows that his resurrection is the foundation of ours, so that if that is taken away, it cannot stand."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The resurrection of Christ is the foundation of the Christian faith, and if there is no resurrection, then our faith is in vain."

It requires a willingness to let go of our own wisdom and understanding, and to trust in something greater than ourselves. It challenges us to examine our own hearts and minds, and to be open to the possibility of a truth that surpasses human reasoning."
