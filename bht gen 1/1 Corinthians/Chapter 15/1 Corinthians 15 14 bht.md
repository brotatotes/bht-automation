# 1 Corinthians 15:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
If Christ has not been raised, then our preaching and faith are in vain. The concept of "vain" carries the idea of emptiness, futility, and lack of substance. Without the resurrection of Christ as the central pillar, all preaching and beliefs would lack meaning and value. The resurrection of Christ is not a mere theological doctrine but a historical fact that serves as the ultimate proof of God's power over death and grants believers the assurance of eternal life. It is the foundation upon which the entire gospel rests, giving purpose and fruitfulness to our faith.
