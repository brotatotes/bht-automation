# 1 Corinthians 15:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Bible verse being described here emphasizes the vital significance of Christ's resurrection for believers. Without His resurrection, faith is empty and ineffective, leaving humanity still burdened by sin. Mere reforming of behavior is inadequate, and true salvation requires a deeper solution. Christ's resurrection is the ultimate proof of the sufficiency of His atonement, demonstrating God's acceptance and providing assurance for believers.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The frustration of all on which faith relies as accomplished, e.g. the removal of the guilt and power of sin."
2. "Christ's Resurrection accomplished our justification."
3. "Through justification, our future bliss, even in the disembodied state."

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Ye are, by the very fact (supposing the case to be as the skeptics maintained), frustrated of all which 'your faith' appropriates." 
2. "Ye are still under the everlasting condemnation of your sins (even in the disembodied state which is here referred to), from which Christ's resurrection is our justification." 
3. "Saved by his life."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Their faith was vain, 'because,' if Christ was not raised up, they were yet unpardoned sinners."
2. "The pardon of sin was connected with the belief of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus, and, if he was not raised, they were still in a state of sin."
3. "You have evidence that you are not under the dominion of sin. You have repented of it; have forsaken it; and are leading a holy life. You know that, and cannot be induced to doubt this fact. But all that is to be traced to the doctrine that the Lord Jesus rose from the dead."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Vain [ματαια] . A different word, signifying fruitless."
2. "The difference is between reality and result."

These quotes highlight the distinction between the Greek word for "vain" (ματαια) and its meaning of being fruitless or empty. The commentary emphasizes that the word choice emphasizes the lack of substance or value in something. Additionally, it suggests that the difference lies in the contrast between the actuality of a situation and its outcome or consequence.

### John Calvin:
1. "Christ by his death atoned for our sins, that they might no more be imputed to us in the judgment of God." 

2. "He has crucified our old man, that its lusts might no longer reign in us." 

3. "If the resurrection is overthrown, the dominion of sin is set up anew."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Vain (ματαια). Old word from adverb ματην (Matthew 15:9), devoid of truth, a lie."
2. "Stronger word than κενον in verse 1 Corinthians 15:14."
3. "Ye are yet in your sins (ετ εστε εν ταις αμαρτιαις υμων). Because the death of Christ has no atoning value if he did not rise from the dead."

### John Gill:
1. "If Christ be not raised, your faith is vain... and yet is vain, than which nothing can be more absurd."
2. "If Christ is not risen, there never was, is, or will be any such thing as regeneration and sanctification."
3. "If Christ is not risen, his people are under the guilt of their sins; there is no expiation nor remission of them, nor justification from them."

These quotes emphasize the crucial role of Christ's resurrection in the Christian faith. Without the resurrection, faith is meaningless, regeneration and sanctification are impossible, and there is no forgiveness or justification for sins. The commentary highlights the profound implications of Christ's resurrection for believers.

### John Wesley:
1. "Ye are still in your sins" - This phrase emphasizes that without atonement, humanity remains under the guilt and consequences of sin.
2. "There needed something more than reformation" - The commentary highlights that mere reformation or change in behavior is insufficient for salvation. A deeper solution is required.
3. "The sufficiency of which God attested by raising our great Surety from the grave" - The resurrection of Jesus serves as evidence of the sufficiency of His atonement, demonstrating God's approval and acceptance of His sacrifice.
