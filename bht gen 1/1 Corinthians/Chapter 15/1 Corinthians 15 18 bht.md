## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Those who fell asleep in Christ, perished (i.e. passed into misery in Hades). He uses the aorists, speaking of the act of death, not of the continuing state: the act of falling asleep in Christ was to them ἀπώλεια." 
2. "ἐν χρ ., in communion with, membership of Christ."
3. "ἐπὶ μὲν οὖν τοῦ χριστοῦ  θάνατον καλεῖ , ἵνα τὸ πάθος πιστώσηται · ἐπὶ δὲ ἡμῶν  κοίμησιν , ἵνα τὴν ὀδύνην παραμυθήσηται . ἔνθα μὲν γὰρ παρεχώρησεν ἡ ἀνάστασις , θαῤῥῶν καλεῖ θάνατον . ἔνθα δὲ ἐν ἐλπίσιν ἔτι μένει , κοίμησιν καλεῖ ."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "In Christ's case the term used is death, to assure us of the reality of His suffering; in our case, sleep, to give us consolation."
2. "In His case, His resurrection having actually taken place, Paul shrinks not from the term death; in ours, the resurrection being still only a matter of hope, he uses the term falling asleep."
3. "Their souls are lost; they are in misery in the unseen world."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Can you believe it possible that the good people who have believed in the Lord Jesus are destroyed? Can you believe that your best friends, your kindred, and your fellow Christians who have died, have gone down to perdition? Can you believe that they will sink to woe with the impenitent, and the polluted, and abandoned? If you cannot, then it must follow that they are saved."
2. "There are multitudes who are made good men by the gospel. They are holy, humble, self-denying, and prayerful friends of God. 'They have become such by the belief of the death and resurrection of the Lord Jesus.' Can it be believed that they will be destroyed? That they will perish with the profane, and licentious, and unprincipled?"
3. "He, therefore, who becomes an infidel 'believes' that his pious friends - his sainted father, his holy mother, his lovely Christian sister or child, is deluded and deceived; that they will sink down to the grave to rise no more; that their hopes of heaven will all vanish, and that they will be destroyed with the profane, the impure, and the sensual."

### John Calvin:
1. "If the resurrection of Christ is taken away, faith is useless, and Christianity is a mere deception."
2. "The whole of their felicity and consolation depends exclusively on the resurrection."
3. "As to the hope of the dead, all is over, unless that day shall sooner or later arrive."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Inevitable inference." 
2. "Did perish." 
3. "Delivered up to eternal misery."

### John Gill:
1. "Death is often represented by a sleep, and that more than once in this chapter; and doubtless with a view to the resurrection, which will be an awaking out of it, since it will not be perpetual."
2. "If Christ is not risen, that they are perished: soul and body; for if there is no reason to believe the resurrection of the dead, there is no reason to believe the immortality of the soul, or a future state."
3. "Should it be insisted on that the soul survives, and shall live without the body to all eternity, it must be in a state of misery, if Christ is not risen, because it must be in its sins; and neither sanctified nor justified, and consequently cannot be glorified."

### John Wesley:
1. "They who sleep in Christ" refers to those who have died for Him or have a strong belief in Him.
2. These individuals have "perished," meaning they have lost their life and existence in this world.
3. The phrase implies a sense of sacrifice and surrender to Christ, as well as the idea of finding eternal life and purpose in Him.
