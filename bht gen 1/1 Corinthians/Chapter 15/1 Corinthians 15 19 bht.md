# 1 Corinthians 15:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
If our hope in Christ is confined to this present life and we do not anticipate anything beyond the grave, then we would truly be the most pitiable of people. However, if our hope extends to the unseen and eternal, if we taste the powers of the world to come and experience the joy of immortality, then despite our present struggles, we are abundantly blessed beyond comparison.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Assuming this ἀπώλεια of the dead in Christ, the state of Christians is indeed miserable."
2. "The right arrangement of the Greek gives the key to the sentence: εἰ ( ἐν τῇ ζωῇ ταύτῃ ἐν χριστῷ ἠλπικότες ἐσμὲν ) μόνον, 'if all we have done is merely having hoped in Christ in this life.'"
3. "We are most to be pitied (most miserable) of all men; viz. because they, all other men, live at ease, we on the contrary are ever exposed to danger and death."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "If our hopes in Christ were limited to this life only, we should be, of all men, most to be pitied."
2. "For all our hope of salvation, even of the soul (not merely of the body), hangs on the resurrection of Christ, without which His death would be of no avail to us."
3. "The heathen are 'without hope.' We should be even worse, for we should be also without present enjoyment."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "If there was no resurrection, they, of all people would be most to be pitied, since they had exposed themselves to such a variety of dangers and trials, in which nothing could sustain them but the hope of immortality." 
2. "No other people had so elevated hopes, and, of course, no others could experience so great disappointment."
3. "They do not indulge in the pleasures of this life; they do not give themselves, as others do, to the enjoyments of this world. They voluntarily subject themselves to trial and self-denial; and if they are not admitted to eternal life, they are not only disappointed in this but they are cut off from the sources of happiness which their fellow-men enjoy in this world."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "To be taken with the whole clause, at the end of which it stands emphatically."
2. "If in this life we are hopers in Christ, and if that is all."
3. "If we are not such as shall have hope in Christ after we shall have fallen asleep."

### John Calvin:
1. "To believe in this life means here to limit the fruit of our faith to this life, so that our faith looks no farther, and does not extend beyond the confines of the present life."
2. "Paul did not dream of Elysian fields, and foolish fables of that sort, but takes it for granted, that the entire hope of Christians looks forward to the final day of judgment."
3. "Believers, even though they should abound in riches and in blessings of every kind, they nevertheless do not go to excess, and do not gormandize at their ease; in fine, they do not enjoy the world, as unbelievers do, but go forward with anxiety, constantly groaning, partly from a consciousness of their weakness, and partly from an eager longing for the future life."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "If in this life only we have hoped in Christ, we are of all men most pitiable." This verse highlights the importance of having hope in Christ beyond this earthly life. It reminds us that our faith is not limited to the present, but extends to the promise of a future resurrection.

2. "Building our hope of a future resurrection on a mere delusion." This phrase emphasizes the need for a solid foundation of belief in Christ's resurrection. It warns against basing our hope on anything that is false or unreliable.

3. "To die at length as a fool dieth." This phrase serves as a sobering reminder of the consequences of not having faith in Christ. It suggests that without the hope of resurrection, our lives would ultimately be meaningless and futile.

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Hope limited to this life even if 'in Christ.'"
2. "If our hope is limited to this life, we have denied ourselves what people call pleasures and have no happiness beyond."
3. "Paul makes morality turn on the hope of immortality."

### John Gill:
1. "The object of a believer's hope is not any creature, man, or angel; nor any creature enjoyment, as gold and silver; nor any creature righteousness, moral, legal, and civil; nor any external privilege, or profession of religion; but Christ alone as a surety, Saviour, and Redeemer."
2. "If our hope in him is bounded with this life, and confined to the things of it, and does not reach to the things of another life, the things of eternity, the invisible glories of another world, to be enjoyed in soul and body; we are of all men the most miserable."
3. "For these not only deny themselves the pleasures, honours, and profits of this world, but are exposed continually to the hatred, reproach, and persecution of it; they are chastised by God as other men are, that they may not be condemned with the world, and yet they must be condemned, if Christ is not risen."

### John Wesley:
1. "If in this life only we have hope — If we look for nothing beyond the grave."
2. "But if we have a divine evidence of things not seen, if we have 'a hope full of immortality,' if we now taste of 'the powers of the world to come,' and see 'the crown that fadeth not away,'"
3. "then, notwithstanding all our present trials, we are more happy than all men."
