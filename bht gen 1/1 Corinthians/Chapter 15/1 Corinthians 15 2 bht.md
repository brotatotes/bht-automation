# 1 Corinthians 15:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the commentators stress the importance of holding fast to the Gospel preached, as salvation relies on it. They caution against a superficial or fleeting understanding of the message, urging readers to persevere in the true faith. The resurrection of Christ is highlighted as a crucial belief, a pledge of the saints' future resurrection. True faith is deemed indispensable, for it is the work of God's grace and leads to everlasting salvation, while a vain or delusional faith proves empty.

4. "Your faith is vain, in resting on Christ's resurrection as an objective reality."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The apostle thus shows the 'importance' of the doctrine. In every respect it demanded their attention."
2. "It does not mean simply that by this they were brought into a salvable state, but it means that their hopes of eternal life rested on this."
3. "You will be saved by it, if you adhere to it, unless it shall turn out that it was vain to believe, and that the doctrine was false."

1. "The salvation of the readers depends on their holding fast the word preached."
2. "Their holding it fast was the condition on which [Paul] preached it."
3. "The importance of holding fast to the word preached is emphasized as a condition for salvation."

### John Calvin:
1. "Such a sudden fall was an evidence that they had never understood what had been delivered to them, or that their knowledge of it had been loose and floating, inasmuch as it had so quickly vanished."
2. "He warns them that they had needlessly and uselessly professed allegiance to Christ, if they did not hold fast this main doctrine."
3. "To believe in vain, according to the use of ancient languages, is to believe without just reason and authority, giving credit to idle reports as true and authentic."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "τιν λογο ευηγγελισαμην υμιν" - Almost certainly τις (τιν λογο, locative or instrumental, in or with) here is used like the relative ος as is common in papyri.
2. "ε κατεχετε" - Paul assumes that they are holding it fast.
