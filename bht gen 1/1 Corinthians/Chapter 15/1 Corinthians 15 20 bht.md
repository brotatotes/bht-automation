## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Christ, in rising from the dead, is but the firstling or earnest of the resurrection of the whole number of those that sleep."
2. "There does not appear to be any intended reference to the legal ordinance of the first-fruits, but however general the application of the analogy may be, it can hardly fail to have been suggested to the mind of a Jew."
3. "τῶν κεκοιμημένων, from the logical connexion, should mean, not the dead in Christ, but all the dead."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The first-fruits - the earnest or pledge, that the whole resurrection harvest will follow, so that our faith is not vain, nor our hope limited to this life."
2. "The time of writing this Epistle was probably about the Passover; the day after the Passover sabbath was that for offering the first-fruits, and the same was the day of Christ's resurrection: whence appears the appropriateness of the image."
3. "Our faith is not in vain, nor is our hope limited to this life."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "I have showed the consequences which would follow from the supposition that Christ was not raised up... But all this was mere supposition. There is no reason to apprehend any such consequences, or to be thus alarmed. 'Christ' is 'risen.' Of that there is no doubt."
2. "It was not merely or mainly that Christ was the first in order of time that rose from the dead... but it was that he was chief in regard to the dignity, value, and importance of his rising... his resurrection was a demonstration that they would rise."
3. "May it not be implied that, by the resurrection of the Lord Jesus, all those of whom he speaks are regarded as sacred to God, and as consecrated and accepted by the resurrection and acceptance of him who was the first-fruits?"

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The first-fruits [απαρχη]": This term refers to the first and best portion of a harvest that is offered to God. It signifies the initial and most valuable part of something. (James 1:18)
2. "Omit become": This suggests that the phrase "become the first-fruits" should be omitted, indicating that believers are already considered as the first-fruits in Christ. (Colossians 1:18)
3. "Compare Colossians 1:18, and see on Revelation 1:5": By comparing these verses, we can gain a deeper understanding of the concept of believers being the first-fruits in Christ and the significance of this status. (Revelation 1:5)

### John Calvin:
1. "For as in the first-fruits the produce of the entire year was consecrated, so the power of Christ’s resurrection is extended to all of us." 
2. "I rather prefer, however, to understand the statement in this sense — that the rest of the dead will follow him, as the entire harvest does the first-fruits."
3. "He was the first in order of time, for although some were restored to life by the Prophets, and by himself during his personal ministry, none came out of their graves to return to them no more till after his resurrection."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "With what a bound does the apostle here spring on the firm ground and into the clear air of an indubitable resurrection in the Person of Christ."
2. "The allusion here is as obvious as it is beautiful. On the morrow after the first Sabbath of the Passover, a sheaf of the first-fruits of the barley harvest was reaped and 'waved before the Lord,' as a joyful pledge of the full harvest to come."
3. "Even so, on the morrow after the first Sabbath of that Passover when our Lord was crucified being the first day of the week did He rise 'the First-fruits of His sleeping people.'"

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "It is the logical triumph of Paul after the reductio ad impossibile (Findlay) of the preceding argument."

3. "Beautiful picture of death from which word (κοιμαομα) comes our χεμετερψ."

### John Gill:
1. "Christ, as he raised himself by his own power, so he rose again to an immortal life, and was the first that ever did so; he was the first to whom God showed, and who first trod this path of life."
2. "The firstfruits sanctified the rest of the harvest, represented the whole, gave right to the ingathering of it, and ensured it; Christ by lying in the grave, and rising out of it, sanctified it for his people, and in his resurrection represented them."
3. "The firstfruits were only such, and all this to the fruits of the earth, that were of the same kind with them, not to tares and chaff, to briers and thorns; so Christ, in rising from the dead, is only the firstfruits of the saints; of such as are the fruits of his death and of his grace."

### John Wesley:
1. "Christ's resurrection not only proved a resurrection possible, but also proved the certainty of a general resurrection, which he so expressly taught."
