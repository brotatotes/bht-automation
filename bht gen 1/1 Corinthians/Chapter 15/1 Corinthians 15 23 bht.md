# 1 Corinthians 15:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, there is a distinction in the ranks of those who will rise in the universal resurrection, with Christ taking the first place in time and priority. The order of the resurrection follows a descending series, with God, Christ, and then man. The concept of firstfruits and harvest is used as a metaphor to illustrate Christ's resurrection as the guarantee of the future resurrection for believers. The verse primarily focuses on the resurrection of those who belong to Christ, highlighting the assurance of life and the hidden nature of their true life with Him.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "But in this universal Resurrection, ALL SHALL NOT HOLD THE SAME RANK." 
2. "The three ranks are mentioned in order of priority, but this does not constitute their distinctive character." 
3. "The key to the understanding of this passage is to be found in the prophecy of our Lord, Matthew 24:25, but especially in the latter chapter."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Though all shall rise again, let not any think all shall be saved; nay, each shall have his proper place."
2. "Christ's own flock shall share His glory 'at His coming,' which is not to be confounded with 'the end,' or general judgment."
3. "The second coming of Christ is not a mere point of time, but a period beginning with the resurrection of the just at His appearing, and ending with the general judgment."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The 'order' which is here referred to is, doubtless, mainly that of 'time;' meaning that Christ would be first, and then that the others would follow. But it also means that Christ would be first, because it was 'proper' that he should be first."
2. "Christ the first-fruits - Christ first in time, and the pledge that they should rise."
3. "They that are Christ's - They who are Christians. The apostle, though in 1 Corinthians 15:22 he had stated the truth that 'all' the dead would rise, yet here only mentions Christians, because to them only would the doctrine be of any consolation."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "How the one idea ran into the other may be perceived from the analogy of the Latin manipulus, a handful of hay twisted round a pole and used by the Romans as the standard of a company of soldiers, from which the company itself was called manipulus."
2. "Here in the sense of band, or company, in pursuance of the principle of a descending series of ranks, and of consequent subordinations which is assumed by Paul. The series runs, God, Christ, man."
3. "The reference is not to time or merit, but simply to the fact that each occupies his own place in the economy of resurrection, which is one great process in several acts. Band after band rises. First Christ, then Christians. The same idea appears in the first - fruits and the harvest."

### John Calvin:
1. "If Christ’s life draws ours along with it, why does not this appear? Instead of this, while Christ has risen from the grave, we lie rotting there." - Paul's answer is that God has appointed another order of things.

2. "Let us therefore reckon it enough, that we now have in Christ the first-fruits, and that his coming will be the time of our resurrection." - We have the assurance that Christ's resurrection is the guarantee of our own future resurrection.

3. "For our life must still be hid with him, because he has not yet appeared." - Our true life is hidden with Christ and will be revealed when he returns in judgment.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The one head involves 'them that are his' in 'death;' the other, for 'them that are His' secures 'life.'" 
2. "But it is Humanity that is meant in both cases as actually lost in Adam, and as actually recovered in Christ." 
3. "Life' is a word which, when meant of the future state of believers, is never used of that of the wicked."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Each in his own division, troop, rank." 
2. "The word παρουσια was the technical word 'for the arrival or visit of the king or emperor'." 
3. "Paul is only discussing 'those that are Christ's' and so says nothing about judgment."

### John Gill:
1. "The order regarded is that of head and members, the firstfruits and the harvest."
2. "Christ the firstfruits; he rose first in order of time, dignity, causality and influence."
3. "The persons who shall rise first and next after Christ, are they that are his; who were chosen in him before the foundation of the world, and were given to him by his Father as his spouse, his children, his sheep, his portion, and his jewels."

(Note: The provided commentary is quite lengthy, so I have selected three quotes that capture the essence of the commentary and provide valuable insights into the verse.)

### John Wesley:
1. "Afterward — The whole harvest." This quote emphasizes the idea that the events described in the verse are part of a larger picture, symbolizing the final judgment and the culmination of all things.
2. "At the same time the wicked shall rise also." This quote highlights the parallel existence of both the righteous and the wicked, suggesting that they will be judged simultaneously, but with different outcomes.
3. "But they are not here taken into the account." This quote suggests that while the verse focuses on the fate of the righteous, it does not address the fate of the wicked, leaving room for further exploration and understanding of their destiny.
