# 1 Corinthians 15:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, the commentators describe the ultimate culmination of God's plan for the world through Christ's mediatorial work. At this moment, the end of the age will be realized, and the fullness of God's Kingdom will be established. Christ's reign over the world serves the purpose of glorifying the Father, as he accomplishes the salvation of the elect and ultimately delivers the Kingdom to the Father. This signifies the completion of God's redemptive work and the unity of the Godhead, with Christ reigning in a more glorious and visible manner among his people.
