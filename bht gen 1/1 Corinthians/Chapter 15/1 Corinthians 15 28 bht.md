# 1 Corinthians 15:28 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, commentators discuss the ultimate subordination of the Son to the Father and the unity of God's kingdom. They emphasize that the Son will deliver up His mediatorial kingdom to the Father, confirming His subjection. This subordination, however, does not diminish the Son's previous authority and reign. Ultimately, the goal is for God to be recognized as supreme and the ruler over all, when all things and all persons are in complete submission to Him. It is in this state that God becomes all in all, and His glory becomes evident through the destruction of wickedness.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The interpretations, that subjection is only an hyperbolical expression for the entire harmony of Christ with the Father...are idle subterfuges." 
2. "The refutation of these and all other attempts to explain away the doctrine here plainly asserted, of the ultimate subordination of the Son, is contained in the three precise and unambiguous words, αὐτὸς ὁ υἱός."
3. "ἵνα ᾖ ὁ θ. πάντα ἐν πᾶσιν] that God (alone) may be all things in all, i.e. recognized as sole Lord and King."

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "In the mediatorial kingdom, the Son had been, in a manner, distinct from the Father. Now, His kingdom shall merge in the Father's, with whom He is one."
2. "God...all in all—as Christ is all in all."
3. "Then, and not till then, 'all things,' without the least infringement of the divine prerogative, shall be subject to the Son, and the Son subordinate to the Father, while co-equally sharing His glory."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Then shall the Son also himself be subject ... - It has been proposed to render this, 'even then shall the Son,' etc.; implying that he had been all along subject to God; had acted under his authority; and that this subjection would continue even then in a sense similar to that in which it had existed; and that Christ would then continue to exercise a delegated authority over his people and kingdom."
2. "The interpretation which affirms that the Son shall then be subject to the Father in the sense of laying down his delegated authority, and ceasing to exercise his mediatorial reign, has been the common interpretation of all times."
3. "That God may be all in all - That God may be supreme; that the Divinity, the Godhead, may rule; and that it may be seen that he is the Sovereign over all the universe."

### John Calvin:
1. "For the present, as the Devil resists God, as wicked men confound and disturb the order which he has established, and as endless occasions of offense present themselves to our view, it does not distinctly appear that God is all in all."
2. "When Christ will have executed the judgment which has been committed to him by the Father, and will have cast down Satan and all the wicked, the glory of God will be conspicuous in their destruction."
3. "Both meanings sufficiently refute of themselves the wicked frenzies of some who bring forward this passage in proof of them."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "To those who find the supreme Divinity of Christ in every account of His work, and who cannot rest on a Saviour without absolutely Divine properties, the following remarks may prove helpful."
2. "The 'delivering up of the kingdom' will not, it seems, be so 'the end' of the kingdom as that the Son's connection with it shall altogether cease."
3. "The kingdom itself, then, and Christ as the principle of all its highest activities, is never to disappear if anything certain can be gathered from these disclosures."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Merely, 'when the all things are subjected unto him.' The aorist subjunctive has given translators a deal of needless trouble in this passage."
2. "It is prophecy, of course."
3. "The final goal of all God's redemptive plans as Paul has so well said in Romans 11:36."

2. "It is best, therefore to understand it of the Son's giving up the account of his mediatorial kingdom and concerns to his Father; when it will appear that he has in the whole of his conduct and administration been subject to him."
3. "God will be all things to all his saints, immediately without the use of means; he will be that to their bodies as meat and clothes are, without the use of them; and all light, glory, and happiness to their souls, without the use of ordinances, or any means."
