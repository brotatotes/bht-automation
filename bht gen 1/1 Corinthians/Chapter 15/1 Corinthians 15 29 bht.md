# 1 Corinthians 15:29 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this perplexing verse, the commentators present various interpretations. Some suggest that baptism is symbolically connected to the belief in the resurrection and the continuation of spiritual growth beyond death. Others propose that it signifies being baptized in the place of those who have died for their faith, honoring their sacrifice and carrying on their work. The concept can be likened to soldiers stepping forward to fill the gap left by fallen comrades, displaying a determination to advance in the face of adversity and continue the mission.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "What will become of 'what account can they give of their practice?'"
2. "The only legitimate reference is, to a practice, not otherwise known to us, not mentioned here with any approval by the Apostle, not generally prevalent, but in use by some, of survivors allowing themselves to be baptized on behalf of (believing?) friends who had died without baptism."
3. "This, the only justifiable rendering, is adopted by Ambrose, and by Anselm, Erasmus, Grotius, al., and recently by Billroth, Rückert, Meyer, De Wette, al."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "How wretched is their lot!" - This quote highlights the dire consequences of denying the resurrection. It emphasizes the misery and hopelessness that comes with the belief that there is no life after death.

2. "What account can they give of their practice; why are they at the trouble of it, if the dead rise not?" - This quote raises a rhetorical question, challenging the logic behind the practice of baptizing for the dead. It questions the purpose and meaning of such a practice if there is no belief in the resurrection.

3. "The price they get for their trouble is, that they should be gathered to the dead for ever." - This quote suggests that those who deny the resurrection and engage in the practice of baptizing for the dead will ultimately be condemned to eternal separation from God. It highlights the negative consequences of rejecting the belief in life after death.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The apostle here resumes the argument for the resurrection which was interrupted at 1 Corinthians 15:19."
2. "The various opinions which have been entertained in regard to this passage, together with an examination of them, may be seen in Pool’s Synopsis, Rosenmuller, and Bloomfield."
3. "According to this view, the phrase 'for the dead' means, with reference to the dead; with direct allusion to the condition of the dead, and their hopes; with a belief that the dead will rise."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Not, What will they have recourse to? nor, How will it profit them? The reference is to the living who are baptized for the dead." 
2. "Concerning this expression, of which some thirty different explanations are given, it is best to admit frankly that we lack the facts for a decisive interpretation."
3. "Paul is evidently alluding to a usage familiar to his readers; and the term employed was, as Godet remarks, in their vocabulary, a sort of technical phrase."

### John Calvin:
1. "For my part, however, I cannot by any means be persuaded to believe this, for it is not to be credited, that those who denied that there was a resurrection had, along with others, made use of a custom of this sort."
2. "Paul, however, here simply mentions a custom that was sacred, and in accordance with the Divine institution — that if a catechumen, who had already in his heart embraced the Christian faith, saw that death was impending over him, he asked baptism, partly for his own consolation, and partly with a view to the edification of his brethren."
3. "This passage shows us, too, that those impostors who had disturbed the faith of the Corinthians, had contrived a figurative resurrection, making the farthest goal of believers to be in this world."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "A most difficult verse, of which the interpretations that have been given are endless."
2. "Surely this scarcely deserves notice. Plainly, the allusion is to some act performed in expectation of future benefit to themselves, which benefit would be lost if the dead did not rise."
3. "Foreseeing that their faith would cost them the loss of all things, perhaps of life itself, not a few converts, in proceeding to baptism, went to it as their virtual death-warrant."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "This passage remains a puzzle. Stanley gives thirteen interpretations, no one of which may be correct. Over thirty have been suggested." 
2. "The Greek expositors took it to be about the dead (υπερ in sense of περ as often as in 2 Corinthians 1:6) since baptism is a burial and a resurrection (Romans 6:2-6)." 
3. "Some take it to be baptism over the dead. Others take it to mean that Paul and others were in peril of death as shown by baptism (see verse 1 Corinthians 15:30)."

### John Gill:
1. "Rather therefore Christian baptism, or the ordinance of water baptism is here respected."
2. "The apostle seems to point out something that was done or endured by some Christians only; whereas baptism, upon a profession of faith in Christ, and the resurrection from the dead, and performed by immersion, as an emblem of it, was common to all."
3. "I am rather inclined to think that baptism is used here in a figurative and metaphorical sense, for afflictions, sufferings, and martyrdom."

### John Wesley:
1. "Baptized for the dead" may refer to those who are baptized in the hope of receiving blessings after death, suggesting a belief in the continuation of spiritual growth beyond physical life.
2. The phrase could also mean being baptized in the place of those who have recently died for the cause of Christ, symbolizing a sense of duty and honor to carry on their work.
3. This concept can be likened to soldiers who step forward to fill the gap left by fallen comrades, showing a willingness to continue the mission and advance in the face of adversity.
