# 1 Corinthians 15:32 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, the apostle Paul discusses the challenges he has faced as a believer. Commentaries suggest that when he mentions fighting with wild beasts, it is not to be taken literally, but rather figuratively as a metaphor for the dangers he has encountered. Paul's mention of this event at Ephesus, where he faced intense persecution, exemplifies his resilience and God's miraculous deliverance. Furthermore, the phrase "as a man" emphasizes the contrast between a limited human perspective, focused on worldly gains and temporal pleasures, and the hope of the resurrection that Paul firmly holds onto.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The stress of the first clause is on κατὰ ἄνθρωπον, and its meaning, merely as man, i.e. ‘according to this world’s views,’ ‘as one who has no hope beyond the grave.'" 
2. "The renderings, ὅσον τὸ εἰς ἀνθρώπους (Chrys. p. 381), i.e. ‘so far as one can be said θηριομαχεῖν against men,’ and κατὰ ἀνθρώπων λογισμὸν θηρίων ἐγενόμην βορά (Theodoret), ‘exempli causa’ (Semler, Rosenmüller), ‘ut hominum more loquar’ (Estius and Bloomf.), are all constrained, and scarcely to be extorted from the words."
3. "His Roman citizenship would have precluded his ever being literally thrown to beasts: and even supposing him to have waived it, and been miraculously rescued, as Ambrst, Theodoret, Erasm., Luther, Calv., al. suppose, is it conceivable that such an event should have been altogether unrecorded in the Acts?"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "If 'merely as a man' (with the mere human hope of the present life not with the Christian's hope of the resurrection; answering to 'If the dead rise not,' the parallel clause in the next sentence), I have fought with men resembling savage beasts." 
2. "Seeing I have renounced all that, 'as a mere man,' might compensate me for such sufferings, gain, fame, &c." 
3. "Paul imitates the language of such skeptics, to reprove both their theory and practice. 'If men but persuade themselves that they shall die like the beasts, they soon will live like beasts too' [SOUTH]."

### Albert Barnes:
1) "Paul refers to some real occurrence at Ephesus. This is manifest from the whole passage. It is not a supposable case."
2) "The state of things in Ephesus when Paul was there Acts 19:0 was such as to make it nowise improbable that he would be subjected to such a trial."
3) "The phrase κατὰ ἄνθρωπον kata anthrōpon, as a 'man,' may mean, that, 'to human appearance,' or so far as man was concerned, had it not been for some divine interposition, he would have been a prey to the wild beasts."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "After the manner of men [κατα ανθρωπον]. As men ordinarily do, for temporal reward; and not under the influence of any higher principle or hope."
2. "Paul, as a Roman citizen, would not have been set to fight with beasts in the arena; and such an incident would not have been likely to be passed over by Luke in the Acts."
3. "The traditional founder of Tarsus was Sardanapalus, who was worshipped, along with Semiramis, with licentious rites which resembled those of the Feast of Tabernacles. Paul had probably witnessed this festival, and had seen, at the neighboring town of Anchiale, the statue of Sardanapalus, represented as snapping his fingers, and with the inscription upon the pedestal, 'Eat, drink, enjoy thyself. The rest is nothing.'"

### John Calvin:
1. "To what purpose were it,” says he, “for me to incur infamy in connection with a most cruel death, if all my hopes were confined to this world?"
2. "We see what an extremity God allowed his servant to come to, and how wonderfully, too, he rescued him."
3. "If death is the end of man, there is nothing better than that he should indulge in pleasure, free from care, so long as life lasts."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "To take this literally is most unnatural... Clearly, the statement is to be understood in a figurative sense." 
2. "This maxim, though found in a fragment of the Greek poet Menander, was not likely taken directly from him by our apostle; for it is just such a proverbial saying as, when once penned, would be sure to be caught up and repeated from mouth to mouth."
3. "A different punctuation of this verse is adopted by many of the best interpreters... But the sense given by the punctuation of the received text... seems to us more natural."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "After the manner of men. Like men, for applause, money, etc." 
2. "If I fought with wild beasts at Ephesus. Those who argue for an Ephesian imprisonment for Paul and Ephesus as the place where he wrote the imprisonment epistles take the verb literally."
3. "Let us eat and drink. It is the outcry of the people of Jerusalem during the siege of Jerusalem by the Assyrians. Paul is not giving his own view, but that of people who deny the resurrection."

### John Gill:
1. "Some understand this in a figurative sense, and think that by 'beasts' are meant Satan, the roaring lion, and his principalities and powers; or men of savage dispositions, persecuting principles, and cruel practices."
2. "The literal sense best agrees with the apostle's argument."
3. "If regard is had to what befell the apostle at Ephesus...when the apostle did actually fight with beasts, and was wonderfully and providentially preserved; and may be what he refers to when he despaired of life, had the sentence of death in himself, and yet was delivered."

### John Wesley:
1. "If to speak after the manner of men - That is, to use a proverbial phrase, expressive of the most imminent danger."
2. "I have fought with wild beasts at Ephesus - With the savage fury of a lawless multitude."
3. "Let us eat... - We might, on that supposition, as well say, with the Epicureans, Let us make the best of this short life, seeing we have no other portion."
