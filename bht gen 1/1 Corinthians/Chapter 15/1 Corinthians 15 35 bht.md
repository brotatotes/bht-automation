# 1 Corinthians 15:35 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse in question explores the concept of resurrection and raises doubts about its possibility. The skeptics question how the dead can be raised, emphasizing the decay and disorganization of their bodies. However, the commentators assert that resurrection is not limited by human understanding or the laws of nature. They emphasize that the resurrected body will be different, transformed into a spiritual and imperishable form. This miraculous event showcases the power of God and offers hope for eternal life.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "How is it possible that the dead should be raised? They return to their native dust. They become entirely disorganized. Their dust may be scattered; how shall it be re-collected?" 
2. "What will be the form, the shape, the size, the organization of the new body? Are we to suppose that all the matter which at any time entered into its composition here is to be recollected, and to constitute a colossal frame?"

### John Calvin:

2. "Paul, with the view of removing entirely this appearance of absurdity, makes use of an anhypophora, that is, he brings forward by way of objection, in the person of another, what appears at first view to be at variance with the doctrine of a resurrection."
3. "Let us observe, then, that the persons who are here introduced as speaking, are those who endeavor to disparage, in a way of scoffing, a belief in the resurrection, on the ground of its being a thing that is impossible."

### Philip Schaff:

3. "The bodies that rise again are not the same as the ones that were buried. They are not subject to decay or weakness, but are glorified and perfected by God's power."
