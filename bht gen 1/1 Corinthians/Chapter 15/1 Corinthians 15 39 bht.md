## Choicest Commentary Quotes:

2. "But Philippians 3:21- : below implies, it is not 'flesh and blood' in the animal sense we now understand them; for these 'shall not inherit the kingdom of God.'"
3. "Not the same—not flesh of the same nature and excellency. As the kinds of flesh, however widely differing from one another, do not cease to be flesh, so the kinds of bodies, however differing from one another, are still bodies."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "There are many kinds of bodies; that all are not alike; that while they are bodies, yet they partake of different qualities, forms, and properties."
2. "It is not necessary, therefore, to suppose that the body that shall be raised shall be precisely like that which we have here."
3. "There may be a similar change in the body of the believer, and yet be still the same."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "It is conceivable that the resurrection-body should be organized differently from the earthly body, and in a way which cannot be inferred from the shape of the earthly body."
2. "There is a great variety of organization among bodies which we know: it may fairly be inferred that there may be a new and different organization in those which we do not know."

2. "Who that saw, for the first time, the little pendant coffin in which the insect lay entombed, and was ignorant of the transformation of which we are now speaking, would ever predict that, in a few weeks, perhaps in a few days or hours, it would become one of the most elegant and active of winged insects?"
3. "And who that contemplates, with the mind of a philosopher, this current transformation, and knows that two years before the insect mounts into the air, even while it is living in water, it has the rudiments of wings, can deny that the body of a dead man may, at some future period, be again invested with vigor and activity, and soar to regions for which some latent organization may have peculiarly fitted it?"

### John Gill:
1. "Though all flesh is flesh, as to the nature and substance of it; agrees in its original, being by generation; and is supported by food, and is alike frail and mortal; all flesh is grass, rises out of it, or is maintained by it, or withers like that, yet not of equal worth, value, and excellency."
2. "Another flesh of beasts; as sheep and oxen, and other beasts of the field; another of fishes: which may be observed against the Papists, who distinguish between flesh and fish, as if there was no flesh of fishes; and on their fast days prohibit flesh, but allow the eating of fish; thus flesh is attributed to fishes."
3. "The intent of this simile is only to show, that the resurrection of the dead will be in real flesh, in their own flesh, in the selfsame flesh, as to substance, with which they were clothed when on earth; but that it will, as to its qualities, be different from it, as one sort of flesh is now from another."
