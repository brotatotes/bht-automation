# 1 Corinthians 15:40 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the commentators provide insight into the nature of the bodies being discussed. They compare the bodies of angels, emphasizing their heavenly nature and role in God's creation, to the celestial bodies such as the sun, moon, and stars. The celestial bodies are described as having a surpassing glory, radiant and glorious in a way that earthly bodies cannot match. This distinction between the heavenly and earthly bodies highlights the temporary and perishable nature of earthly things compared to the eternal glory of the celestial realm.
