# 1 Corinthians 15:42 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Bible verse describes the transformation and resurrection of the body after death. Commentators emphasize the distinction between the earthly body and the risen body, comparing it to a grain of seed that is sown and then sprouts. The resurrection body is described as incorruptible, no longer susceptible to decay, sickness, or disorganization like the mortal body. It is a completely new and glorious form, different from its previous state, offering hope and reassurance to those who endure sickness and fear the decay of the tomb.
