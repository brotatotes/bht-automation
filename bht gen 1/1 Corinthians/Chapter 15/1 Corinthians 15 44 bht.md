# 1 Corinthians 15:44 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Bible verse being described is 1 Corinthians 15:44. The commentators provide insights into the concept of a "natural body" and a "spiritual body." They explain that the natural body is mortal and sustained by animal functions, such as food and sleep. In contrast, the spiritual body is transformed, purified, and suited to a higher nature. It is subject to the spirit and soul of man, able to engage in spiritual service, delight in spiritual objects, and exist without natural necessities.

### Henry Alford:
1. "If there exists an animal body, there exists also a spiritual." 
2. "It is no more wonderful a thing, that there should be a body fitted to the capacities and wants of man’s highest part, his spirit."
3. "The emphasis is both times on ἔστιν."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The Holy Spirit in the spirit of believers, indeed, is an earnest of a superior state, but meanwhile in the body the animal soul preponderates; hereafter the Spirit shall predominate, and the animal soul be duly subordinate."
2. "A spiritual body—a body wholly moulded by the Spirit, and its organism not conformed to the lower and animal, but to the higher and spiritual life."
3. "It is no more wonderful a thing, that there should be a body fitted to the capacities and want of man's highest part, his spirit (which we see to be the case), than that there should be one fitted to the capacities and wants of his subordinate part, the animal soul."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The word 'natural' here, therefore, means that which has 'animal' life; which breathes and acts by the laws of the animal economy; that which draws in the breath of life; which is endowed with senses, and which has need of the supports of animal life, and of the refreshments derived from food, exercise, sleep, etc."
2. "It will still be a 'body' (σῶμα sōma), but it will have so far the nature of spirit as to be without the vital functions which here control the body."
3. "It will be a body without the vital functions of the animal economy; a body sustained in the manner in which we conceive the spirit to be."

These quotes provide insight into the meaning of a "natural body" and a "spiritual body," emphasizing that the latter is not a mere spirit but a body that transcends the limitations of the animal functions.

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The expression natural body signifies an organism animated by a yuch soul, that phase of the immaterial principle in man which is more nearly allied to the sarx flesh, and which characterizes the man as a mortal creature."
2. "In the resurrection-body the pneuma spirit, for whose life-activity it is the adequate organ, conditions its nature."
3. "A body in which a divine pneuma spirit supersedes the yuch soul, so that the resurrection-body is the fitting organ for its indwelling and work, and so is properly characterized as a spiritual body."

### John Calvin:
1. "Now it is the soul that quickens the body, so as to keep it from being a dead carcase. Hence it takes its title very properly from it."
2. "After the resurrection, on the other hand, that quickening influence, which it will receive from the Spirit, will be more excellent."
3. "Let the present quality of the body be called, for the sake of greater plainness, animation; let the future receive the name of inspiration."

Note: The commentary provides explanations and clarifications about the nature of the body before and after resurrection, emphasizing the role of the soul and the Spirit in animating the body. It also highlights the continuity of the body's substance while discussing the distinction between its present quality (animation) and its future quality (inspiration).

### Philip Schaff:
1. "it is raised a spiritual body...a body whose animating principle is 'the spirit,' or rational nature in its entirely purified and perfected condition" - This quote highlights that a spiritual body is not just a finer material body, but one that is completely transformed and purified in its nature.

2. "a body all whose organs and properties will be adapted to the inner and higher nature whose handmaid it is to be" - This quote emphasizes that the spiritual body will have organs and properties that are perfectly suited to the higher nature it serves.

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The resurrection body is not wholly πνευμα. Caution is needed here in filling out details concerning the ψυχη and the πνευμα."
2. "Certainly he means to say that the 'spiritual body' has some kind of germinal connection with the 'natural body,' though the development is glorious beyond our comprehension."
3. "The force of the argument remains unimpaired though we cannot follow fully into the thought beyond us."

### John Gill:
1. "It is sown a natural body,.... Or an animal one, being generated as animals are, and supported with food as they be, and die at last as they do." 
2. "It is raised a spiritual body; not as to substance, but as to its quality; it will not be changed into a spirit...but the body will then be subject to the spirit and soul of man; it will be employed in spiritual service, for which it will be abundantly fitted and assisted by the Spirit of God."
3. "It will be delighted with spiritual objects; it will be like the angels, those excellent spirits; it will live as spirits do, without natural helps and means, as meat, drink, clothes, sleep, and, as they, will never die."

### John Wesley:
1. "It is sown in this world a merely animal body - Maintained by food, sleep, and air, like the bodies of brutes."
