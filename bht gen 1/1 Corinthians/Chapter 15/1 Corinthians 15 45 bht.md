## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The words quoted serve therefore rather for the illustration of man being a ψυχή, than for a proof of the existence of the spiritual body."
2. "The question of when the second Adam became a life-bestowing Spirit is not one to be pressed: in the union of the two natures, the second Adam was constituted a life-bestowing Spirit, and is such now in heaven, yet having the resurrection-body."
3. "He was a πνεῦμα ζωοποιοῦν, even while in the σῶμα ψυχικόν; and is still such in the σῶμα πνευματικόν."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Man became (was made to become) a living soul, that is, endowed with an animal soul, the living principle of his body." 
2. "He is so called in Job 19:25; see on Job 19:25- : (compare Job 19:25- :). In contrast to 'the last,' Paul calls 'man' (Genesis 2:7) 'the FIRST Adam.'"
3. "As the natural or animal-souled body is the fruit of our union with the first Adam, an animal-souled man, so the spiritual body is the fruit of our union with the second Adam, who is the quickening Spirit."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The use of the word 'soul' in our translation...does not quite convey the idea...The Greek and Hebrew words...more properly denote that which is alive, which is animated, which breathes, which has an animal nature."
2. "Christ here seems to be called Adam because he stands in contradistinction from the first Adam...From the one we derive an animal or vital existence; from the other we derive our immortal existence, and resurrection from the grave."
3. "A vivifying spirit; a spirit giving or imparting life...This is not a quotation from any part of the Scriptures, but seems to be used by Paul either as affirming what was true on his own apostolic authority, or as conveying the substance of what was revealed respecting the Messiah in the Old Testament."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "A living soul [ψυχην ζωσαν] . See Genesis 2:7. Here yuch passes into its personal sense - an individual personality (see Romans 11:4), yet retaining the emphatic reference to the yuch as the distinctive principle of that individuality in contrast with the pneuma spirit following."
2. "Last Adam. Christ. Put over against Adam because of the peculiar relation in which both stand to the race : Adam as the physical, Christ as the spiritual head. Adam the head of the race in its sin, Christ in its redemption."
3. "Quickening spirit [πνευμα ζωοποιουν] . Rev., life - giving. Not merely living, but imparting life. Compare John 1:4; John 3:36; John 5:26, John 5:40; John 6:33 John 6:35; John 10:10; John 11:25; John 14:6. The period at which Christ became a quickening Spirit is the resurrection, after which His body began to take on the characteristics of a spiritual body."

### John Calvin:
1. "Moses relates that Adam was furnished with a living soul; Christ, on the other hand, is endowed with a life-giving Spirit. Now it is a much greater thing to be life, or the source of life, than simply to live."
2. "Christ did also, like us, become a living soul; but, besides the soul, the Spirit of the Lord was also poured-out upon him, that by his power he might rise again from the dead, and raise up others."
3. "All men were created in the first man, because, whatever God designed to give to all, he conferred upon that one man, so that the condition of mankind was settled in his person. He by his fall ruined himself and those that were his, because he drew them all, along with himself, into the same ruin: Christ came to restore our nature from ruin, and raise it up to a better condition than ever."
