# 1 Corinthians 15:47 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this passage, commentators discuss the contrasting nature and roles of the first man (Adam) and the second man (Christ). They highlight how Adam, being made from the earth, was subject to mortality and corruption. In contrast, Christ, with a heavenly origin and nature, came to fulfill the role of the representative and head of redeemed mankind. The commentators emphasize that Christ's descent from heaven demonstrated His lordship and power, and through Him, a new spiritual life is made possible. These insights shed light on the transformative impact of Christ's sacrifice and his role as the ultimate redeemer of humanity.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Since the body of Adam is thus characterized as a ψυχικὸν σῶμα, as 1 Corinthians 15:45, and psychical organism involves mortality (1Co 15:44), it is clear that Paul treats of Adam not as created exempt from death: in strict accordance with Genesis 2:7; Genesis 3:19." 
2. "Nor does this militate against his teaching that death came into the world through sin. Romans 5:12. For had our first parents not sinned, they would have remained in Paradise, and would, by the use of the Tree of Life, which God had not forbidden them (Gen 2:16-17), have become immortal (Gen 3:22)." 
3. "But they were driven out of Paradise, ere yet they had tasted of this tree (Gen 3:22), and so, according to the record in Genesis also, Death came into the world by sin."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Of course, he must partake of a nature that was low, mean, mortal, and corruptible."
2. "He is called the second man, as being the second who sustained a relation to people that was materially to affect their conduct and destiny."
3. "The sense is, evidently, that as the first man had an earthly origin, and was, therefore, earthy, so the second man being from heaven, as his proper home, would have a body adapted to that abode."

### Marvin Vincent:

### John Calvin:

3. "Christ is the Son of God, who came down to us from heaven, and brings with him, therefore, a heavenly nature and influence."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The first man is of the earth. The word signifies ‘rubbish,’ ‘loose earth,’ ‘dust’...the second man is of heaven."

### John Gill:
1. "Adam was certainly made out of the earth, and had his habitation and abode assigned him in the garden of Eden, and was made to cultivate and till it; his lordship and dominion, at most and best, only extended to the terraqueous globe, and the creatures in it; and having sinned, he was not only thrust out of the garden to till the ground out of which he was taken, but doomed to return to the dust from whence he came."
2. "Christ is the second man; and these two are spoken of, as if they were the only two men in the world; because as the former was the head and representative of all his natural posterity, so the latter is the head and representative of all his spiritual offspring."
3. "Christ is Lord of all, not only Lord of lords below, but Lord of angels and saints above; the whole family in heaven and in earth is named of him; and he has all power in heaven and in earth, and a name above every name in this world, and that to come, and is indeed higher than the heavens."

### John Wesley:
1. "The first man, being from the earth, is subject to corruption and dissolution, like the earth from which he came."
2. "The Lord does not owe his glory to heaven. He himself made the heavens, and by descending from thence showed himself to us as the Lord."
3. "Christ was not the second man in order of time; but in this respect, that as Adam was a public person, who acted in the stead of all mankind, so was Christ."

These quotes highlight the contrast between the first man (Adam) and the second man (Christ), emphasizing their origins, nature, and roles as representatives of humanity. They help to deepen our understanding of the verse and the significance of Christ's role in redemption.
