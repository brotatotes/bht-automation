# 1 Corinthians 15:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the appearances of the resurrected Christ are described in chronological order. The first appearance is to Cephas, or Peter, highlighting his importance within the early Christian community. The term "The Twelve" is used to refer to the group of disciples, even when their number was not complete. There is speculation about whether Matthias, who replaced Judas Iscariot, was also present during one of the appearances. The resurrection of Christ is presented as a fact proven by credible witnesses, and the emphasis is on the physical appearances, not just visions.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "That the following appearances are related in chronological order, is evident from the use of the definite adverbs of sequence, εἶτα, ἔπειτα, ἔσχατον δὲ πάντων." 
2. "The occasion referred to seems to be that in John 20:19 ff.; Luke 24:36 ff."
3. "Clearly we must not with Chrys., suppose Matthias to be included as possibly having seen Him after His ascension: for the appearance is evidently one and the same."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "seen of Cephas—Peter" - This quote highlights the significance of Peter as one of the first witnesses of the resurrected Christ. It emphasizes his importance and role in the early Christian community.

2. "The Twelve was their ordinary appellation, even when their number was not full." - This quote explains that the term "The Twelve" was commonly used to refer to the group of disciples, even if their actual number was not complete. It shows the continued recognition and authority given to the original twelve disciples.

It adds an interesting perspective to the event and raises questions about the composition of the group of witnesses.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The resurrection of Christ was a fact to be proved, like all other facts, by competent and credible witnesses."
2. "Paul, therefore, appeals to the witnesses who had attested, or who yet lived to attest, the truth of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus; and shows that it was not possible that so many witnesses should have been deceived."
3. "He does not, therefore, mention the woman to whom the Saviour first appeared, nor does he refer to all the times when the Lord Jesus manifested himself to his disciples. But he does not refer to them in general merely, but mentions 'names,' and refers to persons who 'were then alive,' who could attest the truth of the resurrection."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The word most commonly used in the New Testament for seeing visions."

### John Calvin:
1. "In proportion as our Lord was desirous that there should be many witnesses of his resurrection, and that it should be frequently testified of, let us know that it should be so much the more surely believed among us."
2. "For the eyes of the body cannot be witnesses of a spiritual resurrection."
3. "By all the Apostles I understand not merely the twelve, but also those disciples to whom Christ had assigned the office of preaching the gospel."

### John Gill:
1. "This was not another Cephas, one of the seventy disciples, but the Apostle Peter himself, to whom it is certain the Lord appeared."
2. "Not that he was the first person by whom Christ was seen after his resurrection, but the testimony of the women the apostle omits, and it seems as if Peter was the first of the men that saw Christ when risen."
3. "Whether he was one of the disciples that went to Emmaus, to whom Christ joined himself, and entered into discourse with, is not certain; it should rather seem, that the appearance here referred to was when he was alone."
