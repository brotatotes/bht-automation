# 1 Corinthians 15:50 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Our present mortal bodies, made of flesh and blood, cannot inherit the incorruptible and spiritual kingdom of God. It is necessary for us to be transformed and renewed in order to partake in the glorious resurrection. These earthly bodies, frail and subject to decay, cannot befit the realm of everlasting incorruption. Our hope lies in the change that occurs from the perishable to the imperishable, a transformation wrought by the power of Christ, enabling us to partake in the eternal dwelling of God's kingdom.
