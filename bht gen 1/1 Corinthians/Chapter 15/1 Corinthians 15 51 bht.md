# 1 Corinthians 15:51 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Behold, a mystery is being revealed - a truth previously unseen. A change awaits us all, a transformation from mortality to immortality, from corruption to incorruption. Some of us will be alive when the Lord comes, witnessing this instantaneous alteration from our earthly bodies to spiritual ones. This grand truth, hitherto unclear, is now unveiled, assuring us that even in death, we shall be changed and conformed to Christ.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "He proceeds to reveal to them something of the process of the change at the resurrection-day."
2. "The sleep of death cannot be predicated of (all of us), but the resurrection-change can."
3. "The emphasis is both times on πάντες '(All of us) shall not sleep, but (all of us) shall be changed.'"

Note: The commentary is quite technical and focused on the interpretation of the Greek text, so the quotes provided are the most relevant for enriching understanding of the verse.

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Behold—Calling attention to the 'mystery' heretofore hidden in God's purposes, but now revealed."
2. "YOU, who think you have so much knowledge, 'a mystery' which your reason could never have discovered."
3. "The putting off of the corruptible body for an incorruptible by an instantaneous change will, in the case of 'the quick,' stand as equivalent to death, appointed to all men."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Paul answers it directly, and says that they will undergo an instantaneous change, which will make them like the dead that shall be raised."
2. "Paul then here says, that he was about to communicate a great truth which till then had been unknown, and to resolve a great inquiry on which there had as yet been no revelation."
3. "The objection which is made to it is, that Paul expected to live until the Lord Jesus should return; that he, therefore, expected that the world would soon end, and that in this he was mistaken, and could not be inspired."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Not, there is not one of us now living who shall die before the Lord's coming, but, we shall not all die."
2. "There will be some of us Christians living when the Lord comes, but we shall be changed."
3. "The other rendering would commit the apostle to the extent of believing that not one Christian would die before the coming of Christ."

### John Calvin:
1. "He calls [the resurrection] a mystery, because it had not been as yet so clearly unfolded in any statement of revelation; but he does this to make them more attentive."
2. "Paul’s intention is to explain what he had said — that we will be conformed to Christ, because flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God."
3. "We must, however, unravel the difficulty — that it is appointed unto all men once to die; and certainly, it is not difficult to unravel it in this way — that as a change cannot take place without doing away with the previous system, that change is reckoned, with good reason, a kind of death."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "We shall not all sleep the sleep of death; for a generation of believers will be 'alive and remain when the Lord comes', but we shall all be changed from mortality to immortality, from corruption to incorruption." 

2. "A change which in the living will be equivalent to both death and resurrection all but instantaneously occurring, while they are standing, it may be, on their feet, expecting nothing, and working their ordinary work."

3. "The absurd reading, 'We shall all sleep, but we shall not all be changed,' is the reading, nevertheless, of two of the oldest MSS., of two later Uncials, and of one good Cursive."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "He does not claim that he has explained everything. He has drawn a broad parallel which opens the door of hope and confidence."
2. "Not all of us shall die, Paul means. Some people will be alive when he comes."
3. "Both living and dead shall be changed and so receive the resurrection body."

### John Gill:
1. "Behold, I show you a mystery,.... Or a secret, which could never have been discovered by reason, or the light of nature, and what is of pure revelation."
2. "He prefaces the account of it in this manner, partly to show the great respect he had for these Corinthians, that he treated them as his bosom friends, to whom he communicated his secrets."
3. "They will not die as men ordinarily do, and continue under the power of death, but they will be changed at once from corruption to incorruption, from dishonour to glory, from weakness to power, from being natural to be spiritual bodies."

### John Wesley:
1. "A mystery — A truth hitherto unknown; and not yet fully known to any of the sons of men." 
2. "We — Christians. The Apostle considers them all as one, in their succeeding generations." 
3. "But we shall all — Who do not die, be changed - So that this animal body shall become spiritual."
