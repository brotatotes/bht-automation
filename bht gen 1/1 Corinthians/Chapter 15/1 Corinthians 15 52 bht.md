# 1 Corinthians 15:52 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, the amazing work of omnipotence will take place. The change upon the bodies of living saints will be so quick, imperceptible even, like a quivering harp or twinkle of a star. At the sound of the trumpet, the dead will be awakened from their slumber and all present things will culminate, as almighty power is put forth to raise them. It will be a sudden, instantaneous event, changing believers into saints in a moment.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "in a point of time absolutely indivisible"
2. "the last trump, in a wide and popular sense"
3. "ὁ σαλπιγκτής, scil. So Od. φ. 142, ἀρξάμενοι τοῦ χώρου ὅθεν τέ περ οἰνοχοεύει (scil. ὁ οἰνόχοος)"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The last trump—at the sounding of the trumpet on the last day."
2. "As the law was given with the sound of a trumpet, so the final judgment according to it."
3. "The trumpet was sounded to convoke the people on solemn feasts, especially on the first day of the seventh month."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "In a moment - In an 'atom,' scil. of time; a point of time which cannot be cut or divided... It will be done instantaneously." 

2. "In the twinkling of an eye - This is an expression also denoting the least conceivable duration of time... The suddenness of the coming of the Lord Jesus is elsewhere compared to the coming of a thief in the night."

3. "At the last trump - When the trumpet shall sound to raise the dead... It will end the economy of this world; it will be connected with the last state of things."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Atomos, from aj not and temnw to cut, whence our atom. An undivided point of time."
2. "The same idea of indivisibility appears in ajkarhv (not in the New Testament), from aj not and keirw to shear; primarily of hair too short to be cut, and often used in classical Greek of time."
3. "Twinkling [ριπη] . Only here in the New Testament. Originally the swing or force with which a thing is thrown; a stroke or beat."

### John Calvin:
1. "For in all the change will be sudden and instantaneous, because Christ’s advent will be sudden."
2. "As therefore a commander, with the sound of a trumpet, summons his army to battle, so Christ, by his far sounding proclamation, which will be heard throughout the whole world, will summon all the dead."
3. "The dead, the very dead, shall hear."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye" - This phrase emphasizes the instantaneousness of the event, highlighting the suddenness and speed at which the transformation will occur.

2. "the dead in Christ shall rise first" - This verse from 1 Thessalonians 4:16 indicates that there will be a brief interval between the resurrection of the dead and the transformation of the living saints. It suggests a specific order in which these events will take place.

3. "the trumpet shall sound audibly" - The sounding of the trumpet is described as a signal for the culmination of all present things. This auditory cue signifies the imminent and final transformation of the living saints, marking the end of the current age.

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "In a moment (εν ατομω). Old word, from α privative and τεμνω, to cut, indivisible: Scientific word for atom which was considered indivisible, but that was before the day of electrons and protons." 
2. "In the twinkling of an eye (εν ριπη οφθαλμου). Old word ριπη from ριπτω, to throw. Only here in N.T. Used by the Greeks for the flapping of a wing, the buzz of a gnat, the quivering of a harp, the twinkling of a star."
3. "At the last trump (εν τη εσχατη σαλπιγγ). Symbolical, of course. See on 1 Thessalonians 4:16; Matthew 24:31."
