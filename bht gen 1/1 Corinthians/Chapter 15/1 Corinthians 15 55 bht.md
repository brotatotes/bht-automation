"The challenge to 'death,' to say where is now its 'victory,' seems the natural sequel of the immediately preceding words, 'Death is swallowed up in victory;' as if he had said, 'The tables are turned upon thee now: till now the victory was thine indeed; for 'the wages of sin was death,' and thou hadst a right to see them duly paid. But thy sting has been extracted, and where is it now?'"
