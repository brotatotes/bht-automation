# 1 Corinthians 15:56 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we see the inseparable connection between sin and death. Sin acts as the sting of death, giving it power and bitterness. It is through sin that death inflicts its deadly wound. This relationship is further underscored by the fact that the law reveals the strength of sin, making it even more grievous. Ultimately, it is only through the Savior, Jesus Christ, that we can find redemption from the power and consequences of sin and death.

### John Calvin:
1. "Death has no dart with which to wound us except sin, since death proceeds from the anger of God. Now it is only with our sins that God is angry. Take away sin, therefore, and death will no more be able to harm us."
2. "Sin is compared to a sting, with which alone death is armed for inflicting upon us a deadly wound. Let that be taken away, and death is disarmed, so as to be no longer hurtful."
3. "The law of God imparts to sin its deadly power, because it does not merely discover our guilt, but even increases it. Sin is lulled asleep, but is kindled up by the law, so as to rage furiously. Hence the law is but the occasion of injury. The true cause of ruin is in ourselves."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The sting of death is sin as it inflicts on the sinner a wound which is mortal." 
2. "The power of sin is the law. Law is the expression of sovereign authority."
3. "It will be seen that 'sin' here is viewed in its penal, not its moral character; as criminal, as damnable, as, in its desert, deadly rather than as hateful."

### Archibald T. Robertson:

### John Gill:
1. "Sin is the cause of death, it is what has given rise and being to it; it entered into the world by it, and is supported in its empire through it."
2. "Sin gives death all its bitterness, agonies, and miseries; and it is by that it does all the hurt and mischief it does."
3. "Moreover, the strength of sin, its evil nature, and all the dreadful aggravations of it, and sad consequences upon it, are discovered and made known by the law."

These quotes highlight the relationship between sin and death, emphasizing how sin is the cause of death and how it gives death its power and bitterness. They also emphasize the role of the law in revealing the strength and consequences of sin.
