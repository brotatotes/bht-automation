## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "as to the abortively born...the one whose relation to the rest in point of worthiness, was as that of the immature and deformed child to the rest of the family." 
2. "That this is the meaning is evident from 1 Corinthians 15:9, which drops the figure." 
3. "He appeared to me also: viz. on the road to Damascus. This, and this only, can here be meant; as he is speaking, not of a succession of visions, but of some one definite apparition."

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "the one abortively born": the abortion in the family of the apostles.
2. "As a child born before the due time is puny, and though born alive, yet not of the proper size, and scarcely worthy of the name of man, so 'I am the least of the apostles,' scarcely 'meet to be called an apostle.'"
3. "a supernumerary taken into the college of apostles out of regular course, not led to Christ by long instruction, like a natural birth, but by a sudden power, as those prematurely born."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "This passage proves that the apostle Paul saw the same Lord Jesus, the same 'body' which had been seen by the others, or else his assertion would be no proof that he was risen from the dead."
2. "It was not a fancy, therefore, that he had seen him; it was not the work of imagination; it was not even a 'revelation' that he had risen; it was a real vision of the ascended Redeemer."
3. "The expression, 'as of one born out of due time,' would seem to imply that Paul meant to say that there was some unfitness 'as to the time' when he saw the Lord Jesus; or that it was 'too late' to have as clear and satisfactory a view of him as those had who saw him before his ascension. But this is by no means the idea in the passage."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The word does not mean an untimely living birth, but a dead abortion, and suggests no notion of lateness of birth, but rather of being born before the time."
2. "Paul means that when Christ appeared to him and called him, he was - as compared with the disciples who had known and followed Him from the first, and whom he had been persecuting - no better than an unperfected foetus among living men."
3. "The comparison emphasizes his condition at the time of his call."

### John Calvin:
1. "As it was no deceptive vision, it was calculated to be of use for establishing a belief in the resurrection." 
2. "Lest any one, therefore, should meet him with the objection: 'Who art thou that we should give credit to thee?' he, of his own accord, confesses his unworthiness."
3. "This premature birth renders the grace of God more illustrious in Paul than if he had by little and little, and by successive steps, grown up to maturity in Christ."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The phrase 'born out of due time' in this verse refers to Paul's unique and unexpected encounter with Jesus on the road to Damascus. It emphasizes the extraordinary nature of his conversion and the fact that he was not one of the original disciples who had walked and talked with Jesus during his earthly ministry."

2. "By using the term 'the abortion' or 'the mistimed birth,' Paul acknowledges that his encounter with Jesus was not part of the normal sequence of events. It was a divine intervention, a miraculous occurrence that defied human expectations and timing."

3. "This verse highlights the inclusivity of God's grace and the fact that even someone like Paul, who was once a persecutor of the early Christians, could be chosen by God and have a personal encounter with Jesus. It serves as a reminder that God's love and mercy are not limited by human standards or expectations."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "As unto one born out of due time" - Paul uses this phrase to convey that his encounter with Jesus happened after Jesus had already ascended to heaven, emphasizing the miraculous nature of his experience.

2. "Literally, as to the miscarriage (or untimely birth)" - The phrase "born out of due time" can be understood as being akin to a miscarriage, highlighting the unexpected and extraordinary nature of Paul's encounter with Jesus.

3. "Paul means that the appearance to him came after Jesus had ascended to heaven" - This statement clarifies that Paul's encounter with Jesus was not a physical meeting during Jesus' earthly ministry, but a post-ascension appearance, underscoring the significance of the event.

### John Gill:
1. "This was a sight of Christ in heaven, not on earth, such an one as Stephen had, and was a corporeal one; otherwise it would have been impertinent to have mentioned it, with the rest of the ocular testimonies of Christ's resurrection."
2. "The apostle adds, as of one born out of due time: or 'as an abortive'; not that he was really one, but like one."
3. "The apostle refers to a 'posthumous' birth, to one that is born after the death of his father; because that the rest of the apostles were all chosen, and called, and sent forth, whilst Christ, their everlasting Father, was living on earth, but he not till after his death, resurrection from the dead, and ascension to heaven."

### John Wesley:
1. "An untimely birth - It was impossible to abase himself more than he does by this single appellation."
2. "As an abortion is not worthy the name of a man, so he affirms himself to be not worthy the name of an apostle."
3. "He humbles himself to the lowest degree, acknowledging his unworthiness and insignificance."
