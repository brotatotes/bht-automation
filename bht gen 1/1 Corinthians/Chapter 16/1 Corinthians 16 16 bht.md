# 1 Corinthians 16:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In return for their self-devotion, we are called to honor and respect those who have served us selflessly in the work of Christ. This includes extending gratitude and support to both leaders and fellow laborers, recognizing their dedication and valuing their contributions. As we reciprocate the selflessness shown to us, we foster a spirit of unity and create a harmonious community where leaders are esteemed and all are encouraged to fulfill their roles in the work of the gospel.
