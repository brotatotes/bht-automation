# 1 Corinthians 16:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
On a special day, Christians were encouraged to gather with the purpose of performing a religious duty. The verse addresses the importance of laying up at home whatever one has acquired, as a way of contributing to the collective cause. The act of giving should be based on a settled principle rather than occasional impulse, taking into consideration one's abilities and prosperity. This contribution was seen as a form of treasuring, a means of communication and distribution, with the intention of meeting the pressing needs of the saints.

2. "Let each of you lay up at home in store whatsoever he may by prosperity have acquired."
3. "That there may not, when I come, THEN be collections to be made."

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "The Christian Sabbath commemorates the respective works of the Three Persons of the Triune God—creation, redemption (the resurrection), and sanctification (on Pentecost the Holy Ghost being poured out)."
2. "The word 'Remember' implies that it was in existence before the giving of the law from Sinai, and refers to its institution in Paradise."
3. "A perpetual sabbath would doubtless be the highest Christian ideal; but living in a world of business where the Christian ideal is not yet realized, if a law of definite times was necessary in Paradise, it is still more so now."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Let each one esteem it his duty and his privilege to give to this object."
2. "Let him do it as a matter of principle, and when he is by himself."

2. "For he has an eye, first of all, to convenience, and farther, that the sacred assembly, in which the communion of saints is celebrated, might be an additional spur to them."
