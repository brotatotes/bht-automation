# 1 Corinthians 16:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the apostle admonishes that anyone who does not love the Lord Jesus Christ is to be regarded as accursed and devoted to destruction. This severe denunciation is aimed not at non-believers or outright enemies of Christ, but at those who claim to be part of the Christian community yet lack genuine love for Him. The inclusion of the Aramaic phrase "Maranatha" further serves as a solemn reminder of the impending judgment and coming of the Lord, indicating the severe consequences for those who do not love Him.

1. "He adds, as in Colossians 4:18; Ephesians 6:24, some exhortation, or solemn sentence, in his own hand, as having especial weight."
2. "The negation here of the feeling of personal affection, 'has no love in his heart for,' is worthy of note, as connected with the curse which follows."
3. "μαραναθά] An Aramaic expression, מָרַן אֲתָא or מָרָנָא אֲתָא the (or our) Lord cometh (or, is come, as Chrys., al., ὁ κυρ. ἡμ. ἦλθε: in 1Jn 4:2 the same Syriac form is used to express ἐληλυθότα): probably unconnected with ἀνάθεμα: and added perhaps (Mey.) as recalling some remembrance of the time when Paul was among them."

1. "It was designed to direct them to the great and essential matter of religion, the love of the Lord Jesus; and was intended, doubtless, to turn away their minds from the subjects which had agitated them, the disputes and dissensions which had rent the church into factions, to the great inquiry whether they truly loved the Saviour."
2. "No matter what any man’s endowments might be; no matter what might be his wealth, his standing, or his talent; no matter if he were regarded as a ruler in the church, or at the head of a party; yet if he had not true love to the Lord Jesus, he could not be saved."
3. "This solemn declaration, or denunciation, the apostle wrote with his own hand, as the summary of all that he had said, in order that it might be attentively regarded.

"It is best to consider this word, or rather these two words, 'maran atha', 'our Lord cometh', as added by the apostle, to put persons in mind of the coming of Christ; either at the destruction of Jerusalem, to take vengeance on the Jews, who did not love, but hated him, and maliciously persecuted him, and his; or of the second coming of Christ to judgment, when all the wicked of the earth shall be accursed by him, and all such that love him not will be bid to depart from him."
