# 1 Corinthians 16:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
If a generous collection has been amassed, not merely for security or receiving a warm reception in Jerusalem, but with a sense of the importance of an apostolic mission, the offer stands: I will accompany the mission, ensuring its success and guarding against any suspicion. This act is not just about the money, but a testament to the Corinthians' love for the gospel and the apostle's commitment to honesty, transparency, and trust.
