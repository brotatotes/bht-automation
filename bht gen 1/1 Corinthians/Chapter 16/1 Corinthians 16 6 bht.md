# 1 Corinthians 16:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the apostle Paul expresses his uncertainty regarding his future plans and destinations, as highlighted by various commentators. Though he could not be certain of where he would go and what calls he might have, he expresses a preference to stay with the Corinthians and even spend the winter with them. Paul's request for their aid and companionship on his journey reflects the customary practice of the apostles being accompanied by members of the churches.
