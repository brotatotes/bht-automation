# 1 Corinthians 2:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Bible verse describes the spiritual man, who possesses spiritual discernment and the ability to judge all things according to their true nature. This discernment is given by the Holy Spirit and allows the spiritual man to distinguish between truth and falsehood, to have insight into the mysteries of God, and to discern between the things of God and the things of the world. The spiritual man is not subject to the judgment of others who lack spiritual understanding and may not comprehend or appreciate his feelings, principles, and views.
