### Henry Alford:
1. "In order for an unassisted man, not gifted from Christ, to judge the πνευματικός, he must know the νοῦς κυρίου, the intent and disposition of Christ."
2. "But we (πνευματικοί, among whom he includes himself and the other Apostles) have the mind of Christ: the same mind, in our degree of apprehensiveness of it, by the imparting of His Spirit, which is in Him, and so can judge all things."
3. "The νοῦς κυρίου is the spiritual intent and designs of Christ."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The spiritual man 'is judged of no man.' In order to judge the spiritual man, the ordinary man must 'know the mind of the Lord.' But 'who of ordinary men knows' that?"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The faith of Christians does not stand in the wisdom of man. Every Christian has evidence in his own heart, in his experience, and in the transformation of his character, that none but God could have made the change on his soul."

3. "We have the mind of Christ, as applicable to believers universally... they are instructed as to his otherwise incomprehensible goodness."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Though none can penetrate Jehovah’s mind, yet since in Christ are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge, if we have the mind of Christ, we know all of 'the things of God' which a creature is permitted to know."
2. "The contrast here so sharply drawn between Divine and human wisdom is far-reaching, involving the great question of the rival claims of Reason and Revelation to be the supreme guide to the discovery of what man needs for the regulation of his life and the attainment of his highest bliss."
3. "So soon as 'God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, shines into our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ,' we enter the region and breathe the air, become alive to the interests, kindle with the sympathies, and taste the joys, of all that is spiritual, seeing everything in its true light."
