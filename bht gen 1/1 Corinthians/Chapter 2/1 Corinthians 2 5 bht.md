## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The Spirit is the original Creator of Faith, which cannot be begotten of human caprice."
2. "Man has the capability of hindering its production."
3. "Faith depends for its continuance on the same mighty Spirit, who is almost without intermission begetting it anew."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Stand in the wisdom of men" - This phrase suggests that relying solely on human wisdom can lead to a shallow and limited understanding of the truth. It implies that true wisdom comes from a higher source and should be sought after.

2. "Rest on it, owe its origin and continuance to it" - This quote emphasizes that human wisdom is not self-sustaining or eternal. It highlights the transient nature of human knowledge and the need for a deeper, more enduring wisdom.

3. "The wisdom of men" - This phrase underscores the contrast between human wisdom and divine wisdom. It implies that the wisdom of men is fallible and subject to human biases and limitations, while divine wisdom is perfect and transcendent.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "God intended to furnish you a firm and solid demonstration that the religion which you embraced was from Him; and this could not be if its preaching had been attended with the graces of eloquence, or the abstractions of refined metaphysical reasoning."
2. "The power of God would attend the exhibition of truth everywhere; and would be a demonstration that would be irresistible that the religion was not originated by man, but was from heaven."
3. "Every Christian has thus, in his own experience, furnished demonstration that the religion which he loves is from God, and not from man. Man could not subdue these sins; and man could not so entirely transform the soul."

4. "Faith requires to have so much certainty to go upon, that it will not fail, even when assailed by all the machinations of hell."
5. "Believers recognize the word which they hear as having come forth from God, from the effect of its influence."

### Archibald T Robertson:

3. "Faith in Christ, and in the doctrines of his Gospel, which comes by hearing, might not be attributed to the force of human eloquence and oratory; or stand upon so sandy a foundation, as that which might, if that was the case, be puffed away by a superior flow and force of words."

### John Wesley:
1. "Our faith should not be grounded in the limited wisdom and strength of human beings, but rather in the boundless wisdom and power of God."
