# 1 Corinthians 2:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse being described is a message of wisdom, not of this world, but of the highest kind. It is a wisdom that is understood and discerned by those who are mature in faith and have delved deep into the treasures of knowledge hidden in God's counsels. This wisdom goes beyond the mere intellect, surpassing the wisdom of the wise and the understanding of the rulers of this passing age. It is a wisdom that brings about the completion, perfection, and full apprehension of the believer in Christ.
