# 1 Corinthians 2:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
We speak the mysterious wisdom of God, concealed for ages until revealed, surpassing human intellect. Hidden even from believers, this divine wisdom is part of God's eternal plan, designed for our glory. It is a deep and profound truth that may appear as folly to the world, yet it illuminates the glory of our Lord and will be fully unveiled when all ephemeral glory fades away.
