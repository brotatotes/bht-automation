1. "The words are found in the apocryphal books of Elijah; and Origen and Jerome supposed that Paul quoted from those books. But it is evident that Paul had in his eye the passage in Isaiah; and intended to apply it to his present purpose."
2. "The object of the apostle is not to describe the future state of the redeemed. It is to prove that those who are Christians have true wisdom... They have views of that which the eyes of other people have not seen; a view of wisdom, and fitness, and beauty which can be found in no other plan."
3. "If there are such manifestations of wisdom in the plan here; if Christians see so much of its beauty here on earth; and if their views so far surpass all that the world sees and enjoys, how much greater and purer will be the manifestations of wisdom and goodness in the world of glory."
