# 1 Corinthians 3:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Bible verse describes how the Corinthians, though in Christ, were still lacking in spiritual maturity and understanding. Commentators highlight that the apostle Paul had to speak to them as if they were infants in Christ, unable to grasp deeper spiritual truths. They point out that the Corinthians were still influenced by worldly desires and divisions, preventing them from fully embracing the wisdom of God. Despite their gifts and conversion, they were considered "babes in Christ," in need of basic instruction and growth in their faith.

### John Calvin:
1. "He softens down, it is true, the harshness of his reproach by calling them brethren, but at the same time he brings it forward expressly as a matter of reproach against them, that their minds were suffocated with the darkness of the flesh to such a degree that it formed a hindrance to his preaching among them."
2. "He does not mean, however, that they were altogether carnal, so as to have not one spark of the Spirit of God — but that they had still greatly too much of carnal sense, so that the flesh prevailed over the Spirit, and did as it were drown out his light."
3. "Here, however, it is taken in a bad sense, as referring to the understanding. For we must be children in malice, but not in understanding, as he says afterwards in 1 Corinthians 14:20, — a distinction which removes all occasion of doubt as to the meaning."

2. "They were washed, sanctified, and justified, in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God; but had not that spiritual discerning, or judgment in spiritual things, which some believers had."
