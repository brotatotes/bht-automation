# 1 Corinthians 3:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, Paul discusses the work of different teachers in building upon the foundation of Jesus Christ. Some teachings are like gold, silver, and precious stones - valuable, solid, and enduring. Others are like wood, hay, and stubble - worthless and perishable. The materials used represent the doctrines and teachings of these teachers. It is important for the builders to establish a superstructure that corresponds to the precious foundation, avoiding mixing truth with error or human inventions. Ultimately, the quality of each teacher's work will be tested and the worthless will be destroyed while the faithful teachings will endure.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Though there can be but one foundation, there are many ways of building upon it."
2. "Gold, silver, &c., refer to the matter of the ministers' teaching, primarily; and by inference to those whom that teaching penetrates and builds up in Christ."
3. "The builder of the worthless and unsubstantial is in the end SAVED, so that even his preaching was preaching of Christ, and he himself was in earnest."

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "The 'gold, silver, precious stones,' which all can withstand fire, are teachings that will stand the fiery test of judgment."
2. "Wood, hay, stubble," are those teachings which cannot stand the test of judgment; they are mixed with human philosophy and Judaism, curious rather than useful.
3. "Where there is the least grain of real gold of faith, it shall never be lost."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The main discussion doubtless, has respect to the teachers of religion."
2. "There is an impropriety, an unfitness, in rearing the spiritual temple, to interweave truth with error; sound doctrine with false."
3. "The foundation may be well laid; yet on this foundation an edifice may be reared that shall be truly magnificent, or one that shall be mean and worthless."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "He speaks of the body of truth and doctrine which different teachers may erect on the one true foundation - Jesus Christ."
2. "These [contributions] are not intended to represent specific forms of truth or of error, but none of them are to be regarded as anti-Christian, which would be inconsistent with building on the true foundation."
3. "The whole structure will be brought to a final and decisive test at the day of judgment, when the true value of each teacher's work shall be manifested, and that which is worthless shall be destroyed."

### John Calvin:
1. "It would not have been enough to have laid the foundation if the entire superstructure did not correspond; for as it were an absurd thing to raise a structure of vile materials on a foundation of gold, so it were greatly criminal to bury Christ under a mass of strange doctrines." (177)

2. "By gold, then, and silver, and precious stones, he means doctrine worthy of Christ, and of such a nature as to be a superstructure corresponding to such a foundation." (177)

3. "For God will have his Church trained up by the pure preaching of his own word, not by the contrivances of men, of which sort also is that which has no tendency to edification." (178)

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The one set of materials as incombustible as they are valuable-represent those ministers of Christ whose teaching is sound and faithful." 
2. "The other as inflammable as they are inferior in value represent those whose teaching is the reverse of the former." 
3. "If so, then, those critics who led away by a different set of passages, in which believers themselves are viewed as stones of the spiritual temple understand the apostle to be treating of the admission of improper persons to Church privileges, misunderstand this passage."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "The durable materials are three (gold, silver, marble or precious stones), perishable materials (pieces of wood, hay, stubble), 'of a palace on the one hand, of a mud hut on the other' (Lightfoot)."
2. "Gold was freely used by the ancients in their palaces. Their marble and granite pillars are still the wonder and despair of modern men."
3. "The wooden huts had hay and stubble which were employed to hold the wood pieces together and to thatch the roof."
4. "It is not made clear whether Paul's metaphor refers to the persons as in God's building or to the character of the teaching. Probably both ideas are involved."
5. "The teaching may not always be vicious and harmful. It may only be indifferent and worthless. A co-worker with God in this great temple should put in his very best effort."

### John Gill:
1. "The different materials laid by one and the same man, on this foundation, or the different doctrines advanced upon it, are some of them comparable to gold, silver, precious stones; for their intrinsic worth and value; for the purity and sincerity of them; for their weight, importance, solidity, and substantiality."
2. "But empty, trifling, useless things are meant; such as fables, endless genealogies, human traditions, Jewish rites and ceremonies; which through the prejudice of education, and through ignorance and inadvertency, without any bad design, might by some be introduced into their ministry."
3. "Everything that may now be advanced in the Gospel ministry, not so honourable to the grace of God, or so becoming the person, blood, and righteousness of Christ, nor so consistent with the Spirit's work of grace, may be meant hereby."

### John Wesley:
1. "Gold, silver, costly stones - Three sorts of materials which will bear the fire; true and solid doctrines."
2. "Wood, hay, stubble - Three which will not bear the fire. Such are all doctrines, ceremonies, and forms of human invention."
3. "All but the substantial, vital truths of Christianity."
