# 1 Corinthians 3:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
On the great day of the Lord, the true nature of each person's work and doctrine will be brought to light and made known to all. This revelation will occur through the fire of tribulation and affliction, which serves as a metaphor for the testing and refining of the quality of our beliefs and actions. As the fire consumes what is wrong and inconsistent, it becomes clear that it is not a physical fire, but a symbolic representation of the judgment and purification that awaits us.
