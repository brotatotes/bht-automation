# 1 Corinthians 3:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Bible verse being described emphasizes the concept that believers will have their works tested by fire, and while they may suffer loss in terms of their earthly efforts, they will still be saved. Commentators note that the imagery of the verse centers around God's building and temple, indicating that the Lord's coming is depicted as a consuming fire testing the quality of believers' work. This testing will result in the destruction of anything that does not withstand the fire. The believers themselves will escape the fire, but with the loss of their work.

1. "If his doctrines have not been true; if he has had mistaken views of piety; if he has nourished feelings which he thought were those of religion; and inculcated practices which, however well meant, are not such as the gospel produces; if he has fallen into error of opinion, feeling, practice, however conscientious, yet he shall suffer loss." 

2. "He shall suffer loss - (1) He shall not be elevated to as high a rank and to as high happiness as he otherwise would... (2) He shall be injuriously affected by this forever. It shall be a detriment to him to all eternity."
