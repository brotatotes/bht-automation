This warning emphasizes the consequences of destroying the temple of God, either through defilement, false doctrines, or corrupt worship. Those who harm the spiritual unity and purity of the church will face divine punishment.

This serves as a reminder to uphold the sanctity and holiness of God's dwelling place within believers.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "φθείρει, [destroys, or] mars, whether as regards its unity and beauty, or its purity and sanctity: here, the meaning is left indefinite, but the latter particulars are certainly hinted at, by ἅγιος below."
2. "φθερεῖ, either by temporal death (Mey.), as in ch. 1 Corinthians 11:30; or by spiritual death, which is more probable, seeing that the figurative temple is spoken of, not (as Mey.) the material temple: and as temporal death was the punishment for defiling the material temple (Exodus 28:43. Lev 16:2 al. fr.), so spiritual death for marring or defiling of God’s spiritual temple."
3. "οἵτινες, i.e. ἅγιοι, not, 'which temple are ye,' which would be tautological after 1 Corinthians 3:16, and would hardly be expressed by οἵτινες, 'ut qui,' or 'quales.' Meyer well remarks, that οἵτινές ἐστε ὑμεῖς is the minor proposition of a syllogism: 'Whoever mars the temple of God, him will God destroy, because His temple is holy; but ye also, as His ideal temple, are holy: therefore, whoever mars you, shall be destroyed by God.'"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "God repays in kind by a righteous retaliation. The destroyer shall himself be destroyed."
2. "The destroyers here are distinct from the unwise or unskilful builders. The latter held fast the foundation and, therefore, though they lose their work of superstructure and the special reward, yet they are themselves saved."
3. "Any Christian who violates the sanctity of the spiritual temple shall perish eternally."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "If any man 'destroy' the temple of God, God shall 'destroy' him." 
2. "If any man by his doctrines or precepts shall pursue such a course as tends to destroy the church, God shall severely punish him."
3. "The temple of God is to be regarded as sacred and inviolable."
4. "This proves that though Paul regarded them as lamentably corrupt in some respects, he still regarded them as a true church - as a part of the holy temple of God."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Defile [φθειρει] . Rev., more correctly, destroy. This is the primary and almost universal meaning in classical Greek."
2. "The phrase seems to be used here according to the Jewish idea that the temple was destroyed or corrupted by the slightest defilement or damage, or by neglect on the part of its guardians."
3. "The double relative which refers to the epithet holy; 'of which holy character or class ye are.'"

### John Calvin:
1. "The temple of God ought to be inviolably sacred."
2. "The kind of profanation...is when men intrude themselves, so as to bear rule in the Church in the place of God."
3. "As soon as we are tinctured with the contrivances of men, the temple of God is polluted."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "It is a terrible thing to tear down ruthlessly a church or temple of God like an earthquake that shatters a building in ruins."
2. "The church-wrecker God will wreck. What does Paul mean by 'will destroy'? Does he mean punishment here or hereafter? May it not be both?"
3. "The Corinthians themselves in their angry disputes had forgotten their holy heritage and calling, though this failing was no excuse for the ringleaders who had led them on."

### John Gill:
1. "By bringing in false doctrines, errors, and heresies, and hereby corrupt their minds from the simplicity that is in Christ."
2. "The false prophet, as well as the beast, and the devil, shall be cast into the lake of fire and brimstone."
3. "God is not only an avenger of all immoralities committed against his righteous law, but of all false doctrine and false worship, and of everything that is contrary to the Gospel, and to the order and ordinances of it."

### John Wesley:
1. "Destroy a real Christian, by schisms, or doctrines fundamentally wrong."
