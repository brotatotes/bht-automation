# 1 Corinthians 3:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we are reminded that God sees through the pride and self-reliance of the worldly wise, exposing their futile reasoning and empty thoughts. Their reliance on human intellect and knowledge is ultimately in vain, as true wisdom comes from God alone. No matter how clever and knowledgeable we may perceive ourselves to be, our thoughts and plans are meaningless in comparison to the infinite wisdom of God. It serves as a powerful reminder that those who reject God and rely on their own understanding are left in a state of emptiness and futility.
