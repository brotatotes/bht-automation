# 1 Corinthians 3:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As believers, we belong to Christ, being His property, His subjects, and His members. This relationship signifies our identity and intimate connection with Him. Christ, in turn, refers all His services to the glory of God the Father. It is a beautiful exchange, where we find our true felicity in being united to the chief good, God Himself. In this profound union, our weaknesses, griefs, and sins find their redemption and restoration through Christ's blood and grace.
