## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:

2. "According to the manner of (unrenewed and ungodly) man, = κατὰ σάρκα." 
3. "Putting the assumption in a local form."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Envying had produced strife, and strife divisions (factious parties)." 
2. "For 'strife' is a 'work of the flesh'... The 'flesh' includes all feelings that aim not at the glory of God, and the good of our neighbor, but at gratifying self."
3. "Walk as men - as unregenerate men... 'After the flesh, not after the Spirit' of God, as becomes you as regenerate by the Spirit."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Your divisions and strifes show that you are yet, in some degree, under the influence of the principles which govern the people of this world."
2. "Envy everywhere is a fruitful cause of strife. Most contentions in the church are somehow usually connected with envy."
3. "Instead of being filled with love; of being united and harmonious as the members of the same family ought to be, you are split up into factions as the people of the world are."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Carnal [σαρκικοι] . Here the milder word is used (see ver. 1), having the nature of flesh." 

2. "In ver. 1, Paul would say that he was compelled to address the Corinthians as unspiritual, made of flesh." 

3. "Here he says that though they have received the Spirit in some measure, they are yet under the influence of the flesh."

### John Calvin:
1. "So long as the flesh, that is to say, natural corruption, prevails in a man, it has so completely possession of the man’s mind, that the wisdom of God finds no admittance."
2. "If we would make proficiency in the Lord’s school, we must first of all renounce our own judgment and our own will."
3. "For while they were desirous to be regarded as spiritual, he calls them to look at their works, by which they denied what with their mouth they professed."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Jealousy and strife are destructive forces that can divide a community. In this verse, Paul highlights the presence of jealousy among the Corinthians, as they align themselves with their favorite preachers. This reminds us that our loyalty should be to Christ, not to any human leader." 

2. "The absence of unity and the presence of jealousy and strife indicate a lack of spiritual maturity. Paul challenges the Corinthians by asking if they are not acting like 'unrenewed men.' This serves as a reminder that as believers, we are called to walk in the Spirit and not in the flesh." 

3. "The mention of jealousy and strife in this verse serves as a warning against the dangers of division within the church. It reminds us of the importance of unity and the need to focus on the message of Christ rather than personal preferences or allegiances."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Paul by ψυχικος describes the unregenerate man, by πνευματικος the regenerate man. Both classes are σαρκινο made in flesh, and both may be σαρκικο though the πνευματικο should not be."
2. "The πνευματικο who continue to be σαρκινο are still babes (νηπιο), not adults (τελειο), while those who are still σαρκικο (carnal) have given way to the flesh as if they were still ψυχικο (unregenerate)."
3. "Jealousy (ζηλος) is not necessarily evil, but good if under control. It may be not according to knowledge and easily becomes jealousy as zeal. Ardour may be like the jealousy of God or the envy of men. Ερις is an old word, but used only by Paul in N.T. Wrangling follows jealousy."

### John Gill:
1. "They envied each other's gifts and knowledge, strove about words to no profit, entered into warm debates and contentions about their ministers, and went into factions and parties, which were distinguished by the names they were most affected to; in all which they gave too clear evidence of their prevailing carnality."
2. "They too much walked as other men, who make no profession of religion; that they were led by the judgment of men, and were carried away with human passions and inflections."
3. "In their conduct, they could scarcely be distinguished from the rest of the world."

### John Wesley:
1. "Emulation in your hearts, strife in your words, and actual divisions" - These actions indicate a lack of spiritual maturity and a focus on worldly desires and ambitions.
2. "Are ye not carnal" - The presence of these divisions and conflicts reveals a carnal mindset, driven by selfishness and self-interest rather than the love and unity that should characterize believers.
3. "Walk according to men" - This phrase emphasizes the contrast between living according to worldly standards and living as true followers of Christ, guided by His teachings and example.
