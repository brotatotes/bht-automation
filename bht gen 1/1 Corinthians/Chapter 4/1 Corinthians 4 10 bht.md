# 1 Corinthians 4:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, there is a stark contrast between the perceived wisdom of the world and the "foolishness" of those who follow Christ. The believers, including the apostles, are viewed as "fools" by the world for their unwavering commitment to Christ and preaching of the Gospel. On the other hand, the non-believers pride themselves in their worldly wisdom and status. The verse highlights the irony and paradoxical nature of the Christian faith, where strength is found in weakness and wisdom is found in surrendering to Christ.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "We are foolish for Christ’s sake (on account of Christ, our connexion with Him does nothing but reduce us to be fools), whereas you are φρόνιμοι ἐν χριστῷ, have entered into full participation of Him, and grown up to be wise, subtle Christians."
2. "ἀσθενεῖς ἰσχυροί are both to be understood generally: the ἀσθένεια is not here that of persecution, but that of ch. 1 Corinthians 2:3; the strength is the high bearing of the Corinthians."
3. "Ye are in honour (in glorious repute, party leaders and party men, highly honoured and looked up to), whereas we are despised (without honour). Then ἄτιμοι leads him to enlarge on the disgrace and contempt which the Apostle met with at the hands of the world."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "How much your lot (supposing it real) is to be envied, and ours to be pitied."
2. "Our connection with Christ only entails on us the lowest ignominy, 'ON ACCOUNT OF,' or 'FOR THE SAKE OF' Him, as 'fools'; yours gives you full fellowship IN Him as 'wise'."
3. "We . . . weak . . . ye . . . strong— (1 Corinthians 2:3; 2 Corinthians 13:9)."

1. "We, Paul, Apollos, and Barnabas, have no claims to the character of wise men - we are to be regarded as fools, unworthy of confidence, and unfit to instruct; but you are full of wisdom."
2. "You, Corinthians, boast of your wisdom and prudence. You are to be esteemed very wise. You are unwilling to submit to be esteemed fools. You are proud of your attainments."
3. "We are timid and feeble, but you are daring, bold and fearless. This is irony. The very reverse was probably true. Paul was bold, daring, fearless in declaring the truth, whatever opposition it might encounter."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "We apostles are fools in the world's eyes on account of Christ, because we know and preach nothing but Christ." 
2. "You are wise in Christ, as Christians, making your Christianity a means to your worldly greatness - union with Christ the basis of worldly wisdom."

### John Calvin:
1. "You desire, along with the gospel, to retain commendation for wisdom, whereas I have not been able to preach Christ otherwise than by becoming a fool in this world."
2. "How in these things consort — that I who have been your master, am a fool for Christ’s sake, and you, on the other hand, remain wise!"
3. "In fine, he derides their vanity in this respect, that, reversing the order of things, those who were sons and followers were desirous to be esteemed honorable and noble, while their father was in obscurity, and was exposed also to all the reproaches of the world."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "We are fools for Christ's sake, but ye are wise in Christ" - This verse highlights the irony of the situation, where those who follow Christ may be seen as foolish by the world, while those who do not believe may consider themselves wise. It challenges the conventional wisdom and societal norms, emphasizing the different perspectives and values of believers and non-believers.

2. "How enviable your lot, how pitiable ours!" - This phrase captures the stark contrast between the perceived advantages of the non-believers and the hardships faced by the believers. It reflects the paradoxical nature of the Christian faith, where the world may view believers as unfortunate or pitiable, but in reality, they possess a deeper sense of purpose and fulfillment.

3. "We weak, ye strong; ye have glory, we dishonour" - This statement further emphasizes the dichotomy between the worldly perception of strength and honor versus the humility and sacrifice embraced by followers of Christ. It highlights the willingness of believers to endure hardships and persecution for the sake of their faith, even if it means being considered weak or dishonored by society.

2. "Their ministers took care to preach, and they to profess Christ, in such a manner as to retain the favor of the world, and to escape reproach and persecution."

1. "We are fools, in the account of the world, for Christ's sake, but ye are wise in Christ."
