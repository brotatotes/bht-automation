## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "ὡς μὴ ἐρχομένου forms one idea" - The phrase "ὡς μὴ ἐρχομένου" should be understood as a single concept or assumption in their minds.

2. "the δέ is in consequence placed after it all" - The placement of the word "δέ" after the phrase emphasizes the connection or consequence of the assumption.

3. "ὡς expresses the assumption in their minds" - The word "ὡς" is used to convey the assumption or belief held by the individuals mentioned.

2. "Their conduct was an instance of the haughtiness and arrogance which people will assume when they suppose they are in no danger of reproof or punishment."
3. "Probably he had been detained by the demand on his services in other places, and by various providential hinderances from going there, until they supposed that he stayed away from fear."

3. "Wicked men...never come forward ingenuously to an equal combat, but on the contrary, by sinister artifices they discover their want of confidence."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The phrase 'puffed up' implies a sense of arrogance and self-importance. It reveals a lack of humility and a false sense of security." 
2. "The fear of showing oneself suggests that these individuals were not confident in their actions and were seeking validation from others." 
3. "This verse serves as a reminder that true spiritual growth is not measured by outward appearances or the opinions of others, but by a genuine transformation of the heart."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Some are puffed up." - This phrase highlights the presence of pride and arrogance among certain individuals. It suggests that these individuals have an inflated sense of self-importance, which can hinder their ability to receive correction or guidance. 

2. "As though I were not coming to you." - This statement implies that the Corinthians may have been acting as if Paul's visit to them would never happen or that his presence would not make a difference. It emphasizes the need for them to recognize and acknowledge the authority and influence that Paul carries as an apostle. 

3. "Genitive absolute with particle (assuming it as so) with μη as negative." - This technical explanation highlights the grammatical structure of the phrase. It suggests that the genitive absolute construction, combined with the negative particle μη, serves to emphasize the certainty or inevitability of Paul's arrival. It reinforces the idea that the Corinthians cannot dismiss or ignore Paul's impending visit.

1. "Some are puffed up with their gifts, learning, and eloquence, believing they should continue undisturbed."
