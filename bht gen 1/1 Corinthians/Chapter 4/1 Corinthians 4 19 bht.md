## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "ἐλεύσομαι is prefixed, for emphasis, being the matter in doubt: as we say, ‘Come I will.’"
2. "ταχέως] How soon, see ch. 1 Corinthians 16:8."
3. "γνώσομαι] I will inform myself of not the words of those who are puffed up (those I care not for), but their power: whether they are really mighty in the Spirit, or not."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "But come I will" - an emphatical negation of their supposition (1 Corinthians 4:18).
2. "If the Lord will" - a wise proviso (James 4:15). He does not seem to have been able to go as soon as he intended.
3. "But the power" - I care not for their high-sounding "speech," "but" what I desire to know is "their power," whether they be really powerful in the Spirit, or not. The predominant feature of Grecian character, a love for power of discourse, rather than that of godliness, showed itself at Corinth.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "But I will come - It is from no fear of them that I am kept away; and to convince them of this I will come to them speedily."
2. "No purpose should be formed without a reference to his will; no plan without feeling that he can easily frustrate it and disappoint us."
3. "I will put their power to the proof: I will see whether they are able to effect what they affirm; whether they have more real power than I have."

### John Calvin:
1. "They are in a mistake, in raising their crests during my absence, as though this were to be of long duration, for they shall in a short time perceive how vain their confidence has been."
2. "He has it not, however, so much in view to terrify them, as though he would on his arrival thunder forth against them, but rather presses and bears down upon their consciences, for, however they might disguise it, they were aware that he was furnished with divine influence."
3. "If they wish to have any honor from me, they must bring forward that power which distinguishes the true servants of Christ from the merely pretended: otherwise I shall despise them, with all their show."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "But I will come to you shortly, if the Lord will" - This shows the humility of the author, acknowledging that his plans are subject to the will of a higher power.
2. "He had found already that his own plans were liable to be overruled by the plans of a Higher than he" - This highlights the author's recognition of divine sovereignty and his desire to be in alignment with God's will.
3. "I will know, not the word of them which are puffed up, but the power" - This emphasizes the importance of discerning true spiritual power rather than being swayed by empty words or arrogant displays.

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "If the Lord will (εαν ο κυριος θεληση). Third-class condition. It should represent one's constant attitude, though not always to be spoken aloud." 
2. "He will come and will know their real strength. II Corinthians gives many evidences of Paul's sensitiveness to their talk about his inconsistencies and cowardice."
3. "It will become plain later that Timothy failed on this mission and that Titus succeeded."

### John Gill:
1. "This he said as threatening them, but not by way of prophecy; for it is not certain that he ever did come to them after this; but by way of promise, as it was then the real intention, inclination, and resolution of his mind."
2. "Though it is not absolutely necessary that this should be expressed by us always in so many words; though should it, as the sentence is short and full, there would be no impropriety in it; yet this should always be the sense of our minds and conduct in all the affairs of life."
3. "His concern would be, not so much to observe their masterly language, the eloquence of their speech, the quaintness of their expressions, the cadency of their words, how nicely they were put together, and how fitly pronounced; but what life there was in their ministry, what power went forth with their words, and how effectual their preaching was to the conversion of sinners, and the edifying of the church of God."

### John Wesley:
1. "He here shows his fatherly authority."
2. "Not the big, empty speech of these vain boasters."
3. "But how much of the power of God attends them."
