2. "I do not judge even myself."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "It amounts to a very small matter" - The commentary highlights the insignificance of human judgment compared to God's judgment. It emphasizes that the opinion of man is of little importance in the grand scheme of things.

2. "The day of man" - The commentary introduces the concept of "man's day" as a contrast to the day of the Lord. It suggests that all days prior to the day of the Lord are considered as man's days, further emphasizing the temporary nature of human judgment.

3. "He that has the right, and is able to judge on my case" - The commentary points out that the ultimate judge is the Lord Himself. It highlights the humility of the author, who does not assume the right to judge or approve himself, but instead acknowledges that it is the Lord who has the authority to pass judgment.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Since I am responsible as a steward to my master only, it is a matter of small concern what men think of me, provided I have his approbation."
2. "Whatever might be their rank, character, talent, or learning, he regarded it as a matter of the least possible consequence what they thought of him."
3. "God only is the infallible judge; and as we and our fellow-men are liable to be biased in our opinions, from envy, ignorance, or self-love, we should regard the judgment of the world as of little value."

### John Calvin:

2. "If, then, the Lord’s servants would bear in mind that they must act in this manner, let them allow their doctrine and life to be brought to the test, nay more, let them voluntarily present themselves for this purpose."
3. "It belongs to God alone to determine what distinction every one holds, and what honor he deserves."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Our gospel is veiled only to those who are perishing, to those who are not willing to come to Christ that they may be saved." This highlights the idea that the Gospel is not hidden from everyone, but only from those who reject it and choose not to believe in Christ.

2. "The veiling of the gospel is a result of the hardened hearts and unwillingness of individuals to accept the truth." This emphasizes that the veil is not placed by God, but by the choices and attitudes of those who refuse to accept the message of salvation.

3. "Those who are perishing are blind to the truth of the gospel because they have closed their hearts and minds to it." This suggests that the veil is not a physical barrier, but a spiritual one that prevents individuals from understanding and accepting the good news of Jesus Christ.

"I have often wondered how it is that every man sets less value on his own opinion of himself than on the opinion of others." - This quote, taken from Marcus Aurelius, reflects Paul's humility and his refusal to judge himself, emphasizing the importance of seeking validation from God rather than from human judgment.

### John Gill:
1. "It stood for little or nothing, was of no account with him, what judgment and censures were passed on him by men with regard to his faithfulness in the ministry."
2. "He made no account of theirs, and slighted it as being under bad influence, the influence of the false teachers."
3. "He cared not what any man thought or said, or judged of him; he not only was indifferent to the judgment of the Corinthians concerning him, whether they did or did not praise him, but of any other person."
