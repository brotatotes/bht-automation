## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "So then (because the Lord is the sole infallible dijudicator) decide nothing (concerning us, of merit or demerit) before the time, until the Lord shall have come."
2. "He shall bring to light the hidden things of darkness, all things which are hidden in darkness."
3. "He shall make manifest the counsels of the hearts, then first shewing, what your teachers really are, in heart."
4. "Then shall the fitting praise accrue to each from God."

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Therefore—as the Lord is the sole Decider or Dijudicator."
2. "Here all judgments in general are forbidden, which would, on our part, presumptuously forestall God's prerogative of final judgment."
3. "Our judgments now (as those of the Corinthians respecting their teachers) are necessarily defective; as we only see the outward act, we cannot see the motives of 'hearts'."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Judge nothing - Pass no decided opinion; see the note at Matthew 7:1. The apostle here takes occasion to inculcate on them an important lesson - one of the leading lessons of Christianity - not to pass a harsh opinion on the conduct of any man, since there are so many things that go to make up his character which we cannot know; and so many secret failings and motives which are all concealed from us."

2. "The hidden things of darkness - The secret things of the heart which have been hidden as it were in darkness. The subsequent clause shows that this is the sense. He does not refer to the deeds of night, or those things which were performed in the secret places of idolatry, but to the secret designs of the heart; and perhaps means gently to insinuate that there were many things about the character and feelings of his enemies which would not well bear the revelations of that Day."

3. "And then shall every man have praise of God - The word here rendered 'praise' ἔπαινος epainos denotes in this place reward, or that which is due to him; the just sentence which ought to be pronounced on his character. It does not mean as our translation would imply, that every man will then receive the divine approbation which will not be true; but that every man shall receive what is due to his character, whether good or evil."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The Lord is the only competent examiner therefore do not judge until He comes to judgment."
2. "Even I myself am not competent to institute a conclusive examination, for the absence of condemnation from my conscience does not absolutely acquit me."
3. "The change of the verb favors the rendering examine for ajnakrinw."

### John Calvin:
1. "Paul did not mean to reprove every kind of judgment without exception, but only what is hasty and rash, without examination of the case."
2. "Let us know, then, how much is allowed us, what is now within the sphere of our knowledge, and what is deferred until the day of Christ, and let us not attempt to go beyond these limits."
3. "It is because there are wonderful recesses and deepest lurking-places in the hearts of men. Hence, until the thoughts of the hearts are brought to light, there will always be darkness."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Wherefore judge nothing before the time, until the Lord come." - This verse reminds us to withhold judgment and wait for the Lord's final judgment, which will reveal the true intentions of people's hearts (Ecclesiastes 12:14; Romans 2:16).
2. "Make manifest the counsels of the hearts." - The Lord's judgment will bring to light the hidden motives and intentions of our hearts, exposing the true nature of our actions.
3. "Each man shall have his praise from God according to his fidelity." - God's praise and reward will be based on our faithfulness to Him. The Judge Himself will commend those who have been faithful in their service to Him.

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Stop passing judgment, stop criticizing as they were doing." 
2. "Do not therefore anticipate the great judgment by any preliminary investigation which must be futile and incomplete." 
3. "By turning on the light the counsels of all hearts stand revealed."

### John Gill:
1. "Be slow in judgment" - This Jewish maxim reminds us to refrain from hasty and rash judgments, urging us to leave matters to the ultimate day of judgment.
2. "Hidden things of darkness" - Referring to the secret methods and deceitful practices employed by false teachers to further their own selfish agendas, these hidden things will be exposed and brought to light by the Lord.
3. "Every man have praise of God" - On the day of judgment, those who have faithfully served God and His people will receive praise and commendation from Him, regardless of the criticism and disregard they may have faced from others.

### John Wesley:
1. "Until the Lord come, who, in order to pass a righteous judgment, which otherwise would be impossible, will both bring to light the things which are now covered with impenetrable darkness." 
2. "Manifest the most secret springs of action, the principles and intentions of every heart."
3. "And then shall every one, every faithful steward, have praise of God."
