# 1 Corinthians 4:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the Apostle Paul uses the names of himself, Apollos, and Cephas as examples to caution against attaching oneself to party leaders and becoming proud of one's chosen leader. He wants the Corinthians to learn from him and his fellow ministers not to go beyond what is written in Scripture. Paul also warns against pride and the tendency to elevate one minister above another. The emphasis is on focusing on the principles found in the Word of God rather than on the personalities of human leaders.

1. "Paul's use of the word (in Paul only in N.T.) appears also further in 2 Corinthians 11:13-15 where the word occurs three times, twice of the false apostles posing and passing as apostles of Christ and ministers of righteousness, and once of Satan as an angel of light."

### John Gill:

"That no one of you be puffed up for one against the other; speak great swelling words of vanity, and envy, for one minister against another; when they are all one, bear the same character, are in the same office, and are jointly concerned in the same common cause of Christ and the good of immortal souls."

### John Wesley:

2. "That ye may learn by us — From what has been said concerning us, who, however eminent we are, are mere instruments in God's hand." 
3. "Not to think of any man above what is here written - Or above what scripture warrants."
