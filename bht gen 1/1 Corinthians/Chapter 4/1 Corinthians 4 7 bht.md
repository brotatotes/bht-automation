# 1 Corinthians 4:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This verse reminds us that every difference among individuals, whether in gifts, graces, or circumstances, is ultimately attributed to God. It humbles us by showing that any superiority we may perceive in ourselves is unfounded, and instead directs our focus to the ways in which we can mutually support and benefit one another within the Church. The verse also underscores the importance of recognizing that all good things, both natural and spiritual, originate from God and should not be a source of self-congratulation or boasting.

[1] "The allusion may be, as has been suggested, to the practice of depositing treasure in vessels of earthenware." 

[2] "This verse reminds us that the true value of the Gospel is not found in the vessel itself, but in the treasure it contains." 

[3] "Just as earthenware vessels are fragile and easily broken, so are we as humans. But God chooses to place His precious treasure, the Gospel, in us, flawed vessels, to display His power and glory."

1. "Whatever difference is made among men, is of God; it is he that makes them to differ from the rest of the creation; from angels, to whom they are inferior; and from beasts, to whom they are superior; and from one another in their person, size, shape, and countenance, which is a physical, or natural difference."
2. "The grand distinction God has made among men, lies in his special, distinguishing, and everlasting love to some, and not others; in his choice of them in Christ unto everlasting salvation; in the gift of them to Christ in the eternal covenant; in the redemption of them by his blood; in his powerful and prevalent intercession for them; in God's effectual calling of them by his grace."
3. "To glory in any mercy, favour, or blessing received from God, as if it was not received from him, but as owing to human power, care, and industry, betrays wretched vanity, stupid and more than brutish ignorance, horrid ingratitude, abominable pride and wickedness; and is contrary to the grace of God, which teaches men humility and thankfulness."
