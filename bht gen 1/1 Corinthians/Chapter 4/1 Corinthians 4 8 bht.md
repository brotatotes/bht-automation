# 1 Corinthians 4:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse being described showcases the Corinthians' misguided self-sufficiency and arrogance in thinking they have already reached the pinnacle of spiritual growth. Commentators emphasize that the Corinthians' complacency and arrogance contrast with the self-denying and laborious nature of the apostles. These false teachers revel in their spiritual riches and disdain the influence and guidance of others. However, the commentators express a desire for the Corinthians to truly attain the height of holiness and invite them to share in the joy and fulfillment of the kingdom alongside their spiritual fathers and guides.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The design is to contrast them with the apostles; to show how self-confident and vain the false teachers were, and how laborious and self-denying the apostles were; and to show to them how little claim they had to authority in the church, and the real claim which the apostles had from their self-denials and labors."
