# 1 Corinthians 4:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Bible verse under examination depicts the apostles as being set forth by God as a spectacle for the world, angels, and men. The apostles are portrayed as being last and despised, doomed to a life of suffering and persecution. Their lives and ministry, like a theatrical performance, exhibit the sacrificial nature of their calling, their steadfastness in the face of adversity, and the interconnectedness of all beings in the spiritual realm. This portrayal serves to expose the hostility towards the truth and the indifference of the Corinthians towards the struggles endured by their teachers.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "For (and there is abundant reason for this wish in our present afflicted state) I think, God set forth (before the eyes of the world, the similitude is in θέατρον following) us the Apostles."
2. "us who were last called to be Apostles, q. d. τοὺς ἀπ . τοὺς ἐσχ ., or τοὺς ἐσχ . ἀποστ ., is ungrammatical."
3. "ἐσχάτους, last and vilest: not, ‘respectu priorum,’ last, as the prophets were before us, as Corn.-a-lap., and in part, Bengel."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Paul, in contrast, 'thinks' that God has sent forth him and his fellow ministers 'last,' that is, the lowest in this world."
2. "Criminals 'condemned to die,' in Paul's time, were exhibited as a gazing-stock to amuse the populace in the amphitheater."
3. "Paul tacitly implies that though 'last' and lowest in the world's judgment, Christ's servants are deemed by angels a spectacle worthy of their most intense regard."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Whatever might be their condition, Paul says that the condition of himself and his fellow-laborers was one of much contempt and suffering; and the inference seems to be, that they ought to doubt whether they were in a right state, or had any occasion for their self-congratulation, since they so little resembled those whom God had set forth."

2. "Paul may mean to refer to the custom of bringing forth those in the amphitheater at the conclusion of the spectacles who were to fight with other men, and who had no chance of escape. These inhuman games abounded everywhere; and an allusion to them would be well understood, and is indeed often made by Paul."

3. "Paul represents himself as on this arena or stage, contending with foes, and destined to death. Around him and above him are an immense host of human beings and angels, looking on at the conflict, and awaiting the issue. He is not alone or unobserved. He is made public; and the universe gazes on the struggle."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Exhibiting. Last. Doomed. Spectacle. Unto the world." - These words highlight the contrasting position of the Corinthians and their teachers, who are portrayed as being at the lowest and most despised state, while the Corinthians are self-satisfied and elevated.
2. "The contrast of the selfish Corinthians sitting by unconcerned and unmoved by the awful spectacle." - This quote emphasizes the Corinthians' lack of empathy and indifference towards the suffering and struggles of their teachers, further highlighting their inflated self-satisfaction.
3. "The spiritual oneness of the universe is a conception eminently characteristic of St. Paul." - This quote sheds light on Paul's belief in the interconnectedness of all beings, both physical and spiritual, and how this belief shapes his understanding of the world and its inhabitants.

### John Calvin:
1. "For there can be no doubt that by the term last, he means those who were admitted to the rank of apostles subsequently to the resurrection of Christ."
2. "Observe here the admirable steadfastness of Paul, who, while he saw himself to be dealt with by God in this manner, was nevertheless not broken or dispirited."
3. "He simply means, that the Lord has so ordered his lot that he seems as though he had been appointed to furnish sport to the whole world."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "God hath set forth us the apostles last of all, as men doomed to death." - This verse highlights the sacrificial nature of the apostles' calling, as they were willing to face persecution and even death for the sake of spreading the truth of the Gospel.
2. "A spectacle (to be gazed on as in a theatre) unto the world, and to angels, and to men." - The apostles' lives and ministry were not hidden or private, but rather a public display for all to see. They were like actors on a stage, with the world, angels, and men as their audience.
3. "To exhibit men’s enmity to the truth." - The apostles' role was not only to proclaim the truth, but also to expose the hostility and opposition that many people have towards it. Their lives and preaching served as a testimony to the resistance and rejection faced by those who stand for the truth.

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "The first aorist active indicative of αποδεικνυμ, old verb to show, to expose to view or exhibit (Herodotus), in technical sense (cf. 2 Thessalonians 2:4) for gladiatorial show as in εθηριομαχησα (1 Corinthians 15:32)."

2. "As men doomed to die (ως επιθανατιους). Late word, here alone in N.T. The LXX (Bel and the Dragon 31) has it for those thrown daily to the lions. Dionysius of Halicarnassus (A.R. vii. 35) uses it of those thrown from the Tarpeian Rock."

3. "A spectacle (θεατρον). Cf. Hebrews 11:33-40. The word, like our theatre, means the place of the show (Acts 19:29; Acts 19:31). Then, it means the spectacle shown there (θεαμα or θεα), and, as here, the man exhibited as the show like the verb θεατριζομενο, made a spectacle (Hebrews 10:33)."

### John Gill:
1. "And as it were appointed to death; were continually exposed unto it; were in death oft, always carrying about with them the dying of the Lord Jesus; and were all the day long killed for his sake; all which the apostle not only thought, but believed, were not casual things, fortuitous events, but the determinations and appointments of God; and were brought about in his wise providence to answer some valuable ends, which made him the more easy under them, and reconciled unto them."

2. "The word translated 'spectacle' signifies a 'theatre'; and the allusion is to the Roman theatres, in which various exercises were performed, for the gratification of the numerous spectators, who were placed around in a proper distance to behold; and not so much to the gladiators who fought, in such places, for the diversion of the multitude, as to those unhappy persons who were cast to the wild beasts, let loose upon them to devour them; which horrid barbarities were beheld by the surrounding company with great pleasure and satisfaction."

3. "Such a spectacle were the apostles in their sufferings and persecutions to the 'whole' world, distinguished into 'angels' and 'men'. By 'angels' may be meant the devils, who stirred up the princes of this world against the apostles, to persecute and afflict them; than which nothing was a greater pleasure to these envious and malicious spirits: though good angels may be also included, as witnesses of the faith, courage, and constancy of the saints, and as comforters of them in all their tribulations; but evil angels seem chiefly designed: and by 'men' are meant wicked men, who are as much pleased to behold the barbarities and butcheries committed upon the people of God, as the Romans in their theatres were to see the tragical scenes that were acted there."

### John Wesley:
1. "God hath set forth us last, as appointed to death" - Alluding to the Roman custom of bringing forth those persons last on the stage, either to fight with each other, or with wild beasts, who were devoted to death; so that, if they escaped one day, they were brought out again and again, till they were killed.

2. "The apostles were exposed to the greatest dangers and sufferings, and were treated as the refuse of the world, the offscouring of all things." 

3. "The apostles were not only exposed to the contempt and hatred of men, but were also made a spectacle to angels, who beheld with wonder and admiration the fortitude and constancy with which they endured sufferings and death for the sake of Christ."
