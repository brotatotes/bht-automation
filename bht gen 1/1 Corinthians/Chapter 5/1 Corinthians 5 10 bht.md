## BHT:
In this Bible verse, the commentator's descriptions help us understand the context and meaning more clearly. The verse warns against close association with fornicators, idolaters, covetous individuals, and extortioners. While this does not mean completely isolating from the world, it cautions against intimate companionship with those who continue to live in sin, both inside and outside the church. The commentators emphasize the need for discernment and wisdom in maintaining appropriate relationships while avoiding the corrupting influence of wickedness.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "οὐ πάντως limits the prohibition, which perhaps had been complained of owing to its strictness, and excepts the fornicators of this world, i.e. who are not professing Christians."
2. "οὐ, not μή, because not the whole context of the prohibition is negatived, but only one portion of it."
3. "The root of the two sins being the same, viz. lust or greed, they come often to be mentioned together and as if running into one another."

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "As in dissolute Corinth to 'company with no fornicators,' c., would be almost to company with none in the (unbelieving) world." 
2. "Ye need not utterly ('altogether') forego intercourse with fornicators, c., of the unbelieving world." 
3. "The attempt to get 'out of the world,' in violation of God's will that believers should remain in it but keep themselves from its evil, led to monasticism and its consequent evils."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "You should not so associate with them as to be esteemed to belong to them, or so as to be corrupted by their example."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Idolaters [ειδωλολατραις]. Only twice outside of Paul's writings: Revelation 21:8; Revelation 22:15. This is the earliest known instance of the use of the word." 
2. "For the collocation of the covetous and idolaters, compare Colossians 3:15; Ephesians 5:5." 
3. "New-Testament usage does not confine the term to the worship of images, but extends it to the soul's devotion to any object which usurps the place of God."

1. "You must rather die." - Ambrose emphasizes the seriousness of the command to separate from fornicators, suggesting that it is a matter of life and death.

2. "We must live among thorns so long as we sojourn on earth." - Chrysostom highlights the reality that Christians will always encounter wickedness in the world, but the command is to avoid associating with those who claim to be Christians but live in sin.

3. "The whole world lieth in the wicked one." - This quote from 1 John 5:19 reinforces the idea that the world is under the influence of evil, further supporting the need for believers to separate from the society of the wicked.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Observe the caution 'not altogether' restricting the allowed intercourse with them to what was necessary and safe." 
2. "The collocation of 'the covetous and extortioners' with 'fornicators and idolaters' sounds strange to us; but it is a favourite classification with our apostle."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Paul thus puts a limitation on his prohibition and confines it to members of the church."
2. "The covetous...always comes in bad company (the licentious and the idolaters) like the modern gangsters who form a combination of liquor, lewdness, lawlessness for money and power."
3. "Bandits, hijackers, grafters they would be called today."
4. "This neat Greek idiom of επε with the imperfect indicative...is really the conclusion of a second-class condition with the condition unexpressed."
5. "The unexpressed condition here would be, 'if that were true' (including fornicators, the covetous, extortioners, idolaters of the outside world)."

### John Gill:
1. "By 'the fornicators of this world' are meant, such as were guilty of this sin, who were the men of the world, mere worldly carnal men, who were never called out of it, or ever professed to be."
2. "The apostle's sense is, that his former prohibition of keeping company with fornicators was not to be understood as referring to such persons as were, out of the church, as if no sort of civil conversation and commerce were to be had with men of such, and the like infamous characters."
3. "The apostle, under these characters, comprises all manner of sin against a man's self, against his neighbour, and against God; against himself, as fornication; against his neighbour, as covetousness and extortion; and against God, as idolatry."

### John Wesley:
1. "But I did not mean that you should altogether refrain from conversing with heathens, though they are guilty in some of these respects." 
2. "Covetous, rapacious, idolaters — Sinners against themselves, their neighbour, God."
3. "For then ye must go out of the world — Then all civil commerce must cease. So that going out of the world, which some account a perfection, St. Paul accounts an utter absurdity."
