# 1 Corinthians 5:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the commentator quotes explain that the speaker, with a deep and personal interest in the case, has come to a clear decision on how to handle it. The commentator emphasizes the need for discipline and corrective action to remove the stain caused by the offender's actions. The speaker justifies their demand for expulsion and envisions a church court where the verdict has been reached. Ultimately, the offender is to be excluded from Christian fellowship and handed over to Satan as a form of punishment.
