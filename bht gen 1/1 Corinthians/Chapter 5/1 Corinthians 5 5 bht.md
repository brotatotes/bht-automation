This act is seen as a means of discipline and correction, with the ultimate goal of bringing the offender to repentance and saving their soul.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The aim of the punishment, severe as it might seem, would be in reality a merciful one, tending to the eternal happiness of the offender."
2. "A greater contrast to this can hardly be conceived, than the terrible forms of excommunication subsequently devised, and even now in use in the Romish church, under the fiction of delegated apostolic power."
3. "The delivering to Satan for the destruction of the spirit can belong only to those who do the work of Satan."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Paul delegates here to the Corinthian Church his own special power as an apostle, of inflicting corporeal disease or death in punishment for sin."
2. "Satan, the 'accuser of the brethren' and the 'adversary,' demands the sinner for punishment on account of sin."
3. "Here it is not finally; but for the affliction of the body with disease, and even death, so as to destroy fleshly lust."
4. "The 'destruction of the flesh' answers to 'mortify the deeds of the body,' only that the latter is done by one's self, the former is effected by chastisement from God."
5. "The spirit... saved—the spiritual part of man, in the believer the organ of the Holy Spirit. Temporary affliction often leads to permanent salvation."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "There can be no doubt that excommunication is here intended, and that, by excommunication, the offender was in some sense placed under the control of Satan."
2. "It is evident that it was not of very long duration, since when the apostle exhorts them again to receive him, there is no mention made of his suffering then under it - This was an extraordinary and miraculous power."
3. "That his soul might be saved; that he might be corrected, humbled, and reformed by these sufferings, and recalled to the paths of piety and virtue."

3. "Casting the offender out of the Church involved casting him back into the heathen world, which Paul habitually conceives as under the power of Satan."

### John Calvin:
1. "Delivering over to Satan is an appropriate expression for denoting excommunication; for as Christ reigns in the Church, so Satan reigns out of the Church."
2. "He who is cast out of the Church is in a manner delivered over to the power of Satan, for he becomes an alien, and is cast out of Christ’s kingdom."
3. "The destruction of the flesh is opposed to the salvation of the spirit, simply because the former is temporal and the latter is eternal."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Paul certainly means expulsion from the church and regarding him as outside of the commonwealth of Israel. But we are not to infer that expulsion from the local church means the damnation of the offender." 
2. "The wilful offenders have to be expelled and not regarded as enemies, but admonished as brothers." 
3. "Both for physical suffering as in the case of Job and for conquest of the fleshly sins, remedial punishment."

### John Gill:
1. "By delivering him unto Satan; by which is meant, not the act of excommunication, or the removing of him from the communion of the church, which is an act of the whole church, and not of any single person; whereas this was what the church had nothing to do with; it was not what they were to do, or ought to do, but what the apostle had resolved to do; and which was an act of his own, and peculiar to him as an apostle."
2. "For the destruction of the flesh; that is, that his body might be shook, buffeted, afflicted, and tortured in a terrible manner; that by this means he might be brought to a sense of his sin, to repentance for it, and make an humble acknowledgment of it."
3. "That the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus; that he might be renewed in the spirit of his mind, be restored by repentance, and his soul be saved in the day of Christ; either at death, when soul and body would be separated, or at the day of the resurrection, when both should be reunited."

### John Wesley:
1. "To deliver such an one — This was the highest degree of punishment in the Christian church; and we may observe, the passing this sentence was the act of the apostle, not of the Corinthians."
2. "To Satan — Who was usually permitted, in such cases, to inflict pain or sickness on the offender."
3. "For the destruction — Though slowly and gradually. Of the flesh — Unless prevented by speedy repentance."
