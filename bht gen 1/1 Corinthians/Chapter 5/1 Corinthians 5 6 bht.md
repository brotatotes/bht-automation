# 1 Corinthians 5:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, commentators express concern over the Corinthians' tendency to boast and overlook existing sin within their community. They warn that glorying in one's own achievements while harboring scandalous behavior is unseemly and harmful. The analogy of leaven is employed to illustrate the contagious nature of sin, as a little wrongdoing can permeate and corrupt the entire group. The emphasis is on the deleterious effects of allowing sin to go unchecked, which can infect and endanger the whole community.
