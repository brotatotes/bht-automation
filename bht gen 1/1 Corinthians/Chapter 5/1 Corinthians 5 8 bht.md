# 1 Corinthians 5:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Let us partake in the perpetual feast, keeping sincerity and truth as our unleavened bread. As we celebrate the feast, let us reject malice and wickedness, putting away the old leaven of our unconverted state. This feast, like the Passover, nourishes us for our journey towards eternal redemption, providing spiritual sustenance through the body and blood of Christ. By participating in this feast with sincerity and truth, we strengthen our faith and demonstrate our true, inward devotion to God.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "not . . . old leaven—of our unconverted state as Jews or heathen."
2. "malice—the opposite of 'sincerity,' which allows no leaven of evil to be mixed up with good."
3. "wickedness—the opposite of 'truth,' which allows not evil to be mistaken for good."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "As the Jews when they celebrated the paschal supper, on the slaying and sacrifice of the paschal lamb, put away all leaven - as emblematic of sin - so let us, in the slaying of our sacrifice, and in all the duties, institutions and events consequent thereon, put away all wickedness from our hearts as individuals, and from our societies and churches."
2. "Not under the influence, or in the indulgence of the feelings of corrupt and unrenewed human nature - The word 'leaven' is very expressive of that former or 'old' condition, and denotes the corrupt and corrupting passions of our nature before it is renewed."
3. "Let us be sincere, and true, and faithful; as the Jews partook of bread unleavened, which was emblematic of purity, so let us be sincere and true. It is implied here that this could not be done unless they would put away the incestuous person - No Christians can have, or give evidence of sincerity, who are not willing to put away all sin."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Let us keep the feast." - This quote emphasizes the call to celebrate and participate in the feast, highlighting the importance of communal worship and unity among believers.

### John Calvin:
1. "If, therefore, we would wish to feed on Christ’s flesh and blood, let us bring to this feast sincerity and truth." 
2. "Away with all malice and wickedness, for it is unlawful to mix up leaven with the passover." 
3. "He declares that we shall be members of Christ only when we shall have renounced malice and deceit."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "As the Passover meal was designed to strengthen the Israelites for their wilderness journey, so is this for ours heavenward."
2. "But just as theirs had to be celebrated with unleavened bread, so must ours be free from corrupt admixtures."
3. "What a sublime idea does this give of the Christian life, as a lifelong Paschal celebration of our 'eternal redemption' by the sacrificial death of the Lord Jesus!"

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Let us keep on keeping the feast, a perpetual feast, and keep the leaven out."

1. "Not the feast of the passover, which was now ceased, though this is said in allusion to it; when the master of the house used to say, 'everyone that is hungry, let him come and eat; he that hath need, let him come and paschatize, or keep the feast of the passover.'"
2. "But rather the feast of the Lord's supper is here meant, that feast of fat things Isaiah prophesied of; in which are the richest entertainments, even the flesh and blood of Christ."
3. "Which feast, or course of life, is to be kept 'not with old leaven'; in the old, vain, sinful manner of conversation, as before: neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness; not in malice to any man, or one another, nor in any sort of wickedness, living in no known sin, and allowing of it: but with the unleavened bread of sincerity; as opposed to malice, of sincere love to God and Christ, and to his people: and of truth; of Gospel doctrine, discipline, and conversation."

### John Wesley:
1. "Let us feed on him by faith."
2. "Not with the old leaven — Of heathenism or Judaism."
3. "Sincerity and truth seem to be put here for the whole of true, inward religion."
