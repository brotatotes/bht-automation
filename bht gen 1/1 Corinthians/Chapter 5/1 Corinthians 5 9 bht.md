## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "I wrote to you in my letter (not this present epistle) which might mean, see reff., for there is nothing in the preceding part of this Epistle which can by any possibility be so interpreted."
2. "So Ambrose, Calvin, Beza, Estius, Grot., Calov., Bengel, Wetst., Mosh., De Wette, Meyer: so also Lightfoot, understanding however an Epistle committed to Timothy."
3. "It has been suggested (see Stanley, in loc.) that the whole passage, ch. 1Co 5:9 to 1 Corinthians 6:8, may have been a postscript or note inserted subsequently to the rest of the Epistle, and referring especially to ch. 1Co 6:9-20."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Paul does not refer to the present letter is proved by the fact that no direction 'not to company with fornicators' occurs in the previous part of it."
2. "His letters (plural; not applying to merely one) confirm this."
3. "Paul probably wrote a former brief reply to inquiries of the Corinthians: our first Epistle, as it enters more fully into the same subject, has superseded the former, which the Holy Spirit did not design for the guidance of the Church in general, and which therefore has not been preserved."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It is the natural and obvious interpretation - one that would strike the great mass of people. It is just such an expression as Paul would have used on the supposition that he had written a previous epistle."
2. "It is not true that Paul had in any former part of this Epistle given this direction. He had commanded them to remove an incestuous person, and such a command might seem to imply that they ought not to keep company with such a person; but it was not a general command not to have contact with them."
3. "We know that a number of books have been lost which were either inspired or which were regarded as of authority by inspired men. Thus, the books of Jasher, of Iddo the seer, etc., are referred to in the Old Testament, and there is no improbability that similar instances may have occurred in regard to the writers of the New Testament."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The reference is probably to a former letter now lost."
2. "The words in my epistle seem to favor the other view."
3. "It denotes, therefore, not only close, but habitual, intercourse."

### John Calvin:
1. "He reminds the Corinthians of what he had already enjoined upon them â€” that they should refrain from intercourse with the wicked."
2. "In short, then, he prohibits the Corinthians from holding intercourse with those who, while professing to be believers, do, nevertheless, live wickedly and to the dishonor of God."
3. "Let all that wish to be reckoned brethren, either live holily and becomingly, or be excommunicated from the society of the pious, and let all the good refrain from intercourse and familiarity with them."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The only alternative is, that there is here a reference to some previously-written letter to that church not now preserved." 
2. "Nor is this unworthy of Inspiration, as is evident from the Old Testament prophetic writings, which are very far from containing all that the prophets uttered by inspiration." 
3. "Why, then, should everything which an apostle found occasion to write require of necessity to be recorded for all time?"

### Archibald T. Robertson:

2. "This prohibition does not regard unclean copulation, or a joining with them in the sin of fornication, they had been used to in a state of unregeneracy, for some sort of companying with fornicators is allowed of in the next verse; whereas no degree of a sinful mixture with them would ever be tolerated."
3. "It is to be understood of a civil society and familiar conversation with them; which might bring a reproach upon religion, be a stumbling to weak Christians, and be of dangerous consequence to themselves and others."
