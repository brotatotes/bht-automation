3. "I will not be deprived of my freedom by any practice; i.e. indulge in any practice which shall mar this liberty and render it no real freedom."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "All things are lawful" - Paul addresses the argument that certain indulgences are permissible. He refutes this by stating that just because something may be lawful does not mean it is beneficial or profitable. There are actions that may not be inherently wrong but can still be harmful or lead others to sin.

2. "I will not be brought under the power" - Paul emphasizes his determination not to be enslaved by any habit or practice. He values his freedom as a Christian and refuses to let anything corrupt his mind or hinder his effectiveness. This principle applies to all believers, urging them to break free from any habit that hinders their usefulness and happiness.

3. "The man that has not courage and firmness enough to act on this rule should doubt his piety." - Paul challenges individuals who lack the courage and strength to break free from harmful habits to question their own faith. If one willingly remains enslaved to destructive behaviors, it raises doubts about their love for Christ and their ability to serve as ministers of the self-denying Redeemer.

3. "This kinship of the two words explains the play upon them."

### John Calvin:
1. "It is probable, that the Corinthians even up to that time retained much of their former licentiousness, and had still a savor of the morals of their city."
2. "It is a token of excessive licentiousness, when persons do not, of their own accord, restrict themselves, and set bounds to themselves, amidst such manifold abundance."
3. "We are lords of all things; only we must not abuse that lordship in such a way as to drag out a most miserable bondage, being, through intemperance and inordinate lusts, under subjection to outward things, which ought to be under subjection to us."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "In things indifferent, such as the eating of meats forbidden under the ceremonial law, the Gospel has made all things clean, and I can use my liberty without scruple; but there are some of tender conscience who are still afraid to meddle with such things." 

2. "For their sake, therefore, I must consider whether that which in itself is perfectly lawful is at the same time expedient."

3. "All things are lawful for me, but I will not be brought under the power of anything, to become its slave."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "The 'all things' do not include such matters as those condemned in chapter 1 Corinthians 6:1-11. Paul limits the proverb to things not immoral, things not wrong per se."
2. "Many things, harmless in themselves in the abstract, do harm to others in the concrete. We live in a world of social relations that circumscribe personal rights and liberties."
3. "Paul is determined not to be a slave to anything harmless in itself. He will maintain his self-control."
