# 1 Corinthians 6:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This verse reminds us that our bodies, as believers, are not just physical entities but are intimately connected to Christ. We are reminded of the profound union we have with Him, both in soul and body. Engaging in immoral acts contradicts this sacred bond, tearing apart what is meant to be united. It is a grave transgression to defile the members of Christ by engaging in immoral behaviors. We are called to honor and respect the sanctity of our bodies, recognizing that they are not our own but belong to Christ.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The Lord is a mystical Body, of which our bodies, parts of ourselves in our perfect organization, are members."
2. "Having then alienated the members of Christ (i.e. my own members) shall I make them an harlot’s members?"
3. "The expression πόρνης μέλη is put as coarsely and startlingly as possible, with the emphasis on πόρνης."

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "The body is for the Lord" - emphasizing the purpose of the body in relation to Christ (1 Corinthians 12:27; Ephesians 4:12; Ephesians 4:15; Ephesians 4:16; Ephesians 5:30).

2. "They cannot be at the same time 'the members of a harlot' and 'of Christ'" - highlighting the contradiction between participating in immoral acts and belonging to Christ.

3. "Moral and spiritual ruin is caused by such sins" - pointing out the destructive consequences of engaging in sinful behavior, which may be seen as harmless by human wisdom.

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The body is not only for the Lord: it is also united with Him." 
2. "Members of a harlot. The union of man and woman, whether lawful or unlawful, confers a double personality." 
3. "Fornication effects this result in an immoral way."

### John Calvin:
1. "Christ is joined with us and we with him in such a way, that we become one body with him."
2. "If I have connection with an harlot, I tear Christ in pieces, so far as it is in my power to do so."
3. "The spiritual connection which we have with Christ belongs not merely to the soul, but also to the body, so that we are flesh of his flesh."

Note: The commentary is quite long, so I have selected three quotes that provide a clear understanding of the verse.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Know ye not that your bodies are members of Christ?" - This verse reminds us that as believers, our bodies are not our own, but rather they belong to Christ. It emphasizes the importance of recognizing this truth as a foundational principle of our faith.

2. "Shall I then take away the members of Christ?" - This question challenges us to consider the consequences of using our bodies in ways that go against God's design and purpose. It prompts us to reflect on whether our actions align with our identity as members of Christ.

3. "Alienate them from their proper use and make them, etc." - This phrase highlights the danger of misusing our bodies, separating them from their intended purpose. It serves as a warning against engaging in activities that dishonor God and distort the proper use of our physical selves.

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "The body is not only adapted for Christ, but it is a part of Christ, in vital union with him."
2. "The horror of deliberately taking 'members of Christ' and making them 'members of a harlot' in an actual union staggers Paul and should stagger us."
3. "May it not happen! The word 'God' is not here. The idiom is common in Epictetus though rare in the LXX. Paul has it thirteen times and Luke once."

### John Gill:
1. "The whole persons of God's elect were chosen in Christ, and given to him, and made one with him, their bodies as well as their souls."
2. "Both [bodies and souls] are redeemed by him, and, in union with him, are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones."
3. "It is a most absurd, indecent, abominable, and detestable thing, that the bodies of the saints, which are the members of Christ, should be joined in carnal copulation with a harlot."
