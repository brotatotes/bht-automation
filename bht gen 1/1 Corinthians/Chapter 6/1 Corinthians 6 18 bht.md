# 1 Corinthians 6:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse being described is one that addresses the issue of fornication. Commentators express the urgent need to flee from this sin, emphasizing its harmful effects on both the body and the soul. While other sins may affect the body indirectly, fornication directly defiles and dishonors one's own body. It is likened to a leprosy that stupefies one's intellectual and moral powers, leaving a staining mark on the body. The imperative to flee from fornication is stern and categorical, emphasizing the need for immediate and unquestioning obedience.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:

1. "The assertion, which has surprised many of the Commentators, is nevertheless strictly true."
2. "Drunkenness and gluttony, e.g. are sins done in and by the body, and are sins by abuse of the body, but they are still ἐκτὸς τοῦ σώματος introduced from without, sinful not in their act, but in their effect."
3. "But fornication is the alienating that body which is the Lord’s, and making it a harlot’s body it is sin against a man’s own body, in its very nature, against the verity and nature of his body; not an effect on the body from participation of things without, but a contradiction of the truth of the body, wrought within itself."

2. "Every sin that a man doth is without the body not but that other sins are committed by the body, and by the members of it as instruments; they are generally committed by the abuse of other things that are without, and do not belong to the body; and so do not bring that hurt unto and reproach upon the body, as fornication does."

3. "But he that committeth fornication, sinneth against his own body; not meaning his wife, which is as his own body; but his proper natural body, which is not only the instrument by which this sin is committed, but the object against which it is committed; and which is defiled and dishonoured by it; and sometimes its strength and health are impaired, and it is filled with nauseous diseases hereby."
