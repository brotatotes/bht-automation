## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "All attempts to elude this plain meaning of the words are futile: whether of Chrys., Theophyl., Theodor-Mops, Theodoret, Erasm., for this would be no parallel to the case in hand."
2. "καί brings out an inconsequence or a contradiction between the members of the sentence, which it is the object of the question to remove."
3. "Hence by this 'coram vobis' it appears plainly, though it might be otherwise inferred from the context, that the Saints are to be the judges, sitting in judgment."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "What! (expressing surprise) know ye not" - The commentary highlights the surprise that the readers should have in not recognizing a universally recognized truth.
2. "To reign, and to be saved, are not necessarily synonymous" - This quote emphasizes that there is a distinction between reigning and being saved, indicating that salvation does not automatically guarantee a position of ruling.
3. "The weightiest of earthly questions at issue are infinitely small compared with those to be decided on the judgment-day" - This quote emphasizes the insignificance of earthly matters compared to the weightiness of the judgment-day decisions.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The saints shall judge the world - A great variety of interpretations has been given to this passage... But to this there are obvious objections... That this is the true interpretation, is apparent for the following reasons: (1) It is the obvious interpretation - that which will strike the great mass of people, and is likely, therefore, to be the true one. (2) It accords with the account in Matthew 19:28, and Luke 22:30."
2. "It may be answered, that it may be meant simply that Christians shall be exalted to the right hand of the Judge, and shall encompass his throne; that they shall assent to, and approve of his judgment, that they shall be elevated to a post of honor and favor, as if they were associated with him in the Judgment."
3. "Perhaps the idea is, not that they shall 'pronounce' sentence, which will be done by the Lord Jesus, but that they shall then be qualified to see the justice of the condemnation which shall be passed on the wicked; they shall have a clear and distinct view of the case; they shall even see the propriety of their everlasting punishment, and shall not only approve it, but be qualified to enter into the subject, and to pronounce upon it intelligently."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Matters [κριτηριων] . The word means, 1, The instrument or rule of judging; 2, the tribunal of a judge."

3. "Are ye unworthy of holding or passing judgment in such inferior courts?"

### John Calvin:

2. "The saints are endowed with heavenly wisdom, which immeasurably transcends all human doctrines: therefore they can judge better as to the stars than astrologers."
3. "The world is judged in the Church, because there Christ’s tribunal is erected, from which he exercises his authority."

3. "Hence here it would mean, 'Are ye unworthy of the smallest tribunals?' That is, of sitting on the smallest tribunals, of forming courts yourselves to settle such things?"

### John Gill:
1. "The saints shall judge the world." - The apostle appeals to the knowledge of the Corinthians, reminding them of the traditional belief among Jews that the righteous would have the authority to judge the nations. This notion can be traced back to the apocryphal book of Wisdom and the teachings of Jewish scholars. 

2. "The saints, Christian men, should be governors in the world." - The apostle explains that the saints, those who profess Christianity, would eventually hold positions of civil magistracy and governance in the world. This prediction came true in the centuries following the apostle's writing and continues to be the case, especially in the future when the saints will have even greater authority.

3. "Are ye unworthy to judge the smallest matters?" - The apostle challenges the Corinthians, asking if they consider themselves unfit to handle trivial matters of little importance in their current state. He argues that if they are destined to judge the world and hold positions of power, they should be more than capable of handling smaller, everyday affairs.

### John Wesley:
1. "Know ye not" - This expression emphasizes the Corinthians' lack of practice despite their knowledge and pride in it.
2. "The saints shall judge the world" - This highlights the role of believers as assessors with Christ in the final judgment, where they will participate in condemning the wicked.
3. "Shall be assessors with Christ" - This phrase underscores the privileged position of believers in the judgment, being entrusted with the responsibility of assisting Christ in the condemnation of both angels and humans.
