# 1 Corinthians 6:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Believers are given the astonishing privilege of judging not only human matters, but even fallen angels. This reveals the authority entrusted to them in God's divine plan. It is clear that the term "angels" in this context refers to the evil spiritual beings, and believers are empowered to judge them. This authority extends beyond the spiritual realm, enabling believers to discern and settle even mundane matters relating to their daily lives. The Corinthians' lack of wisdom in this regard seems even more surprising, as believers should certainly be able to handle such worldly affairs.
