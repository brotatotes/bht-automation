# 1 Corinthians 6:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, believers are warned against taking one another to court, as it is a dishonorable action. Instead of seeking peaceful resolutions or using arbitration, they resort to legal action, which is worse. The situation is accentuated by the fact that they bring their disputes before unbelievers, which is seen as the worst course of action. It is emphasized that Christians should seek reconciliation and resolution through peaceful means, rather than engaging in lengthy legal battles.
