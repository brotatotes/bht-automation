# 1 Corinthians 7:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this passage, commentators highlight the significance and implications of the phrase "it is good for a man not to touch a woman." While it does not imply that marriage itself is wrong or sinful, it suggests that celibacy or remaining single can be expedient under certain circumstances. The recommendation for celibacy may be influenced by the challenges of the times or the ability to exercise self-control. The teaching does not oppose marriage, but rather emphasizes the advantages and benefits of a single life, such as the freedom to fully dedicate oneself to spiritual pursuits.

### John Calvin:
1. "It is good for a man not to touch a woman: it is therefore wrong to do so." Paul does not make use of the word good here in such a signification as to be opposed to what is evil or vicious, but simply points out what is expedient on account of there being so many troubles, vexations, and anxieties that are incident to married persons.
2. "Hence, as there are in married life many impediments which keep a man entangled, it were on that account good not to be connected in marriage."
3. "The sum is this, that we must remember to distinguish between the pure ordinance of God and the punishment of sin, which came in subsequently. According to this distinction, it was in the beginning good for a man, without any exception, to be joined to a wife, and even yet, it is good in such a way, that there is in the meantime a mixture of bitter and sweet, in consequence of the curse of God."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "It is good for a man not to touch a woman" - This phrase refers to the idea of not getting married. However, it does not mean that marriage is inherently wrong, as clarified in the next verse and other passages that affirm the honor and importance of marriage (1 Corinthians 7:1).

2. "The 'present distress' seems to have been his main reason for recommending the single state" - Paul's recommendation for remaining single in this context was likely influenced by the challenging circumstances of that time (1 Corinthians 7:26).

3. "Forbidding to marry" is mentioned as one of the signs of the apostasy of the later times (1 Timothy 4:3) - This highlights the significance and value of marriage, as it is considered honorable and not something to be forbidden or discouraged (Hebrews 13:4, Mark 10:6-9).

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Paul pointedly says that [single life] is not wrong, but good." 
2. "One will get a one-sided view of Paul's teaching on marriage unless he keeps a proper perspective."

1. "The things they wrote to him about, here referred to, may be collected from the contents of this chapter, and some others following; as whether a Christian man ought not to abstain from the use of women; whether a believer ought to live with an unbelieving yoke fellow; whether such as had been circumcised should not make use of some methods to draw on the foreskin of their flesh; whether apprentices, who were called by the grace of God, ought to serve out their time with their masters; and concerning celibacy or virginity, the eating of things offered to idols, and the maintenance of ministers."
2. "It is good for a man not to touch a woman; which is to be understood, not of merely touching a woman, which can neither be criminal, nor in all cases inexpedient, or be attended with any ill, or dangerous consequences; nor of the matrimonial contract, which is lawful and honourable; but of the act of carnal copulation with a woman."
3. "The apostle's meaning is not that it is unlawful to marry, or that it is sinful to lie with a woman in lawful wedlock; but that it is much better, and more expedient on several accounts, to abstain from the use of women, when persons have the gift of continency."
