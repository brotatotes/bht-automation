# 1 Corinthians 7:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, the commentators highlight the concept of sanctification within mixed-faith marriages and its transformative effects. They emphasize that the faith of a believing spouse can bring sanctification to the unbelieving partner and even have a positive influence on the spiritual upbringing of their children. The verse encourages readers to recognize the tangible proof of this sanctifying power in action. It underlines the importance of the marriage bond and discourages separation, as it is through the union of believers and unbelievers that sanctification and spiritual growth can occur.

2. "The sense of the passage seems to be this: Christians are not to separate from their unconverted partners, although the Jews were commanded to put away their strange or pagan wives; because the unbelieving party is so far sanctified by the believing party, that the marriage connection is quite 'lawful for Christians. There is nothing in the Christian religion that forbids it.'"
