2. "There is no contradiction, in this licence of breaking off such a marriage, to the command of our Lord in Matthew 5:32, because the Apostle expressly asserts, 1 Corinthians 7:12, that our Lordâ€™s words do not apply to such marriages as are here contemplated."

3. "God hath called us to peace - Religion is peaceful. It would prevent contentions and broils. This is to be a grand principle.
