# 1 Corinthians 7:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, it is suggested that believers should allow their unbelieving partners to depart if they so desire, to maintain peace in their lives. However, commentators emphasize that the decision should not be taken lightly or without considering the potential for the unbelieving partner's conversion. The verse calls for patience, love, and the exemplification of the excellency of religion through the Christian's behavior, with the hopes of bringing back the unbelieving partner to faith. Such an undertaking requires uncertainty, hope, and the recognition that there is no guarantee of salvation.

### Henry Alford:
1. "This interpretation is the only one compatible with the obvious sense of 1 Corinthians 7:15, and of the expression (not τί οἶδας εἰ μή, but) τί οἶδας εἰ σώσεις; and is also in exact harmony with the general tenor of the Apostle’s argument, which is not to urge a union, but to tolerate a separation." 
2. "Let the unbeliever depart: hazard not for an uncertainty the peace in which you ought to be living as Christians."
3. "For what assurance hast thou, O wife, whether thou shalt be the means of thy husband’s conversion? Or what assurance hast thou, O husband, whether thou shalt be the means of thy wife’s conversion?"

### John Calvin:
1. "An uncertain hope ought not to detain thee...so long as there remains any hope of doing good, and the pious wife knows not but that she may by her holy conversation bring back her husband into the way, she ought to try every means before leaving him."
2. "For so long as a man’s salvation is doubtful, it becomes us to be prepared rather to hope the best."
