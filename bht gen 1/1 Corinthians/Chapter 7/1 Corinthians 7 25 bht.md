# 1 Corinthians 7:25 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This verse is a humble and inspired opinion from the apostle. While he acknowledges that he does not have a specific command from the Lord on this matter, his advice is given with the inspiration and guidance of the Holy Spirit. The apostle's recommendation holds weight and should be respected, as it is a trustworthy and divine rule of faith and practice. The absence of a direct command does not diminish the value and significance of his counsel.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The emphasis is on ἐπιταγήν command of the Lord have I none, i.e. no expressed precept: so that, as before, there is no marked comparison between ὁ κύριος and ἐγώ."
2. "πιστὸς εἶναι to be faithful, as in ref., as a steward and dispenser of the hidden things of God, and, among them, of such directions as you cannot make for yourselves, but require one so entrusted to impart to you."
3. "This sense, which has occurred in the estimate given of himself in this very Epistle, is better than the more general ones of true or believing."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "I have no express revelation from the Lord commanding it, but I give my judgment (opinion); namely, under the ordinary inspiration which accompanied the apostles in all their canonical writings."
2. "The Lord inspires me in this case to give you only a recommendation, which you are free to adopt or reject—not a positive command."
3. "He attributes his apostleship and the gifts accompanying it (including inspiration) to God's grace alone."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It is known that that opinion had an early prevalence, and gave rise to the establishment of 'nunneries' in the papal church; an opinion that has everywhere been attended with licentiousness and corruption."
2. "I have no commandment ... - No positive, express revelation."
3. "The advice of 'such' a man - a devoted, faithful, self-denying, experienced Christian - is entitled to respectful deference, even where there is no claim to inspiration."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The use of the word by ecclesiastical writers for an unmarried man has no warrant in classical usage."
2. "The meaning is unquestionable."
3. "In every other case in the New Testament the meaning is unquestionable."

### John Calvin:
1. "He accordingly intimates more explicitly what his views are respecting virginity; but as it is a matter that is liable to be misapprehended, and is full of difficulties, he always speaks, as we shall see, conditionally."
2. "He says that he gives advice, not as if there were anything doubtful in it, and had little or no stability, but as being certain, and deserving to be maintained without any controversy."
3. "For he declares that he does not speak simply as a man, but as a faithful teacher of the Church, and an Apostle of Christ."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Paul did have a command from the Lord as we have in Matthew and Mark... It was quite possible for Paul to know this command of Jesus as he did other sayings of Jesus even if he had as yet no access to a written gospel or had received no direct revelation on the subject from Jesus."
2. "Sayings of Jesus were passed on among the believers. But Paul had no specific word from Jesus on the subject of virgins."
3. "This language, so far from being a disclaimer of inspiration, is an express claim to help from the Lord in the forming of this duly considered judgment, which is in no sense a command, but an inspired opinion."

### John Gill:
1. "I have no commandment of the Lord: neither in the Old Testament, in the law of Moses, or writings of the prophets; nothing is therein enjoined concerning celibacy, or commanding persons to live a single life."
2. "The apostle does not make use of his power and authority, as such, to make decrees, and prescribe rules, binding on the consciences of men; only humbly and modestly gives his opinion."
3. "And when a man is free and faithful, and openly and honestly tells his mind, it greatly recommends him, and commands attention and regard to what he says."

### John Wesley:
1. "I have no commandment from the Lord — By a particular revelation. Nor was it necessary he should; for the apostles wrote nothing which was not divinely inspired."
2. "Sometimes they had a particular revelation, and a special commandment; at other times they wrote from the divine light which abode with them, the standing treasure of the Spirit of God."
3. "And this, also, was not their private opinion, but a divine rule of faith and practice."
