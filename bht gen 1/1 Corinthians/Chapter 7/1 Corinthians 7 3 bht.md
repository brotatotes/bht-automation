# 1 Corinthians 7:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the commentators emphasize the mutual obligations and responsibilities within a marriage. They discuss the duty of cohabitation and emphasize that married couples should not separate from each other, as it is a virtue to be united. The phrase "due benevolence" refers to the act of intercourse, which is described as an act of love, affection, and justice ordained by God. This verse also addresses the importance of maintaining conjugal fidelity and discourages rebellion or refusal of marital intimacy. Ultimately, it highlights the balance between the responsibilities of husband and wife within the marriage connection.
