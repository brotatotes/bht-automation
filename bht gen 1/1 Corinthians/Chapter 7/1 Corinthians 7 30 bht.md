# 1 Corinthians 7:30 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, believers are called to not be possessive of worldly gains, understanding that life is meant to be used rather than owned. It highlights the contrast between Christians and the men of Sodom who placed their value in material possessions. Christians are encouraged to find their true substance and joy beyond this world, remaining unaffected by passing events. They should hold earthly relations loosely, understanding their temporary nature, and rejoice in their heavenly inheritance while being responsible stewards of their possessions.
