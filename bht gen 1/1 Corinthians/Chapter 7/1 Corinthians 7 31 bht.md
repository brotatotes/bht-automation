## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The κατά, as in κατέχοντες, appears here to imply that intense and greedy use which turns the legitimate use into a fault."
2. "I would render them, and they who use the world, as not using it in full."
3. "For the fashion of this world is passing away, is in the act being changed, as a passing scene in a play."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "We are to use it, 'not to take our fill' of its pursuits as our chief aim." 
2. "As the planets while turning on their own axis, yet revolve round the sun; so while we do our part in our own worldly sphere, God is to be the center of all our desires." 
3. "The image is drawn from a shifting scene in a play represented on the stage."

2. "We are not to use it to excess; we are not to make it a mere matter of indulgences."
3. "The form, the fashion of the world is like a splendid, gilded pageant. It is unreal and illusive."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Those that use the world" - The verb χραομα, usually with the instrumental case, but the accusative occurs in some Cretan inscriptions and in late writers according to a tendency of verbs to resume the use of the original accusative.

2. "As not abusing it" - Perfective use of κατα in composition, old verb, but here only in N.T., to use up, use to the full. Papyri give examples of this sense. This is more likely the idea than "abusing" it.

3. "For the fashion of this world passeth away" - Σχημα is the habitus, the outward appearance, old word, in N.T. only here and Philippians 2:7. Παραγε (old word) means "passes along" like a moving panorama (movie show!). Used of Jesus passing by in Jericho (Matthew 20:30).

### John Gill:
1. "Such as have a large affluence of the things of this world, should use them in a moderate and temperate manner."
2. "All that looks glorious and beautiful in the present world...are all fluid and transitory, are passing away."
3. "There is nothing firm and permanent; in a little time, all will be at an end."

These quotes highlight the importance of using worldly possessions responsibly, recognizing the temporary nature of worldly things, and emphasizing the need to focus on eternal values and behaviors.

### John Wesley:
1. "Using every thing therein only in such a manner and degree as most tends to the knowledge and love of God."
2. "Not seeking happiness in it, but in God."
3. "The whole scheme and fashion of this world...is this moment flying off like a shadow."
