## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Albert Barnes:
1. "Is under a necessity of giving attention to the things of the world; or cannot give his undivided attention and interest to the things of religion."
2. "The apostle here plainly intimates that there would be danger that the man would be so anxious to gratify his wife, as to interfere with his direct religious duties."
3. "Many a husband has thus been injured by a frivolous, thoughtless, and imprudent wife; and though that wife may be a Christian, yet her course may be such as shall greatly retard his growth in grace, and mar the beauty of his piety."

### John Calvin:
1. "They have one eye directed to the Lord, but in such a way as to have the other directed to their wife; for marriage is like a burden, by which the mind of a pious man is weighed down, so that he does not move God-ward with so much alacrity."
2. "Whatever evil there is in marriage, has its origin somewhere else; for at this day a man would not have been turned away from the Lord by the society of his wife, if he had remained in a state of innocence, and had not corrupted the holy institution of God; but a wife would have been a help-meet to him in everything good, as she was created for that end."
3. "There are three kinds of anxieties. There are some that are evil and wicked in themselves, because they spring from distrust... There are others that are necessary, and are not displeasing to God... The third class are a mixture of the two former; when we are anxious respecting those things as to which we ought to feel anxiety, but feel too keenly excited, in consequence of that excess which is natural to us."
