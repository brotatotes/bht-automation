# 1 Corinthians 7:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, believers are encouraged not to withdraw from one another's company, as it is important to maintain fellowship. The temporary separation mentioned is not intended for a prolonged period but rather for specific occasions where individuals can focus entirely on prayer and fasting. It is important to be cautious of Satan's attempts to tempt believers, even in the midst of their spiritual exercises. Through prioritizing prayer and remaining united, believers can guard against the influence of impure thoughts and actions.
