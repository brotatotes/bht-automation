## Choicest Commentary Quotes:

1. "This recommendation all depended on the possibility of their being tempted by incontinence: he gives it not then as a command in all cases, but as an allowance for those to whom he was writing, whom he knew, and assumes, to be thus tempted."
2. "The meaning 'by permission,' E. V., is ambiguous, appearing as if it meant by permission of the Lord (to say it)."
3. "That given by Hammond, al., κατὰ τὴν ἐμὴν γνώμην, is philologically inadmissible."

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:

### John Calvin:
1. "He adds a limitation — that he had written these things on account of their infirmity — that they may bear in mind that marriage is a remedy for unchastity, lest they should inordinately abuse the advantage of it, so as to gratify their desire by every means; nay more, without measure or modesty."
2. "He has it also in view to meet the cavils of the wicked, that no one might have it in his power to object in this way: 'What! are you afraid that husbands and wives will not of their own accord be sufficiently inclined to carnal delight that you prompt them to it?'"
3. "Conjugal intercourse is a thing that is pure, honorable and holy, because it is a pure institution of God: the immoderate desire with which persons burn is a fault arising from the corruption of nature; but in the case of believers marriage is a veil, by which that fault is covered over, so that it no longer appears in the sight of God."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "But this I say by permission, not of commandment" - The author emphasizes that their words are not a strict commandment, but rather a permission or allowance. This suggests that there is flexibility in how the verse can be interpreted and applied to different situations.
