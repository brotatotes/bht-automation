## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The stress is on λέγω, not on τοῖς ἀγάμοις καὶ ταῖς χήραις, which would in that case be placed first, as τοῖς γεγαμηκόσιν below."
2. "καλόν, see on 1 Corinthians 7:1, it is good for them, i.e. ‘their best way.’"
3. "ὡς κἀγώ, i.e. ἄγαμος. This brings the Apostle’s own circumstances more clearly before us than 1 Corinthians 7:7, which might be misunderstood: and there can be little doubt from this, that he never was married."

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "The apostle Paul addresses the issue of marriage and singleness, emphasizing the importance of remaining unmarried for those who are able. He encourages the unmarried and widows to stay single, just as he himself is. This highlights the value of dedicating oneself fully to serving God without the distractions and responsibilities of marriage." 

2. "Paul's words remind us that singleness is not a lesser state but a valid and honorable choice. It allows individuals to focus on their relationship with God and serve Him wholeheartedly. It is a calling that should be respected and supported within the Christian community." 

3. "By choosing to remain unmarried, one can devote themselves entirely to the work of the Lord, without the added obligations and concerns that come with marriage. This allows for a greater level of dedication and service, as well as a deeper intimacy with God."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It may be advisable, in the present circumstances of persecution and distress, not to be encumbered with the cares and anxieties of a family."
2. "The word unmarried (ἀγάμοις agamois) may refer either to those who had never been married, or to widowers."
3. "The apostle specifies these, though he had not specified 'widowers' particularly. The reason of this distinction seems to be, that he considers more particularly the case of those females who had never been married."

### John Calvin:
1. "The sum is this, that an unmarried life has many advantages, and that these are not to be despised, provided every one measures himself according to his own size and measure."
2. "For as to the objection that is brought forward by Papists — that in baptism, also, we promise to God purity of life, which it is not in our power to perform, the answer is easy — that in that we promise nothing but what God requires from all his people, but that continency is a special gift, which God has withheld from many."
3. "Hence the Apostle would wish those who are at present practicing chastity, to continue in it and persevere; but as they have no security for the continuance of the gift, he exhorts all to consider carefully what has been given them."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "It is possible that by 'the unmarried' the apostle means only men since widows are added and since virgins receive special treatment later." 
2. "He does not say that it is better to be unmarried, but only that it is good for them to remain unmarried." 
3. "Αγαμος is an old word and in N.T. occurs only in this passage."

### John Gill:
1. "It is good for them if they abide; unmarried, and do not change their condition any more; not that it was sinful to marry again, for he allows of it in the next verse, in case they have not the gift of continence."
2. "They would be more free from the cares of life, have less trouble, and be more at leisure to serve the Lord."
3. "He proposes himself as an example to widowers and widows; and having known what a married and single state both were, was better able to give his judgment of both, and proper advice to such persons."

### John Wesley:

2. "St. Paul was then single is certain" - This commentary confirms that Paul was indeed single, providing context for his statement. It helps us understand that he speaks from personal experience and conviction.
3. "It does not appear that this declaration... hath any reference at all to a state of persecution" - The commentary clarifies that Paul's statement about remaining single is not specifically related to persecution. This insight helps us focus on the broader message of the verse, rather than limiting its meaning to a particular context.
