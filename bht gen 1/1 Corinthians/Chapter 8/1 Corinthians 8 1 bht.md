# 1 Corinthians 8:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, the commentators shed light on the importance of understanding the balance between knowledge and love. The verse addresses the Corinthian believers who boast in their knowledge but fail to exercise love. The commentators caution against relying solely on knowledge, as it can lead to pride and self-sufficiency.

This verse serves as a gentle reproof to the Corinthians, encouraging them to prioritize love and humility over mere knowledge.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "We know, that we all have knowledge; knowledge, however, puffs up, but love builds up." 
2. "Partaking of them was an abomination among the Jews...and was forbidden by the Apostles and elders assembled at Jerusalem."
3. "It shows how little such decisions were at that time regarded as lastingly binding on the whole church."

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "The infirmities of such should be respected."
2. "Christians were constantly exposed to the temptation of receiving them, which was forbidden."
3. "Knowledge puffeth up—when without 'love'."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Knowledge puffeth up - This is the beginning of the parenthesis. It is the reply of Paul to the statement of the Corinthians, that all had knowledge. The sense is, 'Admitting that you all have knowledge; that you know what is the nature of an idol, and of idol worship; yet mere knowledge in this case is not a safe guide; its effect may be to puff up, to fill with pride and self-sufficiency, and to lead you astray.'" 

2. "But charity edifieth - Love (ἡ ἀγάπη hē agapē); so the word means; and so it would be well to translate it. Our word 'charity' we now apply almost exclusively to alms-giving, or to the favorable opinion which we entertain of others when they seem to be in error or fault. The word in the Scripture means simply 'love.' The sense here is, 'Knowledge is not a safe guide, and should not be trusted. Love to each other and to God, true Christian affection, will be a safer guide than mere knowledge.'" 

3. "Your conclusion on this question should not be formed from mere abstract knowledge; but you should ask what love to others - to the peace, purity, happiness, and salvation of your brethren - would demand. If love to them would prompt to this course, and permit you to partake of this food, it should be done; if not, if it would injure them, whatever mere knowledge would dictate, it should not be done."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The contrast is striking between puffing up and building up - a bubble and a building."
2. "We know, to use your own words, that we all have knowledge."
3. "The parenthesis thus comes in with an appropriate cautionary force."

### John Calvin:
1. "Of what avail is knowledge, that is of such a kind as puffs us up and elates us, while it is the part of love to edify?" 
2. "Accursed, then, be that knowledge which makes men proud, and is not regulated by a desire of edifying."
3. "We must lay it down as a settled principle, that knowledge is good in itself; but as piety is its only foundation, it becomes empty and useless in wicked men: as love is its true seasoning, where that is wanting it is tasteless."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Ye plead your knowledge; we are at one with you there; but this is a question, not of knowledge, but of love."
2. "Knowledge puffeth up, but love edifieth."
3. "Love...cements them like stones in one building."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "The connection between idolatry and impurity was very close, especially in Corinth."
2. "What were Christians to do about eating such portions either buying in the market or eating in the home of another or at the feast to the idol?"
3. "There was the more enlightened group who acted on the basis of their superior knowledge about the non-existence of the gods represented by the idols."

### John Gill:
1. "We know that we all have knowledge...had the same knowledge of Christian liberty as they had; knew that an idol was nothing, and that eating meats offered to them could not defile, or do them any hurt." 
2. "Knowledge puffeth up; not true knowledge...mere show of knowledge, knowledge in conceit, mere notional and speculative knowledge, that which is destitute of charity or love." 
3. "But charity edifieth; that is, a man that has knowledge, joined with love to God, and his fellow Christians, will seek for that which makes for the edification of others."

### John Wesley:
1. "Knowledge without love always puffeth up."
2. "Love alone edifies - Builds us up in holiness."
3. "A gentle reproof of their self-conceit."
