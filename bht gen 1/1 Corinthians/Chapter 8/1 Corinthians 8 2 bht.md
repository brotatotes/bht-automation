# 1 Corinthians 8:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, Paul speaks of the danger of knowledge without humility or love. The commentators emphasize the importance of recognizing our limitations and avoiding arrogance. True knowledge, they suggest, is accompanied by humility, kindness, and a conscious awareness of our need to continually learn and grow. It is not simply intellectual knowledge, but a deeper connection with God that transforms our understanding and leads to love and compassion for others.
