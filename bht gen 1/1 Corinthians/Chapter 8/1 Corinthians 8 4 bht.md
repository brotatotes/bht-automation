## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "We know that there is no idol in the world, i.e. that the εἴδωλα of the heathen (meaning not strictly the images, but the persons represented by them) have no existence in the world."
2. "That they who worship idols, worship devils, the Apostle himself asserts ch. 1 Corinthians 10:20; but that is no contradiction to the present sentence, which asserts that the deities imagined by them, Jupiter, Apollo, &c., have absolutely no existence."
3. "And that there is no god, but One: the insertion of ἕτερος has probably been occasioned by the first commandment, οὐκ ἔσονταί σοι θεοὶ ἕτεροι πλὴν ἐμοῦ."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Idol is nothing—has no true being at all, the god it represents is not a living reality."
2. "This does not contradict 1 Corinthians 8:1- :, which states that they who worship idols, worship devils for here it is the GODS believed by the worshippers to be represented by the idols which are denied to have any existence, not the devils which really under the idols delude the worshippers."
3. "None other God—The oldest manuscripts omit the word 'other'; which gives a clearer sense."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "We fully admit, and know, that the whole thing is delusive; and there can be no danger that, by partaking of the food offered in sacrifice to them, we should ever be brought to a belief of the stupendous falsehood that they are true objects of worship, or to deny the true God."
2. "There may have been a reference here to the name of an idol among the Hebrews. They called idols אלילים 'ĕlı̂yliym (Elilim), or in the singular אליל 'ĕlı̂yl (Elil}, vain, null, nothingworth, nothingness, vanity, weakness, etc.; indicating their vanity and powerlessness."
3. "There is but one God; and that fact is known to us all. The phrase 'in the world' seems to be added by way of emphasis, to show the utter nothingness of idols; to explain in the most emphatic manner the belief that they had no real existence."

### John Calvin:
1. "He condemns, in general, that contemptuous knowledge which is not seasoned with love."
2. "An idol is nothing, inasmuch as there is but one God; for it follows admirably — 'If there is no other God besides our God, then an idol is an empty dream, and mere vanity.'"
3. "An idol is nothing because there is no God but one; for he is the invisible God, and cannot be represented by a visible sign, so as to be worshipped through means of it."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "No idol is anything in the world... The idol was a mere picture or symbol of a god. If the god has no existence, the idol is a non-entity."
2. "This Christians held as firmly as Jews. The worship of Jesus as God's Son and the Holy Spirit does not recognize three Gods, but one God in three Persons."
3. "The cosmos, the ordered universe, can only be ruled by one God."

These quotes highlight the understanding that idols are meaningless without the existence of the gods they represent, the belief in one God held by Christians, and the idea that the ordered universe can only be governed by a single deity.

### John Gill:
1. "We know that an idol is nothing in the world; among the things created by God in the world; for though the matter of it may be of God, the form is of men; nor has it any share in the government of the world."
2. "Though it may have an existence, as the sun, moon, and stars, yet not divinity; and in that sense nothing."
3. "Very likely the apostle may have reference to אלילים, the Hebrew word for idols, which signifies things of nought, that are good for nothing, are of no value, and are as nothing."

### John Wesley:
1. "An idol is nothing — A mere nominal god, having no divinity, virtue, or power."
2. "Idols are the work of men's hands, and therefore cannot be gods, for they have no life, sense, or motion."
3. "The worship of idols is a gross absurdity, and a great affront to the true God, who is the only object of religious worship."
