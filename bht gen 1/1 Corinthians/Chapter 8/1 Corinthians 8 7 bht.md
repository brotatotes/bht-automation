# 1 Corinthians 8:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this particular Bible verse, there is a discussion about the knowledge and conscience of believers when it comes to eating meat that has been offered to idols. Some commentators point out that not all believers have the same level of knowledge and understanding. It is important to consider the weaker brethren, who may still have remnants of their previous idolatrous beliefs and feel convicted about eating such meat. Indulging in this food may defile their conscience and be viewed as sinful. It is crucial to act with wisdom and compassion, considering the different levels of understanding among believers.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Not in all is the knowledge, but some through their consciousness...eat it as offered to an idol, and their conscience, in that it is weak, is defiled." 
2. "By ἕως ἄρτι, it is shown that these ἀσθενεῖς must have belonged to the Gentile part of the Corinthian church."
3. "Had they been Jewish converts, it would not have been συνείδησις τοῦ εἰδώλου which would have troubled them, but apparent violation of the Mosaic law."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Though to us who 'have knowledge' all meats are indifferent, yet 'this knowledge is not in all' in the same degree as we have it."
2. "Some Gentile Christians, whether from old association of ideas or misdirected conscience, when they ate such meats, ate them with some feeling as if the idol were something real."
3. "If they ate it unconscious at the time that it had been offered to idols, there would be no defilement of conscience. But conscious of what it was, and not having such knowledge as other Corinthians boasted of, they by eating them sin against conscience."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Though this might be generally true, yet it was not universally; for that some were ignorant on this subject, and supposed that an idol had a real existence, and that to partake of that meat would be to confirm them in their superstition."
2. "There are some who are weak and ignorant; who have still remains of pagan opinions and superstitious feelings."
3. "This is just one instance, like thousands, in which former erroneous opinions, prejudices, or superstitious views may influence those who are truly converted to God, and greatly mar and disfigure the beauty and symmetry of their religious character."

Note: The commentary is quite short, so I have included all the relevant quotes.

### John Calvin:
1. "Your actions ought to be regulated not merely according to your knowledge, but also according to their ignorance."
2. "This is the kind of offense that Paul reproves in the Corinthians — when we induce weak brethren, by our example, to venture upon anything against their conscience."
3. "For as the excellence of actions depends on the fear of God and integrity of conscience, so, on the other hand, there is no action, that is so good in appearance, as not to be polluted by a corrupt affection of the mind."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The 'weak' here are Gentile converts who, being steeped in idolatry up to the time of their conversion, were unable as yet to shake off the impression that the idol, which by them had so long been regarded as a god, had after all something divine in it." 

2. "When such weak brethren saw their stronger-minded brethren openly partaking of meat known to have been sacrificed to an idol, they would be emboldened by their example to do the same, while still regarding the act as idolatrous, and so would defile their conscience."

3. "The received text here reads, 'from conscience of the idol;' and Meyer and Alford think this right. But the above reading is decidedly better supported, and it is the text of Griesbach. Lachmann, Tregelles, and Tischendorf."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Knowledge has to overcome inheritance and environment, prejudice, fear, and many other hindrances."

2. "It is the force of habit that still grips them when they eat such meat. They eat it 'as an idol sacrifice,' though they no longer believe in idols. The idol-taint clings in their minds to this meat."

3. "Even if unenlightened, one must act according to his conscience, a sensitive gauge to one's spiritual condition."

4. "Knowledge breaks down as a guide with the weak or unenlightened conscience."

5. "Food cannot pollute, but [the conscience] is defiled by the doing of something which the unenlightened conscience does not allow."

### John Gill:
1. "The apostle is not speaking of Heathens, in whom there was no knowledge of the one true God, the author of all things, and of the one Lord Jesus, the only saviour and Redeemer; but of Christians, in whom there was the knowledge of these things, but not in all of them."
2. "It became those who had more knowledge to be careful how they laid stumblingblocks in the way of such, to the prejudice of their consciences."
3. "Some having been formerly accustomed to worship idols, and to eat things offered to them, as having received some virtue from them, still retained an opinion, that there was some difference between such meats and others."

### John Wesley:
1. "Some eat, with consciousness of the idol — That is, fancying it is something, and that it makes the meat unlawful to be eaten." 
2. "And their conscience, being weak — Not rightly informed." 
3. "Is defiled — contracts guilt by doing it."
