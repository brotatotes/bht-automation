## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "I acknowledge this indifference, this licence to eat or not to eat; but it is on that very account, because it is a matter indifferent, that ye must take heed."
2. "The particular πρόσκομμα in this case would be, the tempting them to act against their conscience."
3. "A practice above all others dangerous to a Christian."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The very indifference of meats, which I concede, is the reason why ye should 'take heed' not to tempt weak brethren to act against their conscience." 
2. "This liberty of yours—the watchword for lax Corinthians." 
3. "The indifference of meats...constitutes sin."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Though a man is neither morally better nor worse for partaking of meat or abstaining from it; yet the grand principle to be observed is, so to act as not to injure your brethren."
2. "It is of far more importance that your brother should not be led into sin, than it is that you should partake of meat which you acknowledge is in itself of no importance."
3. "You should be careful that by no conduct of yours your brother be led into sin."

These quotes emphasize the importance of considering the well-being of others and avoiding actions that may lead them into sin, even if those actions are morally neutral in themselves.

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The term 'stumbling block' refers to something that causes another person to sin or stumble in their faith. It can be a behavior, a belief, or an action that leads someone astray from the truth of the Gospel."
2. "In this context, the stumbling block refers to anything that hinders or obstructs another person's spiritual growth or understanding of God's Word."
3. "As believers, we are called to be mindful of our actions and attitudes, ensuring that we do not become stumbling blocks to others but rather instruments of encouragement and edification."

### John Calvin:
1. "He leaves their liberty untouched, but moderates the use of it thus far — that it may not give occasion of stumbling to the weak."
2. "And he expressly desires that regard be had to the weak, that is, to those who are not yet thoroughly confirmed in the doctrine of piety."
3. "In the meantime, he hints that strong giants, who may be desirous tyrannically to subject our liberty to their humor, may safely be let alone, because we need not fear giving offense to those who are not drawn into sin through infirmity, but eagerly catch at something to find fault with."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Lest by any means (μη πως). Common construction after verbs of caution or fearing, μη πως with aorist subjunctive γενητα." 
2. "This liberty of yours (η εξουσια υμων αυτη). Εξουσια, from εξεστιν, means a grant, allowance, authority, power, privilege, right, liberty. It shades off easily."
3. "A stumbling-block to the weak (προσκομμα τοις ασθενεσιν). Late word from προσκοπτω, to cut against, to stumble against. So an obstacle for the foot to strike."

### John Gill:
1. "Care should be taken, lest this liberty of yours become a stumbling block to them that are weak."
2. "They ought to be cautious, lest they should be the means of offending, or causing to offend, such who were weak in the faith."
3. "Not the use of their power and liberty is here denied, but the abuse of it is guarded against."

These quotes emphasize the importance of being mindful of others' weaknesses and not using one's freedom in a way that could cause them to stumble or be offended. It highlights the responsibility to exercise caution and avoid abusing one's liberty.
