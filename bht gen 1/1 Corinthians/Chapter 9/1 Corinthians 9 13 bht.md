## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

2. "A part of the victims going to the service of the altar, and the rest being shared by the priests."
3. "The priests were considered partakers with the altar, as they were intimately involved in the sacrificial system."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Paul illustrates the doctrine that the ministers of religion were entitled to a support from the fact that those who were appointed to offer sacrifice receive a maintenance in their work."

3. "If it was reasonable then, it is reasonable now. If God commanded it then, it is to be presumed that he intends to require it now."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Minister [εργαζομενοι] . Lit, work or perform. Never in classical Greek of being engaged in sacred rites."
2. "Wait [παρεδρευοντες] . Etymologically akin to paredrov sitting beside."
3. "Altar [θυσιαστηριω] . See on Acts 17:23."

### John Calvin:
1. "For if Paul had not of his own accord refrained from using his liberty, there was a risk of the progress of the gospel being obstructed."
2. "The sum is this — 'The Levitical priests were ministers of the Israelitish Church; the Lord appointed them sustenance from their ministry; hence in ministers of the Christian Church the same equity must be observed at the present day.'"
3. "Hence a distinction must be made between the ancient priesthood and that of the present day. Priests under the law were set apart to preside over the sacrifices, to serve the altar, and to take care of the tabernacle and temple. Those at the present day are set apart to preach the word and to dispense the sacraments."

1. "Sacred things (τα ιερα). Of the temple (του ιερου). Play on the same word ιερου (sacred)." 
2. "They which wait upon the altar (ο τω θυσιαστηριω παρεδρευοντες). Old word παρεδρευω, to sit beside, from παρ--εδρος, like Latin assidere, and so constant attendance."
3. "Locative case θυσιαστηριω, late word found so far only in LXX, Philo, Josephus, N.T., and ecclesiastical writers."

### John Gill:
1. "Not the priests in the temples of the Heathen deities, but the priests in the temple at Jerusalem, who were employed in slaying the sacrifices, taking off their skins, cutting them into pieces, laying them in order with the wood upon the altar, and burning them." 
2. "The priests and Levites always stood in their ministry, some doing one thing, and some another; some slew the sacrifice, others sprinkled the blood; some took away the ashes, others laid the wood, others brought up the parts of the sacrifice when slain, skinned, and cut asunder, and laid them on the altar." 
3. "As it was but just and equitable that persons so employed should be maintained out of the revenues of the temple and altar, it is but right that Gospel ministers should be provided for with a suitable maintenance."
