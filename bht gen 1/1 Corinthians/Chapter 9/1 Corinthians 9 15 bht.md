## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "True, that each of these examples pointed to a form of ἐξουσία, and none of these forms had he made use of."
2. "I wrote (write) not these things however, that it may be thus (viz. after the examples which I have alleged) done to me."
3. "For it were good for me rather to die than that any one should make void my (matter of) boasting."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Paul's special gift of continency, which enabled him to abstain from marriage, and his ability to maintain himself without interrupting seriously his ministry, made that expedient to him which is ordinarily inexpedient."
2. "What to him was a duty, would be the opposite to one, for instance, to whom God had committed a family, without other means of support."
3. "Rather than hinder the progress of the Gospel by giving any pretext for a charge of interested motives, Paul would 'die' of hunger."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Though my right to a support is established, in common with others, both by reason, the nature of the case, the examples in the law, and the command of the Lord Jesus, yet there are reasons why I have not chosen to avail myself of this right, and why I have not urged these claims." 

2. "I neither ask you to send me now a support, nor, if I visit you again, do I expect you will contribute to my maintenance."

3. "Rather than forego these advantages, it would be better for me - it would be a thing which I would prefer - to pine in poverty and want; to be exposed to peril, and cold, and storms, until life should close. I esteem my 'glorying,' the advantages of my course, to be of more value than life itself."
