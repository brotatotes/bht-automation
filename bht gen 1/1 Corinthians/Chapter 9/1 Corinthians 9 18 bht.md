## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "His making the gospel to be without cost, was not his μισθός, but his καύχημα only: and these two are not identical."
2. "I am persuaded that the following is the true rendering: What then is my reward (in prospect) that I while preaching, render the gospel without cost (i.e. what reward have I in prospect that induces me to preach gratuitously) in order not to use (as carrying out my design not to use) [to the full] my power in the gospel?"
3. "The καύχημα was present: the μισθός, future."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "By making the Gospel without charge, where I might have rightfully claimed maintenance, I might 'win the more.'" 
2. "The 'reward' ultimately aimed at is the gaining of the more."
3. "The former, as involving the latter, is verbally made the answer to the question, 'What is my reward?' But really the 'reward' is that which is the ultimate aim of his preaching without charge, namely, that he may gain the more."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "What is there that will demonstrate that my heart is in the work of the ministry; that I am free and voluntary, and that I am not urged by mere necessity?"
2. "I will support myself by my own labor, and will thus show that I am not urged to preaching by mere 'necessity,' but that I love it."
3. "All that This case proves is, that it would be proper only where a 'necessity' was laid on a man, as it was on Paul; when he could not otherwise show that his heart was in the work, and that he was voluntary and loved it."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Abuse [καταχρησασθαι]. This word carries the idea of using something to its full extent or taking advantage of it. In this context, it refers to using the things of this world to their fullest extent, without becoming enslaved to them or allowing them to distract from our ultimate purpose." 

2. "Use to the full. This phrase emphasizes the idea of fully utilizing the resources and opportunities that God has given us, without allowing them to become idols or distractions. It is a call to be good stewards of the blessings we have been entrusted with, while keeping our focus on the eternal."

3. "The concept of 'use to the full' reminds us that everything in this world is temporary and passing away. It encourages us to prioritize the things of God and invest our time, energy, and resources in eternal matters, rather than getting caught up in the temporary pleasures and pursuits of this world."

### John Calvin:
1. "I am under the necessity of preaching the gospel: if I do it not, wo is unto me, for I resist God’s calling. But it is not enough to preach, unless I do it willingly; for he who fulfils the commandment of God unwillingly, does not act, as becomes him, suitably to his office." 
2. "Paul, it is true, went a greater length than the ordinary calling of pastors required, because he refrained from taking pay, which the Lord allows pastors to take. But as it was a part of his duty to provide against every occasion of offense that he foresaw, and as he saw, that the course of the gospel would be impeded, if he made use of his liberty, though that was out of the ordinary course, yet I maintain that even in that case he rendered to God nothing more than was due."
3. "Whatever works are comprehended under the law, are falsely termed works of supererogation, as is manifest from the words of Christ. When ye have done all things that are commanded you, say, We are unprofitable servants: we have done what we were bound to do."
