# 1 Corinthians 9:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, the apostle Paul demonstrates his ability to adapt and connect with different groups of people. He distinguishes between Jewish converts and those still under the law, acknowledging that he himself belonged nationally to the Jews but not religiously. Paul's intention was not to compromise his own beliefs but to gain the trust and affection of others, in hopes of eventually leading them towards embracing the teachings of the Gospel. He willingly conformed to Jewish customs and practices, all while maintaining his freedom from the law as a means of salvation.
