# 1 Corinthians 9:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the apostle Paul expresses his willingness to adapt and relate to different groups of people. He became like a heathen to the heathens, not holding himself bound by the ceremonial precepts of the Mosaic law. However, he was careful not to be lawless or without a sense of moral obligation. Instead, he understood himself to be under the law to Christ, guided by the principles of love and the teachings of Jesus. Paul's actions were motivated by his desire to gain the hearts of all people and lead them towards the gospel of Christ.
