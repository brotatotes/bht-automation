# 1 Corinthians 9:25 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The pursuit of victory and the Christian's spiritual growth mirror the rigorous discipline and self-control exhibited by athletes. Believers are called to embody temperance, denying themselves earthly indulgences in order to obtain an imperishable crown of eternal life. While temporary crowns of achievement may wither away, the invaluable nature of the eternal reward sets Christians apart. The self-denial and dedication required for the heavenly crown far surpasses any human efforts undertaken for fleeting earthly success.

2. "But if they value so highly a crown of leaves that quickly fades, what value ought we to set upon a crown of immortality?"

2. "Would you conquer in the Olympic games...you must be orderly, live on spare diet, avoid confections, practice gymnastics at the appointed time, in heat and cold, and drink neither cold water nor wine; in a word, you must give yourself up to the training-master, as to a physician, and then enter the lists." [1]
