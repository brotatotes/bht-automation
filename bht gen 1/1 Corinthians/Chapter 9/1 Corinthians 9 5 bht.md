### Henry Alford:
1. "Ostendit sibi licere quod ceteris Apostolis, id est ut non operetur manibus suis, sed ex Evangelio vivat:... ad hoc enim et fideles mulieres habentes terrenam substantiam ibant cum eis, et ministrabant eis de substantia sua." - Augustine, De Opere Monachorum, 4 (5), vol. vi. p. 552

2. "And from this misunderstanding of the passage grew up a great abuse, and such women are mentioned with reprobation by Epiphan. Hær. 78, vol. i. (ii. Migne), p. 1043, under the name of ἀγαπηταί." 

3. "Peter was married, see Matthew 8:14. A beautiful tradition exists of his encouraging his wife who was led to death, by saying μέμνησο, ὦ αὕτη, τοῦ κυρίου." - Clem [39] Alex. Strom. vii. § 11 (63), p. 868 P. Euseb. H. E. iii. 30. Clem [40] Alex. Strom, iii. § 6 (52), p. 535 P.

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Paul implies he did not exercise his undoubted right to marry and 'lead about' a believer, for the sake of Christian expediency, as well to save the Church the expense of maintaining her in his wide circuits, as also that he might give himself more undistractedly to building up the Church of Christ."
2. "Contrast the Corinthians' want of self-sacrifice in the exercise of their 'liberty' at the cost of destroying, instead of edifying, the Church."
3. "A confutation of Peter's self-styled followers, the Romanists, who exclude the clergy from marriage."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "To lead about - To have in attendance with us; to conduct from place to place; and to have them maintained at the expense of the churches amongst which we labor."
2. "It is evident from this that the apostles generally were married. The phrase used here is οἱ λοιποὶ ἀπόστολοι hoi loipoi apostoloi ('the remaining apostles,' or the other apostles). And if they were married, it is right and proper for ministers to marry now, whatever the papist may say to the contrary."
3. "It is right for missionaries to marry, and to take their wives with them to pagan lands. The apostles were missionaries, and spent their lives in pagan nations as missionaries do now, and there may be as good reasons for missionaries marrying now as there were then."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "A sister, a wife. Wrong Sister means a Christian woman, a fellow-member of the Church, as Romans 16:1; 1 Corinthians 7:15; James 2:15."
2. "It is in apposition with wife: A wife that is a sister, a believer."
3. "Such an one has also the right, like her husband, to be maintained by the Church."

### John Calvin:
1. "We confess that Peter was acknowledged as first among the Apostles, as it is necessary that in every society there should always be some one to preside over the others, and they were of their own accord prepared to respect Peter for the eminent endowments by which he was distinguished."
2. "That preeminence, however, was not lordship — nay more, it had nothing resembling lordship. For while he was eminent among the others, still he was subject to them as his colleagues."
3. "One thing farther must here be noticed, that the Apostles had no horror of marriage, which the Papal clergy so much abominate, as unbecoming the sanctity of their order."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The interpretation we refer to is, that the apostle is here claiming the right of preachers to follow our Lord’s example (Luke 8:1-3), who allowed rich women to follow Him and His apostles, ministering to them of their substance." 
2. "The great fluctuation in the Greek readings of this verse especially that strange reading ‘sisters, women’ is a proof (as has been well observed) of the desperate shifts to which people have been driven to obliterate the testimony against compulsory celibacy in the ministers of Christ which the true text of this verse contains."
3. "Though named hereafter 'the apostles,' it would not necessarily follow that none of these were themselves apostles, for 'Cephas,' one of the apostles, is named immediately after them."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "This is a plea for the support of the preacher's wife and children."
2. "Plainly Paul has no wife at this time."
3. "It was well known that Peter was married."

Note: The commentary is about 1 Corinthians 9:5.

### John Gill:
1. "The phrase 'a sister, a wife'...answers to אחתיכלה, 'my sister, spouse', Song of Solomon 4:9."
2. "The Jews called their wives, sisters, not on account of religion, but because of the common relation that men and women, all mankind, stand in to one another."
3. "These words clearly imply the lawfulness of a minister's marriage, and suppose it, yet they do not express the act itself, or the lawfulness of entering into such a state, but rather what follows after it."

### John Wesley:

3. "Who therefore, it is plain, did this." This quote refers to the other apostles, indicating that they also had the power to have a wife and provide for her.
