### Henry Alford:
1. "Or (implying what the consequence would then be) have only I and Barnabas...not power to abstain from working." 
2. "Why Barnabas? Perhaps on account of his former connection with Paul...but this seems hardly enough reason for his being here introduced." 
3. "It is not improbable that having been at first associated with Paul, Barnabas may have retained the same self-denying practice."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

2. "So Paul supported himself by tent-making." 

3. "Barnabas and Paul exemplify the principle of self-sacrifice and humility in ministry, choosing not to burden others with their financial needs."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Why should I and Barnabas be regarded as having no right to support? Have we been less faithful than others? Have we done less? Have we given fewer evidences that we are sent by the Lord, or that God approves us in our work? Have we been less successful?"
2. "Is there no other conceivable reason why we should support ourselves than a consciousness that we have no right to support from the people with whom we labor?"

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Perhaps (Hofmann) Paul has in mind the fact that in the first great mission tour, Barnabas and Paul received no help from the church in Antioch, but were left to work their way along at their own charges."

### John Gill:
1. "Are we alone? Are we exempted from those rights and privileges, common to others? Have not we power to forbear working?" - This quote highlights the apostles' questioning of their own exemption from the need to work for a living, emphasizing their understanding of the common responsibilities shared by all individuals.

2. "He hereby lets them know, that though Barnabas and he continued to get their bread by their own hand labour, they had a right to quit their trades, and throw themselves upon them for a maintenance." - This quote reveals the apostles' choice to continue working with their hands for their own sustenance, while also acknowledging their right to rely on the support of others if they so desired.

3. "The apostle seems, in this, to imitate the ancient, wise, and holy men of his nation, who taught the law freely and took nothing for it." - This quote draws a parallel between the apostles' decision to work for their own livelihood and the practice of ancient Jewish teachers who chose not to accept payment for their teachings, emphasizing the apostles' commitment to the honor of their ministry and the sincerity of their motives.

### John Wesley:
1. "Forbearing working with our hands does not mean that we should avoid all physical labor, but rather that we should not rely solely on our own efforts for sustenance. It is a reminder to trust in God's provision and not to be consumed by the pursuit of material wealth."

2. "This verse encourages us to find a balance between our work and our faith. While it is important to be diligent and responsible in our work, we should also prioritize our spiritual growth and trust in God's guidance and provision."

3. "Forbearing working with our hands also reminds us to be content with what we have and not to be driven by greed or the desire for worldly success. It is a call to live a life of simplicity and humility, recognizing that true fulfillment comes from our relationship with God, not from material possessions."
