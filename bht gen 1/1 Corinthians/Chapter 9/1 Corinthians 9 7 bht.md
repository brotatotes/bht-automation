# 1 Corinthians 9:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Ministers of the Gospel are likened to soldiers, vine-dressers, and shepherds according to various commentators. They are warriors engaged in a spiritual battle, deserving support for their selfless service. As vine-dressers, they nurture and tend to the growth of the church, while as shepherds, they guide and care for the flock of believers. It is only fair that those who dedicate their lives to the ministry receive sustenance and acknowledgment for their labor in spreading the word of God.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The work of the ministry is as arduous, and as self-denying, and perhaps as dangerous, as the work of a soldier; and common justice, therefore, demands that he who devotes his youth, and health and life to it, for the benefit of others should have a competent support." 
2. "Why should not he receive a competent support who seeks to save people, as well as he who lives to destroy them?" 
3. "He lives to instruct the ignorant; to warn and secure those who are in danger; to guide the perplexed; to reclaim the wandering; to comfort the afflicted; to bind up the broken in heart; to attend on the sick; to be an example and an instructor to the young; and to be a counsellor and a pattern to all."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The phrase, however, is incorrect as a translation, since the Greek word is used not only of war, but of military service in general." 
2. "More correctly, who serveth as a soldier? or, as Rev., what soldier servet?" 
3. "The minister of the gospel is beautifully compared with the soldier, vine-dresser, shepherd."

### John Calvin:
1. "I have, however, with the view of taking off somewhat of the harshness, rendered it in the preterite." 
2. "Now, by three comparisons, and these, too, taken from common life, he makes it out that it was allowable for him to live, if he chose, at the public expense of the Church."
3. "As natural equity points out this as reasonable, who will be so unjust as to refuse sustenance to the pastors of the Church?"

### Philip Schaff:
1. "This verse highlights the principle of fairness and justice in the context of Christian ministry. Just as a soldier is provided for by those he serves, and a farmer enjoys the fruit of his labor, so too should those who serve in the ministry be supported by the community they serve." 

2. "The imagery of planting a vineyard and not enjoying its fruit emphasizes the absurdity of expecting someone to work without receiving any benefit or compensation. It serves as a reminder that those who dedicate their lives to the service of others deserve to be taken care of."

3. "By mentioning the example of feeding a flock, the verse emphasizes the responsibility of providing for the needs of those who are under one's care. It highlights the importance of supporting and sustaining those who are called to shepherd and guide others in their spiritual journey."

### John Gill:
1. "Since ministers of the Gospel are the good soldiers of Jesus Christ, and are engaged in a warfare state, in fighting the good fight of faith, against his enemies, and those of his church, it is but reasonable that their charges should be bore, and they maintained at the public expense."
2. "The church of Christ is a vineyard, it is often so called in Scripture; ministers are planters, vinedressers, and labourers in it; and as the mystical Solomon, the owner of the vineyard, ought to have his thousand, the cultivators of it, the keepers of the fruit, should have their two hundred."
3. "The churches of Christ are compared to flocks of sheep; the ministers of the word are pastors, or shepherds, who have the care and oversight of them, and feed them with knowledge and understanding; and it is but right and just that they enjoy the fruit of their labours, and have a proper and suitable maintenance."
