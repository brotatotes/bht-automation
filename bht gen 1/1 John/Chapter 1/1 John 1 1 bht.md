## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Seeing is a more convincing proof than hearing of; handling, than even seeing." 
2. "Seen, namely, His glory, as revealed in the Transfiguration and in His miracles; and His passion and death in a real body of flesh and blood."
3. "Contrast the wisest of the heathen feeling after (the same Greek as here; groping after WITH THE HANDS") if haply they might find God."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Whatever there was respecting the Word of life, or him who is the living Word, the incarnate Son of God, from the very beginning, from the time when he was first manifested in the flesh; whatever there was respecting his exalted nature, his dignity, his character, that could be subjected to the testimony of the senses, to be the object of sight, or hearing, or touch, that I was permitted to see, and that I declare to you respecting him."
2. "John professes here to have seen enough in this respect to furnish evidence that he was the Son of God. It is not hearsay on which he relies, but he had the testimony of his own eyes in the case."
3. "The evidence that he appeared in the flesh was subjected to more senses than one; to the fact that his voice was heard; that he was seen with the eyes; that the most intense scrutiny had been employed; and, lastly, that he had been actually touched and handled, showing that it could not have been a mere appearance, an assumed form, but that it was a reality."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The successive clauses, that which was from the beginning, etc., express, not the Eternal Word Himself, but something relating to or predicated concerning Him."
2. "In the words 'from the beginning,' the writer looks back to the initial point of time, and describes what has been in existence from that point onward."
3. "The phrase 'the Word of the Life' does not elsewhere occur in a personal sense, but I incline to regard its primary reference as personal, from the obvious connection of the thought with John 1:1, John 1:4."

### John Calvin:
1. "Life has been exhibited to us in Christ; which, as it is an incomparable good, ought to rouse and inflame all our powers with a marvelous desire for it, and with the love of it."
2. "The Apostle’s object, in setting before us the vast good, yea, the chief and only true happiness which God has conferred on us, in his own Son, is to raise our thoughts above."
3. "To believe is not lightly to form an opinion, or to assent only to what is said, but a firm, undoubting conviction, so that we may dare to subscribe to the truth as fully proved."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "The Λογος is described by της ζωης (of life), while in John 1:4 he is called η ζωη (the Life) as here in verse 1 John 1:2 and as Jesus calls himself (John 11:25; John 14:6), an advance on the phrase here." 

2. "The reference goes beyond the Christian dispensation, beyond the Incarnation, to the eternal purpose of God in Christ (John 3:16), 'coeval in some sense with creation' (Westcott)."

3. "The perfect tense (active indicative of ακουω) stresses John's equipment to speak on this subject so slowly revealed. It is the literary plural unless John associates the elders of Ephesus with himself (Lightfoot) the men who certified the authenticity of the Gospel (John 21:24)."

4. "He could be heard and seen. That which we beheld (ο εθεασαμεθα). Repetition with the aorist middle indicative of θεαομα (the very form in John 1:14), 'a spectacle which broke on our astonished vision' (D. Smith)."

5. "Three senses are here appealed to (hearing, sight, touch) as combining to show the reality of Christ's humanity against the Docetic Gnostics and the qualification of John by experience to speak."

### John Gill:
1. "Jesus Christ is here intended, who in his divine nature was, really existed as a divine person, as the everlasting Jehovah, the eternal I AM, which is, and was, and is to come, and existed 'from the beginning'." 

2. "The apostles heard, and saw, and handled him; they not only heard a voice from heaven, declaring him to be the Son of God, but they often heard him speak himself, both in private conversation with them, and in his public ministry."

3. "They saw him in human nature, and the common actions of life he did, as eating, drinking, walking, c. and his many miracles they saw him raise the dead, cleanse the lepers, restore sight to the blind, cause the lame to walk, the dumb to speak, and the deaf to hear."

### John Wesley:
1. "That which was — Here means, He which was the Word himself; afterwards it means, that which they had heard from him."
2. "From the beginning — This phrase is sometimes used in a limited sense; but here it properly means from eternity, being equivalent with, 'in the beginning,' John 1:1."
3. "That which we — The apostles. Have not only heard, but seen with our eyes, which we have beheld - Attentively considered on various occasions."
