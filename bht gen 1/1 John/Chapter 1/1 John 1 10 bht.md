# 1 John 1:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
If we deny our sins, we are denying the truth of God's word, rejecting His declaration of our sinful nature. This rejection not only affects our relationship with Him but also hinders our spiritual growth and understanding. We must align our beliefs with God's truth and humbly acknowledge our need for His mercy and forgiveness. By embracing His word and confessing our sins, we open ourselves to the peace and restoration that comes from genuine repentance.

1) "The importance of the doctrine of the incarnation of the Son of God...It is the most wonderful of all the events...It is the most deeply connected with our welfare." 
2) "The intense interest which true piety always takes in this doctrine...no true Christian can look at the fact that the Son of God became incarnate but with the deepest emotion."
3) "It is an object of ardent desire with true Christians that all others should share their joys...every sincere Christian who is happy desires that all others should be happy too."
4) "Wherever there is true fellowship with God, there is with all true Christians...there is but one church, one family of God."

8) "We should, therefore, at all times exercise a cheerful confidence in God...with more absolute certainty we shall yet see him to be light."

15) "Peace of mind, when wrong has been done, can be found only in confession...When a man has done wrong, the least that he can do is to make confession; and when that is done and the wrong is pardoned, all is done that can be to restore peace to the soul."
16) "The 'ease' of salvation...all that is required is that there should be an acknowledgment of sin at the foot of the cross, and if this is done with a true heart the offender will be saved."

1. "Deny original sin, and that men are born in sin, but affirm they come into the world pure and holy; and assert that concupiscence is not sin; and so not regarding internal lusts and desires as sinful, only what is external, fancy they have so lived as to have been without sin."
2. "God, who in his word declares that the wicked are estranged from the womb, and go astray as soon as they be born, speaking lies; that his own people are transgressors from the womb; that all have sinned and come short of his glory; and that there is none that does good, no, not one, but all are under sin, under the power and guilt of it, and become filthy by it, and so obnoxious to the wrath of God."
3. "His word is not in us; either Christ the Word of God, or rather the word of God which declares these things; no regard is had unto it; it 'is not with us', as the Syriac and Ethiopic versions render it; it is not used and attended to as the rule and standard of truth, but is cast away and despised."
