1. "By the parenthesis John heaps reassurance upon his previous statement of the reality of the Incarnation by the use of εωρακαμεν (as in verse 1 John 1:1) with the assertion of the validity of his 'witness' (μαρτυρουμεν) and 'message' (απαγγελλομεν)." 

2. "Taking up ζωη of verse 1 John 1:1, John defines the term by the adjective αιωνιος, used 71 times in the N.T., 44 times with ζωη and 23 in John's Gospel and Epistles (only so used in these books by John). Here it means the divine life which the Logos was and is (John 1:4; 1 John 1:1)."

3. "Not εγενετο, but ην, and προς with the accusative of intimate fellowship, precisely as in John 1:1 ην προς τον θεον (was with God). Then John closes the parenthesis by repeating εφανερωθη."
