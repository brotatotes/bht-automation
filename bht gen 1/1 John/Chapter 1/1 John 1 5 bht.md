# 1 John 1:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
God is the source of all light and purity. He is the embodiment of wisdom, love, holiness, and glory. Just as light is essential for seeing in the natural world, God's light is necessary for our spiritual sight. There is no darkness in Him, no trace of impurity or evil. He is the purest and brightest light, unmatched in His perfection.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "GOD IS LIGHT." - This verse sets the tone for the entire passage, emphasizing the essence of God as light. It signifies purity, clarity, beauty, and glory, and serves as the condition for all life, growth, and joy.

2. "He is Light, and the Fountain of light material and light ethical." - This statement highlights the dual nature of light, both as a physical and ethical attribute of God. It suggests that those in communion with God and walking in His light are also of the light.

3. "There is not in Him any darkness at all." - This negation strengthens the affirmation of God's light and emphasizes the absence of ethical darkness in Him. It signifies the absence of ignorance, deceit, sin, and death, leaving no room for even the slightest speck of darkness.

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "As the Son announced the message heard from the Father as His apostle, so the Son's apostles announce what they have heard from the Son."
2. "What light is in the natural world, that God, the source of even material light, is in the spiritual, the fountain of wisdom, purity, beauty, joy, and glory."
3. "No, not even one speck of darkness; no ignorance, error, untruthfulness, sin, or death."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The peculiarity, the substance of all that he said, may be summed up in the declaration that God is light, and in the consequences which follow from this doctrine."
2. "God is light - Light, in the Scriptures, is the emblem of purity, truth, knowledge, prosperity, and happiness - as darkness is of the opposite."
3. "The expression here is designed to affirm that God is absolutely perfect; that there is nothing in him which is in any way imperfect, or which would dim or mar the pure splendor of his character."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "God is Light... Light is immaterial, diffusive, pure, and glorious. It is the condition of life. Physically, it represents glory; intellectually, truth; morally, holiness."
2. "Light enkindles love... Well I perceive how is already shining Into thine intellect the eternal Light, That only seen enkindles always love."
3. "In Him is no darkness at all... And darkness there is not in Him, no, not in any way."

### John Calvin:
1. "For his object here was not to include the whole doctrine of the Gospel, but to show that if we desire to enjoy Christ and his blessings, it is required of us to be conformed to God in righteousness and holiness."
2. "When, therefore, God on the other hand is called the Father of light, and also light, we first understand that there is nothing in him but what is bright, pure, and unalloyed; and, secondly, that he makes all things so manifest by his brightness, that he suffers nothing vicious or perverted, no spots or filth, no hypocrisy or fraud, to lie hid."
3. "Then, the meaning is, that God is such a light, that no darkness belongs to him. It hence follows, that he hates an evil conscience, pollution, and wickedness, and everything that pertains to darkness."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "As the apostle condenses the whole of the revelation of Christ’s Person into one word ‘was manifested,’ so he condenses the sum of His teaching into one word ‘message.’"
2. "The subject is fellowship with God; that is, the possession of something common to God and to us. This is hereafter love, ‘God is love;’ here it is light, or unmingled and diffusive holiness."
3. "Holiness in God repels evil, and that to the sinner is its first aspect: ‘in Him is no darkness’ of sin that can be common to Him and us. But holiness in Him is diffusive, as the light is, or it could not become common to Him and to His saints."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Mutual fellowship depends on mutual knowledge." 
2. "Old word, in N.T. only here and 1 John 3:11." 
3. "God is light. Precisely so the Λογος is light and what Jesus claimed to be."
