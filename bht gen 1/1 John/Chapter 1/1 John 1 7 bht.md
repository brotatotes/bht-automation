# 1 John 1:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Walking in the light, as God is in the light, is more than just imitating God; it is an essential aspect of our daily walk with Him. It involves embracing the truth, being ruled by the fear of God, and devoting ourselves wholly to Him. By walking in the light, we are purified from our sins day by day through the cleansing blood of Jesus Christ. This fellowship with God allows us to have true communion with other believers, proving that our hearts have been reconciled to Him and demonstrating our identity as children of God.
