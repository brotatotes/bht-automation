# 1 John 1:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, we are reminded of the importance of confessing our sins to both God and others, as it is through confession that we open ourselves up to receive forgiveness. The verse emphasizes that when we confess our sins, we are acknowledging our offenses and seeking reconciliation with God. We are assured that God is faithful and just, ready to forgive us and cleanse us from all unrighteousness. It is through God's righteous and merciful nature that we find redemption and the assurance that our sins will be pardoned.
