## BHT:
The verse being described in the commentaries is about the concept of abiding in the light through brotherly love. It is emphasized that when one loves their brother sincerely and serves them, they continue in the light of grace. This love is not the cause of their light, but rather an evidence of it. It is mentioned that in this love, there is no wrath or malice, and it prevents the commission of other sins. By abiding in this love, one has a free and unburdened journey in the light of God.
