# 1 John 2:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Bible verse describes the condition of someone who harbors hatred towards their brother. This person is in a continuous state of darkness, lacking love for others, and being unable to discern between good and evil. This darkness affects every aspect of their life, clouding their understanding and causing them to stumble through life without clarity or direction. Ultimately, they are unaware of the perilous path they are on, unaware of the dangers and consequences that lie ahead.
