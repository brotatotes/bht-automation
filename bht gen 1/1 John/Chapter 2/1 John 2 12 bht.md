## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "He calls ALL to whom he writes, 'little sons'... Our Lord, whose Spirit John so deeply drank into, used to His disciples the term 'little sons,' or dear sons and daughters." 

2. "It is an undesigned coincidence with the Epistle here, that in John's Gospel somewhat similarly the classification, 'lambs, sheep, sheep,' occurs." 

3. "ALL God's sons and daughters alike enjoy this privilege [of being forgiven]."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The author of this Epistle was evidently accustomed to express his thoughts in a great variety of ways, having even the appearance of tautology, that the exact idea might be before his readers, and that his meaning might not be misapprehended."
2. "There were probably quite young children in the church in the time of the apostle John, for the word would naturally convey that idea."
3. "Such children, if worthy the attention of an aged apostle, should receive the particular notice of pastors now. The hopes of a church are in them. Their minds are susceptible to impression. The character of the piety in the next age will depend on their views of religion."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Little children" refers to the readers in general, not just children in age.

### John Calvin:
1. "But still we ought ever to take heed, lest the doctrine of faith be smothered, — that doctrine which teaches that Christ is the only author of salvation and of all blessings; on the contrary, such moderation ought to be presented, that faith may ever retain its own primacy." 
2. "Without this assurance, religion would not be otherwise than fading and shadowy; nay, they who pass by the free remission of sins, and dwell on other things, build without a foundation." 
3. "The material cause is mentioned, lest we should seek other means to reconcile us to God... we see that by the craft of Satan, and by the wicked fictions of men, this way is obstructed; for foolish men attempt to pacify God by various satisfactions, and devise innumerable kinds of expiations for the purpose of redeeming themselves."
