# 1 John 2:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the Apostle speaks of the last time, referring to the closing period before the ultimate completion of the world. It is a time of struggle, with the rise of false teachings and opposition to Christ. Antichrist, in various forms, opposes Christ and may be disguised as Christ. The signs of the last time were present in the Apostle's era, and continue to manifest through the many false teachers and deniers of Christ. However, amidst these challenges, we are reminded to eagerly await the coming of Christ, aware that He is not far off.
