# 1 John 2:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, Jesus is described as the propitiation for our sins, reconciling us with God and appeasing His wrath. His sacrifice is not only for those who currently believe, but also for the sins of all people, extending to the whole world. Jesus' death serves as the means by which God's anger is turned away and His forgiveness and salvation are made available to everyone.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Christ has, as our ἱλασμός or ἱλαστήριον, i.e. as a sin-offering, reconciled God and us by nothing else but by His voluntary death as a sacrifice: has by this averted God’s wrath from us."
2. "According to the constant usage of Scripture, God is in so far ἵλεως in regard to the sins of men, as He suffers His ἔλεος to prevail instead of His ὀργή."
3. "The reason of the insertion of the particular here, is well given by Luther: 'It is a patent fact that thou too art a part of the whole world: so that thine heart cannot deceive itself and think, The Lord died for Peter and Paul, but not for me.'"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "He is our all-prevailing Advocate, because He is Himself 'the propitiation'; the propitiatory sacrifice, provided by the Father's love, removing the estrangement, and appeasing the righteous wrath, on God's part, against the sinner."
2. "The only other place in the New Testament where Greek 'propitiation' occurs, is 1 John 4:10; it answers in the Septuagint to Hebrew, 'caphar,' to effect an atonement or reconciliation with God."
3. "Christ's 'advocacy' is limited to believers: His propitiation extends as widely as sin extends."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The proper meaning of the word is that of reconciling, appeasing, turning away anger, rendering propitious or favorable."
2. "The essential thoughts in regard to him, as implied in this word, are: (1)That his will has been disregarded, and his law violated, and that he has reason to be offended with us; (2)That in that condition he cannot, consistently with his perfections, and the good of the universe, treat us as if we had not done it; (3)That it is proper that, in some way, he should show his displeasure at our conduct, either by punishing us, or by something that shall answer the same purpose; and, (4)That the means of propitiation come in here, and accomplish this end, and make it proper that he should treat us as if we had not sinned; that is, he is reconciled, or appeased, and his anger is turned away."
3. "The amount, then, in regard to the propitiation made for sin is, that it removes all obstacles to reconciliation on the part of God: it does whatever is necessary to be done to maintain the honor of His law, His justice, and His truth; it makes it consistent for Him to offer pardon - that is, it removes whatever there was that made it necessary to inflict punishment, and thus, so far as the word can be applied to God, it appeases Him, or turns away His anger, or renders Him propitious."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The construction is to be particularly noted; for, in the matter of our sins; the genitive case of that for which propitiation is made."
2. "The change from this construction shows...that the scriptural conception of the verb is not that of appeasing one who is angry, with a personal feeling, against the offender; but of altering the character of that which, from without, occasions a necessary alienation, and interposes an inevitable obstacle to fellowship."
3. "The propitiation is as wide as the sin."

### John Calvin:
1. "The expiation made by Christ extends to all who by faith embrace the gospel."
2. "The design of John was no other than to make this benefit common to the whole Church."
3. "Then under the word all or whole, he does not include the reprobate, but designates those who should believe as well as those who were then scattered through various parts of the world."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "He himself in his own person, both priest and sacrifice." - This highlights the unique role of Jesus as both the priest and the sacrifice, emphasizing his central role in the redemption of humanity (Hebrews 9:14).

2. "Christ himself is the means of propitiation for our sins." - This emphasizes that Jesus is the ultimate source of reconciliation and forgiveness for our sins, serving as the propitiation or atoning sacrifice (1 John 4:10).

3. "The propitiation by Christ provides for salvation for all if they will only be reconciled with God." - This reminds us that Jesus' sacrifice is sufficient for the salvation of all people, but it requires a personal decision to be reconciled with God (2 Corinthians 5:19-21).

### John Gill:
1. "And he is the propitiation for our sins,.... For the sins of us who now believe, and are Jews:and not for ours only; but for the sins of Old Testament saints, and of those who shall hereafter believe in Christ, and of the Gentiles also."
2. "Nothing is more common in Jewish writings than to call the Gentiles עלמא, 'the world'; andכל העולם, 'the whole world'; and אומות העולם, 'the nations of the world'."
3. "The phrase 'all the world', or 'the whole world', in Scripture, unless when it signifies the whole universe, or the habitable earth, is always used in a limited sense, either for the Roman empire, or the churches of Christ in the world, or believers, or the present inhabitants of the world, or a part of them only."

### John Wesley:
1. "He is the propitiation...by which the wrath of God is appeased." 
2. "For our sins...who believe." 
3. "Not for ours only, but also for the sins of the whole world."
