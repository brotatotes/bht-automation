# 1 John 2:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, it is revealed that denying or rejecting the Son ultimately results in a lack of knowledge and communion with the Father. To deny the Son is to deny the essence of both the Son and the Father. By acknowledging and believing in the Son, one not only reveals the true nature of the Father but also establishes a deep connection and communion with Him. The denial or acceptance of the Son directly impacts one's relationship with the Father, and true understanding of God can only be found through a knowledge of the Lord Jesus Christ.
