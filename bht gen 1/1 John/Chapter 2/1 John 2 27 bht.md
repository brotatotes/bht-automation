# 1 John 2:27 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Bible verse being described is a reminder that believers have received an anointing from God, specifically the Holy Spirit, who serves as their teacher and guide. This anointing remains with them, keeping them from dangerous errors and enabling them to understand the truth. It is a divine influence that permanently abides, ensuring their faithfulness and independence from human teachings. The Spirit teaches them all things necessary for their spiritual growth and guards them against false teachings propagated by the enemy. Abiding in God and relying on the Spirit's guidance is both comforting and exhortative for believers.
