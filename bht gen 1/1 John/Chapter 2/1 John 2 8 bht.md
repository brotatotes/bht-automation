# 1 John 2:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse being described is a commandment, given by Jesus, that encompasses the concept of love. Though it is called "new," it has been in existence since the beginning and has been emphasized by various commentators. It is a commandment that requires believers to live in love not only towards one another but also towards their enemies. This commandment serves as a reflection of God's love for humanity and the transformation that occurs through embracing the light of Christ, leaving behind the darkness of sin and ignorance.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1) "The commandment is a new one: new as regards you, because you are newly come from darkness into light: new as regards Him, because He uttered it when He came into the world to lighten every man, and began that shining which even now continues."
2) "The Apostle has made what is apparently a paradoxical assertion. He has stated that the commandment is not new but old, and then has, notwithstanding, asserted its newness."
3) "You are living in a time when the darkness is rolling away, even now passing: so that the command, which is of the Light, is well said to be 'new'."

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Christianity first put love to brethren on the new and highest MOTIVE, instinctive love to Him who first loved us, constraining us to love all, even enemies, thereby walking in the steps of Him who loved us when enemies."
2. "The new commandment finds its truth in its practical realization in the walk of Christians in union with Christ."
3. "The repetition of 'in' before 'you,' 'in Him and in you,' implies that the love commandment finds its realization separately: first it did so 'in Him,' and then it does so 'in us,' in so far as we now 'also walk even as He walked'; and yet it finds its realization also conjointly, by the two being united in one sentence, even as it is by virtue of the love commandment having been first fulfilled in Him, that it is also now fulfilled in us, through His Spirit in us."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "And yet, that which I write to you, and particularly enjoin on you, deserves in another sense to be called a new commandment, though it has been also inculcated from the beginning, for it was called new by the Saviour himself."
2. "There can be no doubt here that John refers to the commandment to 'love one another,' and that it is here called new, not in the sense that John inculcated it as a novel doctrine, but in the sense that the Saviour called it such."
3. "The ancient systems of error, under which people hated each other, have passed away, and you are brought into the light of the true religion. Once you were in darkness, like others; now the light of the pure gospel shines around you, and that requires, as its distinguishing characteristic, love."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The commandment of love is both old and new."
2. "The fact that the old commandment is new is true in Him and in us."
3. "The darkness...means moral insensibility to the divine light; moral blindness or obtuseness."
4. "The passing is not represented as accomplished, but as in progress."
5. "The true light is the revelation of God in Christ."

### John Calvin:
1. "He says new, because God, as it were, renews it by daily suggesting it, so that the faithful may practice it through their whole life, for nothing more excellent can be sought for by them."
2. "John denies that the doctrine respecting brotherly love is of this kind, is one which grows old with time, but that it is perpetually in force, so that it is no less the highest perfection than the very beginning."
3. "Let him, then, who would reach the goal of wisdom, as to the right way of living, make proficiency in love."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "To walk as Christ walked is to put in practice the old commandment and so make it new (ever new and fresh), as love is as old as man and fresh in every new experience." 
2. "This newness is shown supremely in Christ and in disciples when they walk as Jesus did." 
3. "Dawn is here. Is John thinking of the second coming of Christ or of the victory of truth over error, of light over darkness?"

### John Gill:
1. "The command of brotherly love is a new one; that is, it is an excellent one, as a new name is an excellent name, and a new song is an excellent one."
2. "The love which this new commandment requires is really and truly in the saints, implanted in them in regeneration, is a fruit of the Spirit, and which faith works by, and will always continue in them."
3. "The darkness of sin and ignorance, of a state of nature, and of the kingdom of Satan, in which the people of God are before conversion; which then passes away gradually, by little and little, for it is not removed at once, or wholly gone."

### John Wesley:
1. "A commandment which, though it also was given long ago, yet is truly new in him and in you." 
2. "It was exemplified in him, and is now fulfilled by you, in such a manner as it never was before."
3. "For there is no comparison between the state of the Old Testament believers, and that which ye now enjoy: the darkness of that dispensation is passed away; and Christ the true light now shineth in your hearts."
