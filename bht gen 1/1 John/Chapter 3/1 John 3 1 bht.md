# 1 John 3:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Through the comments of commentators like John Gill and John Wesley, we gain a deeper understanding of the Bible verse being described. This verse speaks of the incredible love bestowed upon believers by the Father, not just in name, but in reality. It highlights the privilege of being called the children of God, a relationship that the world may not understand. Believers, in their devotion and identity as God's children, may seem mysterious and perplexing to those who do not share their faith.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "What manner of love is love itself, or does it import some gift, bestowal, or fruit of love?"
2. "The reality of a believer’s sonship of God, and his non-recognition by the world, are thus necessarily connected together."
3. "It is the world’s ignorance of God, considered as one great act of non-recognition, disobedience, rebellion, hate, which makes them incapable of recognizing, loving, sympathizing with, those who are veritably children of God."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "All our doing of righteousness is a mere sign that God, of His matchless love, has adopted us as children; it does not save us, but is a proof that we are saved of His grace."
2. "He does not say that God hath given us some gift, but love itself and the fountain of all honors, the heart itself, and that not for our works or efforts, but of His grace."
3. "With God to call is to make really to be. Who so great as God? What nearer relationship than that of sons? The oldest manuscripts add, 'And we ARE SO' really."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Even God could bestow upon us no more valuable token of affection than that we should be adopted into His family, and permitted to regard Him as our Father."
2. "A prince could manifest no higher love for a wandering, ragged, vicious orphan boy, found in the streets, than by adopting him into his own family, and admitting him to the same privileges and honors as his own sons; and yet this would be a trifle compared with the honor which God has bestowed on us."
3. "The people of the world regard us as fanatics or enthusiasts; as foolish in abandoning the pleasures and pursuits which they engage in; as renouncing certain happiness for that which is uncertain; as cherishing false and delusive hopes in regard to the future, and as practicing needless austerities, with nothing to compensate for the pleasures which are abandoned."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Behold ye. The plural is peculiar. The usual form is the singular ide or ijdou." 
2. "Originally it means from what country or race; then, of what sort or quality. It is used of the quality of both persons and things." 
3. "Emphasizing the endowment of the receiver. Compare carizomai, from cariv grace, favor, which emphasizes the goodwill of the giver."

### John Calvin:
1. "This being so great a favor, the desire for purity ought to be kindled in us, so as to be conformed to his image; nor, indeed, can it be otherwise, but that he who acknowledges himself to be one of God’s children should purify himself."
2. "He, in short, means that the more abundantly God’s goodness has been manifested towards us, the greater are our obligations to him."
3. "It behooves us especially to understand this doctrine; for since the only cause of our salvation is adoption, and since the Apostle testifies that this flows from the mere love of God alone, there is nothing left to our worthiness or to the merits of works."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Behold! as an exclamation, and thus standing alone, occurs only here. It is the tranquil expression of adoring wonder."
2. "The gift of love, nowhere else said to be given, should not be limited in meaning to demonstration or proof or token: it is love itself which is made ours."
3. "The apostle would have chosen another form of expression if he had meant only the great love shown in our being called sons. Observe, however, that 'sons' is not used, but 'children.'"


### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "What manner of love (ποταπην αγαπην). Qualitative interrogative as in 2 Peter 3:11; Matthew 8:27. Only here in John's writings. Originally of what country or race." 

2. "Hath bestowed (δεδωκεν). Perfect active indicative of διδωμ, state of completion, 'the endowment of the receiver' (Vincent)."

3. "Children (τεκνα). As in John 1:12 and with an allusion to γεγεννητα in 1 John 2:29 in an effort 'to restore the waning enthusiasm of his readers, and to recall them to their first love' (Brooke)."

### John Gill:
1. "Behold what manner of love...the Father hath bestowed upon us." 
2. "It is not a mere name that is bestowed, but the thing itself in reality." 
3. "The saints are the sons of God...by grace, the grace of adoption."

### John Wesley:
1. "That we should be called — That is, should be, the children of God." This quote highlights the significance of being called the children of God, emphasizing the special relationship believers have with Him.

2. "Therefore the world knoweth us not." This quote acknowledges the world's lack of understanding and recognition of believers. It emphasizes the idea that the ways of God and His children are often mysterious and incomprehensible to those who do not share the same faith.

3. "We are a mystery to them." This quote further emphasizes the enigmatic nature of believers to the world. It suggests that the actions, beliefs, and values of believers may be perplexing to those who do not share the same spiritual perspective.
