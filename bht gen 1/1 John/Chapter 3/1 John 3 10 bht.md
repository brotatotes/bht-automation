## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The assertion πᾶς ὁ μὴ κ . τ . λ ., is requisite for the carrying out fully of the  ἐν τούτῳ , which at the same time looks backward and forward: backward, for the children of God have already been designated by the absence of sin, 1 John 3:9 ; forward, for the children of the devil are designated below by the presence of sin in the second half of the verse."
2. "In this (fact, circumstance:  in better than  by , which gives the idea that this is the  only sign)  are manifest the children of God and the children of the devil."
3. "Every one that doeth not righteousness is not of God (= is not a child of God. It may be observed that Orig, Tert, Cypr, al. read ὁ μὴ ὢν δίκαιος, which is edited by Lachmann)."
