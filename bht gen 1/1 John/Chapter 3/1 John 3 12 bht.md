## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Cain erat filius non Dei sed diaboli, non generatione, sed imitatione et suggestione." (Corn.-a-lap.) 
2. "Cain murdered his brother: therefore he hated him: and hate belongs to the children of the evil one, classes him at once among those whose works are evil, and who hate those who, like Abel, are testified to (Heb 11:4) that they are of the children of God who work righteousness." 
3. "Whatever might be the exciting occasion of the murder, this lay at the root the hatred which the children of the devil ever bear to the children of God."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "evil one," to accord with "Because his own works were evil." Compare, "of the devil," in contrast to "of God," 1 John 3:10.
2. "slew he him? Because his own works were evil, and his brother's righteous—through envy and hatred of his brother's piety, owing to which God accepted Abel's, but rejected Cain's offering."
3. Enmity from the first existed between the seed of the woman and the seed of the serpent.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Not as Cain - Not manifesting the spirit which Cain did. His was a most remarkable and striking instance of a want of love to a brother, and the case was well adapted to illustrate the propriety of the duty which the apostle is enjoining."
2. "Who was of that wicked one - Of the devil; that is, he was under his influence, and acted from his instigation."
3. "And wherefore slew he him? - Because his own works were evil, and his brother’s righteous.” He acted under the influence of envy."

These quotes highlight the significance of the story of Cain and Abel in illustrating the importance of brotherly love and the consequences of its absence. They also emphasize the role of envy and the influence of evil in Cain's actions.

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Cain who was [καιν ην] . Who is not in the Greek. The construction is irregular."
2. "Slew [εσφαξεν] . The verb occurs only in John, and only here outside of Revelation."
3. "Thence, generally, to slay or kill."

### John Calvin:
1. "This righteousness alone is approved by God, that is, if we love one another."
2. "Brotherly love, as it proceeds from the love of God as an effect from a cause, is not disjoined from it."
3. "When impiety rules, hatred occupies the first place."

These quotes emphasize the importance of love and brotherly affection in the eyes of God, and highlight the destructive nature of hatred and impiety. They also encourage believers to endure persecution and hatred without provocation, following the example of Abel.

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Of the evil one" - The reference here is to the devil, as clarified in 1 John 3:10. This suggests that Cain's actions were influenced by the evil one, highlighting the spiritual battle between good and evil.

It serves as a cautionary reminder of the destructive power of envy and the importance of guarding our hearts against such feelings.
