# 1 John 3:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Do not be amazed or surprised, brethren, if the world hates you. The world's hatred towards believers is not unfounded nor unusual, but rather a response to the stark contrast between the values of the world and the values of Christ. Believers should expect this animosity, for they stand for truth and righteousness, which can be seen as a threat to the sinful desires of the world. As followers of Christ, we should not be discouraged by the world's hatred, but rather take it as a confirmation that we are faithfully living according to God's will.
