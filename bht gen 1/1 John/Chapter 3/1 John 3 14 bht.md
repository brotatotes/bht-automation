# 1 John 3:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse being described is about the transformative power of love and its connection to passing from spiritual death to life. According to the commentators, love for fellow believers is not the cause of this transformation, but rather evidence of it. It is emphasized that the absence of love signifies spiritual death, while genuine love for others is a sign of being born of God. Through regeneration, individuals move from a state of sin and separation to a life of sanctification, with implanted principles of grace and life.
