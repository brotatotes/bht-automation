# 1 John 3:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the commentators emphasize the deep connection between love and hate, life and death. Hatred is equated with murder, both in terms of its inner disposition and its potential consequences. The gravity of hatred is underscored, as it is seen as a breach of God's commandments and a sign of spiritual death. On the other hand, love is shown to be the essence of eternal life, a transformative power that leads to righteousness and fellowship with God.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1) "In the ethical depth of the Apostle’s view, love and hate, like light and darkness, life and death, necessarily replace, as well as necessarily exclude, one another."
2) "He who hates his brother is stated to be an ἀνθρωποκτόνος. The example given, 1 John 3:12, showed the true and normal result of hate."
3) "Eternal life, which abides in God’s children, which is the living growth of the seed of God in them, is evidenced by love: if the very crown and issue of hate, homicide, be present, it is utterly impossible that this germ of life can be coexistent with it."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Love and hatred, like light and darkness, life and death, necessarily replace, as well as necessarily exclude, one another."
2. "Whereas, 1 John 3:14 desires us to lay down our lives for the brethren; duels require one (awful to say!) to risk his own life, rather than not deprive another of life."
3. "God regards the inward disposition as tantamount to the outward act which would flow from it."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The private malice, the secret grudge, the envy which is cherished in the heart, is murderous in its tendency."
2. "The apostle does not say that he who hates his brother, though he does not in fact commit murder, is guilty to the same degree as if he had actually done it; but he evidently means to say that the spirit which would lead to murder is there, and that God will hold him responsible for it."
3. "What a fearful declaration, then, is this! How many real murderers there are on the earth besides those who are detected and punished, and besides those open violators of the laws of God and man who go at large!"

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The contrast is suggestive between the sentiment embodied in this statement and that of Pagan antiquity respecting murder."
2. "Among the Greeks, to have killed a man was considered in the light of misfortune, or, at most, a prudential error."
3. "The religion of the age takes no notice of the act whatever."

### John Calvin:
1. "To stimulate us still more to love, he shews how detestable before God is hatred."
2. "The Apostle declares that all who hate their brethren are murderers."
3. "The very desire to do harm, as well as the attempt, is condemned before God."

### John Wesley:
1. "He, I say, abideth in spiritual death, is void of the life of God."
2. "For whosoever hateth his brother, and there is no medium between loving and hating him, is, in God's account, a murderer: every degree of hatred being a degree of the same temper which moved Cain to murder his brother."
