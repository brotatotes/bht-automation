# 1 John 3:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
True love is not just a matter of words but something that is embodied in our actions and demonstrated through sacrifices made for the good of others. Our hearts, as the seat of our feelings, act as witnesses, justifying or accusing us before God. Assurance of our faith is not meant to be an extraordinary occurrence but a regular experience for believers. Love is a manifestation of our true relationship with God, serving as evidence that we are born of the truth, and it brings peace and assurance in the presence of God.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Having herein the truth radically, we shall be sure not to love merely in word and tongue." 
2. "The 'heart,' as the seat of the feelings, is our inward judge; the conscience, as the witness, acts either as our justifying advocate, or our condemning accuser, before God even now." 
3. "Assurance is designed to be the ordinary experience and privilege of the believer."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "By this; that is, by the fact that we have true love to others, and that we manifest it by a readiness to make sacrifices to do them good."
2. "To be of the truth stands opposed to cherishing false and delusive hopes."
3. "We shall in this way allay the doubts and trouble of our minds, and produce a state of quiet and peace, to wit, by the evidence that we are of the truth."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The primitive meaning persuade."
2. "The secondary and consequent sense, assure, quiet, conciliate."

### John Calvin:
1. "If we, in truth, love our neighbors, we have an evidence that we are born of God, who is truth, or that the truth of God dwells in us."
2. "Love is accessory or an inferior aid, a prop to our faith, not a foundation on which it rests."
3. "Then love is accessory or an inferior aid, a prop to our faith, not a foundation on which it rests."

These quotes emphasize the importance of love as evidence of our faith and relationship with God, but also clarify that love is not the foundation of our faith. They highlight the role of the Holy Spirit in producing love in us and the necessity of a good conscience in our assurance before God.
