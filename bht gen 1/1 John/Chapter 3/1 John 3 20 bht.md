# 1 John 3:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, we are reminded that God's knowledge and judgment are far greater than our own. Our own conscience may accuse and condemn us for our sins, but God, being all-knowing and just, perceives even the hidden sins and thoughts of our hearts. No external acts of piety can soothe or persuade our condemning hearts, but finding peace requires acknowledging God's superior judgment and earnestly seeking His forgiveness and grace.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "If our heart condemn us not, we have confidence towards God." 
2. "The condemning testimony of our conscience is not alone, but is a token of One sitting above our conscience and greater than our conscience: because our conscience is but the faint echo of His voice who knoweth all things: if it condemn us, how much more He?"
3. "The doing of such works is the working of the life of Christ in us: they are its sign, they its fruits: they are not of us, but of it and of Him."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Lord, Thou knowest all things: thou knowest that I love Thee." - Peter's appeal to the all-knowing God, acknowledging his love despite his past sin of denying the Lord.

2. "If our heart judges us unfavorably, we may be sure that He, knowing more than our heart knows, judges us more unfavorably still." - The condemning testimony of our conscience is not alone, but is the echo of the voice of God who is greater and knows all things.

3. "This gaining over the heart to peace is not so advanced a stage as the having CONFIDENCE towards God which flows from a heart condemning us not." - Gaining assurance and peace in our hearts, knowing that God is greater than our self-condemnation, is a step towards having confidence in God.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "We cannot hope for peace from any expectation that our own hearts will never accuse us, or that we ourselves can approve of all that we have done."
2. "If our hearts condemn us for present insincerity, and for secret sins, we can never 'persuade' or soothe them by any external act of piety."
3. "We cannot hope to find peace by hiding anything from his view, or by any supposition that he is not acquainted with the sins for which our consciences trouble us."
4. "He knows all the sins which we have forgotten; all those acts which we endeavor to persuade ourselves are not sinful, but which are evil in his sight."
5. "Peace cannot be found in the indulgence of sin in the hope that God will not perceive or regard it, for we can sooner deceive ourselves than we can him."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "For [οτι] . To be rendered not as a conjunction (for, because) but as a relative, in whatsoever or whereinsoever."
2. "Condemn [καταγινωσκη] . The word occurs only three times in the New Testament; here, ver. 21, and Galatians 2:11. It signifies (1.) To note accurately, usually in a bad sense. Hence to detect... (2.) To note judicially: to accuse: to accuse one's self."
3. "Because [οτι] . This second oti does not appear in the A. V. It is a conjunction. Greater [μειζων] . Is this superior greatness to be regarded as related to God's judgment, or to His compassion? If to His judgment, the sense is: God who is greater than our heart and knows all things, must not only endorse but emphasize our self-accusation."

### John Calvin:
1. "For if any one is conscious of guilt, and is condemned by his own heart, much less can he escape the judgment of God."
2. "He says, that God is greater than our heart, with reference to judgment, that is, because he sees much more keenly than we do, and searches more minutely and judges more severely."
3. "The meaning is now clear, that since the knowledge of God penetrates deeper than the perceptions of our conscience, no one can stand before him except the integrity of his conscience sustains him."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Whereinsoever our heart condemn us... It means to know something against one, to condemn." 
2. "Because God is greater than our heart... God's omniscience is linked with his love and sympathy." 
3. "God knows every secret in our hearts. This difficult passage strikes the very centre of Christian truth."

### John Gill:
1. "The conscience, which is meant by the heart here, is accuser, witness and judge; it accuses of the evil of sin, and is as good as a thousand witnesses; and upon its own testimony pronounces guilty, and condemns."
2. "God is greater than our heart: for he is the Maker of it, and he has the power over it, and the management of it; it is in his hands, and to be turned by him as he pleases; and he is the searcher and trier of it; and besides, is a swifter witness than conscience, and a superior Judge unto it."
3. "If the hearts of believers accuse, reprove, and condemn for sin through unbelief, or want of clear view of pardon and righteousness by Christ, God is greater, as in power, so in knowledge, than the hearts of men; and he knows the thoughts he has towards them, which are of peace, and not of evil."

### John Wesley:
1. "God, who is greater than our heart - An infinitely holier and a more impartial Judge."
2. "Knoweth all things — So that there is no hope of hiding it from him."
3. "If in anything our heart, our own conscience, condemn us, much more does God."
