# 1 John 3:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the commentators shed light on the importance of having a heart that does not condemn us. They emphasize that it does not imply sinlessness but rather the assurance of fellowship with God, providing boldness and confidence in our relationship with Him. This confidence extends to our communication with God, as our prayers will be answered when we have a heart that aligns with His Word. It is through this confidence that we can approach God with full assurance, knowing that He hears our prayers and will answer them according to His will.
