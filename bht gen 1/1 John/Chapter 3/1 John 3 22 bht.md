# 1 John 3:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Believers, as children of God, approach Him in prayer seeking His will, humbly surrendering their own. Their prayers, being the voice of the Spirit in them, are naturally and necessarily answered by God. As children of God, their prayers please Him, as they are evidence of their faith, showing that they walk in obedience and seek to please Him. The faithful receive from God, relying on Christ as the mediator, and they strive to discern His will and put it into practice, pleasing Him in their worship and obedience.
