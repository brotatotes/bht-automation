# 1 John 3:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This verse captures the essence of the believer's journey towards purity and restoration. With a hope firmly anchored in God and His promises, believers are called to purify themselves, not in their own strength, but through the power and grace of the Father. The hope of being like Christ propels them to strive diligently, seeking complete purification from all defilement. Ultimately, this hope leads believers to the perfect pattern of purity in Christ, and through their cooperation with Him, they are enabled to become like Him in holiness.
