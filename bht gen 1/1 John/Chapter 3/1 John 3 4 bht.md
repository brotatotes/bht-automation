# 1 John 3:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Sin is rebellion against God's authority and a violation of His holy law. It encompasses any transgression, big or small, and is characterized by a persistent pattern of disobedience. Sin is not only a deviation from moral codes, but also a disregard for God's authority. It leads to a separation from God and a need for repentance and transformation.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Every sin whatever then is a transgression of God’s law: as indeed its very name implies: ἁμαρτάνειν being to miss a mark, and the mark being that will of God which is the νόμος and σκοπός to him who ποιεῖ τὸ θέλημα τοῦ θεοῦ." 
2. "The assertions are all perfectly general, and regard, in the true root and ideal, every sin whatever."
