# 1 John 3:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse being described is a powerful statement about the purpose of Jesus' incarnation and the significance of his sacrifice. Christ, sinless and pure, made himself manifest in the flesh to eradicate the stain of sin from humanity. His work on the cross was a complete expiation, taking away sins and offering reconciliation and satisfaction. This verse serves as a strong dissuasive from sin, illustrating the transformative aim of Christ's work - to destroy sin entirely and make us resemble him.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "He became incarnate that He might blot it out: He has no stain of it on Himself."
2. "The most palpable violations of the construction and sense are made by the rationalists."
3. "It is only by holding fast here the personal reference to Christ in himself, that we keep the logical coherence between that verse and this."

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "The very object of Christ's manifestation in the flesh was to take away all sins, as the scapegoat did typically."
2. "In him is no sin, not 'was,' but 'is,' as in 1 John 2:1, 'He is righteous,' and 1 John 3:3, 'He is pure.' Therefore we are to be so."
3. "Additional proof of the incompatibility of sin and sonship."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The argument is a clear one, and is perhaps the strongest that can be made to bear on the mind of a true Christian - that the Lord Jesus saw sin to be so great an evil, that he came into our world, and gave himself to the bitter sorrows of death on the cross, to redeem us from it." 

2. "The essential argument here is, that the whole work of Christ was designed to deliver us from the dominion of sin, not to furnish us the means of indulgence in it; and that, therefore, we should be deterred from it by all that Christ has done and suffered for us." 

3. "As he was perfectly pure and spotless, so should all his followers aim to be; and none can truly pretend to be his who do not desire and design to become like him."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "John various terms to describe the incarnation. He conceives it with reference to the Father, as a sending, a mission."
2. "With reference to the Son, as a coming, regarded as a historic fact and as an abiding fact."
3. "In Him is no sin. He is essentially and forever without sin."

### John Calvin:
1. "He who believes in Christ is necessarily cleansed from his sins." 
2. "Christ really, and, so to speak, actually takes away sins, because through him our old man is crucified, and his Spirit, by means of repentance, mortifies the flesh with all its lusts."
3. "For if he dwells in us by faith, he performs his own work, that is, he cleanses us from sins."

Note: The commentary is quite long, so I had to condense it significantly to fit within the word limit.

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "He was manifested...of the Incarnation...not of the second coming." 
2. "To take away sins...to lift up and carry away...the complete expiation wrought by Christ on Calvary."

### John Gill:
1. "Jesus Christ, the Word and Son of God, who is here meant, who was with the Father, and lay in his bosom from all eternity, was in the fulness of time made manifest in the flesh, or human nature, by assuming it into union with his divine person."
2. "The end of which manifestation was, to take away our sins; as the antitype of the scape goat, making reconciliation and satisfaction for them, through the sacrifice of himself."
3. "And this shows that he did not offer himself for any sins of his own, for there were none in him, but for the sins of others; and which consideration, therefore, is a strong dissuasive from sinning."
