## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Nothing short of personal immanence in the personal Christ will satisfy the words: a living because He lives, and as receiving of His fulness." 
2. "If the child of God falls into sin, it is an act against nature, deadly to life, hardly endured, and bringing bitter repentance: it is as the taking of a poison, which if it be not corrected by its antidote, will sap the very springs of life." 
3. "The cutting off by an act of sin of the sight and knowledge of Christ, shows, and shows in proportion as it prevails, unreality in that sight and knowledge."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "He reasons from Christ's own entire separation from sin, that those in him must also be separate from it."
2. "The life of sin and the life of God mutually exclude one another, just as darkness and light."
3. "All sin as such is at variance with the notion of one regenerated."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The sense seems to be that we have some sort of relation to him similar to that which we have to our home; that is, some fixed and permanent attachment to him."
2. "It refers to the adherence to the Saviour as a continuous state of mind, or as having permanency; meaning that there is a life of continued faith in him."
3. "He who is born again does not sin habitually, or is not habitually a sinner. If he does wrong, it is when he is overtaken by temptation, and the act is against the habitual inclination and purpose of his soul."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "To abide in Christ is more than to be in Him, since it represents a condition maintained by communion with God and by the habitual doing of His will."
2. "John does not teach that believers do not sin, but is speaking of a character, a habit."
3. "Throughout the Epistle he deals with the ideal reality of life in God, in which the love of God and sin exclude each other as light and darkness."

### John Calvin:
1. "Whosoever sinneth hath not seen him." - This verse emphasizes that true knowledge of Christ is inseparable from a transformed life. It challenges the notion that faith in Christ can be claimed without a corresponding change in behavior.

2. "For Christ is never dormant where he reigns, but the Spirit renders effectual his power." - This quote highlights the active and transformative presence of Christ in the lives of believers. It suggests that where Christ truly reigns, there is evidence of his power at work through the Holy Spirit.

3. "It may be rightly said of him, that he puts sin to flight, not otherwise than as the sun drives away darkness by its own brightness." - This comparison vividly illustrates the power of Christ to overcome sin. Just as the sun dispels darkness naturally and effortlessly, Christ's presence in our lives has the same effect on sin, driving it away.

These quotes collectively emphasize the importance of a genuine and transformative faith in Christ, which is evidenced by a life that reflects his image.

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Does not keep on sinning." - This phrase emphasizes the continuous action of sinning, indicating a lifestyle of sin rather than occasional acts of sin.

2. "Whosoever sinneth certainly seeth him not - The loving eye of his soul is not then fixed upon God."
