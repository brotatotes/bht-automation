# 1 John 3:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse describes the transformative power of being born of God. It highlights the incompatibility between sin and regeneration, as those begotten of God cannot habitually sin. The divine seed of loving faith abides in them, leading them to cleanse away every sin and resist it. This new life in God generates a hatred for sin and an unceasing desire to live righteously, as the grace of the Spirit opposes and prevents sin. Through inflexible perseverance and the workmanship of the Holy Spirit, the regenerate person is preserved from the temptations and corruptions that sin brings.

3. "The exact idea here, as it seems to me, is not that the 'seed' refers to 'the word of God,' as Augustin and others suppose, or to 'the Spirit of God,' but to the germ of piety which has been produced in the heart 'by' the word and Spirit of God, and which may be regarded as having been implanted there by God himself, and which may be expected to produce holiness in the life."
