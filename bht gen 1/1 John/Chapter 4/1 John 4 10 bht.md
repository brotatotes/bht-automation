### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Herein is love—love in the abstract: love, in its highest ideal, is herein." 
2. "The love was all on God's side, none on ours." 
3. "Not that we loved God—though so altogether worthy of love. He loved us—though so altogether unworthy of love."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Herein is love - In this great gift is the highest expression of love, as if it had done all that it can do."
2. "Not that we loved God - Not that we were in such a state that we might suppose he would make such a sacrifice for us, but just the opposite."
3. "But that he loved us - Not that he approved our character, but that he desired our welfare. He loved us not with the love of complacency, but with the love of benevolence."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Propitiation refers to the act of appeasing or satisfying the wrath of God. In this context, it signifies that Jesus Christ's sacrifice on the cross was the ultimate act of appeasement for our sins, reconciling us to God." 

2. "The concept of propitiation emphasizes the seriousness of sin and the need for a sacrificial offering to atone for it. Jesus' death on the cross served as the perfect propitiation, fully satisfying God's righteous anger and providing a way for humanity to be forgiven and restored to a right relationship with God."

3. "Through propitiation, Jesus took upon himself the punishment that we deserved, bearing the full weight of God's wrath on our behalf. This act of selfless love demonstrates God's mercy and grace, offering us forgiveness and salvation through faith in Christ."

### John Calvin:
1. "He meant by these words to teach us that God’s love towards us has been gratuitous."
2. "God freely loved us, — how so? because he loved us before we were born, and also when, through depravity of nature, we had hearts turned away from him."
3. "It was then from God’s goodness alone, as from a fountain, that Christ with all his blessings has come to us."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Not that (ουχ οτ)--but that (αλλ' οτ). Sharp contrast as in John 7:22; 2 Corinthians 7:9; Philippians 4:17."

2. "We loved (ηγαπησαμεν). First aorist active indicative, but B reads ηγαπηκαμεν (perfect active, we have loved)."

3. "To be the propitiation (ιλασμον). Merely predicate accusative in apposition with υιον (Son). For the word see 1 John 2:2; Romans 3:25 for ιλαστηριον, and for περ see also 1 John 2:2."

### John Gill:
1. "Herein is love,.... The love of God, free love, love that cannot be matched: herein it is manifested, as before; this is a clear evidence of it, an undoubted proof, and puts it out of all question."
2. "The love of God is antecedent to the love of his people; it was when theirs was not; when they were without love to him, yea, enemies in their minds, by wicked works, and even enmity itself, and therefore was not procured by theirs."
3. "The instance of this love follows:and sent his Son [to be] the propitiation for our sins: this is a subordinate end to the other, mentioned in 1 John 4:9; for, in order that sinful men may possess everlasting life and happiness, it is necessary that their sins be expiated, or atonement be made for them."
