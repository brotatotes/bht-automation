# 1 John 4:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Through the words of various commentators, we gain insight into a Bible verse that emphasizes the invisible and incomprehensible nature of God, who has never been seen by mortal eyes. Instead, we can experience God's presence by loving one another, as God dwells within us through our love for fellow believers. This perfect love, representative of God's invisible self, has the power to transform and fulfill us, as it indicates the ongoing abiding of God's love within us.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Our inability to return God’s love: but I must feel that Düsterd.’s objection to it is fatal: it gives a sense wholly alien from St. John’s habit of thought, in alleging that we cannot return God’s love, and further alien in giving as a reason for this inability, that He is invisible."
2. "Not, because we cannot love God whom we have not seen: but because the exponents of God whom we have not seen are our brethren whom we do see."
3. "By our love to them are we to know, how far we have love to Him: if that be present, He dwelleth in us, and ἡ ἀγάπη αὐτοῦ τετελειωμένη ἐστὶν ἐν ἡμῖν."

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "God, whom no man hath seen at any time, hath appointed His children as the visible recipients of our outward kindness which flows from love to Himself." 
2. "If we love one another, God dwelleth in us—for God is love; and it must have been from Him dwelling in us that we drew the real love we bear to the brethren."
3. "His love—rather, 'the love of Him,' that is, 'to Him,' evinced by our love to His representatives, our brethren."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He has never indeed been seen by mortal eyes. We are not, then, to expect to become acquainted with what he is in that way. But there is a method by which we may be assured that we have a true knowledge of him, and that is, by evidence that we love another, and by the presence of his Spirit in our hearts." 

2. "Though we cannot see him, yet there is a way by which we may be assured that he is near us, and that he even dwells in us. That way is by the exercise of love."

3. "Our love for each other is the proper exponent of love to him reigning in our hearts. Without this our love to him would not have accomplished what it was adapted and designed to do. True love will diffuse itself over all who come within its range, and will thus become complete and entire."

2. "God shews himself as present, when by his Spirit he forms our hearts so that they entertain brotherly love."
3. "The sum, then, of what is said is, that since love is from the Spirit of God, we cannot truly and with a sincere heart love the brethren, except the Spirit puts forth his power."

### Philip Schaff:

### John Gill:
1. "No man hath seen God at any time... but here the sense is, that whereas God is invisible in his nature, and incomprehensible in his being and perfections, so that there is no coming to him, and seeing of him, and conversing with him in a familiar way."
2. "Then we ought to love the saints and people of God, who are visible, may be seen, come at, and conversed with."
