# 1 John 4:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Love, perfect and mature, has the power to banish fear. It is not a slavish fear, but the underlying reverence and respect for God. This fear is different from the dread of punishment or torment; it is the confidence and boldness that comes when one's heart is filled with the love of God. When we understand and experience God's love for us, it brings peace and tranquility, dispelling the anxieties of our hearts.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1) "Confidence in (or as understood, as to) that terrible day presupposes the absence of fear: and this casting out of fear is the very work of love, which in its perfect state cannot coexist with fear." 
2) "Fear (φόβος, abstract and general: anarthrous, on account of the negative predication) existeth not in love (τῇ ἀγάπῃ, abstract and general also, as in 1 John 4:17; not 'God's love to us,' as Calv., Calov., Spener, al.: nor 'brotherly love,' as Lücke, al.), nay perfect love casteth out fear, because fear hath torment." 
3) "He that feareth hath not been perfected in (his) love."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Fear has no place in love. Bold confidence, based on love, cannot coexist with fear."
2. "Love, when perfected, gives bold confidence and casts out fear."
3. "Fear is always revolving in the mind the punishment deserved. Fear, by anticipating punishment, has it even now, the foretaste of it."
4. "Perfect love is incompatible with such a self-punishing fear. Godly fear of offending God is quite distinct from slavish fear of consciously deserved punishment."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Love is not an affection which produces fear."
2. "He whose sins are pardoned, and whose heart is filled with the love of God, has nothing to dread in this world or the world to come."
3. "As far as [love] exists, its tendency is to deliver the mind from alarms."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The fear is that spoken of in 1 Peter 1:17; Hebrews 12:28; godly fear; filial reverence; not slavish fear, as Romans 8:15."
2. "Fear carries its own punishment."
3. "Men's condition is varied; without fear and love; with fear without love; with fear and love; without fear with love."

### John Calvin:
1. "We obtain by knowing God’s love towards us the benefit of a peaceful calmness beyond the reach of fear."
2. "When the love of God is by us seen and known by faith, peace is given to our consciences, so that they no longer tremble and fear."
3. "The Apostle reminds us that it is owing to unbelief when anyone fears, that is, has a disturbed mind; for the love of God, really known, tranquilizes the heart."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Fear (φοβος). Like a bond-slave (Romans 8:15), not the reverence of a son (ευλαβεια, Hebrews 5:7) or the obedience to a father (εν φοβω, 1 Peter 1:17). This kind of dread is the opposite of παρρησια (boldness)." 

2. "Perfect love (η τελεια αγαπη). There is such a thing, perfect because it has been perfected (verses 1 John 4:12; 1 John 4:17). Cf. James 1:4."

3. "Casteth out fear (εξω βαλλε τον φοβον). 'Drives fear out' so that it does not exist in real love. See εκβαλλω εξω in John 6:37; John 9:34; John 12:31; John 15:6 to turn out-of-doors, a powerful metaphor. Perfect love harbours no suspicion and no dread (1 John 4:1)."

### John Gill:
1. "So far as that prevails and gains ground, fear removes; not the filial fear of God, the new covenant grace of fear, which is the beginning of wisdom, and is consistent with faith, hope, love, and spiritual joy."
2. "Those that truly love Christ, his Gospel, and his people, they are not afraid of men; the spirit of power, love, and of a sound mind, is opposite to a spirit of fear, nor can they stand together."
3. "When love to the brethren appears to be perfect, that is, genuine and sincere, and a man knows that from the bottom of his heart he sincerely loves the saints, he concludes from hence, as he may, the truth of his faith, which works in this way; and this frees him from the fears of men and devils, and of the future judgment and wrath to come."

### John Wesley:
1. "No slavish fear can be where love reigns."
2. "Perfect, adult love casteth out slavish fear."
3. "A father in Christ, love without fear."
