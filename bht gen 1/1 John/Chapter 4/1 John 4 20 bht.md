# 1 John 4:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse under discussion emphasizes the interconnectedness between loving God and loving others. It challenges the notion that one can claim to love God while harboring hatred towards their fellow human beings. The commentators highlight the impossibility and contradiction in such a claim, emphasizing that love for God should extend to our visible brothers and sisters, as they are a reflection of God's image. The verse challenges us to demonstrate our love for God through tangible acts of love towards others, as our perception of them and our actions towards them are intertwined with our love for God.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "He that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen, God whom he hath not seen cannot love." - This verse highlights the importance of loving our fellow human beings as a reflection of our love for God. It emphasizes the need for tangible acts of love towards others, as opposed to mere words or feelings.

2. "The best tests omit, and give the direct statement cannot love." - The commentary suggests that the most accurate interpretation of the verse is to state that if we do not love our brothers and sisters, we cannot truly love God. This implies that our love for God is demonstrated and measured by our love for others.

3. "Note the striking inversion of the clauses." - The commentary draws attention to the intentional reversal of the clauses in the verse, which emphasizes the significance of loving our visible brothers and sisters in order to truly love the unseen God. This inversion serves as a powerful reminder of the interconnectedness of our relationships with others and with God.

### John Calvin:
1. "But the reason he subjoins seems not sufficiently valid, for it is a comparison between the less and the greater: If, he says, we love not our brethren whom we see, much less can we love God who is invisible."
2. "The love which God has to us is from faith and does not flow from sight."
3. "God offers himself to us in those men who bear his image, and he requires the duties, which he does not want himself, to be performed to them."

Note: The commentary is quite lengthy, so I have selected three quotes that capture the essence of the author's message.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "All the words here point, as we have seen before, to an utterly spurious Christianity, which knows nothing of the revelation of the unseen God in His Son."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "A liar (ψευστης). Blunt and to the point as in 1 John 1:10; 1 John 2:4."
2. "That loveth not (ο μη αγαπων). 'The one who does not keep on loving' (present active negative articular participle)."
3. "Hath seen (εωρακεν). Perfect active indicative of οραω, the form in John 1:18 used of seeing God."

Note: The commentary provides a grammatical analysis of the verse and references other verses in the Bible for comparison. The selected quotes highlight the straightforwardness of the language used in describing the consequences of not loving God and the emphasis on continuous love as a characteristic of believers.

### John Gill:
1. "If a man say I love God, and hateth his brother,.... Than which profession nothing can be more contradictory, not black and white, or hot and cold in the same degree." 

2. "He is a liar; it is not truth he speaks, it is a contradiction, and a thing impossible."
