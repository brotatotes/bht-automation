# 1 John 4:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This description revolves around the concept of love and its connection to knowing and understanding God. It emphasizes that without love, there is no true knowledge of God. God is described as love, not merely displaying love, but having a nature that is love itself. The knowledge of God is transformative, leading to a renewal of one's being. God's love is depicted as infinite and unconditional, extending to all humanity.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "He that loveth not hath never known God...has never had in him even the beginnings of knowledge of God...the aorist makes a far stronger contrast than the present οὐ γινώσκει would." 
2. "God is love, not merely an attribute, of God. It is co-essential with Him: He is all love, love is all of Him: he who has not love, has not God."
3. "Unless he is speaking of the essential being of God, quorsum pertineat, to say that he that loveth not never knew God, because 'God is love?' Put for these last words, 'God is loving,' and we get at once a fallacy of an undistributed middle."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "God is fundamentally and essentially LOVE."
2. "God is essentially love, therefore he knows not God."
3. "This man doth not love, and therefore knows not love."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He that loveth not, knoweth not God" - Has no true acquaintance with God; has no just views of him, and no right feelings toward him.
2. "God is love" - He is not merely benevolent, he is benevolence itself.
3. "In the darkness of this world of sin - in all the sorrows that come now upon the race, and that will come upon the wicked hereafter - we have the assurance that a God of infinite benevolence rules over all."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Knoweth not [ουκ εγνω]. The aroist tense: did not know, from the beginning. He never knew."
2. "Is love [αγαπη εστι. ν]. See on God is light (i. 5), and the truth (i. 6); also God is spirit (John 4:24). Spirit and light are expressions of God's essential nature."
3. "Love is the expression of His personality corresponding to His nature. See on love of God (ii. 5). Truth and love stand related to each other. Loving is the condition of knowing."

### John Calvin:
1. "There is no knowledge of God where there is no love."
2. "God is love, that is, that his nature is to love men."
3. "The true knowledge of God is that which regenerates and renews us, so that we become new creatures."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "He that loveth not (ο μη αγαπων). Present active articular participle of αγαπαω 'keeps on not loving.'" 
2. "Knoweth not God (ουκ εγνω τον θεον). Timeless aorist active indicative of γινωσκω, has no acquaintance with God, never did get acquainted with him." 
3. "God is love (ο θεος αγαπη εστιν). Anarthrous predicate, not η αγαπη. John does not say that love is God, but only that God is love. The two terms are not interchangeable. God is also light (1 John 1:5) and spirit (John 4:24)."

### John Gill:
1. "He that loveth not, knoweth not God... for to pretend love to God, the begetter of them, whom he sees not, and not love those who are begotten by him, and are visible objects of respect, is a contradiction, and cannot be reconciled."
2. "For God is love; he loves himself; there is an entire love between the three divine Persons, who are in the strictest, and in the most inconceivable and inexpressible manner affected to each other; their love is natural and essential."
3. "God loves all his creatures as such, nor does he hate any of them, as so considered; and he bears an everlasting, unchangeable, and invariable love to his elect in Christ Jesus."

These quotes highlight the importance of love in knowing and understanding God, the nature of God's love, and the call for believers to love one another as children of God.

### John Wesley:
1. "God is often styled holy, righteous, wise; but not holiness, righteousness, or wisdom in the abstract, as he is said to be love; intimating that this is his darling, his reigning attribute."
2. "Love is not only an attribute of God, but it is his very nature and essence."
3. "God's love is not conditional or limited; it is boundless and unconditional, extending to all humanity."
