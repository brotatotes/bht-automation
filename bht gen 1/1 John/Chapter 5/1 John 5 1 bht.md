# 1 John 5:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Faith in Jesus as the Christ is the key to our relationship with God and the assurance of our eternal life. This faith goes beyond mere intellectual conviction, requiring a deep trust in the work and person of Jesus. By believing in Jesus as the Messiah, we acknowledge him as the prophet, priest, and king who fulfills God's promises. This faith is not exclusive, but inclusive, calling us to love and embrace all our brothers and sisters in Christ as children of our common Father.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Every one that believeth that Jesus is the Christ hath been begotten of God." 
2. "Our birth of God depends on and is in closest union with our faith."
3. "Every one who loveth him that begot, loveth also him that is begotten of him."

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Reason why our 'brother' (1 John 4:21) is entitled to such love, namely, because he is 'born (begotten) of God': so that if we want to show our love to God, we must show it to God's visible representative."
2. "He could not be our 'Jesus' (God-Saviour) unless He were 'the Christ'; for He could not reveal the way of salvation, except He were a prophet: He could not work out that salvation, except He were a priest: He could not confer that salvation upon us, except He were a king: He could not be prophet, priest, and king, except He were the Christ."
3. "Christ is the 'only-begotten Son' by generation; we become begotten sons of God by regeneration and adoption."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "That loves that God who has thus begotten those whom he has received as his children, and to whom he sustains the endearing relation of Father."
2. "He will love all the true children of God; all Christians."
3. "As all the children in a family love their common father, so it should be in the great family of which God is the Head."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Whosoever believeth - This is a universal invitation, open to all without exception. It emphasizes the inclusivity of the offer of salvation, extending to every person who believes in Jesus."
2. "The Christ - This title refers to Jesus as the Messiah, the anointed one. It signifies his role as the Savior and the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies. Believing in Jesus as the Christ means acknowledging him as the promised deliverer and placing one's trust in him for salvation."
3. "Lit., every one that believeth - This phrase highlights the individual nature of faith. It is not enough to simply belong to a particular group or have a cultural affiliation. Each person must personally believe in Jesus and place their trust in him for salvation."

### John Calvin:
1. "The first truth is, that all born of God, believe that Jesus is the Christ; where, again, you see that Christ alone is set forth as the object of faith, as in him it finds righteousness, life, and every blessing that can be desired, and God in all that he is."
2. "Then Jesus cannot be received as Christ, except salvation be sought from him, since for this end he was sent by the Father, and is daily offered to us."
3. "But we must observe, that the Apostle does not so speak of the faithful only, and pass by those who are without, as though the former are alone to be loved, and no care and no account to be had for the latter; but he teaches us as it were by this first exercise to love all without exception, when he bids us to make a beginning with the godly."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Faith in Jesus as the Christ has here the only meaning that St. John ever gives it: that divinely wrought trust in the work as well as the person of Jesus which the Spirit produces." 
2. "The exact link between faith and regeneration is untouched." 
3. "The argument is, like that of chap. 1 John 4:20, derived from the general nature of the case; but it is carried to the highest region, and here has the emphasis."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "John insists on this form of faith as he does in verse 1 John 5:5 and in accord with the purpose of John's Gospel."
2. "Nothing less will satisfy John, not merely intellectual conviction, but full surrender to Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior."
3. "John appeals here to family relationship and family love, proving our love for the common Father by our conduct towards our brothers and sisters in Christ."

### John Gill:
1. "To believe him to be the Christ, is to believe him to be that prophet Moses said should come, and who has declared the whole mind and will of his Father; and that he is that priest that should arise after the order of Melchizedek, and make atonement for sin, and intercession for transgressors; and that he is that King whom God has set over his holy hill of Zion, whose laws are to be obeyed, and his commands observed."
2. "True faith in him as the Messiah is a believing with the heart unto righteousness, or a looking to, and trusting in the righteousness of Christ for justification; and a dealing with his blood for pardon and cleansing, under a sense of guilt and filth; and a laying hold on his atoning sacrifice for the expiation of sin, and peace with God; and a reception of him as the only Saviour and Redeemer, or a dependence on him for life and salvation."
3. "Regeneration is not owing to the power and will of man, but to the abundant mercy and good will of God, and is an instance of his rich mercy, great love, and free favour, and commands love again."

### John Wesley:
1. "The scope and sum of this whole paragraph appears from the conclusion of it, 1 John 5:13: 'These things have I written to you who believe, that ye may know that ye who believe have eternal life.' So faith is the first and last point with St. John also." 

2. "Every one who loveth â€” God that begat loveth him also that is begotten of him - Hath a natural affection to all his brethren." 

3. "Faith is the foundation of our relationship with God and the assurance of our eternal life."
