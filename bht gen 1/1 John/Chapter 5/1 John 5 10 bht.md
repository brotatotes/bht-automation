# 1 John 5:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
With an emphasis on personal experience, those who have faith in Jesus Christ bear witness to their belief. Rejecting God's testimony, on the other hand, amounts to accusing Him of falsehood and doubting the credibility of His word. Such disbelief disregards God's explicit declarations and calls into question the integrity of His testimony.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The witness of the Spirit in the believer himself to his own sonship is not here expressed, but follows as a consequence of believing the witness of God to Jesus' divine Sonship."
2. "Refusal to credit God's testimony ('believeth not God') is involved in refusal to believe IN (to rest one's trust in) Jesus Christ, the object of God's record or testimony."
3. "Divine 'faith' is an assent unto something as credible upon the testimony of God. This is the highest kind of faith; because the object hath the highest credibility, because grounded upon the testimony of God, which is infallible."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The evidence that Jesus is the Son of God."
2. "There is the evidence derived from the fact that the soul has found peace by believing on him."
3. "These things constitute a mass of evidence for the truth of the Christian religion, whose force the believer cannot resist."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "To believe God, is to believe the message which comes from Him."
2. "The act perpetuates itself in the present condition of the unbeliever."
3. "In one other case to believe on is used with an object not directly personal, but the reference is clearly to the personal Christ as the Light of the World."

### John Calvin:
1. "We can have no faith in God, except by believing in Christ, because God sets him alone before us and makes us to stand in him."
2. "He does not say that God speaks outwardly, but that every one of the godly feels within that God is the author of his faith."
3. "If to make God a liar be a horrible and execrable impiety, because then what especially belongs to him is taken away, who would not dread to withhold faith from the gospel, in which God would have himself to be counted singularly true and faithful?"

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The testimony has become subjective: the ‘three agree in one’ within the believer’s consciousness."
2. "Faith is followed by full assurance; but the assurance is here the possession of life itself."
3. "He who believes not the witness given by God concerning His Son rejects the utmost possible evidence that God, knowing man’s necessity, could give him."

Note: The provided commentary is longer than the allowed word count. I have selected three quotes that I believe best capture the essence of the commentary.

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "John draws a distinction between 'not believing God' in the next clause, the testimony of God about his Son, and surrender to and reliance on the Son as here." 
2. "See the same distinction less clearly drawn in John 6:30."
3. "The subjective negative is regular with 'ο μη πιστευων.'"

### John Gill:
1. "He that believeth on the Son of God... hath the witness in himself." 
2. "The Spirit of God enlightening him into the impurity of his nature, his impotence to do anything spiritually good, his incapacity to atone for sin, and the insufficiency of his righteousness to justify him before God."
3. "Such an one very readily receives into him the testimony God gives of his Son, of the glory and excellency of his person, and retains it in him."

### John Wesley:
1. "He that believeth on the Son of God hath the testimony." - This quote highlights that those who have faith in Jesus Christ possess the personal evidence of their belief. It emphasizes the intimate connection between belief and personal experience.

2. "He that believeth not God, in this, hath made him a liar." - This quote reveals the consequence of rejecting God's testimony. It suggests that disbelief in God's word is equivalent to accusing Him of falsehood, undermining the credibility of God's testimony.

3. "Because he supposes that to be false which God has expressly testified." - This quote emphasizes the gravity of doubting or disbelieving God's testimony. It suggests that such disbelief is based on the assumption that God's explicit declarations are untrue, challenging the integrity of God's word.
