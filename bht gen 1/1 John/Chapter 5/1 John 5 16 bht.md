# 1 John 5:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the commentators provide insights into the concept of intercession and the sin unto death. They explain that intercession is a duty to pray for those who are in danger of ruin or have gone astray. The sin unto death refers to a category of sins that sever the fellowship with Christ and results in spiritual death. While it is not forbidden to pray for this sin, it is not explicitly encouraged. Nevertheless, God's grace and forgiveness are available to all who turn to Him, and our prayers can have a powerful impact on the lives of others.

2. "The Christian intercessor for his brethren, John declares, shall not assume the authority which would be implied in making request for a sinner who has sinned the sin unto death."
3. "To 'request' for a sin unto death [intercede, as it were, authoritatively for it, as though we were more merciful than God] would savor of presumption."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It is our duty to pray for those who sin, and to seek the salvation of those whom we see to be going astray, and to be in danger of ruin, wherever they are, or whoever they may be."
2. "There are multitudes of sins which people commit, which upon no proper interpretation of the passages respecting the sin which 'hath never forgiveness,' can come under the description of that sin, and for which it is proper, therefore, to pray that they may be pardoned."
3. "As long as they are in this world of probation and of hope, let us never despair of the conversion of any, in answer to prayer, who may have gone astray."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The sin unto death does not refer to a specific act, but to a class or species of sins, the tendency of which is to cut the bond of fellowship with Christ."
2. "Whatever breaks the fellowship between the soul and Christ, and, by consequence, between the individual and the body of believers, is unto death, for there is no life apart from Christ."
3. "Prayer even for this sin unto death is not forbidden, but John says that he does not enjoin it."

### John Calvin:
1. "It is a great thing, that as soon as we are oppressed, God kindly invites us to himself, and is ready to give us help; but that he hears us asking for others, is no small confirmation to our faith in order that we may be fully assured that we shall never meet with a repulse in our own case."
2. "He who will pray for the perishing, will, he says, restore life to him; though the words, 'he shall give,' may be applied to God, as though it was said, God will grant to your prayers the life of a brother. But the sense will still be the same, that the prayers of the faithful so far avail as to rescue a brother from death."
3. "That we may not cast away all hope of the salvation of those who sin, he shews that God does not so grievously punish their falls as to repudiate them. It hence follows that we ought to deem them brethren, since God retains them in the number of his children."

### Archibald T Robertson:

2. "None of the sins of God's elect are unto death, or issue in death, in fact; which is owing not to any different nature there is in their sins, or to their good works which counterbalance them; but to the grace of God, and to the blood and righteousness of Christ, by which they are pardoned and justified."
3. "He shall pray to God for him, that he would administer comfort to him, discover his love, and apply his pardoning grace to him, and indulge him with his presence and the light of his countenance."
