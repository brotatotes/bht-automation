# 1 John 5:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This verse speaks of the distinction between true believers, born of God, and the rest of humanity who remain under the influence of the wicked one. True Christians have the assurance of their divine origin and are led by the Spirit, while the world, steeped in sin and wickedness, lies under the control and dominion of the evil one. It paints a vivid picture of a corrupt and spiritually dead world, contrasting with the life and vitality found in those who are children of God.
