# 1 John 5:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
By loving our Christian brethren, we demonstrate our love for God and His commandments, as confirmed by various commentators. This mutual love between God and His children is inextricably linked and serves as a sign and test of our genuine affection for both parties. Our love for God leads us to love and serve our brethren with a sincere and pure heart, not driven by ulterior motives or superficial reasons. Through our devotion to God and obedience to His commandments, we manifest our love for Him and our fellow believers.
