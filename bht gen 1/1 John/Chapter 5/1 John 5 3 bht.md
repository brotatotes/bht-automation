# 1 John 5:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The love of God is not a mere sentiment, but it is shown through our obedience to his commandments. We find that these commandments are not burdensome or oppressive, but rather they are a source of joy and fulfillment. As we keep his commandments, we demonstrate our genuine love for God and experience even greater manifestations of his love towards us. Through the power of the Spirit, we find that the service of God is freedom, liberating us from the bondage of the world.
