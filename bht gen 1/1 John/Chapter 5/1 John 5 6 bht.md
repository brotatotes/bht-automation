### Henry Alford:
1) "This Son of God is he &c.:” making the proposition assert the identity of the Son of God with the historical Jesus, not the converse."
2) "The main objection to Huther’s view is, that, as well stated by Düsterd., it makes the coming by water and blood, which, by the context, is evidently in the Apostle’s argument a substantiating consideration, to be merely an exceptional one."
3) "The blood of His Cross must, by all Scripture analogy, be that intended. The pouring out of this blood was the completion of the baptism which He had to be baptized with."

3. "The Holy Spirit is an additional witness, besides the water and the blood, to Jesus' Sonship and Messiahship."

### Albert Barnes:

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Water refers to Christ's baptism at the beginning of His Messianic work, through which He declared His purpose to fulfill all righteousness."
2. "Blood refers to His bloody death upon the cross for the sin of the world."
3. "The true principle of interpretation appears to be laid down in the two canons of Dusterdieck. (1.) Water and blood must point both to some purely historical facts in the life of our Lord on earth, and to some still present witnesses for Christ. (2.) They must not be interpreted symbolically, but understood of something so real and powerful, as that by them God's testimony is given to believers, and eternal life assured to them."

### John Calvin:
1. "That our faith may rest safely on Christ, he says the real substance of the shadows of the law appears in him."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The very terms used imply a symbolical meaning underlying the literal, for we cannot understand ‘water’ and ‘blood’ as pointing to merely historical facts."

3. "Eternal life is the removal of the death of condemnation: that is symbolized by the ‘blood;’ for it is the blood of Christ that cleanseth from all sin."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "He that came (ο ελθων). Second aorist active articular participle of ερχομα, referring to the Incarnation as a definite historic event, the preexistent Son of God 'sent from heaven to do God's will' (Brooke)."
2. "These two incidents in the Incarnation are singled out because at the baptism Jesus was formally set apart to his Messianic work by the coming of the Holy Spirit upon him and by the Father's audible witness, and because at the Cross his work reached its culmination ('It is finished,' Jesus said)."
3. "The repetition of both preposition (εν this time rather than δια) and the article (τω locative case) argues for two separate events with particular emphasis on the blood ('not only' ουκ μονον, 'but' αλλ') which the Gnostics made light of or even denied."

### John Gill:
1. "By 'water' is not meant the ablutions or washings of the ceremonial law; Christ came not by these, but to make an end of them; his blood, which cleanseth from all sin, being the antitype, and so the fulfilling end of them."
2. "Christ, as the Son of God, came, or was made manifest by John as such, at the waters of Jordan, and at his baptism; there he was declared to be the Son of God by his Father's voice from heaven."
3. "As at baptism, so at his sufferings and death, he was made manifest to be the Son of God; as he was to the centurion and others, that were with him, when they observed the earthquake, and the things that were done; and at his from the dead he was declared to be the Son of God with power."
