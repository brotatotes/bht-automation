# 1 John 5:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This verse holds a significant place in discussions on the Trinity, with commentators both rejecting and affirming its genuineness. The verse speaks of a threefold testimony: the witness of the Spirit, the water, and the blood. These witnesses confirm our faith in Christ, with the Spirit testifying through the Word and miracles. Together, they bear harmonious testimony to Jesus Christ as the divine and complete Savior. While some dispute the authenticity of certain additions, the verse underscores the unity of God, the trinity of persons, and their distinct roles in the Godhead.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1) "The Spirit is, of the three, the only living and active witness, properly speaking: besides, the water and the blood are no witnesses without Him; whereas He is independent of them, testifying both in them and out of them."
2) "And this their one testimony is given by the purification in the water of baptism into His name, John 3:5; by the continual cleansing from all sin which we enjoy in and by His atoning blood: by the inward witness of His Spirit, which He hath given us."
3) "The context, as above explained, is employed in setting forth the reality of the substance of the faith which overcomes the world, even of our eternal life in Jesus the Son of God. And this is shewn by a threefold testimony, subsisting in the revelation of the Lord Himself, and subsisting in us His people."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Two or three witnesses were required by law to constitute adequate testimony."
2. "The triad specified pointing to a still Higher Trinity."
3. "It is on earth that the context evidently requires the witness of the three, the Spirit, the water, and the blood, to be borne: mystically setting forth the divine triune witnesses, the Father, the Spirit, and the Son."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The supposed importance of the verse in its bearing on the doctrine of the Trinity has contributed to this, and has given to the discussion a degree of consequence which has pertained to the examination of the genuineness of no other passage of the New Testament."

2. "The reasons which seem to me to prove that the passage included in brackets is spurious, and should not be regarded as a part of the inspired writings, are briefly the following:"

3. "The argument against the passage from the external proof is confirmed by internal evidence, which makes it morally certain that it cannot be genuine."

### John Calvin:
1. "God, in order to confirm most abundantly our faith in Christ, testifies in three ways that we ought to acquiesce in him."
2. "The Father, together with his eternal Wisdom and Spirit, declares Jesus to be the Christ as it were authoritatively, then, in this ease, the sole majesty of the deity is to be considered by us."
3. "But as the Spirit, dwelling in our hearts, is an earnest, a pledge, and a seal, to confirm that decree, so he thus again speaks on earth by his grace."

### Archibald T Robertson:
