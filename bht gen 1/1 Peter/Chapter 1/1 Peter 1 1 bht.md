## Henry Alford:
1. "Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to the elect strangers of the dispersion." - This verse highlights that the readers of 1 Peter are both Jewish and Gentile Christians, forming part of the Israel of God.

2. "There is no reason to exclude Gentile Christians from among them." - The commentary emphasizes that Gentile Christians are included among the readers of 1 Peter, further supporting the idea of a diverse audience.

3. "The whole geographical extent embraced by the terms." - The commentary suggests that the inclusion of specific regions in the verse indicates the widespread reach of the Gospel message, encompassing various regions and cultures.

## Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "He who preaches otherwise than as a messenger of Christ, is not to be heard; if he preach as such, then it is all one as if thou didst hear Christ speaking in thy presence."
2. "Christians, if they rightly consider their calling, must never settle themselves here, but feel themselves travellers."
3. "The election here is that of individuals to eternal life by the sovereign grace of God, as the sequel shows."

## Albert Barnes:
1. "He here addresses them as elect; in the following verse he shows them in what way they were elected."
2. "The word means, literally, a by-resident, a sojourner among a people not one’s own."
3. "He would regard them still as the people of God, though dispersed abroad; as those who were away from what was properly the home of their fathers."

## Marvin Vincent:
1. "Peter calls himself, not Simon, but Peter, the name most significant and precious both to himself and to his readers, because bestowed by his Lord."
2. "He is addressing churches with which he had no immediate connection, and which were distinctively Pauline. Hence he appeals to his apostleship in explanation of his writing to them, and as his warrant for taking Paul's place."
3. "Persons sojourning for a brief season in a foreign country. Though applied primarily to Hebrews scattered throughout the world, it has here a wider, spiritual sense, contemplating Christians as having their citizenship in heaven."

## John Calvin:
1. "For Paul did not wish to the faithful the beginning of grace and peace, but the increase of them, that is, that God would complete what he had begun."
2. "We are not curiously to inquire about the election of our brethren, but ought on the contrary to regard their calling, so that all who are admitted by faith into the church, are to be counted as the elect."
3. "The foreknowledge of God excludes every worthiness on the part of man."
4. "Our salvation flows from the gratuitous election of God; but that it is to be ascertained by the experience of faith, because he sanctifies us by his Spirit."

## Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Peter uses this name, not Cephas or Simon, because he is writing to Christians scattered over Asia Minor." 
2. "Peter terms himself συνπρεσβυτερος in 1 Peter 5:1." 
3. "The picture in the metaphor here is that heaven is our native country and we are only temporary sojourners here on earth."

## Adam Clarke:
1. "The strangers scattered throughout — Jews first, who had believed the Gospel in the different countries here specified; and converted Gentiles also." 
2. "Though the word strangers may refer to all truly religious people, see Genesis 47:9; Psalms 39:12, in the Septuagint, and Hebrews 11:13, yet the inscription may have a special reference to those who were driven by persecution to seek refuge in those heathen provinces to which the influence of their persecuting brethren did not extend."
3. "Asia — This word is taken in different senses: It signifies, 1. One of the three general divisions of our continent, and one of the four of the whole earth. It is separated from Europe by the Mediterranean Sea, the Archipelago, the Black Sea, the Palus Maeolis, the rivers Don and Dwina; and from Africa by the Arabic Gulf, or Red Sea: it is everywhere else surrounded by water."
