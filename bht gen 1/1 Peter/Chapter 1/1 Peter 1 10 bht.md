# choicest prompt v1 X bht prompt v3; ['Henry Alford', 'Jamieson Fausset Brown', 'Albert Barnes', 'Marvin Vincent', 'John Calvin', 'Philip Schaff', 'Archibald T Robertson', 'Adam Clarke']

## Henry Alford:
1. "Concerning which salvation (its time especially, as explained below, but its manner and issue also) sought earnestly and examined earnestly." 
2. "The prophets sought and examined the salvation, emphasizing the greatness of the salvation."
3. "The Prophets prophesied concerning the grace that was destined for you, looking forward with them."

## Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "The magnitude of this 'salvation' is proved by the earnestness with which 'prophets' and even 'angels' searched into it."
2. "They did not like us fully see, but they desired to see the one and the same Christ whom we fully see in spirit."
3. "The prophets, as private individuals, had to reflect on the hidden and far-reaching sense of their own prophecies; because their words, as prophets, in their public function, were not so much their own as the Spirit's, speaking by and in them."

## Albert Barnes:
1. "The object of this reference to the prophets seems to be to lead them to value the religion which they professed more highly, and to encourage them to bear their trials with patience."
2. "They were in a condition, in many respects, far superior to that of the prophets. They had the full light of the gospel. The prophets saw it only at a distance and but dimly, and were obliged to search anxiously that they might understand the nature of that system of which they were appointed to furnish the comparatively obscure prophetic intimations."
3. "They thus became students and interpreters for themselves of their own predictions. They were not only prophets, but men. They had souls to be saved in the same way as others. They had hearts to be sanctified by the truth; and it was needful, in order to this, that truth should be applied to their own hearts in the same way as to others."

## Marvin Vincent:
1. "Have inquired and searched diligently." - The commentary highlights the Greek word εξεζητησαν (exezētēsan) used in the verse, which means to search out diligently. This emphasizes the thoroughness and effort put into the inquiry.

2. "Used of Esau's seeking carefully for a place of repentance." - The commentary draws a parallel to Hebrews 12:17, where the same word is used to describe Esau's earnest search for repentance. This connection adds depth to the understanding of the verse in question.

3. "Used nowhere else in the New Testament." - The commentary points out that the word εξηρευνησαν (exēreunēsan) is unique to this verse in the New Testament. This highlights the significance of the word choice and suggests that the author intentionally selected it for this particular context.

## John Calvin:
1. "He hence commends the value of salvation, because the prophets had their minds intensely fixed on it; for it must have been a great matter, and possessing peculiar excellency, which could have thus kindled in the prophets a spirit of inquiry respecting it."

2. "At the same time he confirms the certainty of salvation by this very antiquity; for from the beginning of the world it had received a plain testimony from the Holy Spirit."

3. "The last proposition is, — that it hence appears evident how wonderful is the glory of that salvation promised to us in the Gospel, because even angels, though they enjoy God’s presence in heaven, yet burn with the desire of seeing it."

## Philip Schaff:
1. "The salvation here in view is the salvation already introduced first as ‘ready to be revealed in the last time,’ and then as a ‘salvation of souls.’ It is not to be limited either to the completed salvation of the future, or to the partial salvation of the present, but is God’s salvation generally." 
2. "They depict, therefore, the strength and earnestness of the interest with which the prophets gave their minds to the hidden things of this salvation."
3. "The term ‘grace’ here is not to be distinguished (with Huther) from the ‘salvation,’ as if the latter denoted only the future salvation, and the former covered both the present and the future. It is simply another expression for the salvation dealt with all along, designating it now under the particular aspect of a free gift from God."

## Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Peter lingers over the word σωτηρια (salvation) with something new to say each time." 
2. "Here it is the general sense of the gospel of grace."
3. "Both of these words occur together in I Macc. 9:26."

## Adam Clarke:
1. "The incarnation and suffering of Jesus Christ, and the redemption procured by him for mankind, were made known, in a general way, by the prophets."
2. "The prophets plainly saw that the grace which was to come under the Messiah's kingdom was vastly superior to anything that had ever been exhibited under the law."
3. "They made all possible inquiry, and searched as after grains of gold, hidden among sand or compacted with ore, in order to ascertain the time and the signs of that time, in which this wondrous display of God's love and mercy to man was to take place."


# BHT:
The verse being described is a powerful reminder of the magnitude of salvation. Various commentators emphasize the earnest and diligent searching undertaken by the prophets and angels to understand the greatness of this salvation. The passage highlights that the prophets had glimpses of the salvation but could only grasp it partially, unlike those who possess the full light of the gospel. The verse also underscores the profound interest of angels in witnessing this magnificent plan of redemption. Overall, the verse unveils the depth and significance of the salvation offered in the Scriptures.
