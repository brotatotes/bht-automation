# choicest prompt v1 X bht prompt v3; ['Henry Alford', 'Jamieson Fausset Brown', 'Albert Barnes', 'Marvin Vincent', 'John Calvin', 'Philip Schaff', 'Archibald T Robertson', 'Adam Clarke']

## Henry Alford:
1. "The Spirit of Christ, i.e. Christ’s Spirit, gen. subj.: the Spirit which Christ has and gives, being He who reveals all things relating to Christ and the purposes of the Father."
2. "The sufferings regarding (spoken of with reference to; or, as before, ‘destined for’) Christ."
3. "The glories after these (sufferings) - 'Gloriam resurrectionis: gloriam adscensionis: gloriam judicii novissimi et regni cœlestis.'"

## Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "What expresses the time absolutely: what was to be the era of Messiah's coming; what manner of time; what events and features should characterize the time of His coming."
2. "The 'or' implies that some of the prophets, if they could not as individuals discover the exact time, searched into its characteristic features and events."
3. "Since 'the Spirit of Christ' is the Spirit of God, Christ is God. It is only because the Son of God was to become our Christ that He manifested Himself and the Father through Him in the Old Testament, and by the Holy Spirit, eternally proceeding from the Father and Himself, spake in the prophets."

## Albert Barnes:
1. "They studied them as we do the predictions which others have made; and though the prophets were the medium through which the truth was made known, yet their own predictions became a subject of careful investigation to themselves."
2. "How interesting is the thought that when Isaiah, for example, had given utterance to the sublime predictions which we now have of the Messiah, in his prophecies, he sat himself down with the spirit of a little child, to learn by prayer and study, what was fully implied in the amazing words which the Spirit had taught him to record!"
3. "They saw clearly that the Messiah was to suffer; and doubtless this was the common doctrine of the prophets, and the common expectation of the pious part of the Jewish nation. Yet it is not necessary to suppose that they had clear apprehensions of his sufferings, or were able to reconcile all that was said on that subject with what was said of his glory and his triumphs."

## Marvin Vincent:
1. "The sufferings destined for Christ, as in ver. 10 he speaks of the grace, unto you; i.e., destined to come unto you."
2. "Peter was especially concerned to show that the sufferings of Christ were in fulfillment of prophecy."
3. "The plural is used to indicate the successive steps of his glorification; the glory of his resurrection and ascension, of the last judgment, and of the kingdom of heaven."

## John Calvin:
1. "There was a difference between the law and the gospel, a veil as it were being interposed, that they might not see those things nearer which are now set before our eyes."
2. "It was no superstition to sigh with a desire of having a nearer sight [of redemption]."
3. "The prophets taught us by their example a sobriety in learning, for they did not go beyond what the Spirit taught them."
4. "The sufferings of Christ...teaches us that the Church of Christ has been from the beginning so constituted, that the cross has been the way to victory, and death a passage to life."
5. "It is no common consolation, that our condition, such as we find it to be, has been foretold so many ages ago."

## Philip Schaff:
1. "By diligent reflection these prophets sought to discover the precise period (whether soon or late), or, if that were denied them, at least the signs of the times the kind of era (whether, e.g., one of peace or one of war) at which the revelation given them of the destined admission of the Gentile world into Israel’s grace was to be made good."
2. "The revealing Power in them is designated ‘the Spirit of Christ,’ not in the sense of the Spirit that speaks of Christ, but in the sense of the Spirit that belongs to Christ, or possibly the Spirit that is identical with Christ."
3. "The future things thus attested are described as the sufferings unto Christ (i.e destined, or in store, for Christ), and the glories after these. But whose sufferings and glories? Some take them to be those of believers, and translate the clause, the sufferings (borne by Christians) in reference to Christ."

## Archibald T Robertson:
1. "The prophets knew what they prophesied, but not at what time the Messianic prophecies would be fulfilled."
2. "Peter definitely asserts here that the Spirit of Jesus Christ (the Messiah) was in the Old Testament prophets."
3. "Here we have predictive prophecy concerning the Messiah, though some modern critics fail to find predictions of the Messiah in the Old Testament."

## Adam Clarke:
1. "The glory that should follow" refers to the resurrection, ascension, exaltation, and the effusion of the Holy Spirit, as well as the manifestation of God's infinite love through the spread of the Gospel and the moral changes it brings to the world.
2. The glory also includes the final glorification of those who faithfully received the Gospel and continued in their faith until death.
3. Additionally, the human nature of Jesus Christ will be eternally glorified as the glorious Head of the Church.
