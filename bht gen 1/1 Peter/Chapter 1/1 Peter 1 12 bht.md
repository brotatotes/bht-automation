# 1 Peter 1:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Bible verse being described is a revelation that the prophets of old had knowledge of future events, not for their own sake, but for the benefit of future generations. They proclaimed these revelations through their ministry, which was driven by the Holy Spirit sent from heaven. The message they conveyed was of great interest, not only to humans, but even to the angels who desired to understand the mysteries of salvation. This passage highlights the incredible privilege we have to receive and proclaim the message of salvation that the prophets and apostles faithfully announced.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The great stream of interpreters being the other way, or not touching the difficulty at all), that (not, ‘because,’ as on interpretation (1) above it must be, and as Luther, al. take it: this clause does not contain the reason for the ἀπεκαλύφθη, but the content and purport of the ἀποκάλυψις) not to themselves (dat. commodi) but to you they were ministering."
2. "The things (in their previous announcement and foreshadowing) which now have been declared (aor., ‘were declared:’ νῦν embracing the N. T. period: but we in English cannot join ‘were’ with ‘now’) unto you by means of those who preached the gospel to you by (dat. instrumental) the Holy Spirit sent (historic tense again, referring distinctly to the day of Pentecost) from heaven."
3. "Which things (viz. the things announced to you: the αὐτὰ … ἅ: not, as many, the future glories promised to us: see below) angels (generic, as προφῆται above: see there) desire to look into (παρακύψαι, see reff., to stoop down and peer into. It enhances further still the excellence of the salvation revealed to us, that angels, for whom it is not designed as for us (Heb 2:16), long to pry into its mysteries."
