# choicest prompt v1 X bht prompt v3; ['Henry Alford', 'Jamieson Fausset Brown', 'Albert Barnes', 'Marvin Vincent', 'John Calvin', 'Philip Schaff', 'Archibald T Robertson', 'Adam Clarke']

## Henry Alford:
1. "The great stream of interpreters being the other way, or not touching the difficulty at all."
2. "From these examples it would appear, that the ἀπεκαλύφθη here is not said of any result or consequence of their ἐραυνῆσαι, but of the general revelation made to them."
3. "Still, both are one in design, and in the contents of their testimony: cf. the τῆς εἰς ὑμᾶς χάριτος, and τὰ εἰς χριστὸν παθήματα."

## Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Not only was the future revealed to them, but this also, that these revelations of the future were given them not for themselves, but for our good in Gospel times."
2. "Our immense privileges are thus brought forth by contrast with theirs, notwithstanding that they had the great honor of Christ's Spirit speaking in them; and this, as an incentive to still greater earnestness on our part than even they manifested."
3. "The Spirit of Christ was in the prophets also, but not manifestly, as in the case of the Christian Church and its first preachers, 'SENT down from heaven.' How favored are we in being ministered to, as to 'salvation,' by prophets and apostles alike, the latter now announcing the same things as actually fulfilled which the former foretold."

## Albert Barnes:
1. "They were not permitted to know fully the import of the predictions which they were made the instruments of communicating to mankind, but they understood that they were intended for the benefit of future ages."
2. "The full benefit of them would be experienced only in distant ages."
3. "The angels had an intense desire to look into these things; that they contemplated them with interest and fixed attention, like one who comes near to an object, and looks narrowly upon it."

## Marvin Vincent:
1. "The term is applicable to any kind of service, official or not." 
2. "Desire (ejpiqumousin). The word commonly denotes intense desire."
3. "A very graphic word, meaning to stoop sideways [παρα]. Used by Aristophanes to picture the attitude of a bad harp-player."

Note: The commentary provided is not a complete analysis of the verse, but rather a collection of random thoughts and observations.

## John Calvin:
1. "Their ministry is more useful to us, because we are fallen on the ends of the world."
2. "They spread the table, that others might afterwards feed on the provisions laid on it."
3. "The gospel contains treasures of wisdom, as yet concealed and hidden from angels."

## Philip Schaff:
1. "The ministry in view is expressed by a term applicable to any kind of service, official or non-official. It is the word used by Paul when he speaks of the Corinthians as ‘manifestly declared to be the Epistle of Christ ministered by us.’" 
2. "The preachers evangelized them by the Holy Ghost sent from heaven. The better reading here is not ‘in,’ but ‘by’ the Holy Ghost, the Spirit being represented simply as the instrument in whose might they effected what they did." 
3. "The intensity of this interest is expressed by the strong term desire, or long the word used by Christ Himself in view of His hastening passion, ‘With desire I have desired to eat this passover with you before I suffer.’"

## Archibald T Robertson:
1. "The connexion between study and inspiration is a great mystery." - Bigg
2. "We do the best that we can and only skirt the shore of knowledge." - Newton
3. "Here is revelation about the revelation already received, revelation after research."

## Adam Clarke:
1. "We may presume that, in a great variety of cases, the prophets did not understand the meaning of their own predictions."
2. "If all succeeding interpreters of the prophecies had been contented with the same information relative to the predictions still unaccomplished, we should have had fewer books, and more wisdom."
3. "Even the holy angels are struck with astonishment at the plan of human redemption, and justly wonder at the incarnation of that infinite object of their adoration."


# BHT:
In this enigmatic verse, various commentators shed light on the profound nature of the revelations contained within the Bible. The commentators emphasize the prophets' limited understanding of their own predictions, highlighting the future-oriented nature of their writings meant for our benefit. These prophetic messages, conveyed through the distant ages, are contrasted with the immense privileges bestowed upon the Christian Church. The intensity of interest displayed by both angels and Christ Himself underscores the profound significance of the hidden treasures of wisdom contained within the Gospel.
