# 1 Peter 1:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, believers are called to prepare their minds and be ready for the coming of the Lord, similar to how workers would gather their robes with a girdle in preparation for labor. They are urged to be sober, not only in their physical actions but also in their spiritual self-restraint, resisting the allurements of the world. Their minds should be focused and ready, like those who await their Lord's return, maintaining a steadfast hope for the blessings and grace that will be bestowed upon them.
