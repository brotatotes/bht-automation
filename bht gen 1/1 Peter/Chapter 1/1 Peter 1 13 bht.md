## Henry Alford:
1. "Gird up the loins of your mind, being sober." - The exhortation emphasizes the need for mental preparedness and vigilance, not just temperance in food and drink. It calls for spiritual sobriety, restraining our senses from being intoxicated by the allurements of the world.

2. "Hope perfectly." - This phrase encourages believers to have unwavering hope and devotion of soul, without doubt or dejection. It implies a complete trust in God's promises and a steadfast confidence in His faithfulness.

3. "The grace which is being brought to you in the revelation of Jesus Christ." - The grace mentioned here refers to the great gift of grace, the crowning example of grace. It highlights the imminent and near impending nature of this grace, which is brought to believers through the revelation of Jesus Christ at His second advent.

## Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Seeing that the prophets ministered unto you in these high Gospel privileges which they did not themselves fully share in, though 'searching' into them, and seeing that even angels 'desire to look into' them, how earnest you ought to be and watchful in respect to them!"
2. "The believer is to have his mind (mental powers) collected and always ready for Christ's coming. 'Gather in the strength of your spirit.'"
3. "Sobriety, that is, spiritual self-restraint, lest one be overcome by the allurements of the world and of sense, and patient hopeful waiting for Christ's revelation, are the true ways of 'girding up the loins of the mind.'"

## Albert Barnes:
1. "The meaning here is, that they were to have their minds in constant preparation to discharge the duties, or to endure the trials of life - like those who were prepared for labor, for a race, or for a conflict."
2. "They were not to abandon the hopes of the gospel, but were to cherish those hopes to the end of life, whatever opposition they might meet with, and however much might be done by others to induce them to apostatize."
3. "The word brought here means, that this great favor which they hoped for would be borne to them by the Saviour on his return from heaven."

## Marvin Vincent:
1. "The metaphor is suggested by the girding up of the loose eastern robes preparatory to running or other exertion."
2. "Christ's call is a call to active service."
3. "Set your hope perfectly: wholly and unchangeably; without doubt or despondency."

## John Calvin:
1. "It is hence necessary for us to put off the image of Adam and to cast aside the whole world and all hinderances, that being thus set at liberty we may rise upwards to Christ."
2. "Whosoever, then, really wishes to have this hope, let him learn in the first place to disentangle himself from the world, and gird up his mind that it may not turn aside to vain affections."
3. "For when we direct our eyes to this event, this world becomes crucified to us, and we to the world. Besides, according to this meaning, Peter used the expression shortly before."

## Philip Schaff:
1. "The duty is born of the privilege."
2. "The act of tucking up the loose Eastern tunic in preparation for travelling or running, for work or conflict, or for any kind of exertion...is the natural figure of a certain mental preparedness."
3. "The sobriety in view here...means the settled self-control, the elevated equanimity which should make the Christian superior to the distractions of the present."

## Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Because of which thing," the glorious free grace opened for Gentiles and Jews in Christ.
2. Girding up, a vivid metaphor for the habit of quickly gathering up loose robes with a girdle when in a hurry or starting on a journey.
3. Be sober, a metaphorical call to be mentally alert and clear-minded.
4. "Being perfectly sober," emphasizing the need for complete sobriety and not just partial sobriety.
5. "That is being brought," picturing the ongoing process of revelation.

## Adam Clarke:
1. "Gird up the loins of your mind — Take courage from this display of God's love now made known to you; and though you must expect trials, yet fortify your minds with the consideration that he who has given you his Son Jesus will withhold from you no manner of thing that is good."
2. "Hope to the end for the grace — Continue to expect all that God has promised, and particularly that utmost salvation, that glorification of body and soul, which ye shall obtain at the revelation of Christ, when he shall come to judge the world."
3. "But if the apostle alludes here to the approaching revelation of Christ to inflict judgment on the Jews for their final rebellion and obstinacy, then the grace, χαριν, benefit, may intend their preservation from the evils that were coming upon that people, and their wonderful escape from Jerusalem at the time that the Roman armies came against it."
