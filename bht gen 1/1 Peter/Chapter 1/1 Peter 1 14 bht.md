# choicest prompt v1 X bht prompt v3; ['Henry Alford', 'Jamieson Fausset Brown', 'Albert Barnes', 'Marvin Vincent', 'John Calvin', 'Philip Schaff', 'Archibald T Robertson', 'Adam Clarke']

## Henry Alford:
1. "Children of disobedience' are accordingly those, who belong to ἀπείθεια as a child to its mother, to whom disobedience is become a nature, a ruling disposition."
2. "The depths of the sacred tongue were given us to descend into, not to bridge over."
3. "This ignorance marks not only the period, but also the ground and element of these lusts prevailing in fashioning the life."

## Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Faith is the highest obedience, because discharged to the highest command" - Luther
2. "The outward fashion is fleeting, and merely on the surface. The 'form,' or conformation in the New Testament, is something deeper and more perfect and essential."
3. "The sanctification is first described negatively, c. the putting off the old man, even in the outward fashion, as well as in the inward conformation, then positively, putting on the new man."


## Albert Barnes:
1. "Conduct yourselves as becomes the children of God, by obeying his commands; by submitting to His will; and by manifesting unwavering confidence in him as your Father at all times."
2. "The Christian is to be as different from what he was himself before conversion as he is from his fellow-men."
3. "Now they are to be governed by a different rule, and their own former standard of morals and of opinions is no longer their guide, but the will of God."

## Marvin Vincent:
1. "The Christian is represented as related to the motive principle of his life as a child to a parent."
2. "The word really carries a warning against conformity to something changeful, and therefore illusory."
3. "The Christian is called to actively participate in the process of shaping and transforming their own lives."

## John Calvin:
1. "The sum of the whole law, and of all that God requires of us, is this, that his image should shine forth in us, so that we should not be degenerate children."
2. "The time of ignorance he calls that before they were called into the faith of Christ. We hence learn that unbelief is the fountain of all evils."
3. "Where the knowledge of God is not, there darkness, error, vanity, destitution of light and life, prevail."

These quotes highlight the importance of obedience, the role of unbelief in leading to sin, and the necessity of knowledge of God for true enlightenment.

## Philip Schaff:
1. "Hope is a sanctifying principle, promoting holiness, while it is itself also brightened and strengthened by it."
2. "In the character of the obedient, and in order to holiness, they must renounce a certain fashion of life."
3. "This unstable, deceptive form of life which they are not to assume is the old life of heathen lust, the life in which they ignorantly followed 'the capricious guidance of the passions.'"

## Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Children marked by obedience." 
2. "The outward pattern in contrast with the inward change." 
3. "In your ignorance."

## Adam Clarke:
1. "Not fashioning yourselves — As the offices of certain persons are known by the garb or livery they wear, so are transgressors."
2. "Where we see the world's livery we see the world's servants; they fashion or habit themselves according to their lusts."
3. "We may guess that they have a worldly mind by their conformity to worldly fashions."


# BHT:
The verse conveys the idea of transformation and obedience. It emphasizes the need for believers to separate themselves from their former way of life and conform to the will of God. The commentators remark on the significance of obedience, the contrast between outward appearance and inner change, and the danger of being influenced by worldly customs. The verse underscores the importance of actively choosing a new way of life based on faith and righteousness, rather than being governed by ignorance or conforming to sinful desires.
