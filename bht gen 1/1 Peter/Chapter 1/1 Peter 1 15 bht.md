# choicest prompt v1 X bht prompt v3; ['Henry Alford', 'Jamieson Fausset Brown', 'Albert Barnes', 'Marvin Vincent', 'John Calvin', 'Philip Schaff', 'Archibald T Robertson', 'Adam Clarke']

## Henry Alford:
1. "after the pattern of that Holy One who called you"
2. "be ye yourselves also holy in all behavior"
3. "Nulla sit pars vitæ quæ non hunc bonum sanctitatis odorem redoleat." (Translation: "Let there be no part of life that does not emit the good fragrance of holiness.")

## Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "God is our grand model."
2. "Every one that begets, begets an offspring resembling himself."
3. "Christians are already holy unto God by consecration; they must be so also in their outward walk and behavior in all respects."

## Albert Barnes:
1. "The model or example in accordance with which they were to frame their lives, should be the character of that God who had called them into his kingdom."
2. "They were to be like him."
3. "Since God is holy, and we profess to be his followers, we also ought to be holy."

## Marvin Vincent:
1. "Render, therefore, after the pattern of the Holy One who called you." 
2. "A favorite word with Peter; used eight times in the two epistles." 
3. "Our later limitation of the meaning to the interchange of talk makes it expedient to change the rendering, as Rev., to manner of living."

## John Calvin:
1. "God sets us apart as a peculiar people for himself; then we ought to be free from all pollutions."
2. "We are too ready to look to men, so as to follow their common way of living."
3. "In bidding us to be holy like himself, the proportion is not that of equals; but we ought to advance in this direction as far as our condition will bear."

## Philip Schaff:
1. "Instead of letting their life revert to the type of those renounced impurities, they must show it conformed to no lower standard than that of God." 
2. "Holiness would not be holiness, but exclusiveness, if it did not presuppose God’s entrance into multifarious relations, and thereby revelation and communication." 
3. "A holiness after God’s pattern, and befitting children of obedience, must needs be a separateness from the world complete enough to show itself in all and every part of their behaviour."

## Archibald T Robertson:
1. "God is our standard or pattern, not our lusts." 
2. "Do ye also become holy." 
3. "The original meaning (turning up and down, back and forth) suited the Latin word conversatio (converto), but not our modern 'conversation' (talk, not walk)."

## Adam Clarke:
1. "Heathenism scarcely produced a god whose example was not the most abominable." 
2. "Here Christianity has an infinite advantage over heathenism. God is holy, and he calls upon all who believe in him to imitate his holiness."
3. "The reason why they should be holy is, that God who has called them is holy."


# BHT:
In this verse, we are called to be holy, following the example of God Himself who has called us into His kingdom. Our behavior and way of life should emit the good fragrance of holiness, resembling the character of God who is our ultimate model. As believers, we are already consecrated to God, but we are also called to demonstrate holiness in every aspect of our lives. This call to holiness sets us apart from the impurities of the world and requires a complete separation from ungodliness in our thoughts, words, and actions.
