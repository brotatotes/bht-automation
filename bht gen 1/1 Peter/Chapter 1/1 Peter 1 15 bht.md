# 1 Peter 1:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This verse calls for believers to strive for holiness in their lives, following the example set by God himself. They are urged to live in a manner that reflects the character of the Holy One who has called them. This encompasses all aspects of their behavior and conversation, as well as a separation from the impurities of the world. The command to be holy is rooted in the nature of God, who is the source and model of holiness, and believers are called to imitate and follow him in their pursuit of holy living.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Nay rather (owing to the broken construction, ἀλλά is not, strictly speaking, the negation of μὴ συνσχημ., but of whatever we supply to complete it; and thus is stronger than merely ‘but.’ So Œc., ἀλλὰ νῦν γοῦν, λέγει, τῷ καλέσαντι συσχηματιζόμενοι, ἁγίῳ ὄντι κ. τ. λ.) after the pattern of (the prep. still carries on the idea of conformity of σχῆμα) that Holy One" - This quote explains the significance of the word "nay rather" and provides insight into the meaning of "after the pattern of" in relation to the Holy One who called the readers.

2. "be ye yourselves also (γενήθητε, aor. imperat., setting forth the completeness with which this holiness is to be put on. But the passive sense of ἐγενήθην must not be everywhere pressed)" - This quote emphasizes the command for the readers to be holy themselves and clarifies the passive sense of the verb "ἐγενήθην."

3. "holy in all (manner of, every instance of: not πάσῃ τῇ nor τῇ πάσῃ: nor need we suppose, as De W., an irregular construction such as it is almost impossible to avoid recognizing in Eph 2:21) behaviour (conversation, in the old sense of turning and walking about in life)" - This quote explains the meaning of being holy in all behavior or conversation, highlighting the idea of living a holy life in every aspect.
