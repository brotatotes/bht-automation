# choicest prompt v1 X bht prompt v3; ['Henry Alford', 'Jamieson Fausset Brown', 'Albert Barnes', 'Marvin Vincent', 'John Calvin', 'Philip Schaff', 'Archibald T Robertson', 'Adam Clarke']

## Henry Alford:
1. "God's holiness is not just a characteristic or attribute, but it is the very essence of His being. As His children, we are called to reflect His holiness in our lives." 

2. "The command to be holy is not a suggestion or a mere moral standard, but it is a divine mandate rooted in God's own nature. It is a call to live in a way that is set apart and distinct from the world."

3. "Holiness is not about perfection or sinlessness, but it is about a heart that is devoted to God and seeks to align itself with His will. It is a continual process of transformation and sanctification."

## Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Scripture is the true source of all authority in questions of doctrine and practice."
2. "As I am the fountain of holiness, being holy in My essence, be ye therefore zealous to be partakers of holiness, that ye may be as I also am."
3. "God is essentially holy: the creature is holy in so far as it is sanctified by God."

## Albert Barnes:
1. "The foundation of the command is, that they professed to be his people, and that as his people they ought to be like their God."
2. "It is a great truth, that people everywhere will imitate the God whom they worship. They will form their character in accordance with his."
3. "Hence, by knowing what are the characteristics of the gods which are worshipped by any people, we may form a correct estimate of the character of the people themselves."

These quotes emphasize the importance of Christians striving to be holy, as they are called to imitate the character of God. They also highlight the idea that true worship shapes and molds the character of believers, making them more like God.

## Philip Schaff:
1. "The future, 'ye shall be,' is better supported than the imperative, 'be ye.' The sense, however, remains substantially the same." 
2. "Peter appends a reason for his counsel, and this he expresses in words which he takes from God's charge to Israel." 
3. "They occur repeatedly in the Pentateuch, but they apply with even greater force to the subject of God's wider choice in the New Testament Israel."

## Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Because it is written" - This phrase emphasizes the authority and importance of the quotation from the Old Testament. It highlights the fact that the words being referenced are not just human wisdom, but divine revelation.

2. "The quotation is from Leviticus 11:44; Leviticus 19:2; Leviticus 20:7" - This reference to specific verses in Leviticus shows that the command to be perfect is not a new concept introduced by Jesus, but rather a principle that has been established in the Old Testament. It highlights the continuity and consistency of God's expectations for His people.

3. "The future εσεσθε here is volitive like an imperative" - This explanation clarifies that the use of the future tense in the Greek text indicates a command or exhortation. It suggests that being perfect is not just a suggestion or an ideal to strive for, but a commandment that believers are called to actively pursue.
