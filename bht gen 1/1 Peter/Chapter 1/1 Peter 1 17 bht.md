# choicest prompt v1 X bht prompt v3; ['Henry Alford', 'Jamieson Fausset Brown', 'Albert Barnes', 'Marvin Vincent', 'John Calvin', 'Philip Schaff', 'Archibald T Robertson', 'Adam Clarke']

## Henry Alford:
1. "If ye call upon as father Him who judgeth impartially...according to the work of each man." 
2. "Behave during the time of your sojourning in fear." 
3. "This fear is not the leading to repentance, but the fear which accompanies the Christian through his whole course."

## Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Call upon as Father Him who without acceptance of persons judgeth." - This quote highlights the idea that believers should approach God as their Father, who judges without favoritism. It emphasizes the unity and authority of the Trinity, as the Father judges through His Son.
2. "Each man's work is one complete whole, whether good or bad." - This quote emphasizes that our actions and works reflect our overall character and faith. It reminds us that our works are not isolated incidents, but rather manifestations of our relationship with God.
3. "The outward state of the Jews in their dispersion is an emblem of the sojourner-like state of all believers in this world." - This quote draws a parallel between the Jews' physical state of being scattered and the spiritual state of believers as sojourners in this world. It highlights the idea that our true home is with God and that we are temporary residents on earth.

## Albert Barnes:
1. "Piety being represented in the Scriptures as calling on God, or as the worship of God."
2. "God is often spoken of as the Father of the intelligent beings whom he has made. Christians worship Him as a Father - as one having all the feelings of a kind and tender parent toward them."
3. "You worship a God who will judge every person according to his real character, and you should therefore lead such lives as he can approve."

## Marvin Vincent:
1. "God is to be invoked, not only as Father, but as Judge."
2. "The constituents of the compound word, proswpon, the countenance, and lambanw, to receive, are found in Galatians 2:6; and the word is the Old - Testament formula to accept or to raise the face of another; opposed to making the countenance fall."
3. "In the Old Testament it is, as Bishop Lightfoot observes, 'a neutral expression involving no subsidiary notion of partiality, and is much oftener found in a good than in a bad sense.'"

## John Calvin:
1. "He judges, he says, without looking on the person, that is, no outward mask is of any account with him, as the case is with men, but he sees the heart." 
2. "By saying, According to every man’s work, he does not refer to merit or to reward... but that what will be regarded will be the real sincerity of the heart."
3. "The fear that is mentioned, stands opposed to heedless security, such as is wont to creep in, when there is a hope of deceiving with impunity."

## Philip Schaff:
1. "He whom all believers invoke in prayer is Father indeed, but also and none the less Judge." 
2. "Peter would seem to remind them that the God whom Christ had taught them to look to as Father is One in whom there is no breach between parental love and judicial rectitude."
3. "The qualifying term, ‘without respect of persons,’ denotes that this impartial judgment of God takes men not in the mass, but individually, and every man for himself, whether son or not."

## Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Without respect of persons" - Found nowhere else except in the later Ep. of Clem. of Rome and Ep. of Barn., from alpha privative and προσωπολημπτης (Acts 10:34. See James 2:9 for προσωπολημπτεω and 1 Peter 1:1 for προσωπολημψια) from προσωπον λαμβανω (in imitation of the Hebrew).

2. "According to each man's work" - "According to the deed of each one" God judges (κρινοντα) just as Christ judges also (2 Corinthians 5:10).

3. "Of your sojourning" - It comes from παροικεω, old verb, to dwell beside (in one's neighbourhood), and so of pilgrims or strangers (παροικος Acts 7:6) as of Jews away from Palestine or of Christians here on earth, then of a local region (our "parish"). Peter here recurs to 1 Peter 1:1 ("sojourners of the Dispersion").

## Adam Clarke:
1. "God is said to be no respecter of persons for this reason among many others, that, being infinitely righteous, he must be infinitely impartial."
2. "God can feel neither of them, and therefore God can be no respecter of persons. He approves or disapproves of men according to their moral character."
3. "Here, then, is no respect of persons; God's judgment will be according to a man's work, and a man's work or conduct will be according to the moral state of his mind."

These quotes highlight the impartiality of God's judgment and emphasize that it is based on a person's moral character and actions, rather than any external factors or favoritism.


# BHT:
In this Bible verse, the commentator quotes emphasize the nature of God as both a Father and a Judge. They highlight that believers should approach God with reverence and fear, not only as a kind and tender parent, but also as the one who judges impartially. The verse reminds us that our works reflect our character and faith, and that God will judge each person according to their true nature. The mention of fear also serves as a reminder to live a life pleasing to God.
