# choicest prompt v1 X bht prompt v3; ['Henry Alford', 'Jamieson Fausset Brown', 'Albert Barnes', 'Marvin Vincent', 'John Calvin', 'Philip Schaff', 'Archibald T Robertson', 'Adam Clarke']

## Henry Alford:
1. "This argument enhances the duty of godly fear by the consideration of the inestimable price at which they were redeemed."
2. "The diminutive forms stand generally for the coined or wrought metal: and such a sense would be applicable here."
3. "The vain ungodly lives of Jews as πατροπαράδοτα, without more explanation."

(Note: The commentary is quite lengthy, so I have selected three quotes that provide different insights into the verse.)

## Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "The blood of Christ is not in Scripture said to buy heaven for us: heaven is the 'inheritance' given to us as sons, by the promise of God."
2. "Gold and silver being liable to corruption themselves, can free no one from spiritual and bodily death; they are therefore of too little value. Contrast 1 Peter 1:19, Christ's 'precious blood.'"
3. "An Israelite sold as a bond-servant for debt might be redeemed by one of his brethren. As, therefore, we could not redeem ourselves, Christ assumed our nature in order to become our nearest of kin and brother, and so our God or Redeemer."

## Albert Barnes:
1. "There is no more effectual way to induce true Christians to consecrate themselves entirely to God, than to refer them to the fact that they are not their own, but have been purchased by the blood of Christ."
2. "The word here means that they were rescued from sin and death by the blood of Christ, as the valuable consideration on account of which it was done; that is, the blood, or the life of Christ offered as a sacrifice, effected the same purpose in regard to justice and to the maintenance of the principles of moral government."
3. "The idea here is, that a price far more valuable than any amount of silver or gold had been paid for the redemption of the people of God, and that they were under proportionate obligation to devote themselves to his service."

## Marvin Vincent:
1. "The verb carries the idea of a ransom - price."
2. "With silver or gold money; the words meaning, respectively, a small coin of silver or of gold."
3. "Handed down from your fathers. The word is peculiar to Peter."

## John Calvin:
1. "There is hence nothing which ought so much to stimulate us to the practice of holiness, as the memory of this price of our redemption."
2. "For the sake of amplifying he mentions these things in contrast, so that we may know that the whole world, and all things deemed precious by men, are nothing to the excellency and value of this price."
3. "But we hence learn, that as soon as men depart from Christ, they go fatally astray. In vain is pretended in this case the authority of the Fathers or an ancient custom."

## Philip Schaff:
1. "The thought of what it cost to help them to break with the old walk of heathenism should be argument enough for cultivating now a walk of gravity and circumspection."
2. "A redemption is in view which is expressed by a verb that is found in the N. T. only in other two passages (Titus 2:14; Luke 24:21), although several terms connected with it occur not unfrequently."
3. "Here the ransom price is stated first negatively as not ‘corruptible’ (or ‘perishable’) things, not even the most valuable of these, such as silver or gold."

## Archibald T Robertson:
1. "The appeal is to an elementary Christian belief, the holiness and justice of God with the added thought of the high cost of redemption."
2. "The ransom is the blood of Christ."
3. "The Jews made a wrong use of tradition, but the reference here seems mainly to Gentiles."

## Adam Clarke:
1. "The precious blood of Christ is here stated to be the price at which the souls of both Jews and Gentiles were redeemed; it was a price paid down, and a price which God's righteousness required."
2. "Even silver and gold, the most valuable medium of commerce among men, bear no proportion in their value to the souls of a lost world."
3. "Nothing, therefore, but such a ransom price as God provided could be a sufficient ransom, oblation, and satisfaction, for the sins of the world."


# BHT:
The verse being described emphasizes the redemption of both Jews and Gentiles, highlighting the high cost paid with the precious blood of Christ. Commentators draw attention to the significance of this price, surpassing the value of silver or gold. It is a reminder of God's holiness, justice, and the need for consecration, inspiring believers to live in dedication to Him. The verse also touches upon the misuse of tradition and the erroneous ways of the world, urging believers to stay true to Christ as their ultimate redeemer.
