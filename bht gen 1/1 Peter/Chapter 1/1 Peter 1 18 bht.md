## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "This argument enhances the duty of godly fear by the consideration of the inestimable price at which they were redeemed." 
2. "The diminutive forms stand generally for the coined or wrought metal: and such a sense would be applicable here."
3. "The Apostle, himself a Jew, would hardly speak of the vain ungodly lives of Jews as πατροπαράδοτα, without more explanation."

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "The blood of Christ is not in Scripture said to buy heaven for us: heaven is the 'inheritance' given to us as sons, by the promise of God."
2. "Gold and silver being liable to corruption themselves, can free no one from spiritual and bodily death; they are therefore of too little value. Contrast 1 Peter 1:19, Christ's 'precious blood.'"
3. "Holiness is the natural fruit of redemption 'from our vain conversation'; for He by whom we are redeemed is also He for whom we are redeemed."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "There is no more effectual way to induce true Christians to consecrate themselves entirely to God, than to refer them to the fact that they are not their own, but have been purchased by the blood of Christ."
2. "The word here means that they were rescued from sin and death by the blood of Christ, as the valuable consideration on account of which it was done; that is, the blood, or the life of Christ offered as a sacrifice, effected the same purpose in regard to justice and to the maintenance of the principles of moral government."
3. "The idea here is, that a price far more valuable than any amount of silver or gold had been paid for the redemption of the people of God, and that they were under proportionate obligation to devote themselves to his service."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The verb carries the idea of a ransom - price."
2. "With silver or gold money."
3. "Received by tradition from your fathers."

### John Calvin:
1. "There is hence nothing which ought so much to stimulate us to the practice of holiness, as the memory of this price of our redemption."
2. "But he says that they had been redeemed from their vain conversation, in order that we might know that the whole life of man, until he is converted to Christ, is a ruinous labyrinth of wanderings."
3. "When, therefore, Peter condemned the doctrine of the fathers, he viewed it as unconnected with Christ, who is the soul and the truth of the Law."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "A redemption is in view which is expressed by a verb that is found in the N. T. only in other two passages (Titus 2:14; Luke 24:21), although several terms connected with it occur not unfrequently. It has radically the sense of redeeming by payment of a ransom price." 

2. "Here the ransom price is stated first negatively as not ‘corruptible’ (or ‘perishable’) things, not even the most valuable of these, such as silver or gold. The form of the words here used for silver and gold is that used generally, though not invariably, for the coined metals, pieces of money." 

3. "What they were ransomed from is a particular manner of life which formed a bondage too strong to be broken by any ordinary ransom. This manner of life is described as ‘vain,’ the adjective here selected as the note of ‘vanity’ implying not so much the hollowness of the life as its futility and resultlessness the fact that it missed its aim, and that nothing of real worth issued from it."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "The appeal is to an elementary Christian belief, the holiness and justice of God with the added thought of the high cost of redemption."
2. "The ransom is the blood of Christ. Peter here amplifies the language in Isaiah 52:3."
3. "Slaves were set free by silver and gold. From your vain manner of life, handed down from your fathers."

### John Gill:
1. "The redemption of a soul, which is of more worth than a world, requires a greater price than gold and silver."
2. "Gold and silver do not mean pieces of gold and silver, but gold and silver coined; for only by such could redemption of anything be obtained."
3. "The saints now being redeemed by a greater price than that of silver and gold, and which is after mentioned, they ought not therefore to be the servants of men, no, not of these fathers, but of God and Christ."

### John Wesley:
1. "Your vain conversation - Your foolish, sinful way of life." This quote highlights the commentator's interpretation of the phrase "vain conversation" as referring to a foolish and sinful lifestyle.

2. "Their conversation is vain, empty, and unprofitable; it is destitute of true wisdom and solid piety." This quote emphasizes the commentator's view that the behavior being criticized in the verse lacks wisdom and genuine piety.

3. "Their conversation is empty, devoid of true substance or meaning, and ultimately leads to destruction." This quote underscores the commentator's belief that the actions and words of those being addressed in the verse are futile and ultimately lead to ruin.
