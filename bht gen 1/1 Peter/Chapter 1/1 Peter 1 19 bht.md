## Henry Alford:
1. "but with precious blood, as of a lamb blameless and spotless" - This emphasizes the value and purity of Christ's blood, likening it to the blood of a blameless and spotless lamb.
2. "the figure of buying out of the ματαία ἀναστροφή seems to contain an allusion to the bringing up out of Egypt" - The redemption of believers from a futile way of life is compared to the deliverance of Israel from Egypt, drawing a parallel between the blood of the paschal lamb and the blood of Christ.
3. "the redemption of those brought out of heathendom required the blood of Christ" - Just as the blood of the paschal lamb was necessary for Israel's redemption from Egypt, the blood of Christ is necessary for the redemption of those brought out of heathendom.

## Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "With precious blood, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot (even the blood) of Christ." 
2. "Though very man, He remained pure in Himself ('without blemish'), and uninfected by any impression of sin from without ('without spot'), which would have unfitted Him for being our atoning Redeemer."
3. "As Israel's redemption from Egypt required the blood of the paschal lamb, so our redemption from sin and the curse required the blood of Christ."

## Albert Barnes:
1. "The word 'precious' is a word which would be applied to that which is worth much; which is costly."
2. "The blood of Christ had a value above silver and gold; it was worth more, to wit: (1) In itself - being a more valuable thing - and, (2) In effecting our redemption."
3. "Such a lamb only was allowed to be offered in sacrifice... because it was proper that man should offer that which was regarded as perfect in its kind."

## Marvin Vincent:
1. "The word Cristou, of Christ, stands at the end of the sentence, and is emphatic."
2. "The reference is to a sacrificial lamb."
3. "Without blemish [αμωμου]. Representing the Old - Testament phrase for absence of physical defect."

Note: The commentary provided does not exceed 60 words.

## John Calvin:
1. "We have in Christ whatever had been shadowed forth by the ancient sacrifices... it assists our faith not a little, to compare the reality with the type, so that we may seek in the former what the latter contains."
2. "Moses ordered a whole or perfect lamb, without blemish, to be chosen for the Passover... Peter, by applying this to Christ, teaches us that he was a suitable victim, and approved by God, for he was perfect, without any blemish."
3. "Had he had any defect in him, he could not have been rightly offered to God, nor could he pacify his wrath."

## Philip Schaff:
1. "The point of the statement is not to institute a direct comparison between Christ and a lamb, nor to represent the means by which the redemption was effected as comparable in value to the blood of a stainless lamb, but to exhibit the cost of the redemption from the heathen life of sin as nothing less than the surrender of a life of sinless perfection."
2. "The terms 'blameless' and 'spotless,' too, are terms applicable to the lambs of the Old Testament system, with which every Israelite was so familiar."
3. "The lamb particularly in Peter’s view here, is variously identified, as e.g. with the Paschal Lamb, with the lamb of Isaiah 53:0, or with the general idea signified by the various lambs of the Old Testament service and realized in Christ."

## Archibald T Robertson:
1. "The blood of anyone is 'precious' (costly), far above gold or silver, but that of Jesus immeasurably more so." 
2. "Jesus is the Paschal Lamb. Peter sees clearly that it was by the blood of Christ that we are redeemed from sin." 
3. "Without (alpha privative) spot (μωμος) as the paschal lamb had to be (Leviticus 22:21). So Hebrews 9:14."

## Adam Clarke:
1. "The precious blood of Christ - The valuable blood; how valuable neither is nor could be stated." This quote emphasizes the immeasurable value of Christ's blood, highlighting its significance in the redemption of humanity.

2. "As of a lamb - Such as was required for a sin-offering to God; and THE Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world." This quote highlights the dual symbolism of Christ as both the sacrificial lamb and the ultimate atonement for the sins of the world.

3. "Without blemish - In himself, and without spot from the world; being perfectly pure in his soul, and righteous in his life." This quote emphasizes the moral perfection and sinlessness of Christ, underscoring his suitability as the perfect sacrifice for humanity's sins.
