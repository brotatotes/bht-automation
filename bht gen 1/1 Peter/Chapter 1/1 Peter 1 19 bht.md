### Philip Schaff:
1. "The point of the statement is not to institute a direct comparison between Christ and a lamb, nor to represent the means by which the redemption was effected as comparable in value to the blood of a stainless lamb, but to exhibit the cost of the redemption from the heathen life of sin as nothing less than the surrender of a life of sinless perfection."
2. "The lamb particularly in Peter’s view here, is variously identified, as e.g. with the Paschal Lamb, with the lamb of Isaiah 53:0, or with the general idea signified by the various lambs of the Old Testament service and realized in Christ."
3. "The expiatory or sacrificial value of Christ’s death is no doubt at the basis of the statement, and the idea of ransom from sin as a power is not disconnected from the idea of a ransom from sin as a penalty. But the redemption which Peter deals with here, being a redemption from the spell and thraldom of a vain mode of living, is an ethical redemption, and Christ’s death is presented immediately here as a spiritual power breaking a certain despotism."
