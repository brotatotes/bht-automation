## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The difference between προγιγνώσκειν and προορίζειν is this, that in the former idea, the fact of knowledge is especially put forward, seeing that all God’s decrees rest on the ground of His omniscience." 
2. "Eligendos facit Deus, non invenit," is an important remark of Augustine.
3. "By this description of the readers, an anticipation is given of the whole train of thought in the Epistle: the aim of which is to impress the blessed certainty of salvation, and with that, the obligations incurred by receiving God’s gift."

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "God's foreknowledge is not the perception of any ground of action out of Himself; still in it liberty is comprehended, and all absolute constraint debarred."
2. "The Hebrew and Greek 'know' include approval and acknowledging as one's own."
3. "Believers are 'sanctified through the offering of Christ once for all.' This is the true sanctification of the Spirit, to obey the Gospel, to trust in Christ."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The word does not refer to the purpose to choose, but to the fact that they were chosen or selected by God as His people."
2. "The essential idea here is, that the original choice was on the part of God, and not on their part, and that this choice was founded on what He before knew to be best."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Their election is in virtue of this, in pursuance of this (Alford), or has this for its norm. The term foreknowledge (which is never used of the lost) is distinct at once from allied terms expressing the idea of predestinating or fore-ordaining...It is a foreknowledge, therefore, which comes near the ideas of predestination and creative or appropriating love, and which makes it certain that its objects shall be in the relation which God purposes for them."
2. "If their election has its ground and norm in the foreknowledge of the Father, it realizes itself now within the sphere or condition of a patent separation from the world, which is effected by the Spirit."
3. "Thus the note of comfort, struck at once in recalling the fact that the readers were elect, is prolonged by this statement of all that there is in the nature of that election to lift them above the disquietudes of time."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Peter here presents the Trinity (God the Father, the Spirit, Jesus Christ)." 
2. "The whole Epistle is a commentary upon προγνωσις θεου, αγιασμος πνευματος, αιμα Χριστου (Bigg). Peter is not ashamed of the blood of Christ." 
3. "Grace and peace (χαρις κα ειρηνη) occur together in 2 Peter 1:2, in 2 John 1:2 (with ελεος), and in all Paul's Epistles (with ελεος added in I and II Timothy)."

### John Gill:
1. "The cause, spring, and source of their election was, 'the foreknowledge of God the Father': to whom election is commonly ascribed, agreeably to the order of the divine Persons in the Trinity, and their distinct parts in the economy of salvation."
2. "But the sovereign grace, good will, and pleasure of God, or the everlasting love of God the Father, which is the cause of, and has given birth to the act of election, is meant by foreknowledge, joined with affection, delight, and approbation."
3. "The ends to which the saints are chosen are, unto obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ; by 'obedience' is meant either the obedience of elect men to Christ, which lies in obeying the truth of the Gospel, called the obedience of faith... or else the obedience of Christ is intended; and so the Arabic version renders it, 'unto the obedience of Jesus Christ'; which lay in his performing the precepts of the law, and bearing the penalty of it, death."

### John Wesley:
1. "Strictly speaking, there is no foreknowledge, no more than afterknowledge, with God: but all things are known to him as present from eternity to eternity."
2. "Election, in the scripture sense, is God's doing anything that our merit or power have no part in."
3. "Through sanctification of the Spirit — Through the renewing and purifying influences of his Spirit on their souls."
