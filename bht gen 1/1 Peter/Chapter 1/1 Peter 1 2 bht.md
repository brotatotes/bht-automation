# choicest prompt v1 X bht prompt v3; ['Henry Alford', 'Jamieson Fausset Brown', 'Albert Barnes', 'Marvin Vincent', 'John Calvin', 'Philip Schaff', 'Archibald T Robertson', 'Adam Clarke']

## Henry Alford:
1. "The difference between προγιγνώσκειν and προορίζειν is this, that in the former idea, the fact of knowledge is especially put forward, seeing that all God’s decrees rest on the ground of His omniscience." 
2. "Eligendos facit Deus, non invenit," is an important remark of Augustine. 
3. "By this description of the readers, an anticipation is given of the whole train of thought in the Epistle: the aim of which is to impress the blessed certainty of salvation, and with that, the obligations incurred by receiving God’s gift."

## Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "God's foreknowledge is not the perception of any ground of action out of Himself; still in it liberty is comprehended, and all absolute constraint debarred."
2. "The Hebrew and Greek 'know' include approval and acknowledging as one's own."
3. "Believers are 'sanctified through the offering of Christ once for all.' This is the true sanctification of the Spirit, to obey the Gospel, to trust in Christ."

## Albert Barnes:
1. "The word does not refer to the purpose to choose, but to the fact that they were chosen or selected by God as His people."
2. "The essential idea here is, that the original choice was on the part of God, and not on their part, and that this choice was founded on what He before knew to be best."
3. "We become in fact the chosen or elect of God by a work of the Spirit on our hearts making us holy; that is, renewing us in the divine image."

## Marvin Vincent:
1. "The Father foreknowing, the Son atoning, the Spirit applying the Son's work in sanctifying." 
2. "The mystery of the Trinity and the economy of our salvation are intimated in this verse." 
3. "Grace and peace. The salutation is peculiar by the addition of be multiplied."

## Philip Schaff:
1. "Their election is in virtue of this, in pursuance of this (Alford), or has this for its norm. The term foreknowledge (which is never used of the lost) is distinct at once from allied terms expressing the idea of predestinating or fore-ordaining... It is a foreknowledge, therefore, which comes near the ideas of predestination and creative or appropriating love, and which makes it certain that its objects shall be in the relation which God purposes for them."
2. "In sanctification of the Spirit... it expresses neither the act nor the process of sanctifying, nor yet the ethical quality of holiness, but that state of separation or consecration into which God’s Spirit brings God’s elect."
3. "The election, which is rooted in the eternal purpose of God, works historically to this twofold goal: the subjective result of an attitude of filial obedience, and the objective result of a permanent covenant relation assured to its objects."

## Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Peter here presents the Trinity (God the Father, the Spirit, Jesus Christ)." 
2. "The whole Epistle is a commentary upon προγνωσις θεου, αγιασμος πνευματοσ, αιμα Χριστου (Bigg)." 
3. "Peter is not ashamed of the blood of Christ."

## Adam Clarke:
1. "Election, in the scriptural sense, is God's doing any thing that our merit or power has no part in." 
2. "The true predestination or foreappointment of God is, 1. He that believeth shall be saved from the guilt and power of sin. 2. He that endureth to the end shall be saved eternally. 3. They who receive the precious gift of faith thereby become the sons of God; and, being sons, they shall receive the Spirit of holiness, to walk as Christ also walked." 
3. "Through sanctification of the Spirit — through the renewing and purifying influences of his Spirit on their souls, unto obedience - to engage and enable them to yield themselves up to all holy obedience, the foundation of all which is the sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ - the atoning blood of Jesus Christ which was typified by the sprinkling of the blood of sacrifices under the law, in allusion to which it is called the blood of sprinkling."


# BHT:
The verse being described emphasizes the concept of divine foreknowledge and election. God's omniscient knowledge forms the foundation of His decrees and choices. The selection of believers by God is not based on their own merits but is rooted in His sovereign choice. Through the sanctifying work of the Spirit, believers are set apart and empowered to live obediently, all made possible through the cleansing power of the blood of Jesus Christ. This verse reveals the profound mysteries of the Trinity, the economy of salvation, and the eternal purpose of God's election.
