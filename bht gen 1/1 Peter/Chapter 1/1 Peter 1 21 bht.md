## Henry Alford:
1. "That we are redeemed from our vain conversation, is owing to the blood of Christ: but that we have faith and hope in God, is brought about by God having raised Christ from the dead, and given Him glory." 
2. "Your faith rests on Christ's resurrection it was God who raised Him: your hope, on Christ's glorification: it is God who has given Him that glory."
3. "Closely accordant with this is St. Peter's first public speech in the Acts 2:22 ff., where all that has happened to Christ is referred to God as the doer of it."

## Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Through Christ: His Spirit, obtained for us in His resurrection and ascension, enabling us to believe."
2. "By this faith the ungodly is justified, so that thenceforth faith itself begins to work by love."
3. "The raising of Jesus by God is the special ground of our 'believing': (1) because by it God declared openly His acceptance of Him as our righteous substitute; (2) because by it and His glorification He received power, namely, the Holy Spirit, to impart to His elect 'faith': the same power enabling us to believe as raised Him from the dead."

## Albert Barnes:

2. "By raising up the Lord Jesus, and exalting him to heaven, he has laid the foundation of confidence in his promises, and of the hope of eternal life."
3. "He has laid the foundation of confidence in his promises, and of the hope of eternal life."

## Marvin Vincent:
1. "The phrase 'that your faith and hope might be in God' emphasizes the object of our faith and hope, which is God himself. It reminds us that our trust and confidence should ultimately be placed in God, rather than in ourselves or any other human being."
2. "By stating that our faith should also be toward God, the commentary highlights the importance of directing our faith towards God alone. It reminds us that our faith is not meant to be divided or shared with anything or anyone else, but rather it should be wholeheartedly placed in God."
3. "The verse encourages us to have faith and hope in God, reminding us that he is the source of our salvation and the one who can fulfill our deepest desires and longings. It reminds us to place our trust in God's promises and to rely on him for our ultimate hope and security."

## John Calvin:
1. "For, since God is incomprehensible, faith could never reach to him, except it had an immediate regard to Christ."
2. "Let us, therefore, remember, that Christ is not in vain called the image of the invisible God, but this name is given to him for this reason, because God cannot be known except in him."
3. "It is hence evident that we cannot believe in God except through Christ, in whom God in a manner makes himself little, that he might accommodate himself to our comprehension; and it is Christ alone who can tranquillize consciences, so that we may dare to come in confidence to God."

## Philip Schaff:
1. "The readers not merely as believing, but as raised to the condition of a settled and loyal faith, and as having God Himself, and nothing lower, for the object of this new conviction."
2. "Christ, and only Christ, by all that He had taught and all that He had been on earth, was the means of leading them to this knowledge of God and trust in God."
3. "The fact that these Gentiles, once ‘without God and without hope in the world,’ had been brought through Christ to know God, and rest their faith in Him, is a witness to the truth of Peter’s statement that even they were in God’s view when the Christ, who had been eternally before His mind as Ransom, was manifested in time."
