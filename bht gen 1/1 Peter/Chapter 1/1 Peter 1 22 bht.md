## Henry Alford:
1. "Having purified your souls in your obedience of the truth." 
2. "The legitimate tendency of that purification, which ought to have been going on in your souls, was toward unfeigned brotherly love." 
3. "Let the love come straight and pure from thence, not short of it, from any secondary purpose as its origin."

## Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Faith purifies the heart as giving it the only pure motive, love to God."
2. "The Holy Spirit is the purifier by bestowing the obedience of faith."
3. "Love to the brethren is the evidence of our regeneration and justification by faith."

## Albert Barnes:
1. "No one is made pure without personal intention or effort - any more than one becomes accomplished or learned without personal exertion."
2. "The amount of effort which we make 'in purifying our souls' is usually also the measure of our attainments in religion."
3. "The effect of the influence of the Holy Spirit in applying the truth has been to produce sincere love to all who are true Christians."

## Marvin Vincent:
1. "Purified [ηγνικοτες]...In the moral sense, as here, James 4:8; 1 John 3:3." 
2. "Obeying [υπακοη]...A peculiarly New Testament term unknown in classical Greek." 
3. "Unfeigned [ανυποκριτον]...A hypocrite is, therefore, an actor."

## John Calvin:
1. "The meaning is, that their souls would not be capable of receiving grace until they were purified, and by this our uncleanness is proved."
2. "Your souls are to be purified, but as ye cannot do this, offer them to God, that he may take away your filth by his Spirit."
3. "He briefly reminds us what God especially requires in our life, and the mark to which all our endeavors should be directed."
4. "This, then, is the reason why Peter calls our attention to it, when speaking of a life rightly formed."
5. "He adds, fervently; for the more slothful we are by nature, the more ought every one to stimulate himself to fervor and earnestness, and that not only once, but more and more daily."

## Philip Schaff:
1. "What it implies, therefore, is a moral purification from everything inconsistent with a religious destination."
2. "In order to exhibit the acts of love of the kind here enjoined on all the particular occasions which may arise for them, they must first see to have the disposition of love the disposition of souls cleansed of selfishness."
3. "The purification implies, the creation of a disposition which is alien to all love that is unreal or selfish."

## Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Seeing ye have purified (ηγνικοτες). Perfect active participle of αγνιζω, old verb from αγνος (pure), here with ψυχας (souls), with καρδιας (hearts) in James 4:8 as in 1 John 3:3 of moral cleansing also."

2. "There is cleansing power in the truth of God in Christ."
