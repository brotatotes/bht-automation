# choicest prompt v1 X bht prompt v3; ['Henry Alford', 'Jamieson Fausset Brown', 'Albert Barnes', 'Marvin Vincent', 'John Calvin', 'Philip Schaff', 'Archibald T Robertson', 'Adam Clarke']

## Henry Alford:
1. "Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but incorruptible, by means of the word of God, living and abiding." 
2. "The word of God is not the begetting principle itself, but only that by which the principle works: as it were the coccus or grain which is the involucrum and vehicle of the mysterious germinating power." 
3. "The word itself is no mere perishing vehicle; no mere sacramental symbol, lost in the using: but it lives by and with the divine principle of life which it conveys and expands, and abides forever."

## Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Christian brotherhood flows from our new birth of an imperishable seed, the abiding word of God."
2. "As natural relationship gives rise to natural affection, so spiritual relationship gives rise to spiritual, and therefore abiding love."
3. "We are born again of the Spirit, yet not without the use of means, but by the word of God."

## Albert Barnes:
1. "Not of corruptible seed - 'Not by virtue of any descent from human parents' - Doddridge."
2. "The result of such a birth, or of being begotten in this way - for so the word rendered 'born again' more properly signifies - is only corruption and decay."
3. "By truth, communicating a living principle to the soul which can never decay."

These quotes highlight the contrast between being born again through divine truth and being born of corruptible seed. They emphasize that the new birth through God's word brings a living principle to the soul that is everlasting and free from decay.

## Marvin Vincent:
1. "Being born again...having been begotten again." 
2. "The former denoting the origin or source of life, the latter the medium through which it imparts itself to the nature." 
3. "The connection and relation of the personal with the revealed word is distinctly recognized."

## John Calvin:
1. "The Gospel is not preached, that it may be only heard by us, but that it may, as a seed of immortal life, altogether reform our hearts."
2. "The faithful might know that they ought to renounce their former nature, and that it might be more evident how much is the difference between the children of Adam who are born only into the world, and the children of God who are renewed into a heavenly life."
3. "The word is set forth as the means or instrument by which this seed is implanted."

## Philip Schaff:
1. "The tense denotes a subsisting state due to an act in the past, and, therefore, here a new life in which they stand in virtue of a decisive change equivalent to a new birth."
2. "The former originates in what is incorruptible, and therefore is itself unsusceptible of failure or decadence."
3. "The Logos or ‘Word’ by which God begets us is neither the Personal Word, Christ, by whom God has spoken finally, nor the written Word, the ‘Scripture,’ with which Paul opens his quotations, but, as in Hebrews 4:12, Revelation, or the declared will of God, and here that will as declared specially in the Gospel."

## Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Having been begotten again" - This phrase emphasizes the transformative nature of being born again in Christ, highlighting the spiritual rebirth experienced by believers.

2. "Not of corruptible seed" - This phrase underscores the contrast between the perishable nature of earthly things and the imperishable nature of the spiritual seed from which believers are born again.

3. "Through the word of God" - This phrase emphasizes the role of the gospel message as the means through which believers are born again, highlighting the power and authority of God's word in bringing about spiritual transformation.

## Adam Clarke:
1. "Being born again — For being born of Abraham's seed will not avail to the entering of the kingdom of heaven."
2. "Not of corruptible seed — By no human generation, or earthly means; but of incorruptible - a Divine and heavenly principle which is not liable to decay, nor to be affected by the changes and chances to which all sublunary things are exposed."
3. "By the word of God — Δια λογου ζωντος Θεου· By the doctrine of the living God, which remaineth for ever; which doctrine shall never change, any more than the source shall whence it proceeds."
