# choicest prompt v1 X bht prompt v3; ['Henry Alford', 'Jamieson Fausset Brown', 'Albert Barnes', 'Marvin Vincent', 'John Calvin', 'Philip Schaff', 'Archibald T Robertson', 'Adam Clarke']

## Henry Alford:
1. "Scripture proof that the word of God lives and abides."
2. "The grass was dried up and the flower fell away."
3. "Quicquid ex carne veluti flos ex gramine suo efflorescit." (Translation: "Whatever blossoms from the flesh, like a flower from grass.")

## Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "If ye were born again of flesh, corruptible seed, ye must also perish again as the grass; but now that from which you have derived life remains eternally, and so also will render you eternal."
2. "The glory is the wisdom, strength, riches, learning, honor, beauty, art, virtue, and righteousness of the NATURAL man, which all are transitory."
3. "The grass is the flesh: 'the flower' its glory."

## Albert Barnes:
1. "All flesh, every human being, is like grass. There is no stability in anything that man does or produces. He himself resembles grass that soon fades and withers; but God and his word endure forever the same."
2. "The comparison of a human being with grass, or with flowers, is very beautiful, and is quite common in the Scriptures. The comparison turns on the fact, that the grass or the flower, however green or beautiful it may be, soon loses its freshness; is withered; is cut down, and dies."
3. "All that man prides himself on - his wealth, rank, talents, beauty, learning, splendor of equipage or apparel."

## Marvin Vincent:
1. "The best texts read 'of it' or 'thereof', emphasizing the transient nature of man and his accomplishments." 
2. "The use of the aorist tense in 'withered was the grass' creates a sense of sudden and dramatic decay." 
3. "The word 'fell off' in 'the flower fell off' conveys the idea of something being detached or separated, highlighting the fragility of human life."

## John Calvin:
1. "For as the Prophet there speaks of the restoration of the Church, to prepare the way for it, he reduces men to nothing lest they should flatter themselves."
2. "In short, such is the meaning of the Prophet: as exile was to the Jews like death, he promised them a new consolation, even that God would send prophets with a command of this kind."
3. "He afterwards shews how suddenly everything that seems beautiful in men vanishes, even through the blowing of the Spirit of God; and by this he intimates, that man seems to be something until he comes to God, but that his whole brightness is as nothing in his presence."

## Philip Schaff:
1. "The phrase ‘all flesh’ embraces man and all that is of man as he is by nature."
2. "The ‘glory’ of the flesh, by which is meant its goodliest outcome, ‘the most splendid manifestations of man’s life,’ is compared to the still more tender bloom that brightens on the flower only to fall off."
3. "Peter does not bring in this passage as a formal quotation sustaining his statement by an appeal to Scripture, but simply expresses in Old Testament words which come easily to his lips a reason for the incorruptibility which he attributes to the new life."

## Adam Clarke:
1. "For all flesh is as grass" - This phrase emphasizes the temporary nature of human existence, comparing it to the fleeting lifespan of grass. It reminds us that our earthly existence is limited and should be cherished and used wisely.

2. "Earthly seeds, earthly productions, and earthly generations, shall fail and perish" - This highlights the impermanence of worldly things. It serves as a reminder that material possessions and achievements will eventually fade away, urging us to focus on eternal values and spiritual growth.

3. "The grass withereth, and the flower falleth off" - This imagery symbolizes the transitory nature of life. Just as grass withers and flowers fade, our lives too will come to an end. It encourages us to reflect on the brevity of life and prioritize what truly matters in the grand scheme of things.


# BHT:
All flesh, like grass, is transient and subject to decay. The glory and achievements of the natural man are fleeting and will eventually perish. The fragility of human life is compared to the withering of grass and the falling off of flowers. These verses remind us of the temporary nature of our earthly existence and encourage us to focus on what truly matters, prioritizing spiritual growth and cherishing the time we have.
