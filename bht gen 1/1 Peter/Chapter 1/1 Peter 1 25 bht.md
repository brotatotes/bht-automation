# choicest prompt v1 X bht prompt v3; ['Henry Alford', 'Jamieson Fausset Brown', 'Albert Barnes', 'Marvin Vincent', 'John Calvin', 'Philip Schaff', 'Archibald T Robertson', 'Adam Clarke']

## Henry Alford:
1. "ῥῆμα is rather the word uttered, the ‘dictum:’ λόγος, the word, uttered or unuttered, single or manifold, concrete or abstract."
2. "And this is the word which was preached to you."
3. "The word preached to you is imperishable and eternal, and demands of you that you earnestly and intently follow up that new life which by it has been implanted in you."

## Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "That is eternal which is born of incorruptible seed." 
2. "Ye have received the incorruptible seed, the word." 
3. "Ye are born for eternity, and so are bound now to live for eternity."

## Albert Barnes:
1. "Amidst all the revolutions on earth, the fading glories of natural objects, and the wasting strength of man, his truth remains unaffected."
2. "The gospel system is as lovely now as it was when it was first revealed to man, and it has as much power to save as it had when first applied to a human heart."
3. "The beauty of religion is the only permanent beauty in the earth; and he that has that need not regret that that which in this mortal frame charms the eye shall fade away like the flower of the field."

## Marvin Vincent:
1. "The substitution indicates that Peter identifies Jesus with God."

2. "No very satisfactory reason can be given for the change from logov to rJhma."

3. "It may be due to the Greek translation, which Peter follows."

## John Calvin:
1. "For this was what the Prophet had in view, that there is no permanent life but in God, and that this is communicated to us by the word."
2. "We ought the more carefully to notice this, because impious and Luciferian men, craftily allowing to God’s word its own honor, at the same time attempt to draw us away from the Scriptures."
3. "Then, when Peter says, Which has been announced, or declared, to you, he intimates that the word is not to be sought elsewhere than in the Gospel preached to us."

## Adam Clarke:
1. "The word of the Lord...endureth for ever, having...the same excellence and the same efficacy." 
2. "The Gospel...shall be preached while the world standeth."
3. "All human schemes of salvation...shall come to naught; and the doctrine of Christ crucified...shall be alone the power of God for salvation to every soul that believeth."


# BHT:
The Scriptures speak of the eternal and unchanging nature of God's Word, which is both preached and implanted in believers' hearts. It is a powerful and imperishable seed, offering salvation to every soul. The beauty of religion lies in its permanence amidst the fleeting nature of the world. The substitution of words in the verse indicates Peter's identification of Jesus with God, emphasizing the importance of adhering to the Scriptures. As impious men attempt to draw us away, we are reminded to hold fast to the Gospel, for it endures forever and carries the power of God for salvation.
