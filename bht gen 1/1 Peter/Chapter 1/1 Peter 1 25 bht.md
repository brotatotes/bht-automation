# 1 Peter 1:25 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The spoken word, the "ῥῆμα," is transformed into the preached word, the "λόγος," emanating from an eternal and incorruptible source. Embracing this imperishable and everlasting message, we find the beauty of religion, the only permanent beauty, surpassing the transient allure of earthly things. Through the Gospel, the word of the Lord endures, settling in our hearts and offering an unchanging foundation amidst the fluctuations of the world. Let us, therefore, hold fast to the preached word, for it is through the Gospel that we receive the eternal truth and the power to save.
