# choicest prompt v1 X bht prompt v3; ['Henry Alford', 'Jamieson Fausset Brown', 'Albert Barnes', 'Marvin Vincent', 'John Calvin', 'Philip Schaff', 'Archibald T Robertson', 'Adam Clarke']

## Henry Alford:
1. "εὐλογητός carries with it rather the imperative, ‘Blessed be’ &c., εὐλογημένος the indicative, ‘Blessed is’ &c."
2. "This hope of the Christian 'has life in itself, gives life, and looks for life as its object.'"
3. "The resurrection of Christ, bringing in life and the gift or the life-giving Spirit, is that which potentiates the new birth unto a living hope."

## Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Blessed—A distinct Greek word (eulogetos, 'Blessed BE') is used of God, from that used of man (eulogemenos, 'Blessed IS')."
2. "That God's 'mercy' should reach us, guilty and enemies, proves its fulness. 'Mercy' met our misery; 'grace,' our guilt."
3. "Faith, the subjective means of the spiritual resurrection of the soul, is wrought by the same power whereby Christ was raised from the dead."

## Albert Barnes:
1. "There was great mercy shown them in the fact that they were renewed. They had no claim to the favor, and the favor was great." 
2. "The meaning is, that as God is the Author of our life in a natural sense, so he is the Author of our second life by regeneration." 
3. "The hope which they had, had living power. It was not cold, inoperative, dead. It was that which was vital to their welfare, and which was active and powerful."

## Marvin Vincent:
1. "Blessed [ευλογητος] . eu, well, logov, a word. Well - spoken - of; praised; honored. Used in the New Testament of God only." 
2. "Hath begotten us again [αναγεννησας ημας] . The verb is used by Peter only, and by him only here and ver. 23. It is in the aorist tense, and should be rendered, as Rev., begat; because regeneration is regarded as a definite historical act accomplished once for all."
3. "Lively [ζωσαν] . Better, as Rev., literally rendering the participle, living : a favorite word with Peter."

## John Calvin:
1. "For this end, the knowledge of God’s benefits avails much; for, when their value appears to us, all other things will be deemed worthless, especially when we consider what Christ and his blessings are; for everything without him is but dross."
2. "Whosoever, then, seeks really to know the only true God, must regard him as the Father of Christ; for, whenever our mind seeks God, except Christ be thought of, it will wander and be confused, until it be wholly lost."
3. "He shews that God was induced by no merits of ours to regenerate us unto a living hope, because he assigns this wholly to his mercy. But that he might more completely reduce the merits of works to nothing, he says, great (multam) mercy."

## Philip Schaff:
1. "The gifts of God’s grace to the believer, and the believer’s relation to God, depend upon the prior relation between God and Christ."
2. "The particular grace for the bestowal of which God receives this ascription is hope."
3. "The hope which originated thus in God’s act is living."

## Archibald T Robertson:
1. "The verbal adjective (from ευλογεω) occurs in the N.T. only of God, as in the LXX (Luke 1:68)." 
2. "This precise language in 2 Corinthians 1:3; 2 Corinthians 1:3; and part of it in 2 Corinthians 11:31; Romans 15:6."
3. "The Stoics used αναγεννησις for παλινγενεσια (Titus 3:5). If ανωθεν in John 3:3 be taken to mean 'again,' the same idea of regeneration is there, and if 'from above' it is the new birth, anyhow."
4. "The Pharisees cherished the hope of the resurrection (Acts 23:6), but the resurrection of Jesus gave it proof and permanence (1 Corinthians 15:14; 1 Corinthians 15:17)."
5. "It is no longer a dead hope like dead faith (James 2:17; James 2:26). This revival of hope was wrought 'by the resurrection of Jesus Christ' (δια αναστασεως)."

## Adam Clarke:
1. "Let that God have praise who is the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, and who deserves the praise of every human being for his infinite mercy to the world, in its redemption by Christ Jesus." 
2. "The hope, that with them, died with their Master, and seemed to be buried in his grave, was restored by the certainty of his resurrection."
3. "It is the Gospel alone that gives the well grounded hope of eternal life; and the ground on which this hope rests is the resurrection of Christ himself."


# BHT:
In this verse, the blessings of God are extolled as He is praised and honored for His infinite mercy in the redemption of the world through Jesus Christ. Through the resurrection of Christ, believers are begotten again, or regenerated, into a living hope. This hope is not a mere intellectual belief, but a hope that has life and power, grounded on the certainty and significance of Christ's resurrection. It is through this hope, given by God's mercy and grace, that believers can experience a new birth and a renewed sense of purpose and assurance in their faith.
