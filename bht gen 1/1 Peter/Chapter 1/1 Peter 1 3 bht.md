# 1 Peter 1:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This verse describes the blessing and praise given to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. It speaks of being begotten again, born anew, and regenerated by God. The hope that is given is a living hope, filled with true spiritual life. It is all made possible through the resurrection of Christ, which is not only a symbol of hope but also a means of spiritual revival and eternal life.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "εὐλογητός carries with it rather the imperative, ‘Blessed be’ &c., εὐλογημένος the indicative, ‘Blessed is’ &c."
2. "This hope of the Christian 'has life in itself, gives life, and looks for life as its object.'"
3. "The resurrection of Christ, bringing in life and the gift or the life-giving Spirit, is that which potentiates the new birth unto a living hope."

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Blessed—A distinct Greek word (eulogetos, 'Blessed BE') is used of God, from that used of man (eulogemenos, 'Blessed IS')."
2. "That God's 'mercy' should reach us, guilty and enemies, proves its fulness. 'Mercy' met our misery; 'grace,' our guilt."
3. "Faith, the subjective means of the spiritual resurrection of the soul, is wrought by the same power whereby Christ was raised from the dead."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "There was great mercy shown them in the fact that they were renewed. They had no claim to the favor, and the favor was great." 
2. "The meaning is, that as God is the Author of our life in a natural sense, so he is the Author of our second life by regeneration." 
3. "The hope which they had, had living power. It was not cold, inoperative, dead. It was not a mere form - or a mere speculation - or a mere sentiment; it was that which was vital to their welfare, and which was active and powerful."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Blessed [ευλογητος] . eu, well, logov, a word. Well - spoken - of; praised; honored. Used in the New Testament of God only." 
2. "Hath begotten us again [αναγεννησας ημας] . The verb is used by Peter only, and by him only here and ver. 23. It is in the aorist tense, and should be rendered, as Rev., begat; because regeneration is regarded as a definite historical act accomplished once for all."
3. "Lively [ζωσαν] . Better, as Rev., literally rendering the participle, living : a favorite word with Peter."

### John Calvin:
1. "For this end, the knowledge of God’s benefits avails much; for, when their value appears to us, all other things will be deemed worthless, especially when we consider what Christ and his blessings are; for everything without him is but dross."
2. "Whosoever, then, seeks really to know the only true God, must regard him as the Father of Christ; for, whenever our mind seeks God, except Christ be thought of, it will wander and be confused, until it be wholly lost."
3. "He shews that God was induced by no merits of ours to regenerate us unto a living hope, because he assigns this wholly to his mercy. But that he might more completely reduce the merits of works to nothing, he says, great (multam) mercy."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The gifts of God’s grace to the believer, and the believer’s relation to God, depend upon the prior relation between God and Christ."
2. "The particular grace for the bestowal of which God receives this ascription is hope."
3. "The hope which originated thus in God’s act is living."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Blessed be" - The verbal adjective (from ευλογεω) occurs in the N.T. only of God, as in the LXX (Luke 1:68).
2. "The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ" - This precise language is used in 2 Corinthians 1:3 and Romans 15:6.
3. "Begat us again" - First aorist active articular (ο, who) participle of αναγενναω, rare word to beget again, in N.T. only here and 1 Peter 1:23.

### John Gill:
1. "To be 'begotten again', and so to be born again, is opposed unto, and distinguished from our first birth, when we were conceived, and shapen in sin; and designs a birth, spiritual, holy, and heavenly."
2. "God, and not man, is the efficient cause of this, which is sometimes ascribed to the Spirit, and sometimes to the Son, and here to the Father."
3. "Christ's resurrection is the virtual cause of regeneration, or regeneration is in virtue of Christ's resurrection; had he not risen from the dead, none would have been quickened, or made to live, or have been raised to newness of life."

### John Wesley:
1. "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ — His Father, with respect to his divine nature; his God, with respect to his human." 

2. "Who hath regenerated us to a living hope — An hope which implies true spiritual life, which revives the heart, and makes the soul lively and vigorous." 

3. "By the resurrection of Christ — Which is not only a pledge of ours, but a part of the purchase-price. It has also a close connexion with our rising from spiritual death, that as he liveth, so shall we live with him."
