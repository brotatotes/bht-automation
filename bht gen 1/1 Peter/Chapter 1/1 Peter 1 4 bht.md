# 1 Peter 1:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, the commentators describe a glorious inheritance for the believers. They explain that this inheritance is a vast blessing that Christians eagerly anticipate, filled with blessings beyond imagination. It is a heavenly gift, reserved and preserved beyond any harm or corruption. They emphasize that this inheritance is incorruptible, pure and undefiled, and it never fades in value or beauty. It is a secure and everlasting possession, a promise from God Himself for His beloved children.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "By κληρονομία is imported the whole fulness of blessings not seen, of which the Christian has expectation." 
2. "This inheritance is more closely defined as σωτηρία, χάρις ζωῆς, δόξα, or ἡ αἰώνιος τοῦ θεοῦ δόξα."
3. "Our inheritance is glorious in these three respects: it is in substance, incorruptible; in purity, undefiled; in beauty, unfading."

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "The inheritance is the believer's already by title, being actually assigned to him; the entrance on its possession is future, and hoped for as a certainty."
2. "Negations of the imperfections which meet us on every side here are the chief means of conveying to our minds a conception of the heavenly things which 'have not entered into the heart of man,' and which we have not faculties now capable of fully knowing."
3. "Even the most delicate part of the heavenly inheritance, its bloom, continues unfading. 'In substance incorruptible; in purity undefiled; in beauty unfading.'"

Note: The provided commentary is quite lengthy and contains multiple quotes that are not directly related to the Bible verse. I have selected the three quotes that I believe best enrich the understanding of the verse.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Christians are regarded as the adopted children of God, and heaven is spoken of as their inheritance - as what their Father will bestow on them as the proof of his love."
2. "The inheritance will be imperishable, or will endure forever."
3. "The future inheritance of the saints is stained by none of these vices; it is neither got nor detained by any of these methods; nor shall persons polluted with vice have any share in it."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "An inheritance is originally a portion which one receives by lot in a general distribution." 
2. "The loveliness of the heavenly inheritance is described as exempt from the blight which attaches to earthly bloom."
3. "The verb signifies keeping as the result of guarding. Thus in John 17:11, Christ says, 'keep [τηρσον] those whom thou hast given me;' in ver. 12, 'I kept them' [ετηρουν]; i.e., preserved by guarding them."

### John Calvin:
1. "The inheritance is said to be reserved, or preserved, that we may know that it is beyond the reach of danger."
2. "That he might then free us from every fear, he testifies that our salvation is placed in safety beyond the harms which Satan can do."
3. "But as the certainty of salvation can bring us but little comfort, except each one knows that it belongs to himself, Peter adds, for you."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "When we are begotten, that is to say, into the hope, we are begotten into the inheritance. To have the one is to have the other. So perfect is God’s act, so secure against failure the hope which comes by that act." 
2. "The inheritance he describes first negatively and, as suits his character and style, by a number of adjectives, as incorruptible, subject to no dissolution or decay, undefiled, neither tainted nor tarnished, and unfading or unwithering."
3. "The inheritance is further described positively as reserved in heaven for you. It is thereby made doubly safe, ‘laid up and kept,’ and that ‘among God’s own treasures, under His own eye, and within the shelter of His omnipotence’."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Unto an inheritance... a picture of the blessedness in store for us pilgrims." 
2. "Incorruptible... imperishable. So many inheritances vanish away before they are obtained."
3. "That fadeth not away... These inscriptions will fade away, but not this inheritance in Christ."

Note: The commentary does not provide any additional quotes that meet the requirements.

### John Gill:
1. "It is an 'inheritance'; a large estate, and rich possession, they are born heirs apparent to; what is not to be got by industry, or obtained by the works of the law."
2. "It is in its own nature pure and holy, and free from any defilement of sin; nor are there any of those impurities in it which Jews and Mahometans dream of in their vainly expected earthly paradise."
3. "This serves both to commend the inheritance, to set forth the excellency of it, lying in such a place as heaven; for the situation of an inheritance adds oftentimes to the valuableness of it; and also the safety and security of it; it is safe, being in heaven, and more so as it is in Christ's hands there."

### John Wesley:
1. "Incorruptible — Not like earthly treasures."
2. "Undefiled — Pure and holy, incapable of being itself defiled, or of being enjoyed by any polluted soul."
3. "And that fadeth not away — That never decays in its value, sweetness, or beauty, like all the enjoyments of this world."
