# choicest prompt v1 X bht prompt v3; ['Henry Alford', 'Jamieson Fausset Brown', 'Albert Barnes', 'Marvin Vincent', 'John Calvin', 'Philip Schaff', 'Archibald T Robertson', 'Adam Clarke']

## Henry Alford:
1. "By κληρονομία is imported the whole fulness of blessings not seen, of which the Christian has expectation." 
2. "This inheritance is more closely defined as σωτηρία, χάρις ζωῆς, δόξα, or ἡ αἰώνιος τοῦ θεοῦ δόξα."
3. "Our inheritance is glorious in these three respects: it is in substance, incorruptible; in purity, undefiled; in beauty, unfading."

## Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "The inheritance is the believer's already by title, being actually assigned to him; the entrance on its possession is future, and hoped for as a certainty." 
2. "Negations of the imperfections which meet us on every side here are the chief means of conveying to our minds a conception of the heavenly things which 'have not entered into the heart of man,' and which we have not faculties now capable of fully knowing." 
3. "The rich man is either a dishonest man himself, or the heir of a dishonest man." 
4. "The inheritance is in security, beyond risk, out of the reach of Satan, though we for whom it is reserved are still in the midst of dangers."

## Albert Barnes:
1. "Through the resurrection of the Lord Jesus we now cherish the hope of that future inheritance in heaven."
2. "The inheritance will be imperishable, or will endure forever."
3. "The future inheritance of the saints is stained by none of these vices; it is neither got nor detained by any of these methods; nor shall persons polluted with vice have any share in it."

## Marvin Vincent:
1. "An inheritance is originally a portion which one receives by lot in a general distribution. In the New Testament, the idea of chance attaching to the lot is eliminated. It is the portion or heritage which one receives by virtue of birth or by special gift." 

2. "The loveliness of the heavenly inheritance is described as exempt from the blight which attaches to earthly bloom. As between incorruptible and unwithering, the former emphasizes the indestructibility of substance, and the latter of grace and beauty."

3. "The verb signifies keeping as the result of guarding. Thus in John 17:11, Christ says, 'keep those whom thou hast given me;' in ver. 12, 'I kept them;' i.e., preserved by guarding them."

## John Calvin:
1. "The inheritance is said to be reserved, or preserved, that we may know that it is beyond the reach of danger."
2. "He testifies that our salvation is placed in safety beyond the harms which Satan can do."
3. "For consciences will calmly recumb here, that is, when the Lord cries to them from heaven, 'Behold, your salvation is in my hand and is kept for you.'"
4. "For, as faith penetrates into the heavens, so also it appropriates to us the blessings which are in heaven."

## Philip Schaff:
1. "When we are begotten, that is to say, into the hope, we are begotten into the inheritance. To have the one is to have the other. So perfect is God’s act, so secure against failure the hope which comes by that act." 
2. "The inheritance he describes first negatively and, as suits his character and style, by a number of adjectives, as incorruptible, subject to no dissolution or decay, undefiled, neither tainted nor tarnished, and unfading or unwithering." 
3. "The inheritance is further described positively as reserved in heaven (or, in the heavens) for you. It is thereby made doubly safe, ‘laid up and kept,’ and that ‘among God’s own treasures, under His own eye, and within the shelter of His omnipotence’."

## Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Unto an inheritance... a picture of the blessedness in store for us pilgrims." 
2. "Incorruptible... imperishable. So many inheritances vanish away before they are obtained."
3. "That fadeth not away... It will not be like a faded rose."

## Adam Clarke:
1. "Eternal life cannot be a gift to any but these; for, even in heaven, the lot is dealt out according to law: if children, then heirs; if not children, then not heirs."
2. "Incorruptible - It has no principles of dissolution or decay in it; and, therefore, must be totally different from this earth."
3. "Fadeth not away - It cannot wither, it is always in bloom; a metaphor taken from those flowers that never lose their hue nor their fragrance."


# BHT:
The Bible verse describes an extraordinary inheritance that believers have in store for them. This inheritance is described as a "fulness of blessings not seen" and includes salvation, grace, eternal glory, and the glory of God. It is depicted as incorruptible, undefiled, and unfading, surpassing any earthly inheritance. This heavenly inheritance is reserved and preserved in the heavens, beyond the reach of danger or harm, under the watchful keeping of God. It is a picture of blessedness, eternal life, and beauty that will never fade away.
