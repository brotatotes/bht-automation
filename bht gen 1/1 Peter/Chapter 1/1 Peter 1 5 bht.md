## Henry Alford:
1. "Our faith lays hold upon this power, and this power strengthens faith, and so we are preserved."
2. "The stress of the ἑτοίμην ἀποκαλυφθῆναι is... the fact of the salvation being ready to be revealed: not yet to be brought in and accomplished, but already complete, and only waiting God’s time to be manifested."
3. "In the last time."

## Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "We are guarded in the world as our inheritance is kept in heaven." 
2. "God Himself is our sole guarding power. It is His power which saves us from our enemies. It is His long-suffering which saves us from ourselves." 
3. "The believer lives spiritually in God, and in virtue of His power, and God lives in him."

## Albert Barnes:
1. "The only reason which any Christians have to suppose they will ever reach heaven, is the fact that God keeps them by his own power."
2. "He does not keep us by the mere exertion of power, but he excites faith in our hearts, and makes that the means of keeping us."
3. "They are 'kept by the power of God to salvation;' and as God has all power, and guards them with reference to this end, it cannot be but that they will be saved."

## Marvin Vincent:
1. "The present participle indicates something in progress, a continuous process of protection. Hence, lit., who are being guarded."
2. "By, indicating the efficient cause; through, the secondary agency; unto, the result."
3. "Ready [ετοιμην] . Stronger than about to be, or destined to be, implying a state of waiting or preparedness, and thus harmonizing with reserved."

## John Calvin:
1. "Though we are in the world exposed to dangers, we are yet kept by faith; and though we are thus nigh to death, we are yet safe under the guardianship of faith."
2. "How weak soever we may then be, yet our salvation is not uncertain, because it is sustained by God’s power."
3. "Salvation is not deferred because it is not yet prepared, but because the time of its revelation is not yet come."

## Philip Schaff:

2. "The inheritance is kept; the heirs are guarded." - God's love acts as a garrison, protecting and safeguarding believers.
3. "Deliverance is the goal of the process and final salvation." - The ultimate aim of faith is to attain salvation and be delivered from sin and its consequences.

## Adam Clarke:
1. "Who are defended as in a fortress or castle."
2. "The true disciples of Christ are under the continual watchful care of God, and the inheritance is guarded for them."
3. "By the mighty and miracle-working power of God; for nothing less is necessary to keep and preserve, in this state of continual trial, a soul from the contagion that is in the world."


# BHT:
The Bible verse describes the powerful protection and guardianship that believers have through their faith. They are kept by God's own power, with their salvation ready to be revealed at the appointed time. This power of God is continuous and in progress, sustaining and guarding believers even in the midst of earthly dangers. Their inheritance in heaven is reserved and preserved, just as they are guarded by God Himself. Ultimately, the goal of this divine protection is to bring about deliverance and final salvation for the faithful.
