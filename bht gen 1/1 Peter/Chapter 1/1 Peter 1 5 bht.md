# 1 Peter 1:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Believers are continuously guarded and protected by the unmatched power of God. This divine power sustains their faith and ensures their safekeeping, as they live in the world but are kept by God's power. Their ultimate salvation is not uncertain, as it is upheld by the stability of God's power. While the manifestation of salvation awaits the last day, believers are already prepared and ready for the revelation of God's plan.
