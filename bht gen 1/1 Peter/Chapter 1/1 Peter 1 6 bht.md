# choicest prompt v1 X bht prompt v3; ['Henry Alford', 'Jamieson Fausset Brown', 'Albert Barnes', 'Marvin Vincent', 'John Calvin', 'Philip Schaff', 'Archibald T Robertson', 'Adam Clarke']

## Henry Alford:
1. "The present ἀγαλλιᾶσθε in both places must be a categorical present, used of a future time."
2. "The quasi-future sense of ἀγαλλιᾶσθε in both places."
3. "Looking back from the time of which exultation, the grief is regarded as passed away and gone."

## Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Salvation is realized by faith as a thing so actually present as to cause exulting joy in spite of existing afflictions."
2. "Not every believer, nor every sinner, is tried with afflictions."
3. "The realized joy of the coming salvation makes the present grief seem as a thing of the past."

## Albert Barnes:
1. "The prospect which they had of the future inheritance was to them a source of the highest joy, even in the midst of their many sufferings and trials."
2. "That must be a valuable religion which will make people happy in the midst of persecutions and heavy calamities."
3. "There was some good to be accomplished by them, which made it desirable and proper that they should be thus afflicted."

## Marvin Vincent:
1. "The word is always employed in the New Testament for great or lively joy." 
2. "The word gives a vivid picture of the diversity of the trials, emphasizing this idea rather than that of their number, which is left to be inferred." 
3. "It embraces all that goes to furnish a test of character."

## John Calvin:
1. "But the faithful know by experience, how these things can exist together, much better than can be expressed in words."
2. "Thus sorrow does not prevent their joy, but, on the contrary, give place to it."
3. "For all who raise hither their minds, find it an easy thing calmly to bear all evils."

These quotes highlight the idea that believers can experience both joy and sorrow simultaneously, and that their faith allows them to find joy even in the midst of trials and hardships. It emphasizes the importance of focusing on spiritual blessings and having a perspective that enables believers to endure and overcome difficulties.

## Philip Schaff:
1. "In all which blessings into which God begat you, ye rejoice."
2. "The 'temptations' will refer here, whatever else may be included, to the threatenings and slanders which these Christians had to endure from heathen neighbors."
3. "The terror of the fact is at once relieved by a double qualification, first by the words which limit these temptations to the present, and exhibit them as enduring only for a little space; and then by the clause 'if need be,' or 'if it must be so.'"

## Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Either makes sense, though possibly καιρω is correct." 
2. "Present middle indicative (rather than imperative) of αγαλλιαομα, late verb from αγαλλομα, to rejoice, only in LXX, N.T., and ecclesiastical literature as in Matthew 5:12."
3. "Accusative case of time (ολιγον) probably as in Mark 6:31, though it can be used of space (to a small extent) as in Luke 5:3."

## Adam Clarke:
1. "It was in the present salvation of God that they rejoiced or gloried, though not without having an eye to the great recompense of reward."
2. "During your pilgrimage here below, which is but a point when compared with eternity."
3. "If your situation and circumstances be such that you are exposed to trials and persecutions which you cannot avoid, unless God were to work a miracle for your deliverance, which would not be for your ultimate good, as he purposes to turn all your trials and difficulties to your advantage."


# BHT:
