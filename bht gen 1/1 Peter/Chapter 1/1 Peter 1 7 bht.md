# 1 Peter 1:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Faith, more precious than perishable gold, is tested and refined through fiery trials, ultimately leading to praise and honor at the revelation of Jesus Christ. By comparing the testing of faith to the refining process of gold, commentators emphasize the value and importance of having genuine, proven faith. The trials we face in life serve to purify and strengthen our faith, preparing us for the glorious reward bestowed by the righteous Judge.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The proof of your faith, more precious than gold which perisheth, yet is proved by fire." 
2. "Gold though perishable yet needs fire to try it, how much more does your faith, which is being proved for eternity, need a fiery trial?" 
3. "May be found unto praise and glory and honour in the revelation of Jesus Christ."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "That your faith so proved 'may be found unto praise,' c., namely, the praise to be bestowed by the Judge."
2. "If gold, though perishing, is yet tried with fire in order to remove dross and test its genuineness, how much more does your faith, which shall never perish, need to pass through a fiery trial to remove whatever is defective, and to test its genuineness and full value?"
3. "At Christ's revelation shall take place also the revelation of the sons of God."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The testing of [faith], the process of showing whether it was or was not genuine, was a much more important and valuable process than that of testing gold in the fire."
2. "It is more desirable to test religion than it is gold, because it is more valuable. It pertains to that which is eternal and indestructible."
3. "It is desirable that true religion should be separated from all alloy. There is often much alloy in gold, and it is desirable that it should be separated from it, in order that it may be pure."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The expression is equivalent to your approved faith."
2. "The comparison is between the approved faith and the gold; not between the faith and the proof of the gold."
3. "The verb is used in classical Greek of assaying or testing metals, and means, generally, to approve or sanction upon test."

(Note: The quotes have been shortened to fit the word limit, but still convey the main ideas of the commentary.)

### John Calvin:
1. "If gold, a corruptible metal, is deemed of so much value that we prove it by fire, that it may become really valuable, what wonder is it that God should require a similar trial as to faith, since faith is deemed by him so excellent?"
2. "Both modes of trial may very suitably be applied to faith; for when there is much of the dregs of unbelief remaining in us, and when by various afflictions we are refined as it were in Godâ€™s furnace, the dross of our faith is removed, so that it becomes pure and clean before God; and, at the same time, a trial of it is made, as to whether it be true or fictitious."
3. "For our life is now hidden in Christ, and will remain hidden, and as it were buried, until Christ shall appear from heaven; and the whole course of our life leads to the destruction of the external man, and all the things we suffer are, as it were, the preludes of death."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The idea is thus much the same as your proved faith, your faith as attested by probation."
2. "The comparison between the probation of character and the testing of metals, which occurs so often elsewhere, has a limited application here."
3. "The descriptions are cumulative rather than ascensive, word being added to word in order to convey some faint conception of the gracious reward which is to be found at last to have been the end in view."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "The test or touchstone of faith." 
2. "Faith stands the test of fire better than gold, but even gold is refined by fire."
3. "This is the result of the probation by God as the Refiner of hearts."

### John Gill:
1. "The grace of faith is much more precious than gold; since that perisheth by using, but faith does not; and since it is so valuable as not to be obtained by it."
2. "Faith, being tried in the fire of afflictions, is purged from unbelief; and the believer is purged from his dross and tin, and his iniquity is purged, and the fruit of all is to take away sin."
3. "The trying of faith works patience, and that, experience, and that, hope."

These quotes highlight the preciousness of faith, the refining process it undergoes through trials, and the ultimate praise, honor, and glory it will receive at the appearing of Jesus Christ.

### John Wesley:
1. "The trial of your faith, which is much more precious than gold."
2. "May be found unto praise and honour."
3. "Glory assigned by the great Judge."
