# choicest prompt v1 X bht prompt v3; ['Henry Alford', 'Jamieson Fausset Brown', 'Albert Barnes', 'Marvin Vincent', 'John Calvin', 'Philip Schaff', 'Archibald T Robertson', 'Adam Clarke']

## Henry Alford:
1. "The proof of your faith, more precious than gold which perisheth, yet is proved by fire." 
2. "Gold though perishable yet needs fire to try it, how much more does your faith, which is being proved for eternity, need a fiery trial?" 
3. "May be found unto praise and glory and honour in the revelation of Jesus Christ."

## Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "That your faith so proved 'may be found unto praise,' c., namely, the praise to be bestowed by the Judge."
2. "If gold, though perishing, is yet tried with fire in order to remove dross and test its genuineness, how much more does your faith, which shall never perish, need to pass through a fiery trial to remove whatever is defective, and to test its genuineness and full value?"
3. "At Christ's revelation shall take place also the revelation of the sons of God."

## Albert Barnes:
1. "The testing of [faith], the process of showing whether it was or was not genuine, was a much more important and valuable process than that of testing gold in the fire."
2. "Gold, however valuable it is, is a perishable thing. It is not an enduring, imperishable, indestructible thing, like religion."
3. "It is desirable that true religion should be separated from all alloy. There is often much alloy in gold, and it is desirable that it should be separated from it, in order that it may be pure."

## Marvin Vincent:
1. "The expression is equivalent to your approved faith."
2. "The comparison is between the approved faith and the gold; not between the faith and the proof of the gold."
3. "The verb is used in classical Greek of assaying or testing metals, and means, generally, to approve or sanction upon test."

## John Calvin:
1. "If gold, a corruptible metal, is deemed of so much value that we prove it by fire, that it may become really valuable, what wonder is it that God should require a similar trial as to faith, since faith is deemed by him so excellent?"
2. "Both modes of trial may very suitably be applied to faith; for when there is much of the dregs of unbelief remaining in us, and when by various afflictions we are refined as it were in Godâ€™s furnace, the dross of our faith is removed, so that it becomes pure and clean before God; and, at the same time, a trial of it is made, as to whether it be true or fictitious."
3. "For our life is now hidden in Christ, and will remain hidden, and as it were buried, until Christ shall appear from heaven; and the whole course of our life leads to the destruction of the external man, and all the things we suffer are, as it were, the preludes of death."

## Philip Schaff:
1. "The approvedness of your faith...your faith as attested by probation." 
2. "If the former [gold] is proved by fire, although itself and the benefits of the process pass speedily away according to their kind, the latter [faith], which, as tested, is seen to be a possession superior to the risks of decay and loss, and more precious than the most valued treasure, may well be subjected to similar action." 
3. "The descriptions [praise, honor, glory] are cumulative rather than ascensive, word being added to word in order to convey some faint conception of the gracious reward which is to be found at last to have been the end in view."

## Archibald T Robertson:
1. "The test or touchstone of faith." 
2. "Faith stands the test of fire better than gold, but even gold is refined by fire." 
3. "This is the result of the probation by God as the Refiner of hearts."

## Adam Clarke:
1. "As by the action of fire gold is separated from all alloy and heterogeneous mixtures, and is proved to be gold by its enduring the action of the fire without losing anything of its nature, weight, colour, or any other property, so genuine faith is proved by adversities."
2. "He then who preferred Christianity to his life gave full proof, not only of his own sincerity, but also of the excellency of the principle by which he was influenced; as his religion put him in possession of greater blessings, and more solid comforts, than anything the earth could afford."
3. "The earth, and universal nature, shall be dissolved; but he who doeth the will of God shall abide forever, and his faith shall then be found to the praise of God's grace, the honour of Christ, and the glory or glorification of his own soul throughout eternity."


# BHT:
Faith, like gold tested by fire, is a valuable and enduring quality that surpasses earthly possessions. Just as gold is refined and purified through the fire, genuine faith is proven and approved through trials and challenges. It is through these difficulties that faith is separated from impurities and shown to be true and steadfast. In the end, this tested faith brings praise, glory, and honor in the revelation of Jesus Christ, leading to eternal rewards and the glorification of the believer's soul.
