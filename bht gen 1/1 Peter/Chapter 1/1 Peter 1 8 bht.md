# 1 Peter 1:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This verse speaks of the profound joy and unwavering faith experienced by believers in Jesus, even though they have not physically seen him. Their love for him is based on his divine nature and the spiritual connection they share. This love is not self-seeking or self-sufficient, but rather a pure and inexplicable joy that surpasses human understanding. It is a joy that is closely intertwined with their belief in Jesus and his promises, demonstrating that true faith is not reliant on physical proof, but rather a choice to trust in the unseen.

4. "Faith in him is the source and fountain of our joy. It makes invisible things real... the conviction to the mind of a true believer that there is a Saviour, is as certain and as strong as if he saw him."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Full of glory [δεδοξασμενη] . Lit., glorified, as Rev., in margin."
2. "Receiving [κομιζομενοι] . The verb originally means to take care of or provide for; thence to receive hospitably or entertain; to bring home with a view to entertaining or taking care of."
3. "Paul uses it of receiving the awards of judgment (2 Corinthians 5:10; Ephesians 6:8; Colossians 3:25). In Heb. it is used of receiving the promise (Hebrews 10:36; Hebrews 11:39), and of Abraham receiving back Isaac (xi. 19)."

### John Calvin:
1. "The first clause in order is, that faith is not to be measured by sight. For when the life of Christians is apparently miserable, they would instantly fail, were not their happiness dependent on hope."

3. "In Christ believed on, though not seen, they have now a joy deeper than time’s storms can reach. The quality of this joy is expressed both by the repetition of the verb already used to express exultant joy and by the addition of two remarkable adjectives. It means, 'too deep for expression,' and that in the sense of 'not capable of being told adequately out in words,' rather than in the sense of not capable of being fitted to language at all."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Not having seen (ουκ ιδοντες). Second aorist active participle of οραω, to see, with ουκ rather than μη because it negatives an actual experience in contrast with μη ορωντες (though not seeing, hypothetical case)."
2. "It is possible that Peter here has in mind the words of Jesus to Thomas as recorded in John 20:29 ('Happy are those not seeing and yet believing')."
3. "Unspeakable (ανεκλαλητω). Late and rare double compound verbal (alpha privative and εκλαλεω), here only in N.T., in Dioscorides and Heliodorus, 'unutterable,' like Paul's 'indescribable' (ανεκδιηγητος) gift (2 Corinthians 9:15, here alone in N.T.)."

### John Gill:
1. "They loved him because of his excellencies and perfections, because of the loveliness of his person, and because he first loved them."

### John Wesley:
1. "The phrase 'having not seen' emphasizes the faith of those who believe in Jesus without physically seeing him. It highlights the spiritual nature of their belief and the trust they place in the testimony of others."
2. "This verse reminds us that true faith is not dependent on physical evidence or personal experiences. It is a choice to believe in something beyond what our senses can perceive."
3. "By acknowledging the faith of those who have not seen, this verse encourages believers to hold fast to their faith and trust in the unseen, knowing that their belief is not in vain."
