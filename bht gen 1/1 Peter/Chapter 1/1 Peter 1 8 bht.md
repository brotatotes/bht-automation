# choicest prompt v1 X bht prompt v3; ['Henry Alford', 'Jamieson Fausset Brown', 'Albert Barnes', 'Marvin Vincent', 'John Calvin', 'Philip Schaff', 'Archibald T Robertson', 'Adam Clarke']

## Henry Alford:
1. "In whom though now ye see Him not, yet believing ye rejoice with joy unspeakable." 
2. "Joy unspeakable, that which cannot be spoken out."
3. "Joy shall be crowned with glory."

## Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "They are more 'blessed that have not seen and yet have believed,' than they who believed because they have seen."
2. "The Christian's joy is bound up with love to Jesus: its ground is faith; it is not therefore either self-seeking or self-sufficient."
3. "A joy now already encompassed with glory. The 'glory' is partly in present possession, through the presence of Christ, 'the Lord of glory,' in the soul; partly in assured anticipation."

## Albert Barnes:
1. "It is possible to love one whom we have not seen. Thus, we may love God, whom no 'eye hath seen,' and thus we may love a benefactor, from whom we have received important benefits, whom we have never beheld."
2. "That may be a very pure love which we have for one whom we have never seen. It may be based on simple excellence of character; and in such a case there is the least chance for any intermingling of selfishness, or any improper emotion of any kind."
3. "The strongest attachments which have ever existed on earth have been for this unseen Saviour. There has been a love for him stronger than that for a father, or mother, or wife, or sister, or home, or country."

## Marvin Vincent:
1. "Full of glory [δεδοξασμενη] . Lit., glorified, as Rev., in margin."
2. "Receiving [κομιζομενοι] . The verb originally means to take care of or provide for; thence to receive hospitably or entertain; to bring home with a view to entertaining or taking care of."
3. "Paul uses it of receiving the awards of judgment (2 Corinthians 5:10; Ephesians 6:8; Colossians 3:25). In Heb. it is used of receiving the promise (Hebrews 10:36; Hebrews 11:39), and of Abraham receiving back Isaac (xi. 19). Peter uses it thrice, and in each case of receiving the rewards of righteousness or of iniquity."

## John Calvin:
1. "The first clause in order is, that faith is not to be measured by sight. For when the life of Christians is apparently miserable, they would instantly fail, were not their happiness dependent on hope."
2. "The second clause is, that faith is not a cold notion, but that it kindles in our hearts love to Christ."
3. "It is an incomparable benefit, that consciences are not only at peace before God, but confidently exult in the hope of eternal life."

## Philip Schaff:
1. "Faith, indeed, is distinguished from that vision that is in glory; but it is the vision of the kingdom of grace, it is the eye of the new creature, that quick-sighted eye, that pierces all the visible heavens, and sees above them." 
2. "There is an inseparable intermixture of love with belief... If you ask, How shall I do to love? I answer, Believe. If you ask, How shall I believe? I answer, Love." 
3. "In Christ believed on, though not seen, they have now a joy deeper than time’s storms can reach... The joy as one already irradiated with glory, superior to the poverty and ingloriousness of earthly joy, flushed with the colours of the heaven of the future."

## Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Not having seen (ουκ ιδοντες). Second aorist active participle of οραω, to see, with ουκ rather than μη because it negatives an actual experience in contrast with μη ορωντες (though not seeing, hypothetical case)."

2. "It is possible that Peter here has in mind the words of Jesus to Thomas as recorded in John 20:29 ('Happy are those not seeing and yet believing'). Peter was present and heard the words of Jesus to Thomas, and so he could use them before John wrote his Gospel."

3. "Unspeakable (ανεκλαλητω). Late and rare double compound verbal (alpha privative and εκλαλεω), here only in N.T., in Dioscorides and Heliodorus, 'unutterable,' like Paul's 'indescribable' (ανεκδιηγητος) gift (2 Corinthians 9:15, here alone in N.T.)."

## Adam Clarke:
1. "For faith in the Lord Jesus brings him into the heart; and by his indwelling all his virtues are proved, and an excellence discovered beyond even that which his disciples beheld, when conversant with him upon earth."
2. "In short, there is an equality between believers in the present time, and those who lived in the time of the incarnation; for Christ, to a believing soul, is the same to-day that he was yesterday and will be for ever."
3. "Though they did not see him on earth, and men could not see him in glory, yet by that faith which is the evidence of things not seen, and the subsistence of things hoped for, they had the very highest persuasion of their acceptance with God, their relation to him as their Father, and their sonship with Christ Jesus."


# BHT:
Faith in the Lord Jesus brings Him into the heart, revealing virtues beyond what was witnessed during His earthly ministry. Believers today share in an equality with those who lived in His presence, for Christ remains the same. Through faith, though unseen, they possess a profound assurance of their acceptance with God and their intimate connection to the Father and Christ Jesus. This faith is a source of unspeakable joy, intertwining with love and igniting a hope that is already crowned with glory.
