# 1 Peter 1:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse being described is a powerful reminder of the ultimate destiny and purpose of faith. It speaks of receiving the crowning consummation of our faith, the salvation of our souls. This salvation is not only a future hope but something we can experience now, as our souls are already saved through faith. It is a transformative journey, delivering us from sin and leading us into a life of holiness. In this present moment, salvation is not only our qualification for eternal life but also a constant forerunner and pledge of that eternal salvation.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Receiving (the word κομιζόμενοι quite forbids the sense of ‘present realizing:’ in every one of the reff. it betokens the ultimate reception of glory or condemnation from the Lord."
2. "the end of your faith (that, to which your faith ultimately looked forward: see, besides reff. Romans 6:21-22 . Cf. Æschyl. Choeph. 874, μάχης γὰρ δὴ κεκύρωται τέλος)"
3. "salvation of (your) souls (the great inclusive description of future blessedness: the ψυχή being the central personality of the man. See reff.)."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Receiving—in sure anticipation; 'the end of your faith,' that is, its crowning consummation, finally completed 'salvation'...also receiving now the title to it and the first-fruits of it." 
2. "In 1 Peter 1:10 the 'salvation' is represented as already present, whereas 'the prophets' had it not as yet present. It must, therefore, in this verse, refer to the present: Deliverance now from a state of wrath: believers even now 'receive salvation,' though its full 'revelation' is future."
3. "The immortal soul was what was lost, so 'salvation' primarily concerns the soul; the body shall share in redemption hereafter; the soul of the believer is saved already: an additional proof that 'receiving . . . salvation' is here a thing present."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The result or object of your faith; that is, what your faith is designed and adapted to secure."
2. "They even now had such peace and joy in believing, that it furnished undoubted evidence that they would be saved."
3. "The condition of one who is a true Christian here is so secure that it may even now be called salvation."

### John Calvin:
1. "For this world holds all our affections ensnared by its allurements; this life and all things belonging to the body are great impediments, which prevent us from applying our minds to the contemplation of the future and spiritual life."
2. "Hence the Apostle sets before us this future life as a subject of deep meditation, and he indirectly intimates that the loss of all other things is to be deemed as nothing, provided our souls be saved."
3. "We learn from the Apostle’s words, that salvation is not otherwise obtained than by faith; and we know that faith leans on the sole promise of gratuitous adoption; but if it be so, doubtless salvation is not owing to the merits of works, nor can it be hoped for on their account."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Receiving...to get what is promised." 
2. "The conclusion, the culmination of faith."
3. "Final salvation."

### John Gill:
1. "Salvation" intends spiritual and eternal salvation; that which God appointed his people to from all eternity, which is obtained by Christ, applied by the Spirit, and will be fully enjoyed in heaven: this is the salvation "of souls". 

2. It is rightly supplied in our version by "your", as in the Syriac, Arabic, and Ethiopic versions; though the Vulgate Latin version only reads, "the salvation of souls"; and which is to be understood, not to the exclusion of bodies, for God has designed the salvation of them; and Christ has procured the redemption of them; and these will be preserved unto the coming of Christ, being united to him; and will be raised by him, and with their souls enjoy everlasting happiness with him.

3. Faith has its end, and all it looks for, desires, and wants, in salvation by Christ: and which is now "receiving"; for the saints not only shall receive, and enjoy the full possession of it hereafter, but they have it now; it is not only appointed to them, and wrought out for them, but is brought near, set before them, and applied to them, and put into the hands of faith by the Spirit of God.

### John Wesley:
1. "Receiving - Now already." This quote emphasizes the immediacy of receiving salvation. It suggests that salvation is not something to be delayed or put off, but rather something that can be experienced in the present moment.

2. "Salvation - From all sin into all holiness." This quote highlights the transformative nature of salvation. It implies that salvation not only forgives sins but also leads to a life of holiness and righteousness.

3. "The qualification for, the forerunner and pledge of, eternal salvation." This quote suggests that salvation is not just a one-time event but an ongoing process. It implies that salvation is not only a ticket to eternal life but also a qualification, a forerunner, and a pledge of that eternal salvation.
