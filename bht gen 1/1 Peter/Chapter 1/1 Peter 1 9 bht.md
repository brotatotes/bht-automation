# choicest prompt v1 X bht prompt v3; ['Henry Alford', 'Jamieson Fausset Brown', 'Albert Barnes', 'Marvin Vincent', 'John Calvin', 'Philip Schaff', 'Archibald T Robertson', 'Adam Clarke']

## Henry Alford:
1. "Receiving (the word) as you then, in a blessed eternity, will be receiving." 
2. "The end of your faith, that to which your faith ultimately looked forward." 
3. "Salvation of (your) souls, the great inclusive description of future blessedness."

## Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Receiving—in sure anticipation; 'the end of your faith,' that is, its crowning consummation, finally completed 'salvation'...also receiving now the title to it and the first-fruits of it." 
2. "Deliverance now from a state of wrath: believers even now 'receive salvation,' though its full 'revelation' is future." 
3. "The immortal soul was what was lost, so 'salvation' primarily concerns the soul; the body shall share in redemption hereafter; the soul of the believer is saved already: an additional proof that 'receiving . . . salvation' is here a thing present."

## Albert Barnes:
1. "The result or object of your faith; that is, what your faith is designed and adapted to secure."
2. "They even now had such peace and joy in believing, that it furnished undoubted evidence that they would be saved."
3. "The condition of one who is a true Christian here is so secure that it may even now be called salvation."

## John Calvin:
1. "For this world holds all our affections ensnared by its allurements; this life and all things belonging to the body are great impediments, which prevent us from applying our minds to the contemplation of the future and spiritual life."
2. "He indirectly intimates that the loss of all other things is to be deemed as nothing, provided our souls be saved."
3. "We learn from the Apostle’s words, that salvation is not otherwise obtained than by faith; and we know that faith leans on the sole promise of gratuitous adoption; but if it be so, doubtless salvation is not owing to the merits of works, nor can it be hoped for on their account."

## Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Receiving...to get what is promised."
2. "The end of your faith...the culmination of faith."
3. "Even the salvation of your souls...final salvation."

## Adam Clarke:
1. "Receiving the end of your faith — Ye are put in possession of the salvation of your souls, which was the thing presented to your faith, when ye were called by the Gospel of Christ."
2. "Your faith has had a proper issue, and has been crowned with a proper recompense."
3. "The object of the Jewish expectations in their Messiah was the salvation or deliverance of their bodies from a foreign yoke; but the true Messiah came to save the soul from the yoke of the devil and sin."


# BHT:
The Bible verse talks about receiving the ultimate reward of faith, the salvation of the soul, in a blessed eternity. It is described as the end or culmination of faith, a future blessedness that believers eagerly anticipate. The verse highlights that salvation is not obtained through human merit or works, but solely through faith, and that the soul's deliverance from sin is of utmost importance.
