# choicest prompt v1 X bht prompt v3; ['Henry Alford', 'Jamieson Fausset Brown', 'Albert Barnes', 'Marvin Vincent', 'John Calvin', 'Philip Schaff', 'Archibald T Robertson', 'Adam Clarke']

## Henry Alford:
1. "Laying aside therefore all malice and all guile and hypocrisies and envies and all slanderings." - This verse emphasizes the need to completely remove negative qualities such as malice, guile, hypocrisy, envy, and slander from one's life.

2. "The guileless disposition knows not envy." - This quote highlights the connection between a sincere and honest nature and the absence of envy.

3. "Malitia malo delectatur alieno: invidia bono cruciatur alieno: dolus duplicat cor: adulatio duplicat linguam: detrectatio vulnerat famam." - This Latin quote from Augustine explains the harmful effects of malice, envy, deceit, flattery, and slander on both the individual and those they target.

## Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "The exhortation applies to Christians alone, for in none else is the new nature existing which, as 'the inward man' can cast off the old as an outward thing, so that the Christian, through the continual renewal of his inward man, can also exhibit himself externally as a new man."
2. "Each succeeding one springs out of that which immediately precedes, so as to form a genealogy of the sins against love. Out of malice springs guile out of guile, hypocrises (pretending to be what we are not, and not showing what we really are; the opposite of 'love unfeigned,' and 'without dissimulation'); out of hypocrisies, envies of those to whom we think ourselves obliged to play the hypocrite; out of envies, evil-speaking, malicious, envious detraction of others."
3. "Guile is the permanent disposition; hypocrisies the acts flowing from it. The guileless knows no envy."

## Albert Barnes:
1. "We are to cast off these things entirely; that is, we are no longer to practice them."
2. "The word 'malice'... includes evil of all kinds."
3. "Religion teaches us to lay aside whatever guile, insincerity, and false appearances we may have acquired, and to put on the simple honesty and openness of children."

## Marvin Vincent:
1. "All manner of evil-speaking." This phrase emphasizes the comprehensive nature of the negative speech being referred to. It encompasses any and all types of negative or harmful words spoken against others.

2. "Speakings against." This phrase highlights the act of speaking against someone or something. It suggests a deliberate intention to harm or defame through words.

3. "A rare word." This comment draws attention to the uniqueness of the term used to describe evil-speaking. It indicates that this particular word is not commonly found in the Bible, emphasizing its significance in conveying the concept of negative speech.

## John Calvin:
1. "It is not, then, sufficient for us to have been once called by the Lord, except we live as new creatures."
2. "Infancy is here set by Peter in opposition to the ancientness of the flesh, which leads to corruption; and under the word milk, he includes all the feelings of spiritual life."
3. "He then compares the vices, in which the oldness of the flesh indulges, to strong food; and milk is called that way of living suitable to innocent nature and simple infancy."
4. "What, then, he says amounts to this, — 'Having laid aside the works of your former life, such as malice, deceit, dissimulations, envyings, and other things of this kind, devote yourselves to things of an opposite character, cultivate kindness, honesty,' etc."
5. "He, in short, urges this, that new morals ought to follow a new life."

## Philip Schaff:
1. "The vices to be renounced, therefore, are compared implicitly to a foul garment enwrapping the old man. They are the ‘Nessus shirt’ of corrupt habits which the new man tears off." 
2. "Having by help of the Word an undying life capable of an undecaying love, forswear everything hostile to the life, and by a right use of the Word foster it till it grows to the perfection of final salvation."
3. "The ‘envies’ embrace all exhibitions of jealousy and grudging."

## Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Putting away therefore...to put off clothing." 
2. "Wickedness...vice of any kind." 
3. "Hypocrisies...denunciation of hypocrites."

## Adam Clarke:
1. "Laying aside all malice" - This verse emphasizes the importance of letting go of malicious thoughts and actions. It reminds us to abandon any ill will or desire to harm others, as these attitudes are contrary to the teachings of Christ. 

2. "Christianity can never admit of such" - This quote highlights the incompatibility of malice with the principles of Christianity. It emphasizes that followers of Christ should strive to embody love, kindness, and forgiveness, rather than harboring malice towards others. 

3. "They show the mind, not of Christ, but of the old murderer" - This statement draws a sharp contrast between the mindset of those who harbor malice and the mindset of Christ. It suggests that malice aligns more with the character of the devil, who is described as a murderer, rather than with the loving and compassionate nature of Christ.


# BHT:
In this verse, we are urged to let go of all malice, as it contradicts the teachings of Christ. Christianity cannot tolerate such ill will, as it goes against the principles of love, kindness, and forgiveness. Those who harbor malice exhibit the mindset of the devil, contrasting sharply with the compassionate nature of Christ. Thus, we are called to abandon any malicious thoughts and actions, embracing the love and forgiveness exemplified by Jesus.
