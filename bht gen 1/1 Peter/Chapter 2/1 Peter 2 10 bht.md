## Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Peter plainly confirms Paul, who quotes the passage as implying the call of the Gentiles to become spiritually that which Israel had been literally, 'the people of God.'"
2. "Primarily, the prophecy refers to literal Israel, hereafter to be fully that which in their best days they were only partially, God's people."
3. "Implying that it was God's pure mercy, not their merits, which made the blessed change in their state; a thought which ought to kindle their lively gratitude, to be shown with their life, as well as their lips."

## Albert Barnes:
1. "Which in time past were not a people - That is, who formerly were not regarded as the people of God."
2. "It is, however, a mere allusion here to the passage in Hosea 2:23, 'And I will have mercy upon her that had not obtained mercy; and I will say to them which were not my people, Thou art my people; and they shall say, Thou art my God.'"
3. "The language of the prophet would exactly express his idea, and he therefore uses it without intending to say that this was its original application."

## Marvin Vincent:
1. "A people of God." - This phrase emphasizes the special relationship between God and His chosen people. It highlights the idea that believers are not just individuals, but part of a larger community united by their faith in God.

2. "Compare Romans 9:25, Romans 9:26." - This reference to Romans 9:25-26 suggests that the concept of being a people of God is not limited to a specific time or group. It shows that throughout history, God has called and chosen people to be part of His family.

3. "Note the choice of the term here." - This comment draws attention to the deliberate use of the term "people" (λαος) in the verse. It implies that the word choice carries significance and invites readers to explore the deeper meaning behind it.

## John Calvin:
1. "Peter reminds us that this was fulfilled in his own age; for the Jews were scattered here and there, as the torn members of a body; nay, they seemed to be no longer God’s people, no worship remained among them, they were become entangled in the corruptions of the heathens; it could not then be said otherwise of them, but that they were repudiated by the Lord."
2. "But when they are gathered in Christ, from no people they really become the people of God."
3. "It is then God’s gratuitous goodness, which makes of no people a people to God, and reconciles the alienated."

## Philip Schaff:
1. "The contrast is drawn in order that in the recollection of their past they may find an incentive to adhere at any cost to their prophetic vocation of telling forth to others the excellences of God."
2. "Now they are not only a people, with the bonds of a true people’s union, but God’s people, owned of Him and administered by Him."
3. "Once they had been in the condition of persons not compassionated; now they are persons once for all compassionated of God."

## Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Who once upon a time." - This phrase highlights the past state of the people, emphasizing their previous condition before experiencing a change.
2. "No people." - This phrase refers to the people who had not received mercy, emphasizing their lack of favor or compassion.
3. "Change to first aorist passive participle from 'the long antecedent state' to 'the single event of conversion which ended it'." - This statement explains the shift from the prolonged state of not obtaining mercy to the specific moment of receiving mercy.

## Adam Clarke:
