# choicest prompt v1 X bht prompt v3; ['Henry Alford', 'Jamieson Fausset Brown', 'Albert Barnes', 'Marvin Vincent', 'John Calvin', 'Philip Schaff', 'Archibald T Robertson', 'Adam Clarke']

## Henry Alford:
1. "The seldomer our Apostle uses this endearing term, the weightier it is where it does occur as the opening of a hortatory discourse."
2. "These words, παροίκ . κ . παρεπιδ . , belong, not to παρακαλῶ, as Huther, al., but to ἀπέχεσθαι. They form the ground why the readers should abstain, not why the Writer should exhort."
3. "Non modo impediunt, sed oppugnant: grande verbum." (Translation: "Not only do they hinder, but they attack: a great word.")

## Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Purify your souls as strangers on earth who must not allow yourselves to be kept back by earthly lusts, and because these lusts war against the soul's salvation."
2. "Walk piously among unbelievers so that they may cease to calumniate Christians and may themselves be converted to Christ."
3. "The regenerated soul is besieged by sinful lusts. Like Samson in the lap of Delilah, the believer, the moment that he gives way to fleshly lusts, has the locks of his strength shorn, and ceases to maintain that spiritual separation from the world and the flesh."

## Albert Barnes:
1. "Christians are not properly citizens of this world, but that their citizenship is in heaven, and that they are here mere sojourners."
2. "They should not seek to acquire permanent possessions here, as if they were to remain here, but should act as travelers do, who merely seek a temporary lodging."
3. "A traveler takes along as few things as possible; and a staff is often all that a pilgrim has. We make the most rapid progress in our journey to our final home when we are least encumbered with the things of this world."

## Marvin Vincent:
1. "Beloved [αγαπητοι]. A favorite term with Peter, occurring eight times in the epistles."
2. "Strangers [παροικους]. Rev., sojourners. Compare ch. 1 17, 'the time of your sojourning [παροικιας].'"
3. "Which [αιτινες]. The compound pronoun denotes a class, of that kind which, classifying all fleshly desires in one category."

## John Calvin:
1. "For the lusts of the flesh hold us entangled, when in our minds we dwell in the world, and think not that heaven is our country; but when we pass as strangers through this life, we are not in bondage to the flesh."
2. "By the lusts or desires of the flesh he means not only those gross concupiscences which we have in common with animals, but also all those sinful passions and affections of the soul, to which we are by nature guided and led."
3. "He proves our carelessness in this respect, that while we anxiously shun enemies from whom we apprehend danger to the body, we willingly allow enemies hurtful to the soul to destroy us; nay, we as it were stretch forth our neck to them."

## Philip Schaff:
1. "The opening designation occurs no less than eight times in the Epistles of Peter, and in every case except the present the A. V. translates it simply ‘beloved,’ not ‘dearly beloved.’" 
2. "They are appealed to in the character of strangers and sojourners; of which terms the latter is the one used in the first designation of the readers, and conveys a somewhat different idea from the ‘pilgrims’ of the A. V., while the former denotes properly residents without the rights of natives." 
3. "The ‘lusts’ are, as in 1 Peter 1:14, not merely the fetid sensualities which had attained such monstrous strength in the heathenism of the time, but all inordinate passions and desires, all that would come within Paul’s enumeration of the works of the flesh."

## Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Christians whose fatherland is heaven." (quote 1)
2. "To hold back from the grosser sins of the flesh." (quote 2)
3. "The struggle between the flesh and the spirit." (quote 3)

## Adam Clarke:
1. "As strangers and pilgrims...for they were strangers scattered through Asia, Pontus." 
2. "As ye are strangers and pilgrims...do not entangle your affections with earthly things."
3. "All kinds of earthly desires...are here comprised in the words fleshly lusts."
4. "Which are marshalled and drawn up in battle array, to fight against the soul; either to slay it, or to bring it into captivity."
