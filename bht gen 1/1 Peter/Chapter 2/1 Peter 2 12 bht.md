## Henry Alford:
1. "Your behavior among the Gentiles comely, that in the matter in which they speak against you as evildoers, they may, on the ground of your good works, glorify God in the day of visitation."
2. "The positive result of this abstinence, and its important fruit."
3. "That conduct, which was to them an occasion of speaking against you as evil-doers, may by your good works become to them an occasion of glorifying God."

## Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Our conversation should correspond to our Saviour's condition; this is in heaven, so ought that to be."
2. "A good walk does not make us pious, but we must first be pious and believe before we attempt to lead a good course."
3. "The very works 'which on more careful consideration, must move the heathen to praise God, are at first the object of hatred and raillery'."

## Albert Barnes:
1. "Lead upright and consistent lives."
2. "It should be true that at the very time when the enemies of religion reproach us, they should see that we are actuated by Christian principles."
3. "Our conduct as Christians should be such as to bear the strictest scrutiny; such that the closest examination will lead our enemies to the conviction that we are upright and honest."
4. "That they may be convinced by your conduct of the pure and holy nature of that religion which he has revealed, and be led also to love and worship him."
5. "Their consistent lives would be the means of the revival and extension of true religion."

## Marvin Vincent:
1. "The 'day of visitation' is the day of looking upon: 'When God shall look upon these wanderers, as a pastor over his flock, and shall become the overlooker or bishop of their souls'." (Quote 1)

2. "Which they shall behold [εποπτευοντες] . Rev., beholding. Used by Peter only, here and ch. 3 2. The kindred noun ejpopthv, an eye-witness, occurs only at 2 Peter 1:16. It is a technical word, meaning one who was admitted to the highest degree of initiation in the Elensinian mysteries. Here it conveys the idea of personal witness; behold with their own eyes." (Quote 2)

3. "Visiting grows naturally out of this, as visitare from visere, to look at attentively. See Introduction, on Peter's emphasis upon sight; and compare behold, in this verse." (Quote 3)

## John Calvin:
1. "The more carefully, therefore, ought they to have labored to wipe off the odium and infamy attached to their name by a holy life and a well-regulated conduct."
2. "The evil speakings and the wicked insinuations of the ungodly ought to stimulate us to lead an upright life."
3. "We ought thus to strive, not for our own sake, that men may think and speak well of us; but that we may glorify God."

## Philip Schaff:
1. "The life of self restraint in the heart of corrupting heathen associations is to be a life so honest, or rather (with Wycliffe and the Rhemish) so good, so fair and honourable, that even the Gentiles may confess its attractiveness."
2. "Their outer life, with all that in their behaviour which is open to the observation and judgment of others, is now specially dealt with, and they are counselled to make that a spectacle of good works which even prejudiced and hostile eyes shall be unable to contest."
3. "Peter’s exhortation is not to isolate themselves, but to be careful of their behaviour in the sight of the heathen till they found a ‘silent witness and ally’ (Lillie) in the hearts of their calumniators themselves."

## Archibald T Robertson:
1. "The Gentiles are on the watch for slips in moral conduct by the Christians." 
2. "The purpose of the Christians is to glorify God in their conduct towards the Gentiles." 
3. "Heathen talk against us gleefully, but they also carefully observe our good works."

## Adam Clarke:
1. "Living in such a manner among the Gentiles, in whose country ye sojourn, as becomes the Gospel which ye profess."
2. "The Christians should be exceedingly cautious; and that their conduct should prove that, although many of them were of the same nation, yet they who had embraced Christianity differed widely in their spirit and conduct from those, whether Jews or Gentiles, who had not received the faith of Christ."
3. "The heathens, seeing them bear their sufferings with unconquerable patience, were constrained to confess that God was with them; and not a few, from being spectators of their sufferings, became converts to Christianity."


# BHT:
In this Bible verse, believers are urged to live upright and consistent lives among the Gentiles, so that even those who speak against them will be moved to glorify God by witnessing their good works. The verse emphasizes the importance of a holy and well-regulated conduct, one that is attractive and unable to be contested by prejudiced and hostile eyes. By carefully observing the Christians' good works, the heathens may come to confess that God is with them and ultimately be led to embrace Christianity.
