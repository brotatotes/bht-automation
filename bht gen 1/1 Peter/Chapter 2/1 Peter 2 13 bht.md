# choicest prompt v1 X bht prompt v3; ['Henry Alford', 'Jamieson Fausset Brown', 'Albert Barnes', 'Marvin Vincent', 'John Calvin', 'Philip Schaff', 'Archibald T Robertson', 'Adam Clarke']

## Henry Alford:
1. "Be subjected to every human institution...it is not to the king as a man, but to the king as a human institution, that we are to be subject." 
2. "It is no objection to this, that all powers are ordained of God: for that consideration does not come into notice in these words, but in those which follow, διὰ τ . κύριον." 
3. "Here, it is the lower side of such institutions, the fact of their being ordained and upheld by men, that is brought into sight."

## Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "The apostle speaks as one raised above all human things."
2. "Submit yourselves for the sake of Christ, who desires you to be subject."
3. "The distinction between 'the king as supreme' and 'governors sent by him' implies that 'if the king command one thing, and the subordinate magistrate another, we ought rather to obey the superior'."

## Albert Barnes:
1. "Submit yourselves to every ordinance of man" - The meaning is, to every institution or appointment of man; to wit, of those who are in authority, or who are appointed to administer government.
2. "What is ordained by those in authority is not contrary to the law of God."
3. "We are to be subject to that authority whether exercised by the sovereign in person, or by those who are appointed by him."

## Marvin Vincent:
1. "Submit yourselves [υποταγητε] . Rev., be subject." 
2. "Ordinance of man [ανθρωπινη κτισει] . Lit., to every human creation or institution."
3. "King. The emperor, styled king by Greek writers."

## John Calvin:
1. "Submit yourselves," or, Be ye subject; for by refusing the yoke of government, they would have given to the Gentiles no small occasion for reproaching them.
2. To every ordinance of man...Peter reminds us, that God the maker of the world has not left the human race in a state of confusion, that they might live after the manner of beasts, but as it were in a building regularly formed, and divided into several compartments.
3. Obedience is due to all who rule, because they have been raised to that honor not by chance, but by God’s providence. For many are wont to inquire too scrupulously by what right power has been attained; but we ought to be satisfied with this alone, that power is possessed and exercised.

## Philip Schaff:
1. "The spirit which should animate us in practicing such submission is thus solemnly added. And that is the spirit which recognizes something Divine in human institutions."
2. "This pregnant statement of motive, therefore, elevates incalculably the duty itself. It implies that our submission will come short of its standard if the duty is viewed as a merely secular thing."
3. "He takes the things and the persons as they then were, and, on high spiritual grounds, recommends an inoffensive and respectful attitude towards them."

## Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Peter here approves no special kind of government, but he supports law and order as Paul does (Romans 13:1-8) unless it steps in between God and man (Acts 4:20)."

2. "For the Lord's sake (δια τον κυριον). For Jesus' sake. That is reason enough for the Christian not to be an anarchist (Matthew 22:21)."

3. "It should not be forgotten that, in spite of the fine language of the philosophers, the really popular religions in Greece and Rome were forms of devil-worship, intimately blended with magic in all its grades" (Bigg).

## Adam Clarke:
1. "Genuine Christians have nothing to do with the laws but to obey them."
2. "Society and civil security are in a most dangerous state when the people take it into their heads that they have a right to remodel and change the laws."
3. "The apostle tells them they should obey the civil magistrate, let him be of what stock he may, whether a Jew or a Gentile, and let him exercise the government in whatsoever form."


# BHT:
In this Bible verse, we are called to be subject to every human institution, recognizing their divinely ordained authority. The duty of submission is not merely a secular obligation, but is elevated by the recognition of something divine in these institutions. This submission is not limited to a particular kind of government, but extends to law and order as long as it does not go against God. Genuine Christians are called to obey the laws, recognizing that the authority of the civil magistrate, regardless of their background or form of government, is established by God.
