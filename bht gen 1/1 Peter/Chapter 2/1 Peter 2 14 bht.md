# 1 Peter 2:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This verse emphasizes the importance of submitting to authority figures, recognizing that they are established by God and serve a purpose in maintaining order. It is through our obedience to human rulers that we demonstrate our trust and reverence for God's ultimate authority. However, our submission should not be blind, but rather guided by the moral laws of God. If a ruler's commands contradict these laws, we are called to stand firm in our faith and resist any unjust or immoral orders.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The king is supreme, in his own right: governors rule by delegation from the king, 'mittuntur' διʼ αὐτοῦ." 
2. "The right understanding of διὰ κύριον, as applying to all, forbids this view. For thus we should obey the king as ὑπερέχων, no mention of the Lord being made, whereas rulers are to be obeyed as sent by the Lord."
3. "A governor could surely not be said to be sent διὰ κυρίου for (to bring about) vengeance on evil-doers, and praise of well-doers."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "No tyranny ever has been so unprincipled as that some appearance of equity was not maintained in it; however corrupt a government be, God never suffers it to be so much so as not to be better than anarchy." 
2. "Tyranny harasses many, but anarchy overwhelms the whole state." 
3. "Every government recognizes the excellence of truly Christian subjects."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "For the punishment of evil doers - One of the leading ends of government."
2. "They who govern whole provinces, have the power of sending to the mines."
3. "It is as important a part of the functions of magistracy to protect the innocent, as it is to punish the wicked."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Sent [πεμπομενοις]. In the habit of being sent: sent from time to time." 
2. "Punishment [εκδικησιν]. Not strong enough. Better, vengeance, as Rev. Compare Luke 18:7; Romans 12:19." 
3. "Them that do well [αγαθοποιων]. Only here in New Testament."

### John Calvin:
1. "There is no kind of government to which we ought not to submit...they are God's ministers." 
2. "They who despise their authority are enemies to mankind." 
3. "It is a singular blessing of God, that the wicked are not allowed to do what they like."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "These governors should have our submission, because they are the king’s delegates."
2. "The object, with a view to which they are sent with their delegated powers, is itself a reason for yielding them respect and subjection."
3. "The idea of their office is the repression of the evil, and the protection and praise of the good."

These quotes highlight the reasons for submitting to governors and officials, emphasizing their role as delegates of the king, their purpose in upholding order and right, and the importance of recognizing and respecting their authority. They also acknowledge that there may be situations where the office is perverted or the governor acts unjustly, but the general principle is to obey until it can be amended and to not obey when it offends morality and conscience.

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Even Pilate received his authority ultimately 'from above'." 
2. "For vengeance on evil-doers." 
3. "For praise to them that do well."

### John Gill:
1. "Inferior magistrates, such as were under the Roman emperor... under whom they acted, and to whom they were accountable; or by God, by whom they are ordained, and whose ministers they are." 
2. "Punishment is to be inflicted, by the civil magistrates, for the breach of them, by lines, scourgings, imprisonment, and death itself, according as the crimes are." 
3. "Those who behave according to the laws of God and nations, and are obedient to magistrates, and subject to every ordinance; these have praise of men, of magistrates, and are rewarded by them."

### John Wesley:
1. "The verse highlights the importance of submitting to authority figures, whether they are kings, governors, or magistrates. This implies that God has established a hierarchy of authority in society, and it is our duty to respect and obey those in positions of power."
2. "By submitting to authority, we are not only obeying earthly rulers but also acknowledging God's sovereignty. It is through our obedience to human authority that we demonstrate our trust and reverence for God's ultimate authority."
3. "However, it is important to note that our submission to authority should not be blind or unconditional. We must always prioritize obeying God's commandments and principles over the instructions of human rulers. If a ruler's commands contradict God's moral laws, we are called to stand firm in our faith and resist any unjust or immoral orders."
