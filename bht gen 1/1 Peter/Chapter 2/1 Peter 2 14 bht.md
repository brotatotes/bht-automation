# choicest prompt v1 X bht prompt v3; ['Henry Alford', 'Jamieson Fausset Brown', 'Albert Barnes', 'Marvin Vincent', 'John Calvin', 'Philip Schaff', 'Archibald T Robertson', 'Adam Clarke']

## Henry Alford:
1. "The grounds of obedience in each case, all being alike διὰ κύριον, belong to the actually existing rights of power in that case."
2. "The right understanding of διὰ κύριον, as applying to all, forbids this view. For thus we should obey the king as ὑπερέχων, no mention of the Lord being made, whereas rulers are to be obeyed as sent by the Lord."
3. "A governor could surely not be said to be sent διὰ κυρίου for (to bring about) vengeance on evil-doers, and praise of well-doers."

## Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "No tyranny ever has been so unprincipled as that some appearance of equity was not maintained in it; however corrupt a government be, God never suffers it to be so much so as not to be better than anarchy."
2. "Tyranny harasses many, but anarchy overwhelms the whole state."
3. "Every government recognizes the excellence of truly Christian subjects. Thus PLINY, in his letter to the Emperor Trajan, acknowledges, 'I have found in them nothing else save a perverse and extravagant superstition.'"

## Albert Barnes:
1. "The Roman governors had the power of life and death in such conquered provinces as those mentioned in 1 Peter 1:1." - Doddridge
2. "It is the duty of a good and vigilant president to see to it that his province be peaceable and quiet... And to punish everyone according to their guilt." - Ulpian
3. "It is as important a part of the functions of magistracy to protect the innocent, as it is to punish the wicked."

## Marvin Vincent:
1. "Sent [πεμπομενοις]. In the habit of being sent: sent from time to time."
2. "Punishment [εκδικησιν]. Not strong enough. Better, vengeance, as Rev. Compare Luke 18:7; Romans 12:19."
3. "Them that do well [αγαθοποιων]. Only here in New Testament."

## John Calvin:
1. "There is no kind of government to which we ought not to submit...they are God's ministers." 
2. "They who despise their authority are enemies to mankind." 
3. "It is a singular blessing of God, that the wicked are not allowed to do what they like."

## Philip Schaff:
1. "These governors should have our submission, because they are the king’s delegates."
2. "The object, with a view to which they are sent with their delegated powers, is itself a reason for yielding them respect and subjection."
3. "The idea of their office is the repression of the evil, and the protection and praise of the good."

Note: The commentary provides insights into the reasons for submitting to governors, emphasizing their role as delegates of the king, the purpose of their office, and the importance of respecting their authority. It also acknowledges that there may be situations where the actions of rulers conflict with morality and conscience, but still emphasizes the need to submit to their penalties.

## Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Even Pilate received his authority ultimately 'from above'." 
2. "For vengeance on evil-doers." 
3. "For praise to them that do well."

## Adam Clarke:
1. "By governors, ηγεμοσιν, are meant, leaders, governors, presidents, proconsuls, and other chief magistrates, sent by him into the provinces dependent on the Roman empire." 
2. "They were to punish delinquents, and encourage and protect the virtuous." 
3. "The object of their mission; they were to punish delinquents, and encourage and protect the virtuous."


# BHT:
Government officials, known as governors, are appointed by higher authorities and have the power to maintain order and justice in their jurisdiction. They fulfill their mission by executing punishment on wrongdoers and providing support and protection to those who do good. This divine authority invested in governors stems from above and serves as a means to bring both retribution and praise within society. It is our duty to submit to these delegated authorities, recognizing their role in upholding the common good, even though they may not always act in perfect accordance with our own moral standards.
