# choicest prompt v1 X bht prompt v3; ['Henry Alford', 'Jamieson Fausset Brown', 'Albert Barnes', 'Marvin Vincent', 'John Calvin', 'Philip Schaff', 'Archibald T Robertson', 'Adam Clarke']

## Henry Alford:
1. "For so is the will of God, that doing good you put to silence the ignorance of foolish men." 
2. "ἀγνωσία, see the instructive parallel, ref. 1 Cor., is not simply ignorance of this or that fact, but a state of lack of knowledge or understanding, habitual ignorance."
3. "This state is here introduced as speaking, 'having (as Wiesinger) ever its mouth open rather than its eyes,' ready to cry out upon any mere appearance of things as misunderstood by it."

## Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Maintain such a walk that they shall have no charge against you, except touching your faith." 
2. "Their ignorance should move the believer's pity, not his anger." 
3. "Put to silence—literally, 'to muzzle,' 'to stop the mouth.'"

## Albert Barnes:
1. "It is in accordance with the divine will that in this way you should put them to silence."
2. "By a life of uprightness and benevolence, you may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men."
3. "One of the best ways of meeting the accusations of our enemies is to lead a life of strict integrity."

## Marvin Vincent:
1. "Put to silence [φιμουν] . A very graphic word, meaning to muzzle or gag." 
2. "Ignorance [αγνωσιαν] . In classical Greek it is an ignorance arising from not coming into contact with the person or thing to be known."
3. "Of foolish men [των αφρονων ανθρωπων] . Of the foolish men; the article referring to those just mentioned, who speak against them as evil-doers."

## John Calvin:
1. "The phrase which he adopts, 'to stop up ignorance,' though it may seem harsh on account of its novelty, does not yet obscure the sense."
2. "For he not only calls the unbelieving foolish, but also points out the reason why they slandered, even because they were ignorant of God."
3. "But he means that no occasion of slandering ought to be given to the unbelieving, however much they may desire it."

## Philip Schaff:
1. "The will of God is to the following effect, namely, that by well doing ye silence the ignorance of the foolish men." 
2. "The ‘well-doing’... has here the more general sense of rectitude or dutifulness of conduct." 
3. "The verb ‘silence’ means literally to muzzle, and might be rendered ‘gag.’ But it has the secondary sense... that sense should be retained here."

## Archibald T Robertson:
1. "By well-doing" - The present active participle of αγαθοποιεω, this phrase emphasizes the importance of consistently engaging in good actions and deeds.
2. "The ignorance of foolish men" - Referring to the lack of knowledge or understanding displayed by foolish individuals, this phrase highlights the negative consequences of ignorance.
3. "Disgraceful ignorance" - This phrase, found in both this commentary and in 1 Corinthians 15:24, emphasizes the shame and dishonor associated with ignorance.

## Adam Clarke:
1. "God, as their supreme governor, shows them that it is his will that they should act uprightly and obediently at all times." 
2. "Confound the ignorance of foolish men, who were ready enough to assert that their religion made them bad subjects." 
3. "Let them assert, but ever be unable to bring proof to support it."


# BHT:
In this verse, the will of God is revealed, calling believers to silence the ignorance of foolish men through good deeds and righteous conduct. The foolish men mentioned here are characterized by their lack of knowledge and understanding, which should evoke pity rather than anger from believers. By living a life of integrity and benevolence, believers can effectively muzzle these foolish individuals and refute their baseless accusations against their faith. This instruction reflects God's desire for His followers to lead by example and uphold a standard of righteousness, ultimately challenging and dispelling unfounded ignorance.
