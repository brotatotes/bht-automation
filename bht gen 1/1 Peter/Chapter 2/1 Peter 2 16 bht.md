# choicest prompt v1 X bht prompt v3; ['Henry Alford', 'Jamieson Fausset Brown', 'Albert Barnes', 'Marvin Vincent', 'John Calvin', 'Philip Schaff', 'Archibald T Robertson', 'Adam Clarke']

## Henry Alford:
1. "No one would think of pleading his freedom as an excuse for not honouring all, or for not loving the brethren, or for not fearing God: or indeed for not, in some sense, honouring the King."
2. "But in a matter of subjection, such ἐλευθερία might be and often is made a cloak for disobedience."
3. "As free (children of God, His family and people, His kingly priesthood: not merely free from the law, or free from sin, or free from earthly subjection, but generally and abstractedly free Christ’s freed men)."

## Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Well-doing" is the natural fruit of being freemen of Christ, made free by "the truth" from the bondage of sin. (1 Peter 2:15)
2. Duty is enforced on us to guard against licentiousness, but the way in which it is to be fulfilled is by love and the holy instincts of Christian liberty.
3. We are given principles, not details.

## Albert Barnes:
1. "They were not to submit to the chains of slavery; not to allow their consciences to be bound, or their essential liberty to be interfered with; nor in their subjection to the civil magistrate were they ever to regard themselves otherwise than as freemen."
2. "To spread the gospel in its purity everywhere would be to break every yoke of oppression and bondage, and to make people everywhere free."
3. "It is the essential right of every man who is a Christian to be a freeman - to be free to worship God; to read the Bible; to enjoy the avails of his own labor; to train up his children in the way in which he shall deem best; to form his own plans of life, and to pursue his own ends, provided only that he does not interfere with the equal rights of others."

## Marvin Vincent:
1. "Using Christian freedom as a mask for ungodly license."
2. "The idea of using Christian freedom as a veil."
3. "The covering of sins."

## John Calvin:
1. "True liberty, then, is that which harms or injures no one."
2. "To confirm this, he declares that those are free who serve God."
3. "It is obvious, hence, to conclude, that we obtain liberty, in order that we may more promptly and more readily render obedience to God."

## Philip Schaff:
1. "Liberty is apt to degenerate into licence."
2. "Their freedom was not to be used as a means for concealing or palliating wickedness."
3. "The freedom of Christians is a bond freedom, because they have been set free in order to be bond-servants to God; and a free bondage, because they obey God and Magistrate not of constraint, but spontaneously."

## Archibald T Robertson:
1. "For this ethical sense of ελευθερος see Galatians 4:26."
2. "And not holding your liberty" (present active participle of εχω, with usual negative μη with participle."
3. "There is no such thing as absolute freedom (personal freedom), for that is anarchy."

## Adam Clarke:
1. "The Jews pretended that they were a free people, and owed allegiance to God alone; hence they were continually rebelling against the Roman government, to which God had subjected them because of their rebellion against him."
2. "They used their liberty for a cloak of maliciousness - for a pretext of rebellion, and by it endeavored to vindicate their seditious and rebellious conduct."
3. "These were free from sin and Satan, but they were the servants of God - bound to obey him; and, as he had made it their duty to obey the civil magistrate, they served God by submitting to every ordinance of man for the Lord's sake."


# BHT:
In this verse, the commentators describe the concept of Christian freedom and its limitations. They warn against using freedom as an excuse for disobedience or maliciousness, emphasizing the importance of honoring God, loving others, and respecting authority. The idea of freedom is not to be twisted into anarchy or rebellion, but rather to serve God and spread the Gospel. It is a liberty that allows believers to worship, work, and make choices for themselves within the boundaries of righteousness and the equal rights of others.
