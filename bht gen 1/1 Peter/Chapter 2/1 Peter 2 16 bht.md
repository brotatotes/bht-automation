# 1 Peter 2:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Bible verse being described emphasizes the balance between freedom and submission to authority. Commentators emphasize that true freedom in Christ does not give us license to disregard earthly authority, but rather calls us to honor and respect it. Our freedom is not freedom to sin or live without rules, but it is a freedom to obey God and His commands. We are reminded that our submission to earthly authorities is ultimately an act of obedience to God, who has placed them in positions of power.
