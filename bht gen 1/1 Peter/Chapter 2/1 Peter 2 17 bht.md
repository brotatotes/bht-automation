# choicest prompt v1 X bht prompt v3; ['Henry Alford', 'Jamieson Fausset Brown', 'Albert Barnes', 'Marvin Vincent', 'John Calvin', 'Philip Schaff', 'Archibald T Robertson', 'Adam Clarke']

## Henry Alford:
1. "Give honour to all men (i.e. by the force of the aor. imperat., to each man according as the case, which requires it, arises, q. d. ‘in every case render promptly every man’s due:’ = ἀπόδοτε πᾶσιν τὰς ὀφειλάς, Romans 13:7."
2. "And by this force of the aor., this first precept assumes a place of general and wide-reaching reference."
3. "Love (as your habit of mind and act, pres.) the brotherhood (the aggregate of οἱ ἀδελφοί: see ref. and compare ἱεράτευμα above, 1Pe 2:9), fear God, honour (both these latter as continuing habits, frames of mind and courses of action) the king."

## Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Honour all men—according to whatever honor is due in each case."
2. "Christ has dignified our humanity by assuming it; therefore we should not dishonor, but be considerate to and honor our common humanity, even in the very humblest."
3. "Fear God . . . the king—The king is to be honored; but God alone, in the highest sense, feared."

## Albert Barnes:
1. "Honor all men - That is, show them the respect which is due to them according to their personal worth, and to the rank and office which they sustain."
2. "Fear God - A duty everywhere enjoined in the Bible, as one of the first duties of religion. The word fear, when used to express our duty to God, means that we are to reverence and honor him."
3. "The doctrine taught in these verses Romans 13:13-14 is, that we are faithfully to perform all the relative duties of life. Religion, while it is honored by our faithful performance of our duty to ourselves, is more openly honored by our performance of our duties to those to whom we sustain important relations in life."

## John Calvin:
1. "God is not feared, nor their just right rendered to men, except civil order prevails among us, and magistrates retain their authority."
2. "A regard ought to be had for all, since we ought to cultivate, as far as we can, peace and friendship with all; there is, indeed, nothing more adverse to concord than contempt."
3. "Though brethren are to be specially regarded, yet this ought not to prevent our love from being extended to the whole human race."

## Philip Schaff:
1. "The practical acknowledgment of the dignity of man as such, and of his natural claims upon our consideration and respect."
2. "The followers of Christ were distinguished by Himself from the mass of men as brethren, and that name they seem to have adopted naturally as their own earliest designation."
3. "The reverential awe which is due from the subject to supreme authority, and from the child to supreme perfection, which makes it to the one a dread and to the other a pain to offend, is what is to be rendered to Him who is the Maker of all men, the Father of the brotherhood, the King of kings."


## Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Honour all men (παντας τιμησατε). Not with the same honour."
2. "Love the brotherhood (την αδελφοτητα αγαπατε). Present active imperative of αγαπαω, keep on doing it."
3. "Fear God (τον θεον φοβεισθε). In both senses of reverence and dread, and keep it up (present middle imperative)."
4. "Honour the king (τον βασιλεα τιματε). Keep that up also. A fine motto in this verse."

## Adam Clarke:
1. "Respect every man as a fellow creature, and as one who may be a fellow heir with you of eternal life." 
2. "All true Christians, who form one great family of which God is the head." 
3. "If respect be banished, subordination will flee with it, and anarchy and ruin will rise up in their place."
