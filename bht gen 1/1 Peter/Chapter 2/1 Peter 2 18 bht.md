# choicest prompt v1 X bht prompt v3; ['Henry Alford', 'Jamieson Fausset Brown', 'Albert Barnes', 'Marvin Vincent', 'John Calvin', 'Philip Schaff', 'Archibald T Robertson', 'Adam Clarke']

## Henry Alford:
1. "Ye servants, in subjection, in all fear to your masters." 
2. "Not only to the good and considerate, but also to the perverse." 
3. "These masters are, as Gerh., 'sævi et intractabiles, duri ac morosi'."

## Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Peter's special object seems to be to teach them submission, whatever the character of the masters might be."
2. "The participle expresses a particular instance of the general exhortation to good conduct."
3. "Those bound to obey must not make the disposition and behavior of the superior the measure of the fulfillment of their obligations."

## Albert Barnes:
1. "The word should not and cannot be employed to prove that slavery existed in the churches to which Peter wrote, and still less to prove that he approved of slavery, or regarded it as a good institution."
2. "It would be incumbent on them, while they remained in that condition, to perform with fidelity their duties as Christians, and to bear with Christian meekness all the wrongs which they might suffer from those in whose service they were."
3. "Those who were under them are represented as suffering grievous wrongs... the servant should perform his duty with fidelity, whatever may be the character of the master."

## Marvin Vincent:
1. "Not a common term in the New Testament, occurring only in three other passages." 
2. "The word implies rather the not being unduly rigorous: 'Wherein not strictness of legal right, but consideration for one another, is the rule of practice'." 
3. "The word froward is Anglo-Saxon fream-ward or from-ward, the opposite of to-ward."

## John Calvin:
1. "He first would have servants to be subject with all fear; by which expression he means that sincere and willing reverence, which they acknowledge by their office to be due."
2. "Fear arises from a right knowledge of duty."
3. "For this law is laid on servants, that they are to serve their masters, though they may be unworthy."

## Philip Schaff:
1. "The term for ‘servants’ here is different from the one by which Paul so frequently expresses the idea of the bond-servant... It means, literally, ‘one belonging to one’s house,’ ‘a domestic,’ and in Acts 10:7 it is translated by our A. V. ‘household servant.’" 
2. "The slave’s duty is thus given as an integral section of the great law of subjection to ‘every ordinance of man for the Lord’s sake.’" 
3. "The ‘fear’ has been put absolutely, ‘all fear,’ as extending to everything which can make demands upon the servant’s loyalty and patience... It means, therefore, careful solicitude to give faithful service, ‘shrinking from transgressing the master’s will’ (Huther)."

## Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Οικετης, old word from οικος (house), means one in the same house with another (Latin domesticus), particularly house servants (slaves) in distinction from the general term δουλος (slave)." 
2. "Either the participle is here used as an imperative (so in 1 Peter 3:1; 1 Peter 3:7) as in Romans 12:16, or the imperative εστε has to be supplied."
3. "There were slave-owners (masters) like this as there are housekeepers and employers of workmen today. This is no argument for slavery, but only a sidelight on a condition bad enough at its best."

## Adam Clarke:
1. "Servants, be subject...with all fear" - The commentary emphasizes the importance of submission and reverence in the relationship between servants and their masters, highlighting the need for respect and obedience.

2. "The good and gentle...The froward" - The commentary describes the ideal qualities of a master, one who is just, reasonable, and considerate. It also acknowledges that not all masters may possess these qualities, but encourages servants to fulfill their duties regardless.

3. "Your time belongs to your master...it is your duty to obey" - The commentary reminds servants that their time and work belong to their masters, even if the tasks assigned are unreasonable or foolish. It emphasizes the duty of obedience, leaving the responsibility for the master's actions to the master themselves.
