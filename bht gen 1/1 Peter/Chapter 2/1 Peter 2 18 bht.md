### Albert Barnes:
1. "The exhortation here would be, and still is, strictly applicable to any persons employed as domestics, though they had voluntarily hired themselves out to be such."
2. "Those who are hired, and who are under a necessity of 'going out to service' for a living, are not always free from hard usage, for there are trials incident to that condition of life which cannot be always avoided."
3. "Though the terms used here do not necessarily imply that those to whom the apostle gave this direction were slaves, yet it may be presumed that they probably were, since slavery abounded throughout the Roman empire; but the directions will apply to all who are engaged in the service of others, and are therefore of permanent value."

2. "Fear arises from a right knowledge of duty. And though no exception is added in this place, yet, according to other places, it is to be understood. For subjection due to men is not to be so far extended as to lessen the authority of God."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Peter selects it probably with a conciliatory purpose, as a more courteous term than the common one. It presents the slave in closer relation to the family, and so conveys a softened view of his position."
2. "The slave’s duty is thus given as an integral section of the great law of subjection to ‘every ordinance of man for the Lord’s sake.’"
3. "The ‘fear’ has been put absolutely, ‘all fear,’ as extending to everything which can make demands upon the servant’s loyalty and patience."

1. "The Apostle Peter, here, as the Apostle Paul frequently elsewhere, inculcates this duty of servants to their masters."
2. "The manner in which they are to be subject to them is, with all fear; with reverence to their persons, strict regard to their commands, faithfulness in any trust reposed in them, diligence in the discharge of their duty, and carefulness of offending them."
