# 1 Peter 2:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the Bible speaks of the commendable act of enduring unjust treatment for the sake of conscience towards God. It is a conscious recognition of our relationship with God and a decision to act in accordance with His will, even when faced with adversity. This endurance is not a mere stoical acceptance, but a patient and steadfast response, rooted in a deep sense of duty towards God. It is an expression of gratitude and acceptance before Him, demonstrating our genuine faith and trust in His purposes.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "For this is thankworthy...what recognition at God’s hand in the day when He will come, and His reward with Him? It is said of something, to do or suffer which is out of, beyond, the ordinary course of what might have been expected."
2. "The idea that it means 'gratiam divinam concilians,' Wahl, leading on to 'hoc est opus supererogationis,' Lyra, is theologically inadmissible, besides doing violence to the construction."
3. "on account of consciousness of God...realization in a man’s inner being, of God’s presence and relation to himself."

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "A course out of the common, and especially praiseworthy in the eyes of God."
2. "Conscientious regard to God, more than to men."
3. "Patiently bear up under...griefs."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "This is graceful indeed." - Doddridge
2. "If he feels that God, by his providence, has placed him in the circumstances in which he is, and that it is a duty which he owes to him to bear every trial incident to that condition with a submissive spirit." 
3. "If he does this, he will evince the true nature of religion, and will be graciously accepted of God."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Conscience toward God" refers to the conscious sense of one's relation to God, not just a general sense of conscientiousness. It is the inner consciousness of being a son of God and a joint-heir with Christ, which includes suffering with Him and being glorified with Him.

2. The phrase implies that one's actions and decisions are guided by a deep awareness of their connection to God. It is not merely a sense of duty, but a conscious recognition of their relationship with God and Christ.

3. This conscious sense of one's relation to God enables believers to endure suffering patiently, knowing that they are united with Christ in both His suffering and His glory. It is a source of strength and hope in the midst of trials.

### John Calvin:
1. "No grace or praise shall be found before God, if we bear the punishment which we have by our faults deserved; but they who patiently bear injuries and wrongs are worthy of praise and accepted by God."
2. "To testify that it was acceptable to God, when anyone from conscience towards God persevered in doing his duty, though unjustly and unworthily treated, was at that time very necessary."
3. "Moreover, he who considers that he has to do with God, must necessarily endeavor to overcome evil with good."

Note: The commentary provides additional explanations and references, but the quotes selected capture the essence of the main points.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "We have to choose, therefore, between three ideas, that of gracious or attractive, that of favour, i.e securing favour with one, or that of thankworthy, as the A. V. puts it, or better, ‘acceptable,’ as the R. V. gives it in harmony with the repetition of the word in the end of 1 Peter 2:20." 
2. "Endurance, therefore, is not of itself a ‘thankworthy’ thing. In the case of any one, slave or other, it is so only if it is endurance of wrong, and only if it is animated by one’s sense of his relation to God, not if it is due to prudential considerations or of the nature of a sullen, stoical accommodation to the inevitable."
3. "The motive which gives nobility to endurance is put in the foreground. By this ‘consciousness of God’ is meant neither exactly the ‘conscience toward God’ of the A. V. and R. V., nor ‘conscientiousness before God,’ far less’ the consciousness which God has of us’ (as some strangely put it), but that consciousness which we have of God, which at once inspires the sense of duty and elevates the idea of duty."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "For this thing (obedience to crooked masters) is grace." 
2. "Suffering is not a blessing in and of itself, but, if one's duty to God is involved, then one can meet it with gladness of heart." 
3. "This is the whole point, made clear already by Jesus in Matthew 5:10-12, where Jesus has also 'falsely'."

### John Gill:
1. "This is grateful to God, and acceptable with him."
2. "For acting according to his conscience, in matters of religion, in the things of God."
3. "Endure grief... with patience, and without murmuring, and with resignation to the will of God."

### John Wesley:
1. "Conscience toward God" refers to a sincere desire to please Him, acting out of a pure motive. 

2. "Grief" in this context refers to the severe treatment or affliction one may face for their faith. 

3. The commentary highlights the importance of maintaining a clear conscience before God, even in the face of hardship and persecution.
