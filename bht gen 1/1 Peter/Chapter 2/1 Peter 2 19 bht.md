# choicest prompt v1 X bht prompt v3; ['Henry Alford', 'Jamieson Fausset Brown', 'Albert Barnes', 'Marvin Vincent', 'John Calvin', 'Philip Schaff', 'Archibald T Robertson', 'Adam Clarke']

## Henry Alford:
1. "For this is thankworthy, i.e. what recognition at God’s hand in the day when He will come, and His reward with Him? It is said of something, to do or suffer which is out of, beyond, the ordinary course of what might have been expected." 
2. "The meaning attempted by Wiesinger after Steiger, 'this is grace,' i.e. a mark of divine grace, does not suit 1 Peter 2:20, χάρις παρά, not θεοῦ, but θεῷ: and is condemned by the passage in St. Luke."
3. "The E. V. has hit the meaning very well. Cf. Calvin: 'Idem valet nomen gratiæ quod laudis. Intelligit enim nullam gratiam vel laudem conciliari nobis coram Deo, si pœnam sustinemus quam nostris delictis simus promeriti: sed qui patienter ferunt injurias, eos laude dignos esse, et opus facere Deo acceptum.'"

## Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "A course out of the common, and especially praiseworthy in the eyes of God."
2. "Conscientious regard to God, more than to men."
3. "Patiently bear up under...griefs."

## Albert Barnes:
1. "This is graceful indeed." - The expression "this is grace" emphasizes that the conduct described is acceptable and pleasing to God. It signifies that such behavior will be regarded with favor by Him.

2. "If he feels that God, by his providence, has placed him in the circumstances in which he is, and that it is a duty which he owes to him to bear every trial incident to that condition with a submissive spirit." - The commentary highlights the importance of recognizing one's circumstances as part of God's providence and responding with a submissive spirit, regardless of the hardships faced.

3. "It is acceptable to God if we bear wrong with a proper spirit, from whatever quarter it may come." - The commentary emphasizes that God values the right spirit demonstrated in enduring wrongs, regardless of the source. It underscores the significance of displaying a spirit that honors the gospel, even in the face of oppression and injustice.

## Marvin Vincent:
1. "Conscience toward God" refers to the conscious sense of one's relation to God, not just a general sense of conscientiousness. It is about being aware of our connection to God and our identity as His children.
2. Suffering patiently is not merely a result of a sense of duty, but it stems from an inner consciousness of our relationship with God and Christ. It is the understanding that we are united with Christ in both suffering and glory.
3. Our conscious sense of God's presence and our relationship with Him enables us to endure suffering and find strength in our identity as joint-heirs with Christ. It is a reminder that our suffering is not in vain but is part of a greater purpose.

## John Calvin:
1. "No grace or praise shall be found before God, if we bear the punishment which we have by our faults deserved; but they who patiently bear injuries and wrongs are worthy of praise and accepted by God."
2. "To testify that it was acceptable to God, when anyone from conscience towards God persevered in doing his duty, though unjustly and unworthily treated, was at that time very necessary."
3. "Moreover, he who considers that he has to do with God, must necessarily endeavor to overcome evil with good. For, God not only requires that we should be such to everyone as he is to us, but also that we should be good to the unworthy and to such as persecute us."

## Philip Schaff:
1. "We have to choose, therefore, between three ideas, that of gracious or attractive, that of favour, i.e securing favour with one, or that of thankworthy, as the A. V. puts it, or better, ‘acceptable,’ as the R. V. gives it in harmony with the repetition of the word in the end of 1 Peter 2:20." 
2. "Endurance, therefore, is not of itself a ‘thankworthy’ thing. In the case of any one, slave or other, it is so only if it is endurance of wrong, and only if it is animated by one’s sense of his relation to God."
3. "The motive which gives nobility to endurance is put in the foreground. By this ‘consciousness of God’ is meant neither exactly the ‘conscience toward God’ of the A. V. and R. V., nor ‘conscientiousness before God,’ far less’ the consciousness which God has of us’, but that consciousness which we have of God, which at once inspires the sense of duty and elevates the idea of duty."

## Archibald T Robertson:
1. "For this thing (neuter singular τουτο, obedience to crooked masters) is grace" - The commentary highlights that obedience to unjust masters is an act of grace, emphasizing the importance of showing gratitude in difficult situations.
2. "Suffering is not a blessing in and of itself, but, if one's duty to God is involved, then one can meet it with gladness of heart." - This quote emphasizes that suffering becomes meaningful when it is connected to one's commitment to God, encouraging believers to endure hardships with a joyful attitude.
3. "This is the whole point, made clear already by Jesus in Matthew 5:10-12, where Jesus has also 'falsely' (ψευδομενο)." - The commentary references Jesus' teachings in Matthew 5:10-12, highlighting the parallel between suffering unjustly and being falsely accused, reinforcing the idea that enduring persecution is part of the Christian experience.

## Adam Clarke:
1. "If, in a conscientious discharge of your duty, you suffer evil, this is in the sight of God thankworthy, pleasing, and proper."
2. "It shows that you prefer his authority to your own ease, peace, and emolument."
3. "It shows also... that they considered their obligation to relative duties not to depend on the character of the person to whom they were to be performed, nor on their performing the duties they owed to their servants, but on the unalterable relations of things established by God."
