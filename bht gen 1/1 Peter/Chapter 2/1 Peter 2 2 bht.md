# choicest prompt v1 X bht prompt v3; ['Henry Alford', 'Jamieson Fausset Brown', 'Albert Barnes', 'Marvin Vincent', 'John Calvin', 'Philip Schaff', 'Archibald T Robertson', 'Adam Clarke']

## Henry Alford:
1. "Lac illud animi, non corporis, lac mente hauriendum." (Translation: "That milk is to be drawn by the mind, not the body, that milk is to be drawn by the mind.") This quote emphasizes that the spiritual milk mentioned in the verse is not physical, but rather something that nourishes and benefits the soul.

2. "That is without guile, has no byends, no one purpose but to nourish and benefit the soul." This quote highlights the purity and sincerity of the spiritual milk, contrasting it with teachings that may have ulterior motives or hidden agendas.

3. "The growth is the measure of the fulness of that not only rescue from destruction, but positive blessedness, which is implied in σωτηρία." This quote explains that the growth resulting from consuming the spiritual milk leads to salvation, not just as deliverance from destruction, but also as a state of positive blessedness.

## Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "The childlike spirit is indispensable if we would enter heaven."
2. "The babe, instead of chemically analyzing, instinctively desires and feeds on the milk; so our part is not self-sufficient rationalizing and questioning, but simply receiving the truth in the love of it."
3. "The believer of himself thirsts after the word of God."
4. "The article, 'the,' implies that besides the well-known pure milk, the Gospel, there is no other pure, unadulterated doctrine; it alone can make us guileless."
5. "Growth is the measure of the fulness of that, not only rescue from destruction, but positive blessedness, which is implied in salvation."

## Albert Barnes:
1. "It is not uncommon, in the Scriptures, to compare Christians with little children."
2. "There is no doubt that there is allusion to the gospel in its purest and most simple form, as adapted to be the nutriment of the new-born soul."
3. "Piety in the heart is susceptible of growth, and is made to grow by its proper aliment, as a plant or a child is, and will grow in proportion as it has the proper kind of nutriment."

## Marvin Vincent:
1. "New-born [αρτιγεννητα]. Peculiar to Peter, and only in this passage. Lit., born but just now [αρτι]."
2. "Desire [επιποθησατε]. The compound is intensive; earnestly desire. So Rev., long for. Compare Philippians 2:26."
3. "The sincere milk of the word [το λογικον αδολον γαλα]. The A. V. has rendered logikon, of the word; but wrongly. It describes the quality of the milk as spiritual or rational, as opposed to liberal and ceremonial."

## John Calvin:
1. "That no one might think that infancy, void of understanding and full of fatuity, was commended by him, he in due time meets this objection; so he bids them to desire milk free from guile, and yet mixed with right understanding."
2. "Simplicity and quickness of understanding are two things apparently opposite; but they ought to be mixed together, lest simplicity should become insipid, and lest malicious craftiness should creep in for want of understanding."
3. "Milk is called the simpler mode of teaching, and one suitable to children, when there is no progress made beyond the first rudiments. Justly, then, does Paul charge this as a fault, as well as the author of the Epistle to the Hebrews."

## Philip Schaff:
1. "It expresses a simple fact here, the recency of the Christian life in these converts, which is marked still more emphatically by the addition of the strong adjective (nowhere else used in the N. T.) ‘new-born.’"
2. "The term ‘milk’ here does not mean the elementary doctrine which is suitable for babes in Christ in contrast with the ‘meat’ (1 Corinthians 3:3), or the ‘strong meat’ (Hebrews 5:12-14), which elsewhere is said to be for the full-grown. It is simply a figurative expression for the food which they must have, seeing that they are now in a new life."
3. "This increase will be secured, and that goal reached, only ‘thereby,’ or rather, ‘therein;’ that is, so far as the Word is made the mental food in which their new life instinctively seeks its nourishment, and made this with that great object in view."

## Archibald T Robertson:
1. "As newborn babes" - The author explains that the phrase refers to recent converts, possibly indicating that the Epistle was written before Romans by Paul.

2. "Long for" - The author notes that this is an intense yearning, emphasizing the desire for spiritual growth and nourishment.

3. "The spiritual milk which is without guile" - The author describes this as unadulterated milk, highlighting its purity and rarity. It is compared to the sincere milk of the word, either the milk which is the word or the milk contained in the word, that is Christ.

## Adam Clarke:
1. "As new-born babes — In the preceding chapter, 1 Peter 1:23, the apostle states that they had been born again; and as the new-born infant desires that aliment which nature has provided for it, so they, being born again-born from above, should as earnestly require that heavenly nourishment which is suited to their new nature." 

2. "The figure is very expressive: as a child newly born shows an immediate desire for that nourishment, and that only, which is its most proper food so they, being just born of God, should show that the incorruptible seed abides in them, and that they will receive nothing that is not suited to that new nature."

3. "That ye may grow thereby — εις σωτηριαν, Unto salvation, is added here by ABC, and about forty others; both the Syriac, the Arabic of Erpen, Coptic, AEthiopic, Armenian, Slavonic, Vulgate, and several of the ancient fathers. The reading is undoubtedly genuine, and is very important. It shows why they were regenerated, and why they were to desire the unadulterated doctrines of the Gospel; viz.: that they might grow up unto salvation."


# BHT:
As new-born babes, the believers are urged to earnestly desire the spiritual milk of the Word that nourishes their new nature. This milk, which is unadulterated and without guile, is compared to the simple and pure food that a newborn infant instinctively longs for. Just as a newborn child grows by consuming the proper nourishment, the believers are encouraged to grow unto salvation by feeding on this spiritual milk of the Word.
