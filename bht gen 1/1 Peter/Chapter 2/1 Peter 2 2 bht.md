## BHT:
The Bible verse describes the believers as newborn babes, highlighting their innocence and vulnerability. They are encouraged to desire the pure spiritual nourishment, which is likened to milk, free from deceit and impurity. Seeking this nourishment from the word of God is crucial for their growth in faith, love, and holiness, enabling them to mature spiritually and become more like Christ.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Lac illud animi, non corporis, lac mente hauriendum." (Translation: "That milk is to be drawn from the mind, not the body.")
2. "Our English is too poor in psychological distinctions to be able to express it by any appropriate adjective: 'reasonable' (vulg.) is decidedly wrong, as E. V. in Rom."
3. "The growth is the measure of the fulness of that not only rescue from destruction, but positive blessedness, which is implied in σωτηρία."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The childlike spirit is indispensable if we would enter heaven."
2. "The babe, instead of chemically analyzing, instinctively desires and feeds on the milk; so our part is not self-sufficient rationalizing and questioning, but simply receiving the truth in the love of it."
3. "The believer of himself thirsts after the word of God."
4. "The article, 'the,' implies that besides the well-known pure milk, the Gospel, there is no other pure, unadulterated doctrine; it alone can make us guileless."
5. "The word is to be desired with appetite as the cause of life, to be swallowed in the hearing, to be chewed as cud is by rumination with the understanding, and to be digested by faith."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It is not uncommon, in the Scriptures, to compare Christians with little children."
2. "There is no doubt that there is allusion to the gospel in its purest and most simple form, as adapted to be the nutriment of the new-born soul."
3. "Piety in the heart is susceptible of growth, and is made to grow by its proper aliment, as a plant or a child is, and will grow in proportion as it has the proper kind of nutriment."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "New-born [αρτιγεννητα]. Peculiar to Peter, and only in this passage. Lit., born but just now [αρτι]."
2. "The sincere milk of the word [το λογικον αδολον γαλα]. The A. V. has rendered logikon, of the word; but wrongly. It describes the quality of the milk as spiritual or rational, as opposed to liberal and ceremonial."
3. "Sincere [αδολον] is another epithet of the milk. Lit., without guile, unadulterated. Compare guile in ver. 1. Laying aside guile, desire the guileless milk, etc."

### John Calvin:
1. "That no one might think that infancy, void of understanding and full of fatuity, was commended by him, he in due time meets this objection; so he bids them to desire milk free from guile, and yet mixed with right understanding."
2. "Simplicity and quickness of understanding are two things apparently opposite; but they ought to be mixed together, lest simplicity should become insipid, and lest malicious craftiness should creep in for want of understanding."
3. "Milk is called the simpler mode of teaching, and one suitable to children, when there is no progress made beyond the first rudiments. Justly, then, does Paul charge this as a fault, as well as the author of the Epistle to the Hebrews."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The contrast is not between Christians at different stages of Christian maturity, but between these converts as once they were and as now they have just come to be."
2. "The term 'milk' here does not mean the elementary doctrine which is suitable for babes in Christ in contrast with the 'meat,' but simply a figurative expression for the food which they must have, seeing that they are now in a new life."
3. "The unflagging spiritual appetite or 'longing' which is spoken of is to be cherished with this in view as its most proper object, their own growth from strength to strength, until they reach the measure of final redemption."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "As newborn babes... like νηπιο." - The author compares the believers to newborn babies, emphasizing their innocence and vulnerability. (Quote 1)
2. "The spiritual milk which is without guile... unadulterated milk which, alas, is so hard to get." - The commentary highlights the rarity and purity of the spiritual nourishment that believers should seek. (Quote 2)
3. "That ye may grow thereby... Peter uses the word of God as the food for growth." - The commentator explains that the purpose of seeking spiritual nourishment is for believers to grow in their faith and relationship with God. (Quote 3)

### John Gill:
1. "They were as 'babes', not on account of their want of knowledge, or unskilfulness in the word of righteousness; or of nonproficiency in the learning of divine truths, and their great dulness, backwardness, and imperfection; but because of their harmlessness and innocence, meekness and humility; and for the sincerity of their faith and love, obedience and profession."
2. "By 'the sincere milk of the word' is meant the Gospel, even the whole of it, and not, as elsewhere, the more plain and easy truths of it; which is compared to milk for its purity in itself, for every word of God is pure and for its purifying nature, as used by the Spirit of God."
3. "The Gospel is appointed as a means of their spiritual growth, and by the blessing of God becomes so, and which they find to be so by good experience; and therefore this milk of the word is desirable on this account, for the increase of faith, and the furtherance of the joy of it; for their growth in grace, and in the knowledge of Jesus Christ, and in an experience of spiritual strength from him, and unto him, as their head in all things."

### John Wesley:
1. "Desire — Always, as earnestly as new born babes do, 1 Peter 1:3."
2. "The milk of the word — That word of God which nourishes the soul as milk does the body, and which is sincere, pure from all guile, so that none are deceived who cleave to it."
3. "That you may grow thereby — In faith, love, holiness, unto the full stature of Christ."
