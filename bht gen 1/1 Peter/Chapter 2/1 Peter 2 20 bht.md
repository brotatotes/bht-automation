## Henry Alford:
1. "What kind of glory is it if doing wrong and being buffeted?... When ye do wrong and are buffeted for it would express the Greek more closely." 
2. "Ye shall endure it... ye shall take it patiently." 
3. "If well-doing and suffering... for this is thankworthy with God."

## Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "What kind of glory is it that we receive when we are buffeted? It is a glory that surpasses the ordinary, a glory that is peculiar and unique." 

2. "The punishment of being buffeted is typically reserved for slaves, but when we endure it patiently, it becomes a form of glory that sets us apart." 

3. "To bear with patience the unjust treatment of being buffeted is not only acceptable, but it is also praiseworthy and deserving of thanks."

## Albert Barnes:
1. "If, when ye be buffeted for your faults - That is, if you are punished when you deserve it... if they were justly punished, and should take it patiently, there would be no credit or honor in it."
2. "The patience evinced might indeed be as great as in the other case, but there would be the feeling that you deserved all that you received, and the spirit evinced in that case could not be regarded as entitled to any particular praise."
3. "If your masters are inflicting on you only what you deserve, it would be in the highest degree shameful for you to rise up against them, and resist them, for it would be only adding to the wrong which you had already done."

## Marvin Vincent:
1. "What kind of glory" - This phrase highlights the unique and unparalleled nature of the glory being referred to in the verse. It suggests that the glory associated with suffering for Christ is of a different kind, surpassing any other form of glory.

2. "Buffeted: struck with the fist" - This description provides a vivid image of the physical abuse Jesus endured during his last sufferings. It emphasizes the brutality and humiliation he experienced, further emphasizing the depth of his sacrifice.

3. "This whole passage...bears the mark of Peter's memories" - This insight suggests that Peter, one of Jesus' closest disciples, was drawing from personal recollections when recounting this scene. It adds a layer of authenticity and intimacy to the narrative, making it more relatable and impactful for readers.

## John Calvin:
1. "Patience is certainly a sacrifice of sweet odour to him, that is, when we bear with a submissive mind our punishment."
2. "It is a small and slender praise to bear with submission a just punishment, in comparison with that of an innocent man, who willingly bears the wrongs of men, only because he fears God."
3. "They who suffer punishment for their faults, are influenced by the fear of men."

## Philip Schaff:
1. "even patient endurance, if it is the endurance of what is deserved, can bring no credit to one."
2. "The ‘well-doing’ intended here seems to be the patient, dutiful behaviour of the slave."
3. "He sets before him principles on which he is to quit himself like a Christian, abiding in his calling, principles which also were to work like solvents on the system itself, and gradually to secure its extinction without revolution."

## Archibald T Robertson:
1. "What kind of glory?" - The commentary highlights the qualitative interrogative nature of the phrase, emphasizing the unique and valuable nature of the glory being discussed.

2. "No posing as a martyr allowed here." - The commentary reminds readers that true persecution is not about seeking attention or playing the victim, but rather about genuinely facing opposition for one's faith.

3. "Christians do sometimes deserve persecution, as Jesus implied." - The commentary acknowledges that there may be times when Christians bring persecution upon themselves through their actions or behavior, echoing Jesus' teachings in Matthew 5:10-12.

4. "No 'for it' in the Greek here or in the previous sentence." - The commentary points out the absence of the phrase "for it" in the original Greek text, indicating that suffering for doing good is not necessarily the focus, but rather the act of doing good itself.

5. "This thing is thanks by the side of God." - The commentary explains that the phrase "this is acceptable with God" can be understood as an act that brings gratitude or favor from God.

## Adam Clarke:
1. "The poor Christians, and especially those who had been converted to Christianity while in a state of slavery, were often grievously abused."
