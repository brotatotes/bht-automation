# choicest prompt v1 X bht prompt v3; ['Henry Alford', 'Jamieson Fausset Brown', 'Albert Barnes', 'Marvin Vincent', 'John Calvin', 'Philip Schaff', 'Archibald T Robertson', 'Adam Clarke']

## Henry Alford:
1. "For (proof that undeserved suffering is χάρις παρὰ θεῷ, by the instance of Christ’s sufferings, which were our example) to this (state, viz. the endurance of wrongful sufferings) ye were called." 
2. "Christ also suffered for you, leaving behind for you a copy (ὑπογραμμός) that ye should follow upon His footsteps." 
3. "The ὑπογραμμός, a pattern to write or paint by: technically, ὑπογραμμοὶ παιδικοί were formulæ given by writing-masters to their pupils, containing all the letters of the alphabet."

## Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Christ is an example to servants, even as He was once in 'the form of a servant.'" 
2. "His dying for us is the highest exemplification of 'doing well.'"
3. "Christ's sufferings, while they are for an example, were also primarily sufferings 'for us,' a consideration which imposes an everlasting obligation on us to please Him."

## Albert Barnes:
1. "Such a spirit is required by the very nature of your Christian vocation; you were called into the church in order that you might evince it."
2. "The object is, to hold up the example of Christ to those who were called to suffer, and to say to them that they should bear their trials in the same spirit that he evinced in his."
3. "The apostle does not say that this was the only object for which Christ suffered, but that it was an object, and an important one."

## Marvin Vincent:
1. "Leaving [υπολιμπανων]. Only here in the New Testament."
2. "A graphic word, meaning a copy set by writing-masters for their pupils."
3. "Follow [επακολουθησητε]. Lit., follow upon. The compound verb implies close following."

## John Calvin:
1. "For even hereunto were ye called...we are called by the Lord for this end, patiently to bear wrongs." 
2. "Nothing seems more unworthy, and therefore less tolerable, than undeservedly to suffer; but when we turn our eyes to the Son of God, this bitterness is mitigated; for who would refuse to follow him going before us?" 
3. "We ought, therefore, to exercise in this respect a right judgment...Christ’s patience is what we ought to follow."

## Philip Schaff:
1. "Patient endurance of undeserved suffering should be deemed no strange thing...Painful as it was, it was involved in their Christian vocation." 
2. "The fact appeals with special force to slaves; for He Himself ‘took upon Him the form of a servant’." 
3. "The servant cannot expect to be greater than the Master. They are only called to endure as Christ endured."

## Archibald T Robertson:
1. "They were called to suffer without flinching." 
2. "The fact that Christ suffered lifts their suffering to a new plane." 
3. "Peter does not mean that Christ suffered only as an example, but he did leave us his example for our copying."

## Adam Clarke:
1. "Ye were called to a state of suffering when ye were called to be Christians; for the world cannot endure the yoke of Christ, and they that will live godly in Christ must suffer persecution; they will meet with it in one form or other."
2. "Christ also suffered for us — And left us the example of his meekness and gentleness; for when he was reviled, he reviled not again."
3. "Ye cannot expect to fare better than your master; imitate his example, and his Spirit shall comfort and sustain you."


# BHT:
Undeserved suffering is part of the Christian calling, as exemplified by Christ's suffering. Christ's sufferings serve as a pattern for believers to follow, a model to write or paint their lives by. The example of Christ's suffering not only teaches endurance, but also sets a high standard of doing good and evinces everlasting obligation to please Him. Like a servant following the example of his master, believers are called to bear trials in the same spirit as Christ, knowing that their suffering is not in vain.
