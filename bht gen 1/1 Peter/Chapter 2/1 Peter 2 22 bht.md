# choicest prompt v1 X bht prompt v3; ['Henry Alford', 'Jamieson Fausset Brown', 'Albert Barnes', 'Marvin Vincent', 'John Calvin', 'Philip Schaff', 'Archibald T Robertson', 'Adam Clarke']

## Henry Alford:
1. "He never did sin, nor yet was guile ever found in His mouth." 
2. "The words are almost a citation from Isaiah 53:9, 'He never did sin, nor yet was guile ever found in His mouth.'" 
3. "Not only did He never sin in act, but not even was guile ever found in His mouth."

## Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Never in a single instance did" [ALFORD].
2. "Sinlessness as to the mouth is a mark of perfection."
3. "On Christ's sinlessness, compare 2 Corinthians 5:21; Hebrews 7:26."

## Albert Barnes:
1. "Who did no sin - Who was in all respects perfectly holy."
2. "We should so live, as the Saviour did, as not to deserve to be punished, and thus only shall we entirely follow his example."
3. "If he suffered unjustly, we should esteem it to be no strange thing that we should; if he bore the injuries done him with meekness, we should learn that it is possible for us to do it also."

## Marvin Vincent:
1. "Found [ευρεθη]. Stronger than the simple was, and indicating a guilelessness which had stood the test of scrutiny."
2. "Christ's sinlessness had also stood the test of Peter's intimacy."
3. "Compare Matthew 26:60; John 18:38; John 19:4, John 19:6."

## John Calvin:
1. "He, at the same time, shews how far we come short of what Christ was, when he says, that there was no guile found in his mouth; for he who offends not by his tongue, says James, is a perfect man." 

2. "He then declares that there was in Christ the highest perfection of innocency, such as no one of us can dare claim for himself." 

3. "It hence appears more fully how unjustly he suffered beyond all others. There is, therefore, no reason why any one of us should refuse to suffer after his example, since no one is so conscious of having acted rightly, as not to know that he is imperfect."

## Philip Schaff:
1. "Peter's confession of that sinlessness...is the affirmation of a freedom not only from open but also from hidden sin, a sinlessness not in deed only, but also in word, and indeed in thought."
2. "The language...is peculiarly pertinent to the case of slaves with their strong temptations to practice deception."
3. "The statement is given...with the direct and positive force of simple historical tenses, which may imply...that in no instance did He ever do the wrong deed, or say the guileful word."

## Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Who did no sin" - This quote emphasizes the sinlessness of Christ, as previously mentioned in 1 Peter 1:19. It highlights the purity and righteousness of Jesus.

2. "Christ's guilelessness stood the test of scrutiny" - This quote suggests that despite being examined closely, Jesus was found to be without deceit or cunning. It highlights the integrity and honesty of Christ.

3. "Christ's guilelessness stood the test of scrutiny, as Peter knew" - This quote acknowledges Peter's personal knowledge and experience of witnessing Jesus' innocence, referencing specific instances from the Gospels (Matthew 26:60; John 18:38; John 19:4; John 19:6). It adds credibility to the claim of Jesus' sinlessness.

## Adam Clarke:
1. "Who did no sin — He suffered, but not on account of any evil he had either done or said."
2. "In deed and word he was immaculate, and yet he was exposed to suffering; expect the same, and when it comes bear it in the same spirit."
3. "It is very likely that the apostle mentions guile, because those who do wrong generally strive to screen themselves by prevarication and lies."
