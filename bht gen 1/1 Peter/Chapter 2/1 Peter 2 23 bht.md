# choicest prompt v1 X bht prompt v3; ['Henry Alford', 'Jamieson Fausset Brown', 'Albert Barnes', 'Marvin Vincent', 'John Calvin', 'Philip Schaff', 'Archibald T Robertson', 'Adam Clarke']

## Henry Alford:
1. "When reviled, reviled not again" - This shows the character of the person being discussed, who does not respond to insults with more insults. It demonstrates their patience and self-control.
2. "When suffering threatened not" - This highlights the person's ability to endure suffering without retaliating. It emphasizes their strength and resilience.
3. "Delivered up to Him that judgeth righteously" - This phrase suggests that the person being discussed entrusts their situation to God, who is the ultimate judge. It implies a belief in divine justice and a willingness to let go of personal vengeance.

## Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Threats of divine judgment against oppressors are often used by those who have no other arms, as for instance, slaves."
2. "Christ, who as Lord could have threatened with truth, never did so."
3. "Leave your case in His hands, not desiring to make Him executioner of your revenge, but rather praying for enemies."

## Albert Barnes:
1) "He did not use harsh and opprobrious words in return for those which he received."
2) "He did not revile those who had reproached him. He asked that justice might be done. He demanded that if he had spoken evil, they should bear witness of the evil; but beyond that he did not go."
3) "He did not threaten punishment. He did not call down the wrath of heaven. He did not even predict that they would be punished; he expressed no wish that they should be."

## Marvin Vincent:
1. "Reviled - again [αντελοιδορει] . Only here in the New Testament."
2. "Committed himself [παρεδιδου] . But his gives a reflexive force to the verb which has no parallel."
3. "Judgeth righteously. Compare without respect of persons, ch. 1 17."

## John Calvin:
1. "For such is our disposition, that when we receive injuries, our minds immediately boil over with revengeful feelings; but Christ abstained from every kind of retaliation." 
2. "The godly, that is, that if they patiently endured the reproaches and violence of the wicked, they would have God as their defender." 
3. "It behoves us calmly to bear evils; God in the meantime will not neglect what belongs to him, but will shew himself to be a righteous judge."

## Philip Schaff:
1. "The sentence, therefore, exhibits Christ’s example in suffering in its quality of silence and patience, as the former verse dealt with the quality of innocence."
2. "Here, as in 1 Peter 1:17, God the Father’s prerogative ‘of judgment’ is introduced. There the impartial righteousness of His judgment was a reason for a walk in godly fear. Here it is the ground of assurance for the innocent sufferer."
3. "The unnamed object, however, should naturally be supplied from the things dealt with in the immediate context. These are clearly the wrongs patiently endured by Christ."

## Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Reviled not again" - Jesus chose not to respond to the insults and verbal abuse directed at him, demonstrating remarkable self-control and humility.
2. "Threatened not" - Despite the threats and intimidation he faced, Jesus remained steadfast and did not retaliate or seek revenge.
3. "Committed himself" - Jesus entrusted himself and his cause to the Father, acknowledging that ultimate judgment and justice rest in God's hands.

## Adam Clarke:
1. "Though he could have inflicted any kind of punishment on his persecutors, yet to give us, in this respect also, an example that we should follow his steps, he committed his cause to him who is the righteous Judge."
2. "To avoid evil tempers, and the uneasiness and danger of avenging ourselves, it is a great advantage in all such cases to be able to refer our cause to God, and to be assured that the Judge of all the earth will do right."
3. "The Vulgate, one copy of the Itala, St. Cyprian, and Fulgentius, read, Tradebat autem judicanti se injuste; 'He delivered himself to him who judged unrighteously;' meaning Pontius Pilate."
