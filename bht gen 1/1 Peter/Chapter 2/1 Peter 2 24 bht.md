# 1 Peter 2:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, we see the noblest purpose of love demonstrated by Christ, who suffered innocently and willingly on the cross. He offered himself as a sacrifice, taking upon himself the guilt of our sins. Through Christ's vicarious suffering, we are inspired to endure trials for righteousness' sake. The image of Christ enduring the cross as a sin offering brings to mind the altar, emphasizing the significance of his death. By his sacrifice, we are not only set free from the power of sin but also given an example of patience and restored to life.
