# choicest prompt v1 X bht prompt v3; ['Henry Alford', 'Jamieson Fausset Brown', 'Albert Barnes', 'Marvin Vincent', 'John Calvin', 'Philip Schaff', 'Archibald T Robertson', 'Adam Clarke']

## Henry Alford:
1. "He was not only negatively innocent, but suffered in the pursuance of the noblest purpose of love, and that love towards us." 
2. "He bore our sins in His own body on the tree, taking them to the tree and offering them up on it." 
3. "By His stripe, we were healed."

## Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "His voluntary undertaking of the work of redemption is implied."
2. "In offering or presenting in sacrifice His body, Christ offered in it the guilt of our sins upon the cross, as upon the altar of God, that it might be expiated in Him, and so taken away from us."
3. "That we should die to the sins whose collected guilt Christ carried away in His death, and so LIVE TO THE RIGHTEOUSNESS, the gracious relation to God which He has brought in."

## Albert Barnes:
1. "He did it in his own proper person; he did not make expiation by offering a bloody victim, but was himself the sacrifice."
2. "He put himself in the place of sinners, and bore that which those sins deserved; that is, that he endured in his own person that which, if it had been inflicted on the sinner himself, would have been a proper expression of the divine displeasure against sin, or would have been a proper punishment for sin."
3. "The sufferings which he endured on the cross were such as if he had been guilty; that is, he was treated as he would have been if he had been a sinner."

## Marvin Vincent:
1. "Bare up to the cross, as to an altar, and offered himself thereon." 
2. "The rendering of the verb can be given only in a clumsy way, having become off unto sins; not becoming separate from sins, but having ceased to exist as regards them."
3. "Such a sight we feel sure, as we read this descriptive passage, St. Peter's eyes beheld on the body of his Master, and the flesh so dreadfully mangled made the disfigured form appear in his eyes like one single bruise."

## John Calvin:
1. "Christ by his death has given us an example of patience."
2. "By his death he restored us to life."
3. "We, being dead to sins, ought to live to righteousness."

## Philip Schaff:
1. "From Christ’s fellowship with us in suffering, and from His innocence and patience as a Sufferer, we are now led up to the crowning glory of the example which He has left of an endurance not for wrong-doing, but for well-doing."
2. "The vicariousness of His sufferings adds to His example a power and grandeur higher still than it receives from the qualities already instanced in it."
3. "The phrase ‘to the tree’ points us at once to the climax of His vicarious suffering, His death upon the Cross."

## Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Jesus is the perfect sin offering." 
2. "Here St. Peter puts the Cross in the place of the altar." 
3. "Peter's idea here is like that of Paul in Romans 6:1-23, especially verses 1 Peter 2:2; 1 Peter 2:10)."

## Adam Clarke:
1. "Bare our sins in his own body — Bore the punishment due to our sins. In no other sense could Christ bear them."
2. "To say that they were so imputed to him as if they had been his own, and that the Father beheld him as blackened with imputed sin, is monstrous, if not blasphemous."
3. "By whose stripes ye were healed. — The apostle refers here to Isaiah 53:4-6; and he still keeps the case of these persecuted servants in view, and encourages them to suffer patiently by the example of Christ."

His death on the cross is likened to an altar, emphasizing the significance of his sacrifice. The verse also alludes to the healing offered through his stripes, drawing upon the example of Christ's endurance to inspire perseverance in the face of persecution.
