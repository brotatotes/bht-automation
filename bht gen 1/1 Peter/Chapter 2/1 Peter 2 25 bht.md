3. "He gives us His spirit and feeds and guides us by His word."

## Albert Barnes:
1) "There is something very beautiful in the expression 'Bishop of souls.' It implies that the soul is the special care of the Saviour; that it is the object of his special interest; and that it is of great value - so great that it is that which mainly deserves regard."
2) "The welfare of the soul may be committed to him with confidence. It is the object of his special guardianship, and he will not be unfaithful to the trust reposed in him."
3) "As he has shown his regard for us in seeking us when we were wandering and lost, let us show our gratitude to him by resolving to wander no more. Let us commit ourselves to him as our great Shepherd, to follow where he leads us, and to be ever under his pastoral inspection."
4) "We may learn from this chapter that in committing ourselves to the Shepherd, we may be called to suffer. We may suffer in name, in feeling, in property, in our business, by our honest attachment to the principles of his gospel. But let us bear with patience all the trials of life, whether arising from poverty, an humble condition, or the reproaches of a wicked world."
5) "In our trials here, let it be our main object so to live that our sufferings shall not be on account of our own faults. Be it our first aim to have a conscience void of offence, to wrong no one, to give no occasion for reproaches and revilings, to do our duty faithfully to God and to people."

## Marvin Vincent:
1. "ye were like straying sheep" - This quote highlights the comparison between the readers and straying sheep, emphasizing their tendency to wander off from the right path.
2. "the verb and the participle together denoting habitual action or condition" - This quote explains the grammatical construction used in the verse, indicating that the readers' wandering was not a one-time occurrence but rather a habitual action or condition.
3. "ye were going astray like sheep" - This quote provides an alternative rendering of the verse, emphasizing the similarity between the readers and sheep who are prone to going astray.

## John Calvin:
1. "The meaning then is, that we are all going astray from the way of salvation, and proceeding in the way of ruin, until Christ brings us back from this wandering."
2. "For all who are not ruled by Christ, are wandering like lost sheep in the ways of error."
3. "There is then no cause to fear, but that he will faithfully watch over the safety of those who are in his fold and under his care."

## Philip Schaff:
1. "The readers are compared simply to sheep, not to wandering sheep. That is to say, they are said themselves to have been once wanderers, and in that state of estrangement from God to have been like sheep, helpless, foolish, and heedless." 

2. "He to whom they turned is Christ, who is designated both the Shepherd of their souls and the Overseer of their souls." 

3. "The use of the title 'Bishop,' or, as it simply means 'Overseer' or 'Guardian,' may be due to the fact that, like 'Shepherd,' it was a name given to the 'presidents of the churches, who were, so to speak, the representatives of the One Shepherd and Bishop, the Head of the whole Church.'"

## Archibald T Robertson:
1. "For ye were going astray like sheep" - This phrase emphasizes the state of the believers before they found Christ, highlighting their tendency to wander away and lose their way.

2. "But are now returned" - This statement signifies the transformation that has taken place in the believers' lives. They have turned back to the true Shepherd, Jesus Christ, and found their way back to Him.

3. "Unto the Shepherd and Bishop of your souls" - This description of Jesus as the Shepherd and Bishop of our souls highlights His role as the caring and guiding leader who oversees and protects our spiritual well-being. It emphasizes the intimate relationship between Christ and His followers.

## Adam Clarke:
1. "Formerly ye were not in a better moral condition than your oppressors; ye were like stray sheep, in the wilderness of ignorance and sin, till Christ, the true and merciful Shepherd, called you back from your wanderings." 

2. "Jesus Christ is the Overseer of souls; he has them continually under his eye; he knows their wants, wishes, dangers, c., and provides for them."

3. "Jesus is the good Shepherd that laid down his life for his sheep. All human souls are inexpressibly dear to him, as they are the purchase of his blood."
