2. "On the ground of such instances as Matthew 9:22; Matthew 10:13, Mark 5:30; Mark 8:33, John 12:40; John 21:20, it seems necessary to give the verb the middle sense here, although it might seem more in harmony with the context to render it 'are returned,' so as to bring out more clearly what had been done for them."

1. "For ye were going astray like sheep" - This phrase highlights the human tendency to wander away from the right path, drawing a parallel to the imagery of sheep in Isaiah 53:6 and Luke 15:4-7.

3. "Unto the Shepherd and Bishop of your souls" - Jesus is referred to as both the Shepherd and Bishop of our souls, drawing on the imagery of the Good Shepherd in John 10:11 and the concept of an overseer in Ezekiel 34:11. This highlights His role as the caring and guiding authority in our lives.

### John Gill:
1. "God's elect are sheep before conversion; not that they have the agreeable properties of sheep, as to be meek, harmless, innocent, clean, and profitable, for they are the reverse of all this; nor can some things be said of them before conversion, as may be after, as that they hear Christ's voice, and follow him; nor are they so called, because unprejudiced against, and predisposed unto the Gospel, for the contrary is true of them; but they are so in electing grace."
2. "They are lost sheep, lost in Adam, and by his fall, and by their own actual transgressions; they are as sheep going astray from the shepherd, and from the flock, going out of the right way, and in their own ways; and are, like sheep, stupid and insensible of their danger; and as they never return of themselves, until they are sought for, and brought back."
3. "Saints are passive, and not active in first conversion; they are turned, not by the power of their own free will, but by the power of God's free grace; they are returned under the illuminations and quickenings of the blessed Spirit, and through the efficacious drawings of the Father's love, unto Christ."

### John Wesley:
1. "The bishop is described as a 'kind observer' who carefully watches over and inspects the souls of others. This implies a sense of compassion and concern for the spiritual well-being of individuals."

2. "The bishop is an 'inspector' who diligently examines the lives and actions of those under their care. This suggests a role of accountability and guidance, ensuring that individuals are living in accordance with the teachings of the Bible."
