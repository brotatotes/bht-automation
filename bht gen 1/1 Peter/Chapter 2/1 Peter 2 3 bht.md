## Philip Schaff:
1. "The idea, therefore, is that if, as Peter assumed it to be the case, they had found Christ Himself to be good in their own first inward perception of what He was, they could not but hunger for that living Word of the Gospel by which they had received Him and life with Him, and make such use of it that their life should be a growing life and themselves children, dwelling in brotherly love, and advancing in meetness for the children’s inheritance."
2. "If they had once tasted this goodness, they must have the appetite, and that would keep their life from being stunted. If they had once known what the Lord Himself is, they could not but long for that Word which is His preacher, that they might have an ever-deepening experience of His goodness."
3. "The description which is now commenced of what believers are meant to be in their collective capacity as the Church of God, is continued for some time, and carried into the details of their relations to the ancient Church of God in Israel, to the world and civil society, and to various orders of life."

# BHT:
The verse being described here emphasizes the experiential knowledge of God's grace and goodness. The commentators point out how tasting God's goodness should lead to desiring and pursuing a deeper relationship with Him. It is likened to a taste that excites the appetite, urging believers to hunger for the living Word of the Gospel and grow in their understanding and love for Christ. This taste of goodness should inspire love, brotherly kindness, and gradual transformation in the life of a believer, as they long for the Word that reveals God's unfailing love and goodness.
