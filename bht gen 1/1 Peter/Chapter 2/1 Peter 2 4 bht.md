# choicest prompt v1 X bht prompt v3; ['Henry Alford', 'Jamieson Fausset Brown', 'Albert Barnes', 'Marvin Vincent', 'John Calvin', 'Philip Schaff', 'Archibald T Robertson', 'Adam Clarke']

## Henry Alford:
1. "The approach made by faith, when the Christian closely realizes the presence and seeks the communion of his Lord."
2. "Christ is the stone: we do not come to Him as we come to a stone."
3. "Chosen out, had in honour."

## Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Christ is positively termed the 'living stone'; living, as having life in Himself from the beginning, and as raised from the dead to live evermore after His rejection by men, and so the source of life to us." 
2. "Like no earthly rock, He lives and gives life." 
3. "Many are alienated from the Gospel, because it is not everywhere in favor, but is on the contrary rejected by most men. Peter answers that, though rejected by men, Christ is peculiarly the stone of salvation honored by God."

## Albert Barnes:
1. "Salvation is often represented as coming to Christ."
2. "The reference is to Christ as the foundation on which the church is reared."
3. "It was all a living temple - a temple composed of living materials - from the foundation to the top."

## Marvin Vincent:
1. "Coming [προσερχομενοι]. Indicating a close [προς] and an habitual (present participle) approach and an intimate association."
2. "A living stone [λιθον ζωντα]. The words are in apposition with whom (Christ)."
3. "Disallowed [αποδεδοκιμασμενον]. The word indicates rejection after trial. Of God [παρα θεω]. Render, as Rev., with God; i.e., God being judge."

## John Calvin:
1. "Let it then be noticed, that Peter connects an access to God with the taste of his goodness. For as the human mind necessarily dreads and shuns God, as long as it regards him as rigid and severe; so, as soon as he makes known his paternal love to the faithful, it immediately follows that they disregard all things and even forget themselves and hasten to him."
2. "In short, he only makes progress in the Gospel, who in heart comes to God."
3. "But Peter forbids us to esteem Christ the less, however despised he may be by the world, because he, notwithstanding, retains his own worth and honor before God."

## Philip Schaff:
1. "They who have tasted that He is good have an irresistible attraction to Him, and it is by giving effect to this attraction that they grow."
2. "If the Church, too, is to increase into that which God means it to be, its members must not only feed upon the Word, but come constantly to Christ Himself."
3. "The upbuilding of the Church on Christ the foundation can be made good only in so far as we, the builders, are ourselves ever coming into close personal union with the same Christ."

## Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Coming, a living stone, rejected indeed of men, but with God." - This quote highlights the contradiction between the concept of a "living stone" and the rejection of it by men. It emphasizes the divine perspective in contrast to human rejection.

2. "There is apparent an intentional contradiction between 'living' and 'stone'." - This quote points out the intentional paradox in describing Christ as a living stone, highlighting the uniqueness and divine nature of Christ.

3. "Elect, a precious stone in God's sight." - This quote emphasizes the special position and value of Christ in God's eyes, drawing from the concept of being chosen or elected, as mentioned in Isaiah 28:6.

## Adam Clarke:
1. "Jesus Christ is...represented as the foundation on which the Christian Church is built, and on which it must continue to rest." 
2. "Jesus...is the source of life to all his followers, and...it is in union with him that they live, and answer the end of their regeneration."
3. "As Christ is the choice of the Father, we need have no doubt of the efficacy and sufficiency of all that he has suffered and done for the salvation of a lost world."


# BHT:
The verse being described here is about the significance of coming to Christ, who is described as a living stone. The commentators emphasize the intimate and habitual approach to Christ, who serves as the foundation of the Christian Church. Despite being rejected by men, Christ retains his worth and honor before God, and is chosen by the Father for the salvation of the world. Through coming to Christ, believers experience communion with the Lord, find life in Him, and gain access to God's goodness, leading to growth and the upbuilding of the Church.
