# choicest prompt v1 X bht prompt v3; ['Henry Alford', 'Jamieson Fausset Brown', 'Albert Barnes', 'Marvin Vincent', 'John Calvin', 'Philip Schaff', 'Archibald T Robertson', 'Adam Clarke']

## Henry Alford:
1. "Being God’s spiritual temple, they form an holy priesthood to Him, approaching and serving before Him in virtue of that Living and Holy One, whose mystic Body they are, and in whom the Father is well pleased."
2. "No where is this more clearly declared by inference, than here."
3. "The one, once-for-all, devotion of the body, as in Romans 12:1, to God as His."

## Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Many names which belong to Christ in the singular are assigned to Christians in the plural. He is 'THE SON,' 'High Priest,' 'King,' 'Lamb'; they, 'sons,' 'priests,' 'kings,' 'sheep,' 'lambs.'" 
2. "Christians are both the spiritual temple and the priests of the temple. All believers alike, and not merely ministers, are now the dwelling of God and priests unto God."
3. "Christian houses of worship are never called temples because the temple was a place for sacrifice, which has no place in the Christian dispensation; the Christian temple is the congregation of spiritual worshippers."

## Albert Barnes:
1. "The purpose of the apostle here is to compare the church to a beautiful temple - such as the temple in Jerusalem, and to show that it is complete in all its parts, as that was."
2. "The special abode of God on the earth was now removed from that temple to the Christian church."
3. "Everyone is engaged in offering acceptable sacrifice to God. The business is not entrusted to a particular class to be known as priests; there is not a particular portion to whom the name is to be especially given; but every Christian is in fact a priest, and is engaged in offering an acceptable sacrifice to God."

## Marvin Vincent:
1. "The metaphor of a house built of living stones is violent, and sufficiently characteristic of Peter; yet it pictures, in a very striking way, the union of stability, growth, and activity in the ideal church."
2. "Note the transition from babes growing (ver. 2) to stones built up."
3. "To offer up [ανενεγκαι] . The usual Old - Testament (Septuagint) term for offering of sacrifice. Lit., to bring up to the altar."

## John Calvin:
1. "We must further observe, that he constructs one house from the whole number of the faithful... all ought to be so fitted together, that they may form one universal temple."
2. "By calling us living stones and spiritual building... he intimates a comparison between us and the ancient temple; and this serves to amplify divine grace."
3. "A holy priesthood... in order to stimulate us more effectually to serve and worship God."
4. "It ought also to add not a little to our alacrity, when we know that the worship we perform to God is pleasing to him."
5. "Nevertheless, Christ procures favor for them... in Christ he sets a value on our works, which in themselves deserve nothing."

## Philip Schaff:
1. "The imperative is to be preferred...as most consistent with the use of the similar 'be ye' in 1 Peter 1:15...The imperative, too, may be of the middle form = build yourselves up...or better, of the passive form = be ye built up...So Peter, as his wont is, charges them to do on their side what has been made both possible and a matter of duty by what has been done on God’s side." 
2. "The phrase itself may be in apposition to the subject 'ye'...or it may be rather that they are to be built up in order to make a spiritual house...the real temple of God was not the great House in Jerusalem, and that Christ’s flock, without distinction, too, of Jew and Gentile, was the true Israel, temple, and priesthood of God." 
3. "They are to be so built in order to make not only a spiritual house, but also a holy priesthood...all Christians as such, and without distinction, constitute a priestly fraternity...realizing the complete idea of a priesthood which the former college, with its limitation in numbers, and its sharp separation from the people, and its ritual service, imperfectly and distantly exhibited."

## Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Peter just carried it a bit farther and Paul uses a temple for believers in one place (1 Corinthians 3:16) and for the kingdom of God in general (Ephesians 2:22), as does the author of Hebrews (Hebrews 3:6)."

2. "Peter has the same idea of Revelation 1:6 (ιερεις, priests) that all believers are priests (Hebrews 4:16) and can approach God directly."

3. "Only these are 'spiritual' (πνευματικας) as pictured also in Hebrews 13:15."

## Adam Clarke:
1. "The Church of Christ, it is true, is represented under the figure of a house, or rather household; and as a household or family must have a place of residence, hence, by a metonymy, the house itself, or material building, is put for the household or family which occupies it, the container being put for the contained."
2. "The spiritual house is the holy or Christian family or household, this family or household is composed of the sons and daughters of God Almighty; and hence the propriety of living stones, because this is the living house or spiritual family."
3. "And as all the stones-sons and daughters, that constitute the spiritual building are made partakers of the life of Christ, consequently, they may with great propriety be called living stones, that is, sons and daughters of God, who live by Christ Jesus, because he lives in them."


# BHT:
The Bible verse being described highlights the concept of believers being part of a spiritual temple or household. The verse emphasizes the unity and completeness of the church, paralleling it with the temple in Jerusalem. Believers are described as living stones that make up this spiritual building, with each one playing a unique role. Additionally, the verse emphasizes the priesthood of all believers, where every Christian has the privilege of approaching God directly and offering their acceptable sacrifice. This imagery reflects the grace of God and the transformative power of Christ's work in the lives of believers.
