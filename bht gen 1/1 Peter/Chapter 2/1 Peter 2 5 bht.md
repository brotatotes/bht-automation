# 1 Peter 2:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Believers, united together as living stones in the spiritual temple, are called to offer up their souls and bodies, along with their thoughts, words, and actions, as spiritual sacrifices to God. This imagery of the church as a temple, complete and perfect in all its parts, emphasizes the union, growth, and activity of the ideal church. Through the powerful and efficacious grace of God, believers are separated from the rest of mankind and become acceptable and pleasing to God through the sacrifice of Jesus Christ, with whom they have direct access to God.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Being God’s spiritual temple, they form an holy priesthood to Him, approaching and serving before Him in virtue of that Living and Holy One, whose mystic Body they are, and in whom the Father is well pleased."
2. "No where is this more clearly declared by inference, than here."
3. "It is this, rather than any distinction from the O. T. sacrifices, that is pointed at in πνευματικάς."

3. "Our sacrifices are those of prayer, praise, and self-denying services in the cause of Christ."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The purpose of the apostle here is to compare the church to a beautiful temple - such as the temple in Jerusalem, and to show that it is complete in all its parts, as that was."
2. "The special abode of God on the earth was now removed from that temple to the Christian church."
3. "Everyone is engaged in offering acceptable sacrifice to God. The business is not entrusted to a particular class to be known as priests; there is not a particular portion to whom the name is to be especially given; but every Christian is in fact a priest, and is engaged in offering an acceptable sacrifice to God."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The metaphor of a house built of living stones is violent, and sufficiently characteristic of Peter; yet it pictures, in a very striking way, the union of stability, growth, and activity in the ideal church."
2. "Note the transition from babes growing (ver. 2) to stones built up."
3. "To offer up [ανενεγκαι] . The usual Old - Testament (Septuagint) term for offering of sacrifice. Lit., to bring up to the altar."

### John Calvin:
1. "We must further observe, that he constructs one house from the whole number of the faithful. For though every one of us is said to be the temple of God, yet all are united together in one, and must be joined together by mutual love, so that one temple may be made of us all."
2. "By calling us living stones and spiritual building, as he had before said that Christ is a living stone, he intimates a comparison between us and the ancient temple; and this serves to amplify divine grace."
3. "It is a singular honor, that God should not only consecrate us as a temple to himself, in which he dwells and is worshipped, but that he should also make us priests. But Peter mentions this double honor, in order to stimulate us more effectually to serve and worship God."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The imperative is to be preferred...as most consistent with the hortatory force which seems inherent in the participle 'coming'...The imperative, too, may be of the middle form = build yourselves up, or better, of the passive form = be ye built up...So Peter, as his wont is, charges them to do on their side what has been made both possible and a matter of duty by what has been done on God's side." 
2. "The phrase itself may be in apposition to the subject 'ye'...or it may express the end contemplated in the being built...It may be that they are to be built up on the Foundation in the character of, or because they are, a spiritual house; or it may be rather that they are to be built up in order to make a spiritual house."
3. "The evidence of the best authorities makes it necessary to insert the preposition 'unto,' which at first sight creates an awkward connection...It indicates a further end contemplated by the being built up in Christ...They are to be so built in order to make not only a spiritual house, but also a holy priesthood, and the spiritual house itself is to rise with a view to, or, so as also to become, the holy priesthood."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Peter just carried it a bit farther and Paul uses a temple for believers in one place (1 Corinthians 3:16) and for the kingdom of God in general (Ephesians 2:22), as does the author of Hebrews (Hebrews 3:6)."

2. "Peter has the same idea of Revelation 1:6 (ιερεις, priests) that all believers are priests (Hebrews 4:16) and can approach God directly."

3. "Only these are 'spiritual' (πνευματικας) as pictured also in Hebrews 13:15."

### John Gill:
1. "Saints likewise are compared to stones; they lie in the same quarry, and are the same by nature as the rest of mankind, till dug out and separated from thence by the powerful and efficacious grace of God."
2. "The stones which Deucalion and Pyrrha cast over their heads after the flood are called 'quickened stones', they becoming men, as the fable says."
3. "Now such are acceptable to God by Jesus Christ; through whom they are offered up; for it is through him the saints have access to God, present themselves to him, and their services; and both persons and services are only accepted in Christ, and for his sake, and in virtue of his sacrifice."

### John Wesley:
1. "Ye — Believers."
2. "Are built up — In union with each other."
3. "To offer up - Your souls and bodies, with all your thoughts, words, and actions, as spiritual sacrifices to God."
