## Philip Schaff:

2. "And this might probably be designed to show that, in Jesus, both Jews and Gentiles were to be united; and this is probably the reason why it was called a stone of stumbling, and rock of offence."
3. "He who comes to God, through Christ, for salvation, shall never be confounded; he need not haste to flee away, for no enemy shall ever be able to annoy him."


# BHT:
In this verse, the commentators explain that the foundation of the Church is built upon Christ, the chosen and precious cornerstone. The reference to Zion emphasizes the significance of Jerusalem in the preaching of the Gospel. The imagery of a cornerstone highlights the stability and coherence of the Church. By believing in Christ, one finds a firm foundation and will not be ashamed or confounded in their faith. This verse powerfully conveys the importance of Christ as the foundation for the Christian Church and the assurance and security that believers find in Him.
