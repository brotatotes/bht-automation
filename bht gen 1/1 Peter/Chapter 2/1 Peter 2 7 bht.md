# choicest prompt v1 X bht prompt v3; ['Henry Alford', 'Jamieson Fausset Brown', 'Albert Barnes', 'Marvin Vincent', 'John Calvin', 'Philip Schaff', 'Archibald T Robertson', 'Adam Clarke']

## Henry Alford:
1. "To you is the honour belonging to the Stone itself, with which you are united in the building: the honour implied in the οὐ μὴ καταισχυνθῇ said of those who believe on Him." 

2. "That the result of the οὐ μὴ καταισχυνθῇ is what the Apostle means to state, is evident by the οὖν and τοῖς πιστεύουσιν: that the form in which this is stated is ὑμῖν ἡ τιμή, is evidently owing to the occurrence of ἔντιμον above."

3. "This stumbling is not mere mental offence, which, e.g. they take at the preaching of the Cross; but the 'stumbling upon the dark mountains' of Jeremiah 13:16, the eternal disgrace and ruin which forms the contrast to τιμή above."

## Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "On the opposite effects of the same Gospel on different classes."
2. "To you believers belongs the preciousness of Christ just mentioned."
3. "Those who rejected the STONE were all the while in spite of themselves unconsciously contributing to its becoming Head of the corner."

## Albert Barnes:
1. "Christians perceive a value in him which is seen in nothing else."
2. "The Lord Jesus is in fact of more value to them than any other benefactor."
3. "We owe all our hopes of heaven to him; and in proportion to the value of such a hope, he is precious to us."

## Marvin Vincent:
1. "For you therefore which believe is the preciousness (honor)." 
2. "The preposition eijv, unto, carrying the idea of coming unto the place of honor."
3. "Lit., it would be, was made or became unto the head, etc."

## John Calvin:
1. "Christ is a precious stone in the sight of God; then he is such to the faithful. It is faith alone which reveals to us the value and excellency of Christ."
2. "Christ, though opposed by his enemies, yet continues in that dignity to which he has been appointed by the Father."
3. "Whenever then, we see those who glory in the title of prelates, rising up against Christ, let it come to our minds, that the stone is rejected by the builders, according to the prediction of David."

## Philip Schaff:
1. "The phrase ‘who believe’ is put last in the original (=for you, therefore, is the honour, for you, I say, who believe), because it is only on the ground of their faith (which is given not as a condition here, but as a fact) that the assurance is applied to them."
2. "The difficulty, however, is to catch the point of the noun which expresses the thing that thus belongs to them or is to their advantage."
3. "The sentence takes up the whole idea, which has just been expressed, of an honour in which the foundation stands with God, and what that fact carries with it to believers."

## Archibald T Robertson:
1. "The preciousness (η τιμη). Or 'the honour.'"
2. "Explanation of εντιμον and ου μη καταισχυνθη and only true 'for you which believe' (τοις πιστευουσιν ethical dative of articular present active participle of πιστευω to believe)."
3. "But for such as disbelieve (απιστουσιν δε). Dative present active participle again of απιστεω, opposite of πιστευω (Luke 24:11)."
4. "Was made the head of the corner (εγενηθη εις κεφαλην γωνιας)."
5. "This verse is from Psalms 118:22 with evident allusion to Isaiah 28:16 (κεφαλην γωνιασ=ακρογωνιαιον)."

## Adam Clarke:
1. "The honour is to you who believe; i.e. the honour of being in this building, and of having your souls saved through the blood of the Lamb, and becoming sons and daughters of God Almighty."
2. "The Jews, who continue to reject the Gospel; that very person whom they reject is head of the corner - is Lord over all, and has all power in the heavens and the earth."
3. "He is precious - the honor is to you who believe."


# BHT:
This verse speaks of the preciousness and honor of Christ to those who believe in him. As commentators explain, the honor bestowed upon believers is like a valuable stone, significant to God and recognized by faithful followers. This honor comes through faith, which enables believers to perceive the incomparable value of Christ. Yet, at the same time, this verse reminds us of those who reject Christ, unknowingly contributing to his exalted position. Ultimately, it highlights the contrast between the honor received by those who believe and the consequences faced by those who stumble in disbelief.
