### Henry Alford:

2. "It is as plainly altogether beside the purpose, with Erasm., Luth., Calv., Aret., Bengel, al., to understand ‘Christ,’ or ‘the Stone,’ as the subject, and render as E. V., 'He is precious,' making ἡ τιμή predicate instead of subject) who believe."
3. "This stumbling is not mere mental offence, which, e.g. they take at the preaching of the Cross; but the 'stumbling upon the dark mountains' of Jeremiah 13:16, the eternal disgrace and ruin which forms the contrast to τιμή above."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

2. "To you believers belongs the preciousness of Christ just mentioned."
3. "Those who rejected the STONE were all the while in spite of themselves unconsciously contributing to its becoming Head of the corner."

### Marvin Vincent:

### John Calvin:
1. "Christ is a precious stone in the sight of God; then he is such to the faithful. It is faith alone which reveals to us the value and excellency of Christ."
2. "Christ, though opposed by his enemies, yet continues in that dignity to which he has been appointed by the Father."
3. "Whenever then, we see those who glory in the title of prelates, rising up against Christ, let it come to our minds, that the stone is rejected by the builders, according to the prediction of David."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The phrase ‘who believe’ is put last in the original (=for you, therefore, is the honour, for you, I say, who believe), because it is only on the ground of their faith (which is given not as a condition here, but as a fact) that the assurance is applied to them."
2. "The difficulty, however, is to catch the point of the noun which expresses the thing that thus belongs to them or is to their advantage. Most interpreters now agree that the subject of the sentence is not Christ Himself, but what is called (in reference, that is, to the dignity expressed in the former sentence) ‘the honour,’ i.e the honour already spoken of, and that the predicate is the ‘for you.’"
3. "The reverse side of the prophetic assurance is now exhibited, and, as the omission of the article indicates, the persons are named now in a more general way, not as if definite individuals were in view, but so as to include all of a certain kind."

See Matthew 21:42; Mark 12:10; Luke 20:17, where Jesus himself quotes Psalms 118:22 and applies the rejection of the stone by the builders (ο οικοδομουντες, the experts) to the Sanhedrin's conduct toward him."

### John Gill:
1. "Unto you therefore which believe...nor all that believe a divine revelation, and that the Scriptures are the word of God, and give credit to all that is contained in the sacred oracles; or who believe the whole Gospel, and all the truths of it; as that there is one God; that there are three persons in the Godhead, Father, Son, and Spirit; that Christ is the Son of God, and truly God; that he is the Mediator between God and man; that he is the Messiah, is become incarnate, has obeyed, suffered, and died for men, and is the Saviour of them: that he rose again, ascended to heaven, is set down at the right hand of God, intercedes for his people, and will come a second time to judge the world in righteousness; together with all other truths which arise from, depend upon, and are connected with these; nor all that say they believe, or profess to do so; but such who have seen themselves lost and undone by sin, their need of a Saviour, and Christ as the only one..." 

2. "Now to these, in proof of what is asserted in the above passage out of Isaiah, Christ is precious; he is so in all his names and titles, as Immanuel, God with us, and that cluster of them in Isaiah 9:6 and particularly his name Jesus, a Saviour, which is as ointment poured forth, and draws the love of believers to him; and so he is in both his natures, divine and human; the perfections of deity in him, his being in the form of God, and equal to him, the brightness of his Father's glory, and the express image of his person, render him very amiable in the view of believers; who rightly conclude from hence, that all he has done, and does, must answer the purposes for which they are designed; and his having a perfect human nature, like to theirs, excepting sin, in which he wrought salvation for them on earth, and is now glorified in heaven, makes him a delightful object to them..."

3. "His sacrifice is precious, of a sweet smelling savour to them, as well as to God; by which their sins are fully expiated, put, and taken away; full satisfaction being made for them, and they themselves thereby perfected for ever. And so he is in his prophetic office. His word is precious, and all the truths of the Gospel, which are comparable to gold, silver, and precious stones; the promises of it are exceeding great and precious, being suited to the cases of all believers: and he is also precious in his kingly office; his commands are not grievous; his yoke is easy, and burden light; believers love his commandments above gold, yea; above fine gold, and esteem his precepts concerning all things to be right, and delight in his ways and ordinances..."
