## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "τῷ λόγῳ belongs to ἀπειθοῦντες, not as E. V. after vulg., Erasm., Luth., Beza, Estius, al., to προσκόπτουσιν, which is doubly objectionable, in, 1. making ἀπειθοῦντες a mere tautology from ἀπειθοῦσιν before: 2. giving a place not prominent enough to τῷ λόγῳ, whereas on the other rendering it takes its proper place, as being the means of growth to the Christian, and rejected by the disobedient."
2. "Qui impingunt, nempe, in lapidem illum angularem, verbo non credentes (obedientes?): quo ipso et offensio ipsa et ejus causa indicatur."
3. "for which (thing, fact, viz. the προσκόπτειν, τῷ λόγῳ ἀπειθοῦσιν, their whole moral course of delinquency and the πρόσκομμα at the end of it) they were also (καί, besides that they reach it, there is another consideration) appointed (set where they are, or were; viz. by Him who τίθησιν, above, the stone of stumbling."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Not merely they stumbled, in that their prejudices were offended but their stumbling implies the judicial punishment of their reception of Messiah; they hurt themselves in stumbling over the corner-stone." 

2. "God appoints the ungodly to be given up unto sin, and a reprobate mind, and its necessary penalty." 

3. "God ordains the wicked to punishment, not to crime."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The rejection of the Saviour becomes the means of their ruin. They refuse to build on him, and it is as if one should run against a solid projecting cornerstone of a house, that would certainly be the means of their destruction."
2. "It is not a matter of indifference whether they believe on him or not - whether they accept or reject him. They cannot reject him without the most fearful consequences to their souls."
3. "Their stumbling and falling was not a matter of chance, or a result which was not contemplated, but entered into the original arrangement; and the whole, therefore, might be said to be in accordance with a wise plan and purpose."

### John Calvin:
1. "This the Jews did; for though they professed themselves willing to receive the Messiah, yet they furiously rejected him when presented to them by God."
2. "Here Peter intimates that all who receive not Christ as revealed in the Gospel, are adversaries to God, and resist his word."
3. "In short, his proper office is to prepare us for a spiritual temple to God; but it is the fault of men that they stumble at him, even because unbelief leads men to contend with God."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "What is said there of Jehovah of hosts, namely, that, while He is a sanctuary to those who sanctify Him, he will be a ‘Stone for sinking against, and a rock of stumbling’ to the mass of the faithless people of both kingdoms, is here affirmed of Christ." 
2. "The terms, too, denote not what the disbelieving feel Christ to be (so Luther, etc.), or the offence which they take at Him, but what He in point of fact must prove objectively to them."
3. "The Divine demonstration of Christ as made the very thing which they refused to admit in Him, itself puts the disbelieving to the shame against which the believing are declared to be secured."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "To the disbelieving, Christ was indeed 'a stone of stumbling and rock of offense,' quoted also by Paul in Romans 9:32, which see for discussion." 
2. "Προσκομμα is an obstacle against which one strikes by accident, while σκανδαλον is a trap set to trip one, but both make one fall."
3. "Their disobedience is not ordained, the penalty of their disobedience is."

### John Gill:
1. "The unbelieving and disobedient Jews stumbled at his birth and parentage, at the manner of his birth, being born of a virgin, and at the meanness of his parents, his supposed father being a carpenter, and his mother, Mary, a poor woman."
2. "They stumbled at his outward meanness and poverty when they expected the Messiah would be a rich, powerful, and glorious monarch."
3. "They stumbled at his ministry, at the doctrine he preached, particularly at the doctrine of his divinity, and of spiritual communion with him, by eating his flesh and drinking his blood."

These quotes highlight the reasons why the Jews stumbled at Jesus and his teachings, including his birth, social status, and the radical nature of his ministry.

### John Wesley:
1. "They who believe not, stumble, and fall, and perish for ever."
2. "God having appointed from all eternity, 'he that believeth not shall be damned.'"
3. "Those who stumble and fall are appointed to their own destruction."
