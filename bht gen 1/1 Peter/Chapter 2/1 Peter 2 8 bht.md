# choicest prompt v1 X bht prompt v3; ['Henry Alford', 'Jamieson Fausset Brown', 'Albert Barnes', 'Marvin Vincent', 'John Calvin', 'Philip Schaff', 'Archibald T Robertson', 'Adam Clarke']

## Henry Alford:
1. "ἀπειθοῦντες, which is doubly objectionable, in, 1. making ἀπειθοῦντες a mere tautology from ἀπειθοῦσιν before: 2. giving a place not prominent enough to τῷ λόγῳ, whereas on the other rendering it takes its proper place, as being the means of growth to the Christian, and rejected by the disobedient." 
2. "Qui impingunt, nempe, in lapidem illum angularem, verbo non credentes (obedientes?): quo ipso et offensio ipsa et ejus causa indicatur." 
3. "for which (thing, fact, viz. the προσκόπτειν, τῷ λόγῳ ἀπειθοῦσιν, their whole moral course of delinquency and the πρόσκομμα at the end of it) they were also (καί, besides that they reach it, there is another consideration) appointed (set where they are, or were; viz. by Him who τίθησιν, above, the stone of stumbling."

## Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Not merely they stumbled, in that their prejudices were offended but their stumbling implies the judicial punishment of their reception of Messiah."
2. "God appoints the ungodly to be given up unto sin, and a reprobate mind, and its necessary penalty."
3. "God ordains the wicked to punishment, not to crime."

## Albert Barnes:
1. "The rejection of the Saviour becomes the means of their ruin. They refuse to build on him, and it is as if one should run against a solid projecting cornerstone of a house, that would certainly be the means of their destruction."
2. "An idea similar to this occurs in Matthew 21:44; 'Whosoever shall fall on this stone shall be broken.' The meaning is, that if this foundation-stone is not the means of their salvation, it will be of their ruin."
3. "The reason why they reject him is, that they are not disposed to obey. They are solemnly commanded to believe the gospel; and a refusal to do it, therefore, is as really an act of disobedience as to break any other command of God."

## John Calvin:
1. "This the Jews did; for though they professed themselves willing to receive the Messiah, yet they furiously rejected him when presented to them by God."
2. "Here Peter intimates that all who receive not Christ as revealed in the Gospel, are adversaries to God, and resist his word."
3. "In short, his proper office is to prepare us for a spiritual temple to God; but it is the fault of men that they stumble at him, even because unbelief leads men to contend with God."

## Philip Schaff:
1. "The terms, too, denote not what the disbelieving feel Christ to be...but what He in point of fact must prove objectively to them."
2. "Christ is what He is declared to be to a certain class, when or because they disobey the Word."
3. "The precise thing to which the disobedient are said to be ordained...is to which stumbling, etc."

## Archibald T Robertson:
1. "To the disbelieving, Christ was indeed 'a stone of stumbling and rock of offense,' quoted also by Paul in Romans 9:32, which see for discussion." 

2. "Προσκομμα (from προσκοπτω, to cut against) is an obstacle against which one strikes by accident, while σκανδαλον is a trap set to trip one, but both make one fall."

3. "Their disobedience is not ordained, the penalty of their disobedience is" (Bigg).

## Adam Clarke:
1. "Because in him all Jews and Gentiles who believe are united; and because the latter were admitted into the Church, and called by the Gospel to enjoy the same privileges which the Jews, as the peculiar people of God, had enjoyed for two thousand years before; therefore they rejected the Christian religion, they would have no partakers with themselves in the salvation of God." 

2. "The disobedient stumble against the word, (or doctrine,) to which verily they were appointed." 

3. "This stumbling and offence, particularly of the Jews, against Christ, the corner stone, was long ago asserted and predicted by the prophets, by Christ, and by others."


# BHT:
In this verse, the rejection of Christ becomes the means of ruin for those who refuse to build upon him. Described as a stone of stumbling and a rock of offense, the disobedient resist the word of God and stumble against the teachings of Christ. Foreseen by the prophets and affirmed by Christ himself, this stumbling and offense against the cornerstone is ordained as the penalty for their disobedience. Both Jews and Gentiles who believe are called to partake in the salvation of God, but the rejection of this call results in their downfall.
