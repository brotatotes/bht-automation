## Henry Alford:
1. "You are a chosen generation, a kingly priesthood, an holy nation, a people for acquisition." 
2. "That you may tell out the virtues of Him who called you out of darkness to His wonderful light."
3. "The expression is from the LXX of Exodus 19:6. In the N.T. church these two elements, the kingship and the priesthood, are united in every individual believer, as in our great Head, Jesus Christ, who alone unites them in the O.T. church."

## Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Believers, like Christ, the antitypical Melchisedec, are at once kings and priests."
2. "They have no reason to magnify themselves above others for once they had been in the same darkness, and only through God's grace had been brought to the light which they must henceforth show forth to others."
3. "Reason, without the Holy Spirit, in spite of its vaunted power, is spiritual darkness."

## Albert Barnes:
1. "The people of God are often represented as his chosen or elected people."
2. "They 'at once bore the dignity of kings, and the sanctity of priests.'"
3. "They are a people which he has secured as a possession, or as his own; a people, therefore, which belong to him, and to no other."
4. "It was that they might proclaim the glory of God, and keep up the remembrance of His wondrous deeds in the earth."
5. "The contrast was as great as that between midnight and noonday."

## Marvin Vincent:
1. "Race emphasizes the idea of descent; nation, of community."
2. "Laov, people, occurring very often in the Septuagint, is used there mostly of the Israelites, the chosen people."
3. "The word occurs 1 Thessalonians 5:9, rendered obtaining (Rev.); Ephesians 1:14, God 's own possession (Rev.)."

## John Calvin:
1. "He calls them a chosen race, because God, passing by others, adopted them as it were in a special manner."
2. "Though, then, the fathers had something like to what you have; yet ye far excel them."
3. "And the sum of what he says is, that God has favored us with these immense benefits and constantly manifests them, that his glory might by us be made known."

## Philip Schaff:
1. "They exhibit the Christian life, therefore, in antithesis to a life rooted in mere nature and nationality."
2. "They recall at the same time the fact that these scattered sojourners are, according to the New Testament standard, that very Church of God which national Israel was meant to be according to the Old Testament standard."
3. "The import of the title as applied by Peter depends on the question whether he uses it in the proper sense of the Greek terms, or in the sense of the original Hebrew as inexactly rendered by the LXX."

## Archibald T Robertson:
1. "An elect race... The blood relation of the spiritual Israel through the new birth." 
2. "A royal priesthood... We are all priests." 
3. "A holy nation... Applied to the spiritual Israel of believers."

## Adam Clarke:
1. "The titles formerly given to the whole Jewish Church...are here given to Christians in general in the same way." 
2. "They were called to this state of salvation out of darkness - idolatry, superstition, and ungodliness, into his marvellous light - the Gospel dispensation."
3. "And they had these privileges that they might show forth the praises of Him who had thus called them; the virtues, those perfections of the wisdom, justice, truth, and goodness of God, that shone most illustriously in the Christian dispensation."


# BHT:
In this Bible verse, believers are described as a chosen generation, a kingly priesthood, and a holy nation. They are united in both kingship and priesthood, just like Jesus Christ. As the elect race, they are the spiritual Israel and the Church of God. They have been called out of darkness and into the marvelous light of salvation. Their purpose is to proclaim the glory of God and display the virtues of His wisdom, justice, truth, and goodness that shine in the Christian faith.
