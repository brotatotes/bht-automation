# 1 Peter 2:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Bible verse describes believers as a chosen and blessed people, a special race set apart by God. They are not only kings and priests, but also a holy nation, separated from the darkness of the world to shine the light of God's glory. Their new identity in Christ is rooted in God's election and encompasses spiritual blessings, holiness, and a purpose to declare God's virtues to the world. By God's grace, believers are called out of darkness into the marvelous light of Christ.
