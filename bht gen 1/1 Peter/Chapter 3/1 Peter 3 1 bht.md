# choicest prompt v1 X bht prompt v3; ['Henry Alford', 'Jamieson Fausset Brown', 'Albert Barnes', 'Marvin Vincent', 'John Calvin', 'Philip Schaff', 'Archibald T Robertson', 'Adam Clarke']

## Henry Alford:
1. "Wives, in subjection to your own husbands, that even if any are disobedient to the word, they shall be won without word." 
2. "Converted to faith and obedience: made a gain for Christian love, and for Christ Himself."
3. "Without the wives preaching to them, or exhorting them, but simply by your Christian behaviour."

## Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Feeling the need of leaning on one stronger than herself, the wife (especially if joined to an unbeliever) might be tempted, though only spiritually, to enter into that relation with another in which she ought to stand to 'her own spouse.'"
2. "Even if you have a husband that obeys not the word (that is, is an unbeliever), without the wordâ€”independently of hearing the word preached, the usual way of faith coming."
3. "Unspoken acting is more powerful than unperformed speaking."

## Albert Barnes:
1. "If any wives have husbands who are not true Christians...there might be hope still that they would be converted by the Christian influence of a wife at home."
2. "They also may without the word be won...by another influence than preaching."
3. "The habitual deportment of the wife was to be such as to show the reality and power of religion; to show that it had such influence on her temper, her words, her whole deportment, as to demonstrate that it was from God."

## Marvin Vincent:
1. "Peter means in like manner with servants."
2. "The same word which is used of the submission of servants."
3. "The word used by Christ, Matthew 18:15: 'gained thy brother.'"

## John Calvin:
1. "He expressly reminds them of their duty and brings forward a particular reason why they ought the more carefully to obey, even that they might by their probity allure their husbands to the faith."
2. "But it may seem strange that Peter should say that a husband might be gained to the Lord without the word; for why is it said, that 'faith cometh by hearing?' To this I reply, that Peter's words are not to be so understood as though a holy life alone could lead the unbelieving to Christ, but that it softens and pacifies their minds, so that they might have less dislike to religion."
3. "Then Peter shows that wives by a holy and pious life could do so much as to prepare their husbands, without speaking to them on religion, to embrace the faith of Christ."

## Philip Schaff:
1. "The fact that in the decadence of the language the adjective lost much of its original force, makes it doubtful how much emphasis can be allowed it here. It may point, however, to the nature of the marriage relation, the legal claims, the peculiar and exclusive union which it involved, as furnishing a reason for submission."
2. "The case supposed is expressed as an exceptional and trying one."
3. "The possibility of such victories of patience should encourage the wife to a wifely submission which might be hard to natural inclination."

## Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Wives are not enjoined to be in subjection to the husbands of other women, as some think it fine to be (affinities!)" - This quote highlights the specificity of the instruction for wives to submit to their own husbands, emphasizing the importance of the marital relationship.

2. "Even if any obey not the word, that is, remain heathen." - This quote acknowledges the possibility that some husbands may not be believers, indicating that the instruction still applies in such situations.

3. "Won by pious living, not by nagging. Many a wife has had this blessed victory of grace." - This quote emphasizes the power of a wife's behavior and character in influencing her husband's faith, suggesting that a gentle and virtuous approach is more effective than confrontation or criticism.

## Adam Clarke:
1. "Consider that your husband is, by God's appointment, the head and ruler of the house; do not, therefore, attempt to usurp his government." 
2. "For even though he obey not the word-is not a believer in the Christian doctrine, his rule is not thereby impaired; for Christianity never alters civil relations." 
3. "Your affectionate, obedient conduct will be the most likely means of convincing him of the truth of the doctrine which you have received."


# BHT:
In this verse, wives are urged to submit to their own husbands, even if their husbands are unbelievers. The commentators emphasize that a wife's godly conduct and virtuous behavior have the power to influence her husband's faith more than preaching or confrontation. By living out their faith in a submissive and respectful manner, wives have the potential to win over their husbands without the need for words or direct persuasion. The verse also highlights the specific relationship between a wife and her own husband, emphasizing the importance of this marital bond in the context of submission.
