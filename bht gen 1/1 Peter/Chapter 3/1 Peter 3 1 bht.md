### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

3. "Unspoken acting is more powerful than unperformed speaking."

### Albert Barnes:

2. "They also may without the word be won...by another influence than preaching."

2. "But it may seem strange that Peter should say, that a husband might be gained to the Lord without the word; for why is it said, that 'faith cometh by hearing?' To this I reply, that Peter’s words are not to be so understood as though a holy life alone could lead the unbelieving to Christ, but that it softens and pacifies their minds, so that they might have less dislike to religion."
3. "Then Peter shews that wives by a holy and pious life could do so much as to prepare their husbands, without speaking to them on religion, to embrace the faith of Christ."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The fact that in the decadence of the language the adjective lost much of its original force, makes it doubtful how much emphasis can be allowed it here. It may point, however, to the nature of the marriage relation, the legal claims, the peculiar and exclusive union which it involved, as furnishing a reason for submission."
2. "The case supposed is expressed as an exceptional and trying one."
3. "The possibility of such victories of patience should encourage the wife to a wifely submission which might be hard to natural inclination."

2. "By the agreeable conversation of professors, and so of religious wives, the hearts of such as were averse to Christianity, and the Gospel, as unbelieving husbands, may be so softened, and wrought upon, as to entertain a better opinion of it, and in process of time be inclined to hear and attend it."
