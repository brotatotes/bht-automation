# choicest prompt v1 X bht prompt v3; ['Henry Alford', 'Jamieson Fausset Brown', 'Albert Barnes', 'Marvin Vincent', 'John Calvin', 'Philip Schaff', 'Archibald T Robertson', 'Adam Clarke']

## Henry Alford:
1. "The blessings promised in the Psalm as necessarily refer to the present."
2. "He that loves life and wishes to continue to do so."
3. "Let him refrain his tongue from evil, and lips, that they never speak deceit."

## Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "He who loves life (present and eternal), and desires to continue to do so, not involving himself in troubles which will make this life a burden, and cause him to forfeit eternal life." 
2. "Men commonly think that they would be exposed to the wantonness of their enemies if they did not strenuously vindicate their rights. But the Spirit promises a life of blessedness to none but those who are gentle and patient of evils." 
3. "First he warns against sins of the tongue, evil-speaking, and deceitful, double-tongued speaking; next, against acts of injury to one's neighbor."

## Albert Barnes:
1. "Good days" are prosperous days; happy days; days of usefulness; days in which we may be respected and loved.
2. To refrain the tongue from evil, is to avoid all slander, falsehood; "obscenity, and profaneness, and to abstain from uttering erroneous and false opinions.
3. The words should be an exact representation of the truth.

## Marvin Vincent:
1. "Will love" refers to the act of desiring or intending to love, rather than simply a future tense of love. It emphasizes the intention and choice behind the action of loving.

2. The phrase "he that desires or means to love" highlights the active and intentional nature of love. It implies that love is not just a passive feeling, but a deliberate decision and commitment.

3. The use of "would love" suggests that love is not just a fleeting emotion, but a continuous and ongoing choice. It implies a willingness and readiness to love, regardless of circumstances or obstacles.

## John Calvin:
1. "The Spirit of God promises a happy life to none except to the meek, and those who endure evils."
2. "We cannot be happy except God prospers our ways; and it is the good and the benevolent, and not the cruel and inhuman, that he will favor."
3. "The way of obtaining this blessing is to conduct ourselves justly and harmlessly towards all."

## Philip Schaff:
1. "The opening words, which in the original are in the form of a question, are given as a direct statement. Instead of ‘what man is he that desireth life and loveth many days,’ according to our A. V., or, as the Greek Version renders it, ‘who is the man who desires life, loving good days,’ Peter puts it thus: ‘he who desires to love life, and to see good days.’ The transposition of the word ‘love,’ along with the adoption of the ‘good’ for the ‘many,’ gives a new turn to the statement, the effect of which is to make the prominent thing not the number of the days or the length of life, but the kind of life." 

2. "The phrase ‘love life’ means more than ‘to be fain to have life,’ or ‘to show love for life’ (de Wette), or even ‘to be in earnest as to the love of life’ (Wiesinger). It is to be taken in the simple sense of loving life for its good as opposed to hating it for its emptiness and vexations (Lillie), in the slightly modified sense of cherishing life, or in the secondary sense (which the verb has also in the Classics) of being pleased with life."

3. "Turning the second persons of the Hebrew and the Septuagint into third persons, Peter adopts the conditions on which the Psalmist suspends the boon of a life of such good and gladness. There is a climax in these conditions. They rise from the negative idea of making an end of all evil-speaking, to the stronger but still negative idea of turning away from evil-doing, thence to the positive idea of doing good, and finally to the sedulous pursuit of peace."

## Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Wishing to love life." - This phrase emphasizes the desire for a fulfilling and meaningful life.
2. "Let him refrain his lips from speaking guile." - This quote highlights the importance of honesty and integrity in speech.
3. "Purpose clause with genitive article του (negative μη) and the first aorist active infinitive of λαλεω." - This explanation provides grammatical insight into the purpose of refraining from deceitful speech.

## Adam Clarke:
1. "He who wishes to live long and prosperously, must act as he is here directed."
2. "He must refrain from evil-speaking, lying, and slandering."
3. "He must avoid flattery and fair speeches, which cover hypocritical or wicked intentions."
4. "He must avoid evil, keep going away from evil."
5. "He must do good, he must walk in the way of righteousness."
