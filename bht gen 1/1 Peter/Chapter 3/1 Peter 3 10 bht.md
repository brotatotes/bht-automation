### Henry Alford:
1. "The blessings promised in the Psalm as necessarily refer to the present."
2. "He that loves life and wishes to continue to do so."
3. "The word itself, like the English one 'refrain,' implies a natural tendency towards that from which the abstention is to take place."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Good days" are prosperous days; happy days; days of usefulness; days in which we may be respected and loved.

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Will love" emphasizes the act of desiring or intending to love, rather than simply a future tense of love. It highlights the intention and choice behind the action of loving.

2. The phrase "he that desires or means to love" suggests that love is not just a feeling, but a deliberate decision and commitment. It implies that love requires an active choice and intentionality.

3. The use of "will" in this context implies that love is not passive, but something that requires effort and determination. It suggests that love is an action that one must actively pursue and engage in.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The opening words, which in the original are in the form of a question, are given as a direct statement... The effect of which is to make the prominent thing not the number of the days or the length of life, but the kind of life." 
2. "The phrase 'love life' means more than 'to be fain to have life,' or 'to show love for life'... It is to be taken in the simple sense of loving life for its good as opposed to hating it for its emptiness and vexations."
3. "There is a climax in these conditions. They rise from the negative idea of making an end of all evil-speaking, to the stronger but still negative idea of turning away from evil-doing, thence to the positive idea of doing good, and finally to the sedulous pursuit of peace."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Wishing to love life." This present life. (γαρ)
