(Note: The commentary does not provide any additional quotes that meet the requirements.)

## Marvin Vincent:
1. "Eschew, from the Norman eschever, to shun or avoid, reappears in the German scheuen, to be startled or afraid, and in the English shy, and to shy (as a horse)." 
2. "The Greek word here occurs only twice elsewhere (Romans 3:12; Romans 16:17), where Rev. renders turn aside and turn away." 
3. "The picture in the word is of one bending aside from his course at the approach of evil."

## John Calvin:
1. "It is not enough to embrace [peace] when offered to us, but it ought to be followed when it seems to flee from us." 

2. "When we seek peace as much as we can, others will not grant it to us." 

3. "On account of these difficulties and hindrances, he bids us to seek and pursue it."

## Philip Schaff:
1. "The ‘eschew’ of the A. V. (comp. Shakespeare’s ‘What cannot be eschewed, must be embraced,’ Mer. Wives, v. 5, 251), connected with the old French eschever, German scheuen, English shy, means to shun, and sufficiently expresses the idea, which is that of turning away from something which comes in one’s way." 
2. "This blamelessness and kindliness of life, at once in word and in deed, should take the still more definite form of a determination to secure peace."
3. "Those who suffer from slander or other kinds of wrong are not to imagine themselves exempt from these great laws of Christian duty. All the more are they called to guard against every form of evil, to resist the inclination to take their case into their own hand."

## Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Let him turn away" - The imperative form of the verb emphasizes the urgency and importance of this action. It is a call for immediate action, indicating that one should not delay in turning away from evil or sinful behavior.

2. "Peter adapted the passage" - Peter took the original passage and applied it to his own context, showing the relevance and timeless nature of the message. This highlights the dynamic nature of Scripture, as it can be interpreted and applied in different ways by different individuals.

3. "If men only did!" - This phrase expresses a sense of lament or frustration, suggesting that it is unfortunate that people do not actively pursue peace. It implies that if more individuals were committed to seeking peace, the world would be a better place. This serves as a reminder of the importance of actively pursuing peace in our own lives and relationships.


# BHT:
Let him turn away from evil and do good. Let him seek peace, and pursue it. Eschew evil and actively avoid it, embracing a life of blamelessness and kindness. Turn away from the things that hinder your path and actively pursue the peace that seems to evade you. The urgency and importance of this call to action is emphasized, as we are encouraged to not delay in turning away from evil and actively seeking peace.
