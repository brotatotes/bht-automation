# choicest prompt v1 X bht prompt v3; ['Henry Alford', 'Jamieson Fausset Brown', 'Albert Barnes', 'Marvin Vincent', 'John Calvin', 'Philip Schaff', 'Archibald T Robertson', 'Adam Clarke']

## Henry Alford:
1. "The eyes of the Lord are upon righteous men...and His ears unto their supplication." 
2. "The face of the Lord is upon men doing evil things." 
3. "Because the eyes of the Lord are directed in a favorable sense for good."

## Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "The Lord's eyes are ever over them for good."
2. "The eyes imply favorable regard."
3. "The face of the Lord upon them that do evil, implies that He narrowly observes them, so as not to let them really and lastingly hurt His people."

## Albert Barnes:
1. "For the eyes of the Lord are over the righteous - That is, he is their Protector. His eyes are indeed on all people, but the language here is that which describes continual guardianship and care."
2. "And his ears are open unto their prayers - He hears their prayers. As he is a hearer of prayer, they are at liberty to go to him at all times, and to pour out their desires before him."
3. "But the face of the Lord is against them that do evil - The Lord sets his face against them: an expression denoting disapprobation, and a determination to punish them. His face is not mild and benignant toward them, as it is toward the righteous."

## John Calvin:
1. "It ought to be a consolation to us, sufficient to mitigate all evils, that we are looked upon by the Lord, so that he will bring us help in due time."
2. "Thus in vain we shall be taught patience, except our minds are first imbued with this truth, that God exercises such care over us, that he will in due time succor us."
3. "When he says, that the ears of the Lord are open to our prayers, he encourages us to pray."
4. "The more righteous any one is, and the greater lover of peace he is, the more he is harassed by the wicked. To this I reply, that no one is so attentive to righteousness and peace, but that he sometimes sins in this respect."
5. "The promises as to this life do not extend further than as to what is expedient for us to be fulfilled. Hence, our peace with the world is often disturbed, that our flesh may be subdued, in order that we may serve God, and also for other reasons; so that nothing may be a loss to us."

## Philip Schaff:
1. "This blameless, patient, beneficent, and peaceable manner of life, which has been recommended as containing the secret of all gladness in one’s life, and all goodness in one’s days, is further urged on the ground of God’s observant interest in our life."
2. "He keeps the righteous ever within the loving vision of His eye and gracious hearing of His ear. It cannot, therefore, but go well with them, however they be tried by slander or persecution."
3. "The different meaning which God’s sleepless observance must have to the evil is left as self-understood, and obtains thereby an intenser force. It is enough for the righteous to know that God’s eye is upon the evil, and the knowledge of this adds to their own sense of security in the midst of enemies."

## Archibald T Robertson:
1. "In the case of righteous for their good, but in the case of men 'that do evil' the face of the Lord is not for their good." 
2. "The face of the Lord is not for their good, επ here approaching 'against' in idea." 
3. "The face of the Lord is not turned towards those who do evil, but rather against them."

## Adam Clarke:
1. "The eyes of the Lord are over the righteous... He is continually under God's notice and his care... under his constant protection."
2. "The righteous man ever attracts the Divine notice... wherever he is, there is the ear of God."
3. "But the face of the Lord... his approbation, his providence and blessing, are turned away from them... he only looks upon them to abhor them, and to turn the arm of his justice against them."


# BHT:
The Bible verse emphasizes the close and watchful attention of the Lord towards the righteous. They are under His constant care and protection, and their prayers are heard. On the other hand, those who do evil are observed by God in a different sense; His face is turned away from them, signifying disapproval and a determination to punish. The verse highlights the comfort of being under God's watchful eyes and the consequences of wickedness in His sight.
