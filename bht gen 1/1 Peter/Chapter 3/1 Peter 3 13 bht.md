## Henry Alford:
1. "God takes such care for the righteous, and that the result of that care will be a life worthy to be loved, and good days."
2. "Your μακαριότης will be such as to turn off all their malice and make even suffering itself to be happiness."
3. "If it be that which is good, of which you are zealous? Thus the contrast between κακώσων and τοῦ ἀγαθοῦ is stronger."

## Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "This fearless confidence in God's protection from harm, Christ, the Head, in His sufferings realized; so His members." 
2. "If ye have become followers, emulous, zealous of good." 
3. "Who will do you evil, if ye be zealous of good?"

## Albert Barnes:
1. "The idea is, that God would in general protect them, though the next verse shows that the apostle did not mean to teach that there would be absolute security, for it is implied there that they might be called to suffer for righteousness' sake."
2. "While it is true that good people have often suffered persecution, though laboring only to do good, still it is true as a general thing that a life of integrity and benevolence conduces to safety, even in a wicked world."
3. "A man of a holy and pure life may, under the protection of God, rely on that character to carry him safely through the world and to bring him at last to an honored grave."

## Marvin Vincent:
1. "Followers [μιμηται]. Lit., imitators." - This quote highlights the original meaning of the word "followers" in the verse, emphasizing the idea of imitation or emulation.

2. "But the best texts read zhlwtai, zealots." - This quote introduces an alternative reading of the word, suggesting that the followers can also be understood as zealous individuals.

3. "So Rev., zealous." - This quote indicates that the Revised Version translates the word as "zealous," further supporting the interpretation of the followers as passionate and enthusiastic individuals.

## John Calvin:
1. "For it happens for the most part, that the ungodly disturb us, or are provoked by us, or that we do not labor to do them good as it behoves us; for they who seek to do good, do even soften minds which are otherwise hard as iron."
2. "However, though this commonly happens, yet it is not always the case; for the children of God, how much soever they may strive to pacify the ungodly by kindness, and show themselves kind towards all, are yet often assailed undeservedly by many."
3. "Injustice causes seditions and hatreds and fightings one with another; but justice, concord and friendship."

## Philip Schaff:
1. "The counsels of 1 Peter 3:8-9 are yet again enforced by a still more pointed statement of the security of the righteous."
2. "God’s supervision of the evil as well as of the good being the guarantee that no real harm can be inflicted by the former on the latter."
3. "However ungenerously dealt with, they shall yet sustain no real hurt; they shall still be in God’s safe keeping, and the blessedness of the new life within them will make them superior to the malice and enmity of men."

## Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Any real hurt, either that wishes to harm you or that can harm." 
2. "If ye become" 
3. "Zealots for the good"

## Adam Clarke:
1. "All the devices which the devil or wicked men work against such must be brought to naught, and by the providence of his goodness be dispersed."
2. "If ye be imitators of the good One, i.e. of God."
