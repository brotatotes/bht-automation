# choicest prompt v1 X bht prompt v3; ['Henry Alford', 'Jamieson Fausset Brown', 'Albert Barnes', 'Marvin Vincent', 'John Calvin', 'Philip Schaff', 'Archibald T Robertson', 'Adam Clarke']

## Henry Alford:
1. "The opt. after εἰ usually takes place when 'illa quae ponitur conditio, non revocatur ad veritatem, sed fingitur tantummodo cogitatione.'" (Klotz, Devar. ii. p. 491)
2. "διὰ δικ. = ἕνεκεν δικαιοσύνης in our Lord’s saying Matthew 5:10, and ἕνεκεν ἐμοῦ, Mat 5:11), blessed are ye." (Beng.)
3. "But be not afraid with their terror nor be troubled." (Isa 8:12-13)

## Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "The promises of this life extend only so far as it is expedient for us that they should be fulfilled" - Calvin
2. "Not the suffering, but the cause for which one suffers, makes the martyr" - Augustine
3. "Not even can suffering take away your blessedness, but rather promotes it"

## Albert Barnes:
1. "Happy are ye - Perhaps alluding to what the Saviour says in Matthew 5:10; 'Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness' sake.'"
2. "The meaning here is, not that they would find positive enjoyment in persecution on account of righteousness, but that they were to regard it as a blessed condition; that is, as a condition that might be favorable to salvation."
3. "If we are true Christians, we have really no reason to be alarmed in view of anything that can happen to us. God is our protector, and he is abundantly able to vanquish all our foes; to uphold us in all our trials; to conduct us through the valley of death, and to bring us to heaven."

## Marvin Vincent:
1. "Blessed" - This term is further explained in Matthew 5:3, indicating that it carries a deeper meaning than mere happiness or good fortune.

2. "Be troubled" - The Greek word used here, "ταραχθητε," is associated with significant events such as Herod's trouble, the agitation of the pool of Bethesda, and even Christ's troubled spirit. This suggests that the blessing being referred to is not a superficial or temporary state, but rather a profound and transformative experience.

3. "The word used of Herod's trouble, of the agitation of the pool of Bethesda, of Christ's troubled spirit" - These examples highlight the intensity and significance of the word "troubled." It implies a disruption or disturbance that can lead to a deeper understanding or change. Therefore, the blessing being described in the verse is not about avoiding trouble but rather finding meaning and growth through it.

## John Calvin:
1. "The faithful will do more towards obtaining a quiet life by kindness, than by violence and promptitude in taking revenge."
2. "The best remedy for checking the turbulent emotions of our minds will be, to conquer immoderate terrors by trusting in the aid of God."
3. "If this conviction takes full possession of our minds, that the help promised by the Lord is sufficient for us, we shall be well fortified to repel all the fears of unbelief."

## Philip Schaff:
1. "The case supposed is also differently expressed. It is not that of having evil done to one, but simply that of having to suffer; and, therefore, it is nothing inconsistent with the fact asserted so confidently in the previous interrogation."
2. "Their blessedness will not be affected by the former, but will make them contribute to that sanctified life within, where blessedness finds its shrine."
3. "The contrast then will be between the alarms and disquietudes which the ills of life excite in those who have no faith in God, and the perfect peace in which those should be kept 'whose mind is stayed on God.'"

## Archibald T Robertson:
1. "But if ye should also (or even) suffer." - This verse highlights the possibility of believers experiencing suffering for their faith, emphasizing the potential reality of persecution.
2. "Do not fear their threats." - This quote reminds believers not to be afraid of the intimidation and threats of those who oppose them, drawing from the words of Isaiah 8:12.
3. "Neither be troubled." - This phrase encourages believers not to be disturbed or unsettled by the challenges and difficulties they may face, echoing the sentiment expressed in 1 Peter 3:6.

## Adam Clarke:
1. "God may permit you to be tried and persecuted for righteousness' sake, but this cannot essentially harm you; he will press even this into your service, and make it work for your good."
2. "It is a happiness to suffer for Christ and it is a happiness, because if a man were not holy and righteous the world would not persecute him, so he is happy in the very cause of his sufferings."
3. "Fear not their gods, they can do you no hurt; and supposing that they curse you by them, yet be not troubled; 'He who fears God need have no other fear.'"
