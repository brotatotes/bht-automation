## Henry Alford:
1. "Care only for this, that your heart may be a temple of Christ, in which becoming honour may be given to Him as Lord; then will nothing further disturb you: you have in Him all that you can need."
2. "But so far from being afraid of men, be ever ready to give them a gentle and reverent answer when they enquire of your hope."
3. "Then must ye not answer with proud words and bring out the matter with a defiance and with violence as if ye would tear up trees, but with such fear and lowliness as if ye stood before God’s tribunal."

## Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Sanctify Christ as Lord." - The commentary emphasizes the importance of honoring and hallowing Christ in our hearts, recognizing Him as the dwelling place of God's Spirit.

2. "Be ready always to give... an apologetic answer defending your faith." - The commentary highlights the need for believers to be prepared to provide a reasonable account and defense of their faith when questioned by others.

3. "Be ready, but with 'meekness.' Not pertly and arrogantly." - The commentary emphasizes the importance of responding with humility and gentleness when giving a reason for our hope, rather than being arrogant or confrontational.

4. "Fear - due respect towards man, and reverence towards God." - The commentary reminds believers to approach discussions about their faith with a sense of respect for others and a reverence for God, recognizing that His cause does not require hot-tempered arguments to uphold it.

## Albert Barnes:
1. "In your hearts, or in the affections of the soul, regard the Lord God as holy, and act toward him with that confidence which a proper respect for one so great and so holy demands."
2. "The sentiment of the passage then is, that the sanctifying of the Lord God in our hearts, or proper confidence in him as a holy and righteous God, will deliver us from fear."
3. "A Christian should have such intelligent views of the truth of his religion, and such constant evidence in his own heart and life that he is a child of God, as to be able at any time to satisfy a candid inquirer that the Bible is a revelation from heaven, and that it is proper for him to cherish the hope of salvation."

## Marvin Vincent:
1. "Render, therefore, as Rev., sanctify Christ (the Christ) as Lord." 
2. "Answer is our word apology, not in the popular sense of excuse, but in the more radical sense of defence."
3. "Meekness. See on Matthew 5:5."

## John Calvin:
1. "He requires such constancy in the faithful, as boldly to give a reason for their faith to their adversaries."
2. "We ought to be prompt in avowing our faith, so as to set it forth whenever necessary, lest the unbelieving through our silence should condemn the religion we follow."
3. "Peter, however, as it has been said, does not require them to know how to discuss distinctly and refinedly every article of the faith, but only to show that their faith in Christ was consistent with genuine piety."

## Philip Schaff:
1. "The fear of man is to be displaced by the fear of Christ, and of Him as our true Lord."
2. "One way in which this sanctifying of Christ as Lord will express itself is in meeting fairly and frankly the difficulties and questionings of others."
3. "The fit persons are defined as embracing not indeed all and sundry, but all who ask ‘an account’ of this hope, all who demand to know what can be said on the subject of a hope in One risen from the dead, which so manifestly makes new men of those whom it inspires."

## Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Sanctify... This instead of being afraid." 
2. "Being ready always... To give answer... A reason concerning the hope that is in you." 
3. "Ready with a spoken defence of the inward hope."

## Adam Clarke:
1. "Entertain just notions of God; of his nature, power, will, justice, goodness, and truth."
2. "Consider that he can neither be like man, feel like man, nor act like man."
3. "Consider the goodness of his nature; for goodness, in every possible state of perfection and infinitude, belongs to him."

These quotes emphasize the importance of having a correct understanding of God's nature and attributes, recognizing that He is beyond human limitations and possesses infinite goodness.
