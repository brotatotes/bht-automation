# choicest prompt v1 X bht prompt v3; ['Henry Alford', 'Jamieson Fausset Brown', 'Albert Barnes', 'Marvin Vincent', 'John Calvin', 'Philip Schaff', 'Archibald T Robertson', 'Adam Clarke']

## Henry Alford:
1. "quia parum auctoritatis habet sermo absque vita, ideo fidei professioni bonam conscientiam adjungit." - Calv. (because a sermon without life has little authority, therefore it adds a good conscience to the profession of faith)
2. "ἐπηρεασμός: ἔστιν ὁ ἐπηρεασμὸς ἐμποδισμὸς ταῖς βουλήσεσιν, οὐχ ἵνα τι αὑτῷ, ἀλλ ʼ ἵνα μὴ ἐκείνῳ." - Aristotle, Rhet. ii. 2 (traduce means envious detraction, hindering the intentions of others, not for one's own benefit, but to harm others)
3. "as Christians, your whole life being in Christ, as its element" (referring to behavior in life being in Christ)

## Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Having a good conscience—the secret spring of readiness to give account of our hope."
2. "Profession without practice has no weight."
3. "It is your good walk as Christians, not as citizens, that calls forth malice."

## Albert Barnes:
1. "Whatever you suffer, see that you do not suffer the pangs inflicted by a guilty conscience, the anguish of remorse."
2. "A 'good conscience' implies two things: (1) That it be properly enlightened to know what is right and wrong, and (2) That its dictates must always be obeyed."
3. "No one can over-estimate the importance of having a good conscience. A true Christian should aim, by incessant study and prayer, to know what is right, and then always do it, no matter what may be the consequences."

## Marvin Vincent:
1. "Conscience is, essentially, determining of the self-consciousness by the spirit as the essential principle of life. In conscience man stands face to face with himself."
2. "Conscience does not only offer itself to show us the way we should walk in, but it likewise carries its own authority with it, that it is our natural guide, the guide assigned us by the Author of our nature."
3. "The conscience, in short, is a different faculty of the mind from the mere understanding. We must hold it to be simple and unresolvable till we fall in with a successful decomposition of it into its elements."

## John Calvin:
1. "Unless our minds are endued with meekness, contentions will immediately break forth."
2. "Meekness is set in opposition to pride and vain ostentation, and also to excessive zeal."
3. "The integrity of conscience alone is that which gives us confidence in speaking as we ought."

## Philip Schaff:
1. "The term conscience seems to make a nearer approach in this passage than in the previous...to the modern philosophical definitions of it as the ‘principle of reflection in men by which they distinguish between, approve and disapprove, their own actions’."
2. "The moral quality of a man’s actions is attested to him, according to the Old Testament, by the heart, specially as that is aided and enlightened by the revelation of God’s law...In the New Testament it is by a light within the man, or by this inner witness, termed conscience in the Epistles."
3. "It is essential that it be given not only in meekness and fear, but in the calm, clear strength of a mind conscious of nothing in the walk to give the lie to the apology."

## Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Having a good conscience" - This phrase suggests that maintaining a clear conscience is important for believers. It implies that one's actions should align with their moral values and principles.

2. "That they may be put to shame" - This highlights the potential outcome for those who speak against believers. It suggests that their negative actions and words may ultimately lead to their own embarrassment or disgrace.

3. "In Christ" - This phrase emphasizes the believer's identity and connection with Christ. It suggests that their actions and attitudes should reflect their union with Him, and that their conduct should be influenced by His teachings and example.

## Adam Clarke:
1. "Having a good conscience - The testimony of God in your own soul, that in simplicity and godly sincerity you have your conversation in the world."
2. "Whereas they speak evil of you."
3. "See the same sentiment in 1 Peter 2:11, and the note there."


# BHT:
In this Bible verse, the importance of maintaining a good conscience is emphasized. It suggests that believers should live with integrity and sincerity, allowing their actions to be guided by their faith. The verse also acknowledges the reality that some people may speak ill of believers. However, the focus remains on the believers' commitment to walking in a manner that is pleasing to God. Lastly, it refers to a similar sentiment found in 1 Peter 2:11, suggesting a consistent theme across biblical texts.
