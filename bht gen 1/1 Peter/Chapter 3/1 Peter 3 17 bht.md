## Albert Barnes:
1. "God often sees it to be necessary that his people should suffer. There are effects to be accomplished by affliction which can be secured in no other way; and some of the happiest results on the soul of a Christian, some of the brightest traits of character, are the effect of trials."
2. "No man can promote his own highest good by doing wrong, and then enduring the penalty which his sin incurs; and no one should do wrong with any expectation that it may be overruled for his own good."

2. "There is a sufficient defense in a good conscience, whatever evils may happen, and must be endured." 
3. "If we suffer unjustly, it is not by chance, but according to the divine will; and he assumes, that God wills nothing or appoints nothing but for the best reason."

## Philip Schaff:
1. "For it is better to suffer, if the will of God should will it, doing well than doing evil." - This verse emphasizes the importance of choosing righteousness even in the face of suffering, as it is preferable and of greater advantage to align oneself with God's will.
