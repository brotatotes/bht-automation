# choicest prompt v1 X bht prompt v3; ['Henry Alford', 'Jamieson Fausset Brown', 'Albert Barnes', 'Marvin Vincent', 'John Calvin', 'Philip Schaff', 'Archibald T Robertson', 'Adam Clarke']

## Henry Alford:
1. "Christ also suffered for sins...that suffering was undertaken on our behalf, and that blessedness is our salvation."
2. "He, the sinless One, suffered for sins; as a sacrifice for sin, as a sinner, made sin for us, dying the death of a criminal."
3. "He suffered once: His sufferings are summed up and passed away: He shall suffer no more."

## Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Christ—the Anointed Holy One of God; the Holy suffered for sins, the Just for the unjust." 
2. "He brings us, 'the unjust,' justified together with Him into heaven. So the result of Christ's death is His drawing men to Him; spiritually now, in our having access into the Holiest, opened by Christ's ascension; literally hereafter." 
3. "Two ways of explaining 1 Peter 3:18; 1 Peter 3:19, are open to us: (1) 'Quickened in Spirit,' that is, immediately on His release from the 'flesh,' the energy of His undying spirit-life was 'quickened' by God the Father, into new modes of action, namely, 'in the Spirit He went down and heralded to the spirits in prison.'"

## Albert Barnes:
1. "The design of the apostle in the reference to the sufferings of Christ, is evidently to remind them that he suffered as an innocent being, and not for any wrong-doing, and to encourage and comfort them in their sufferings by his example."
2. "The fact that the Son of God loved people, and gave himself a sacrifice for them, enduring such bitter sorrows, is the most powerful appeal which can be made to mankind to induce them to return to God."
3. "The purposes of the atonement required that he should meet death in the usual form; that the great laws which operate everywhere else in regard to dissolution, should exist in his case; nor is there in the Scriptures any intimation that there was, in this respect, anything special in his case."

## Marvin Vincent:
1. "The just for the unjust. But the Greek without the article is more graphic: just for unjust."
2. "In the flesh. The Greek omits the article. Read in flesh, the material form assumed in his incarnation."
3. "In the spirit. Also without the article, in spirit; not as A. V., by the Spirit, meaning the Holy Ghost, but referring to his spiritual, incorporeal life."

## John Calvin:
1. "It is another comfort, that if in our afflictions we are conscious of having done well, we suffer according to the example of Christ; and it hence follows that we are blessed."
2. "He teaches us that Christ suffered in order to bring us to God. What does this mean, except that we have been thus consecrated to God by Christ’s death, that we may live and die to him?"
3. "The death of Christ had a blessed issue; for though he suffered through the weakness of the flesh, he yet rose again through the power of the Spirit."

## Philip Schaff:
1. "Christ’s suffering or dying is represented to have taken place on account of sin, in the matter of sin, or in respect of sin; for the preposition used here has this general sense."
2. "Christ’s suffering or dying is also described as that of ‘a righteous One for unrighteous ones.’ A different preposition is now used for the ‘for,’ one meaning in behalf of or, to the advantage of."
3. "The particular good which Christ set before Him as the object of His suffering or dying was the bringing us to God; by which is meant introducing us to God, giving us admission, or the right of direct access, to God."

## Archibald T Robertson:
1. "The example of Christ should stir us to patient endurance." 
2. "This is what gives Christ's blood value. He has no sin himself. Some men today fail to perceive this point." 
3. "The spirit of Christ did not die when his flesh did, but 'was endued with new and greater powers of life'."

3. "But quickened by the Spirit...": This phrase speaks to the resurrection of Christ, highlighting the power of his divinity to bring life back into his dead body.
