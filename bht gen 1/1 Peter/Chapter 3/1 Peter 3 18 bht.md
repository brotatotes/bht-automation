## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Christ also suffered for sins...as a proof of the blessedness and advantage of suffering for well-doing."
2. "He, the sinless One, suffered for sins; as a sacrifice for sin, as a sinner, made sin for us, dying the death of a criminal."
3. "He might bring us near to God, put to death indeed in the flesh, but made alive in the spirit."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

2. "It is 'better' for us also once to suffer with Christ, than forever without Christ."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The design of the apostle in the reference to the sufferings of Christ, is evidently to remind them that he suffered as an innocent being, and not for any wrong-doing, and to encourage and comfort them in their sufferings by his example."
2. "The particular point here, however, is not that he once suffered; it is that he had in fact suffered, and that in doing it he had left an example for them to follow."
3. "The fact that the Son of God loved people, and gave himself a sacrifice for them, enduring such bitter sorrows, is the most powerful appeal which can be made to mankind to induce them to return to God."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The just for the unjust. But the Greek without the article is more graphic: just for unjust."
2. "In the flesh. The Greek omits the article. Read in flesh, the material form assumed in his incarnation."

1. "It is another comfort, that if in our afflictions we are conscious of having done well, we suffer according to the example of Christ; and it hence follows that we are blessed."

3. "Now this is a great thing, that we are made conformable to the Son of God, when we suffer without cause; but there is added another consolation, that the death of Christ had a blessed issue; for though he suffered through the weakness of the flesh, he yet rose again through the power of the Spirit."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Christ’s suffering or dying is represented to have taken place on account of sin, in the matter of sin, or in respect of sin; for the preposition used here has this general sense."
