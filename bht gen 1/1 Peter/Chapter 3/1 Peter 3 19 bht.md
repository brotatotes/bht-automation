# choicest prompt v1 X bht prompt v3; ['Henry Alford', 'Jamieson Fausset Brown', 'Albert Barnes', 'Marvin Vincent', 'John Calvin', 'Philip Schaff', 'Archibald T Robertson', 'Adam Clarke']

## Henry Alford:
1. "in which (viz. πνεύματι, in the spirit, according to which His new life was." 
2. "He also went and preached (πορευθείς of a local transference here, just as below in 1 Peter 3:22, πορευθεὶς εἰς οὐρανόν: and ἐκήρυξεν of a preaching good news, nearly = εὐηγγελίσατο, as in all other places of the N. T.)"
3. "to the spirits in prison (the disembodied spirits, which were kept shut up (Jude 1:6; 2Pe 2:4) in the place of the departed awaiting the final judgment: in Scheol, as Syr.)"

## Albert Barnes:
1. "The same 'Spirit' which was efficacious in restoring him to life, after he was put to death, was that by which he preached to the spirits in prison."
2. "It is implied in the expression, as already remarked, that he did this himself; that it was the Son of God who subsequently became incarnate, and not the Holy Spirit, that did this."
3. "The simple idea is that of persons confined as in a prison; and the passage will prove only that in the time when the apostle wrote there were those who were thus confined."

## Marvin Vincent:
1. "In which [spiritual form of life], the disembodied spirit, he went and proclaimed the Gospel." 
2. "The word 'went' is used here in its usual sense of a personal act, and 'preached' refers to proclaiming the Gospel." 
3. "The term 'spirits' refers to disembodied spirits, as seen in Hebrews 12:23, although 'souls' is used in other passages."

## John Calvin:
1. "He then says, that Christ did not rise only for himself, but that he made known to others the same power of his Spirit, so that it penetrated to the dead. It hence follows, that we shall not less feel it in vivifying whatever is mortal in us."
2. "Peter expressly mentioned the Spirit, that he might take away the notion of what may be called a real presence."
3. "I therefore have no doubt but Peter speaks generally, that the manifestation of Christ’s grace was made to godly spirits, and that they were thus endued with the vital power of the Spirit."

## Philip Schaff:
1. "The sense is, ‘in which,’ i.e in the spiritual form of life which has just been noticed."
2. "The verb ‘preached’ is used absolutely here...in the sense which it elsewhere has in the New Testament, where it occurs, both with the object expressed and with the object unexpressed of Christ’s earthly ministry of preaching, which was a message of grace."
3. "The word ‘spirits’ is used here, as in Hebrews 12:23, in the sense of disembodied spirits."

## Archibald T Robertson:
1. "It is a slim hope for those who neglect or reject Christ in this life to gamble with a possible second chance after death which rests on very precarious exegesis of a most difficult passage in Peter's Epistle."
2. "The language is plain enough except that it does not make it clear whether Jesus did the preaching to spirits in prison at the time or to people whose spirits are now in prison, the point of doubt already discussed."
3. "The metaphorical use of εν φυλακη can be illustrated by 2 Peter 2:4; Judges 1:6; Revelation 20:7 (the final abode of the lost)."

## Adam Clarke:
1. "He went and preached...unto the spirits in prison" - The inhabitants of the antediluvian world, who were sentenced to destruction for their disobedience, were given a respite of 120 years to repent. During this time, they were like prisoners awaiting their punishment, with Divine justice holding them under arrest. (Quote 1)

2. "The word πνευμασι, spirits, is supposed to render this view of the subject improbable...but this certainly does not follow" - The objection that the word "spirits" implies disembodied spirits is unfounded. In other passages, the term "spirits" refers to righteous men still in the Church militant, and to men in the body. (Quote 2)

3. "In my old MS. Bible...the clause is the following: In whiche thing and to hem that weren closid togyder in prison, hi commynge in Spirit, prechide" - This translation from an ancient English Bible supports the interpretation that Christ preached to those who were "shut up" in prison, rather than going to hell to preach to the damned or to a place where the souls of the patriarchs were detained. (Quote 3)


# BHT:
In this Bible verse, Christ's powerful spirit, which brought Him back to life, is the same spirit through which He proclaimed the Gospel to the spirits in prison. While some commentators debate who these spirits were, it is clear that Christ's message reached those who were awaiting judgment. It is believed that these spirits could refer to the sinful pre-flood generation or souls in a metaphorical prison. Regardless, Christ's proclamation demonstrates His ability to bring life to all, even those in the darkest places.
