# choicest prompt v1 X bht prompt v3; ['Henry Alford', 'Jamieson Fausset Brown', 'Albert Barnes', 'Marvin Vincent', 'John Calvin', 'Philip Schaff', 'Archibald T Robertson', 'Adam Clarke']

## Henry Alford:
1. "Your chaste behaviour...modest and pure." 
2. "Conducted, led, maintained, in a spirit of reverence to your husbands." 
3. "The connexion of words is τὴν ἐν φόβῳ | ἁγνὴν ἀναστροφήν."

## Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Behold—on narrowly looking into it, literally, 'having closely observed.'" 
2. "Chaste—pure, spotless, free from all impurity." 
3. "Fear—reverential, towards your husbands. Scrupulously pure, as opposed to the noisy, ambitious character of worldly women."

## Albert Barnes:
1. "The word chaste here refers to purity of conduct in all respects, and not merely to chastity properly so called."
2. "The conduct of the wife is to be in all respects pure; and this is to be the grand instrumentality in the conversion of her husband."
3. "The trait of character which is referred to is that of proper respect and reverence in all the relations which she sustained, as opposed to a trifling and frivolous mind."

## Marvin Vincent:
1. "While they behold" - This phrase refers to the idea that others are watching and observing the behavior of believers. It implies that our actions should be a testimony to our faith and should reflect the character of Christ.

2. "Conversation" - In this context, the word "conversation" means behavior or conduct. It emphasizes that our actions and how we live our lives should align with the teachings of the Bible and the example set by Jesus.

3. "Coupled with fear" - This phrase highlights the importance of living in reverence and awe of God. It suggests that our behavior should be motivated by a deep respect for God and a desire to honor Him in all that we do.

## John Calvin:
1. "For minds, however alienated from the true faith, are subdued, when they see the good conduct of believers." 
2. "They understood not the doctrine of Christ, they form an estimate of it by our life."
3. "They will commend Christianity, which teaches purity and fear."

## Philip Schaff:
1. "The behaviour is styled chaste, not in the limited sense of the English adjective, but as covering purity, modesty, and whatever makes wifely conduct not only correct but winsome."
2. "What is meant is not exactly 'the fear of God,' but rather a sensitive respect for the husband and the married relation, the chastity or purity of behaviour is exhibited as associated necessarily with the dutiful spirit that recoils from everything inconsistent with the woman’s and the wife’s position."
3. "Nothing could better express what is meant by this 'fear,' therefore, than Leighton’s well-known description of it as 'a delicate and timorous grace, afraid of the least air or shadow of anything that hath but a resemblance of wronging it, in courage, or speech, or apparel.'"

## Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Beholding (εποπτευσαντες). First aorist active participle of εποπτευω, for which see 1 Peter 2:12." 
2. "See 1 Peter 2:12 also for αναστροφην manner of life)." 
3. "Chaste (αγνην). Pure because 'in fear' (εν φοβω), no word in the Greek for 'coupled,' fear of God, though in Ephesians 5:33 fear (reverence for) of the husband is urged."

## Adam Clarke:
1. "Chaste conversation - with fear." - This phrase emphasizes the importance of combining modesty, chastity, and pure manners with the fear of God. It highlights the need for believers to live in a way that reflects their reverence for God and their commitment to living a morally upright life.

2. "Join modesty, chastity, and the purest manners." - This quote emphasizes the need for believers to integrate these virtues into their daily lives. It encourages them to cultivate a lifestyle that is marked by modesty, sexual purity, and honorable behavior, serving as a testimony to their faith and commitment to God.

3. "Fear...is taken...for the reverence due to the husband." - This interpretation suggests that the fear mentioned in the verse could also refer to the reverence and respect that wives should have for their husbands. It highlights the importance of honoring the marital relationship and recognizing the husband's role as the head of the household.
