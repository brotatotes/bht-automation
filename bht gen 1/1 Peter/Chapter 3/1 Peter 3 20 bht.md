## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The water is in the Apostle’s view the medium of saving, inasmuch as it bore up the ark."

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Noah's days are selected, as the ark and the destroying flood answer respectively to 'baptism' and the coming destruction of unbelievers by fire."
2. "A long period of God's 'long-suffering and waiting,' as Noah had few to help him, which rendered the world's unbelief the more inexcusable."
3. "The same water which drowned the unbelieving, buoyed up the ark in which the eight were saved."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The meaning here is, that they did not obey the command of God when he called them to repentance by the preaching of Noah."
2. "God waited on that guilty race for 120 years, a period sufficiently protracted to evince his long-suffering toward one generation."

### John Calvin:
1. "Let us, however, see why it is that he mentions only the unbelieving; for he seems to say, that Christ in spirit appeared to those who formerly were unbelieving; but I understand him otherwise, that then the true servants of God were mixed together with the unbelieving, and were almost hidden on account of their number."
2. "He then comforted the godly, lest they should be cast down and destroyed because they were so few; and he chose an example the most remarkable in antiquity, even that of the world drowned by the deluge; for then in the common ruin of mankind, the family of Noah alone escaped."
3. "This ought to be applied to the ungodly, whom God’s patience rendered more slothful; for when God deferred his vengeance and did not immediately execute it, the ungodly boldly disregarded all threatenings; but Noah, on the contrary, being warned by God, had the deluge for a long time before his eyes. Hence his assiduity in building the ark; for being terrified by God’s judgment, he shook off all torpidity."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The 'disobedient' means here again, as in 1 Peter 2:7-8, 1 Peter 3:1, disbelieving, refusing belief and withstanding truth." 
2. "The 'waiting' is given in the imperfect tense to bring out its lengthened continuance. It is expressed, too, by a verb for which Paul has a particular fondness, and which conveys the idea of the intenseness or patience of the waiting." 
3. "The mention of the precise number saved serves to throw into still stronger light both the disobedience to which the long-suffering of God addressed itself, and the grace that failed not to separate the believing few."

### Archibald T Robertson:
