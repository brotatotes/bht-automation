# choicest prompt v1 X bht prompt v3; ['Henry Alford', 'Jamieson Fausset Brown', 'Albert Barnes', 'Marvin Vincent', 'John Calvin', 'Philip Schaff', 'Archibald T Robertson', 'Adam Clarke']

## Henry Alford:
1. "The water is in the Apostle’s view the medium of saving, inasmuch as it bore up the ark."
2. "The fact merely is stated. The statement of the fact, however, has been felt to be accompanied by such great difficulties."
3. "It is not purgatory, it is not universal restitution; but it is one which throws blessed light on one of the darkest enigmas of the divine justice."

## Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "This refutes ALFORD'S idea of a second day of grace having been given in Hades."
2. "A long period of God's 'long-suffering and waiting,' as Noah had few to help him, which rendered the world's unbelief the more inexcusable."
3. "The same water which drowned the unbelieving, buoyed up the ark in which the eight were saved."

## Albert Barnes:
1. "The language here does not imply that they had ceased to be disobedient, or that they had become obedient at the time when the apostle wrote; but the object is to direct the attention to a former race of people characterized by disobedience, and to show the patience evinced under their provocations, in endeavoring to do them good."
2. "God waited on that guilty race for 120 years, a period sufficiently protracted to evince his long-suffering toward one generation."
3. "The allusion to their being saved here seems to be to encourage those whom Peter addressed to perseverance and fidelity, in the midst of all the opposition which they might experience. Noah was not disheartened. Sustained by the Spirit of Christ - the presence of the Son of God - he continued to preach."

## Marvin Vincent:
1. "A pregnant construction; into which they were gathered, and in which they were saved."
2. "By water. Some take this as instrumental, by means of water; others as local, by passing through the water."
3. "Rev., in margin, were brought safely through water."

## John Calvin:
1. "Christ, even when dead, punished them."
2. "The power of the Spirit of Christ shewed itself to be vivifying in him."
3. "The godly ought not to be terrified by their vast number; for though Noah was surrounded on every side by the ungodly, and had very few as his friends, he was not yet drawn aside from the right course of his faith."

## Philip Schaff:
1. "The 'disobedient' means here again, as in 1 Peter 2:7-8, 1 Peter 3:1, disbelieving, refusing belief and withstanding truth." 
2. "The 'waiting' is given in the imperfect tense to bring out its lengthened continuance. It is expressed, too, by a verb for which Paul has a particular fondness, and which conveys the idea of the intenseness or patience of the waiting." 
3. "The mention of the precise number saved serves to throw into still stronger light both the disobedience to which the long-suffering of God addressed itself, and the grace that failed not to separate the believing few."

## Archibald T Robertson:
1. "These spirits now in prison once upon a time were disobedient." - The spirits referred to were rebellious and disobedient in the past, emphasizing their current state of imprisonment.

2. "Waited out to the end, as for Christ's Second Coming." - The spirits patiently waited for the fulfillment of God's promises, just as believers today eagerly await the return of Christ.

3. "They came through the water in the ark and so were saved by the water in spite of the flood around them." - Peter highlights the significance of water as the means through which Noah and his family were saved, emphasizing the power of God's deliverance even in the midst of destruction.

## Adam Clarke:
1. "There were ten generations from Adam to Noah, that the long-suffering of God might appear; for each of these generations provoked him to anger, and went on in their iniquity, till at last the deluge came."
2. "While the ark was preparing, only Noah's family believed; these amounted to eight persons; and these only were saved from the deluge διυοατος, on the water: all the rest perished in the water."
3. "Though many of them, while the rains descended, and the waters daily increased, did undoubtedly humble themselves before God, call for mercy, and receive it; but as they had not repented at the preaching of Noah, and the ark was now closed, and the fountains of the great deep broken up, they lost their lives, though God might have extended mercy to their souls."


# BHT:
In this verse, the commentators shed light on the story of Noah and the flood. They emphasize the disobedience and unbelief of the people in Noah's time, as well as the patience and long-suffering of God in giving them an opportunity to repent. The commentators also highlight the fact that Noah and his family were saved through water, contrasting the salvation of the few with the perishing of many. This passage serves as a reminder of the consequences of disobedience and the importance of perseverance in faith.
