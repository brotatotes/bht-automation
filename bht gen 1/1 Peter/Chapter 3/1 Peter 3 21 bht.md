# 1 Peter 3:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, commentators discuss the significance of water and baptism in relation to salvation. They draw a parallel between Noah's salvation through the floodwaters and our spiritual cleansing through baptism. They emphasize that the saving power lies not in the water itself, but in the faith and obedience it represents. Baptism, as a symbolic act, signifies the washing away of sin and the renewal of a person's conscience. It is through this outward sign and the inward grace it represents that we are united with Christ and find acceptance and salvation.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Water saves in both cases. It saved them, becoming to them a means of floating their ark and bearing them harmless: it saves us, becoming to us baptism: and that baptism not material, but spiritual." 
2. "The seeking after God in a good and pure conscience, which is the aim and end of the Christian baptismal life." 
3. "By means of the resurrection of Jesus Christ, as the removal of sin once for all for all mankind, it is, that in baptism the prayer for a good conscience is directed to God."

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Water saved Noah not of itself, but by sustaining the ark built in faith, resting on God's word: it was to him the sign and mean of a kind of regeneration, of the earth."
2. "The flood was for Noah a baptism, as the passage through the Red Sea was for the Israelites; by baptism in the flood he and his family were transferred from the old world to the new: from immediate destruction to lengthened probation; from the companionship of the wicked to communion with God; from the severing of all bonds between the creature and the Creator to the privileges of the covenant: so we by spiritual baptism."
3. "Not the putting away of the filth of the flesh (as is done by a mere water baptism, unaccompanied with the Spirit's baptism), but of the soul. It is the ark (Christ and His Spirit-filled Church), not the water, which is the instrument of salvation: the water only flowed round the ark so not the mere water baptism, but the water when accompanied with the Spirit."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The mention of water in the case of Noah, in connection with his being saved, by an obvious association suggested to the mind of the apostle the use of water in our salvation, and hence led him to make the remark about the connection of baptism with our salvation."
2. "Baptism, in the proper sense of the term, as above explained, where the water used is a symbol, in like manner now saves us; that is, the water is an emblem of that purifying by which we are saved."
3. "No outward ablution or purifying saves us, but that which pertains to the conscience."
4. "The whole efficiency in the case is derived from [the resurrection of Jesus Christ]. If he had not been raised from the dead, baptism would have been vain, and there would have been no power to save us."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The word occurs only once elsewhere, Hebrews 9:24: 'the figures of the true.'"
2. "The meaning here is much disputed, and can hardly be settled satisfactorily."
3. "To these questions the triune Jehovah answers in baptism, 'Yea!' Now is laid the solid foundation for a good conscience."

### John Calvin:
1. "As Noah, then, obtained life through death, when in the ark, he was enclosed not otherwise than as it were in the grave, and when the whole world perished, he was preserved together with his small family; so at this day, the death which is set forth in baptism, is to us an entrance into life, nor can salvation be hoped for, except we be separated from the world." 
2. "This objection Peter anticipates, when he testifies that he speaks not of the naked sign, but that the effect must also be connected with it...the external symbol is not sufficient, except baptism be received really and effectually: and the reality of it will be found only in a few." 
3. "We ought to acknowledge in baptism a spiritual washing, we ought to embrace therein the testimony of the remission of sin and the pledge of our renovation, and yet so as to leave to Christ his own honor, and also to the Holy Spirit; so that no part of our salvation should be transferred to the sign."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The comparison, therefore, is not between the Flood and Baptism, but simply between water in one service and water in another."
2. "The saving efficacy is not of a material kind like that exerted by water in the case of the Ark and its eight."
3. "Peter intends to explain that, when he speaks of baptism as having a saving efficacy, he does not mean a mere ceremonial washing, but one which carries a moral value with it."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Water in baptism now as an anti-type of Noah's deliverance by water." 
2. "The saving by baptism which Peter here mentions is only symbolic, not actual." 
3. "Baptism, Peter explains, does not wash away the filth of the flesh either in a literal sense, as a bath for the body, or in a metaphorical sense of the filth of the soul."

### John Gill:
1. "As the ark, while it was preparing, was the scorn and derision of men, so is this ordinance of the Gospel; it was rejected with disdain by the Scribes and Pharisees, as it still is by many."
2. "Baptism saves not as a cause, for it has no causal influence on, nor is it essential to salvation. Christ only is the cause and author of eternal salvation."
3. "Baptism does certainly lay an obligation on men to walk in newness of life; in baptism persons make a public confession of God, and openly put on Christ before men."

### John Wesley:
1. "Through the water of baptism we are saved from the sin which overwhelms the world as a flood."
2. "Not, indeed, the bare outward sign, but the inward grace."
3. "A divine consciousness that both our persons and our actions are accepted through him who died and rose again for us."
