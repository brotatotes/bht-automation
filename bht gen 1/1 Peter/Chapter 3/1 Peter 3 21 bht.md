# choicest prompt v1 X bht prompt v3; ['Henry Alford', 'Jamieson Fausset Brown', 'Albert Barnes', 'Marvin Vincent', 'John Calvin', 'Philip Schaff', 'Archibald T Robertson', 'Adam Clarke']

## Henry Alford:
1. "Water saves in both cases. It saved them, becoming to them a means of floating their ark and bearing them harmless: it saves us, becoming to us baptism: and that baptism not material, but spiritual."
2. "Not fleshly putting away of filth, but enquiry of a good conscience after God."
3. "By means of the resurrection of Jesus Christ, it is, that in baptism the prayer for a good conscience is directed to God."

## Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Water saved Noah not of itself, but by sustaining the ark built in faith, resting on God's word: it was to him the sign and mean of a kind of regeneration, of the earth."
2. "The flood was for Noah a baptism, as the passage through the Red Sea was for the Israelites; by baptism in the flood he and his family were transferred from the old world to the new: from immediate destruction to lengthened probation; from the companionship of the wicked to communion with God; from the severing of all bonds between the creature and the Creator to the privileges of the covenant: so we by spiritual baptism."
3. "Not the putting away of the filth of the flesh (as is done by a mere water baptism, unaccompanied with the Spirit's baptism), but of the soul. It is the ark (Christ and His Spirit-filled Church), not the water, which is the instrument of salvation: the water only flowed round the ark so not the mere water baptism, but the water when accompanied with the Spirit."

## Albert Barnes:
1. "The mention of water in the case of Noah, in connection with his being saved, by an obvious association suggested to the mind of the apostle the use of water in our salvation, and hence led him to make the remark about the connection of baptism with our salvation."
2. "The apostle does not say that it corresponded in all respects; in respect, e.g., to quantity, or to the manner of the application, or to the efficacy; but there is a sense in which water performs an important part in our salvation, as it did in his."
3. "No man can be saved without that regenerated and purified heart of which baptism is the appropriate symbol, and when it would be proper to administer that ordinance."

## Marvin Vincent:
1. "The word occurs only once elsewhere, Hebrews 9:24: 'the figures of the true.'"
2. "The meaning here is much disputed, and can hardly be settled satisfactorily."
3. "The thing asked may be conceived as follows: 'How shall I rid myself of an evil conscience?'"

## John Calvin:
1. "Noah, saved by water, had a sort of baptism. And this the Apostle mentions, that the likeness between him and us might appear more evident."
2. "As Noah, then, obtained life through death, when in the ark, he was enclosed not otherwise than as it were in the grave, and when the whole world perished, he was preserved together with his small family; so at this day, the death which is set forth in baptism, is to us an entrance into life."
3. "We must at the same time beware of another evil, such as prevails among the Papists; for as they distinguish not as they ought between the thing and the sign, they stop at the outward element, and on that fix their hope of salvation. Therefore the sight of the water takes away their thoughts from the blood of Christ and the power of the Spirit."

## Philip Schaff:
1. "The comparison, therefore, is not between the Flood and Baptism, but simply between water in one service and water in another."
2. "The saving efficacy is not of a material kind like that exerted by water in the case of the Ark and its eight."
3. "Peter intends seems to be to explain that, when he speaks of baptism as having a saving efficacy, he does not mean a mere ceremonial washing, but one which carries a moral value with it."

## Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Water in baptism now as an anti-type of Noah's deliverance by water."
2. "The saving by baptism which Peter here mentions is only symbolic, not actual."
3. "Baptism, Peter explains, does not wash away the filth of the flesh either in a literal sense, as a bath for the body, or in a metaphorical sense of the filth of the soul."

## Adam Clarke:
1. "Baptism implies a consecration and dedication of the soul and body to God, the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit."
2. "He who is faithful to his baptismal covenant, taking God through Christ, by the eternal Spirit, for his portion, is saved here from his sins; and through the resurrection of Christ from the dead, has the well-grounded hope of eternal glory."
3. "The water of baptism saves no man, but as it is the means of his getting his heart purified by the Holy Spirit, and typifying to him that purification."


# BHT:
In this verse, the commentators emphasize the connection between Noah's salvation through water and the symbolic nature of baptism in our own salvation. They explain that just as water played a role in Noah's deliverance, baptism serves as a means of consecration and dedication to God. While baptism itself does not save, it represents a commitment to God and an acknowledgement of the need for a purified heart through the work of the Holy Spirit. Through baptism, we are united with Christ's death and resurrection, giving us the hope of eternal glory.
