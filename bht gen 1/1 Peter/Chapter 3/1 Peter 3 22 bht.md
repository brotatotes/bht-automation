2. "Proving against rationalists an actual material ascension."

3. "Those who have impenitent husbands and friends should be encouraged in seeking their conversion.

3. "Christ exercises supreme power everywhere as God’s representative."

## Philip Schaff:
1. "The point of the verse is to bring out the heightened power which resulted to Christ from His suffering and death, and thus to crown the train of statement by which the blessing of suffering for righteousness’ sake is enforced."
2. "The preaching which it affirms is one the results of which are in no way indicated, and the introduction of which at this point is in no obvious connection with Peter’s exhortation."
3. "The strain of the paragraph, therefore, amounts to this: Be content to suffer. It is a blessing to do so, provided ye suffer for well-doing, not for ill-doing."
