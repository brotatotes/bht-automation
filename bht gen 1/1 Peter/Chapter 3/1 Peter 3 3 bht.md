## Henry Alford:
1. "Let the adornment be much better so, than either as taking the word κόσμος expressed below as the subject, or as complete in itself, which is against not only probable construction, but the analogy of 1 Timothy 5:9."
2. "The outward adornment of braiding of hair and putting round of golden ornaments or putting on of dresses."
3. "The sex which began first our engagement to the necessity of clothing, having still a peculiar propensity to be curious in that, to improve the necessity to an advantage."

## Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "To whom let there belong...not the outward adornment...of plaiting...wearing...apparel." 
2. "Have the blush of modesty on thy face instead of paint, and moral worth and discretion instead of gold and emeralds."
3. "Put the focus on inner beauty, not outward appearance."

## Albert Barnes:
1. "The apostle does not condemn true ornament, nor does he condemn the desire to appear in such a way as to secure the esteem of others."
2. "The true notion of ornament or adorning is that which will make any person or thing appear well, or beautiful, to others."
3. "Religion promotes neatness, and cleanliness, and a proper attention to our external appearance according to our circumstances in life, as certainly as it does to the internal virtue of the soul."

## Marvin Vincent:
1. "The Roman women of the day were addicted to ridiculous extravagance in the adornment of the hair."
2. "The attendants will vote on the dressing of the hair as if a question of reputation or of life were at stake, so great is the trouble she takes in quest of beauty."
3. "Female extravagance in dress in the days of the empire reached an alarming pitch."

## John Calvin:
1. "Wives are to adorn themselves sparingly and modestly: for we know that they are in this respect much more curious and ambitious than they ought to be."
2. "Peter did not intend to condemn every sort of ornament, but the evil of vanity, to which women are subject."
3. "Two things are to be regarded in clothing, usefulness and decency; and what decency requires is moderation and modesty."

## Philip Schaff:
1. "The adornment which wives are to value is not that which is effected by the particular acts of plaiting or braiding the hair, wearing of gold, or putting on of apparel."
2. "The arts themselves had gone to unheard of excess, as we learn from literature, coins, and sculpture, among the heathen ladies of the Empire."
3. "He does not, however, speak of ornaments and tasteful attire as things unfit for a Christian woman, but condemns excess of attention to such things as if they made the wife’s real attractions."

## Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Κοσμος has here its old meaning of ornament (cf. our cosmetics), not the common one of world (John 17:5) considered as an orderly whole." 
2. "The use of ουχ here rather than μη (usual negative with the imperative) because of the sharp contrast in verse 1 Peter 3:4 (αλλ')." 
3. "Peter is not forbidding the wearing of clothes and ornaments by women, but the display of finery by contrast."

## Adam Clarke:
1. "Plaiting the hair, and variously folding it about the head, was the most ancient and most simple mode of disposing of this chief ornament of the female head."
2. "Thin plates of gold were often mixed with the hair, to make it appear more ornamental by the reflection of light and of the solar rays."
3. "The proper ornament of a woman is that which becomes her best. This is neither gold, nor pearls, nor scarlet; but those things which are an evident proof of gravity, regularity, and modesty."


# BHT:
The passage being described emphasizes the importance of inner beauty over outward adornment. It warns against excessive focus on extravagant hairstyles, excessive use of gold and clothing, and displays of vanity. The commentators point out that the apostle does not condemn all forms of adornment, but rather the excessive attention and value placed on them. The verse serves as a reminder to prioritize modesty, decency, and the cultivation of inner virtues over external appearances and material possessions.
