# choicest prompt v1 X bht prompt v3; ['Henry Alford', 'Jamieson Fausset Brown', 'Albert Barnes', 'Marvin Vincent', 'John Calvin', 'Philip Schaff', 'Archibald T Robertson', 'Adam Clarke']

## Henry Alford:
1. "The κρυπτὸς ἄνθρωπος is not here that which is to be adorned, but is itself the adornment: and consequently is of necessity the regenerate life itself in its freshness and beauty." 
2. "The incorruptible ornament of the meek and quiet spirit." 
3. "The meek and quiet spirit is in the sight of God of great price."

## Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Singularity mostly comes from pride and throws needless hindrances to religion in the way of others."
2. "Under costly attire there may be a humble mind."
3. "Great is he who uses his earthenware as if it were plate not less great is he who uses his silver as if it were earthenware."
4. "Meek in affections and feelings; quiet in words, countenance, and actions."
5. "The results of redemption should correspond to its costly price."

## Albert Barnes:
1. "The word 'hidden' here means that which is concealed; that which is not made apparent by the dress, or by ornament. It lies within, pertaining to the affections of the soul."
2. "The internal ornament is ever enduring...whatever pertains to outward decoration, however beautiful and costly, is fading; but that which pertains to the soul is enduring."
3. "A wife, therefore, if she would permanently please her husband, should seek the adorning of the soul rather than the body; the ornament of the heart rather than gold and jewels."

## Marvin Vincent:
1. "Meek [πραεος]. See on Matthew 5:5." 
2. "Of great price [πολυτελες]. The word used to describe costly raiment, 1 Timothy 2:9."

## John Calvin:
1. "The word heart, no doubt means the whole soul. He at the same time shews in what consists the spiritual adorning of women, even in the incorruptness of a meek and quiet spirit."
2. "Peter means that the ornament of the soul is not like a fading flower, nor consists in vanishing splendor, but is incorruptible."
3. "For why do women take so much care to adorn themselves, except that they may turn the eyes of men on themselves? But Peter, on the contrary, bids them to be more anxious for what is before God of a great price."

## Philip Schaff:
1. "The contrast here being between those external accessories of ornamentation on which it is vain to depend for power of attraction or persuasion, and those inner qualities of character which are the secret of all permanent, personal influence."
2. "The inner personality of moral beauty which makes the wife’s true adorning, which belongs to the heart and cannot be seen by the outer eye."
3. "The estimate which is put upon such a spirit by Him who has said of Himself that He ‘seeth not as man seeth; for man looketh on the outward appearance, but the Lord looketh on the heart’ should be a further recommendation of it to these women."

## Archibald T Robertson:
1. "See Paul's use of ανθρωπος for the outer and old, the inner and new man."
2. "See also the Jew εν κρυπτω and what Jesus said about God seeing 'in secret'."
3. "No word in the Greek for 'apparel'. For αφθαρτος see 1 Peter 1:4; 1 Peter 1:23. For πραυς see Matthew 5:5; Matthew 11:29."

## Adam Clarke:
1. "The hidden man of the heart...the soul, with the whole system of affections and passions." 
2. "Every part of the Scripture treats man as a compound being: the body is the outward or visible man; the soul, the inward, hidden, or invisible man." 
3. "A meek and quiet spirit...will not give provocation to others, nor receive irritation by the provocation of others."


# BHT:
The Bible verse speaks of a hidden treasure within the soul, an adornment more valuable than any outward ornament or attire. It emphasizes the incorruptible beauty of a meek and quiet spirit, which is of great price before God. This spiritual adorning, unlike fading flowers or costly garments, lies in the depths of the heart and is the secret to lasting personal influence. It calls for a focus on inner qualities and character, which are seen and valued by God, rather than seeking attention through external appearances.
