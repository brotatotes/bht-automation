# choicest prompt v1 X bht prompt v3; ['Henry Alford', 'Jamieson Fausset Brown', 'Albert Barnes', 'Marvin Vincent', 'John Calvin', 'Philip Schaff', 'Archibald T Robertson', 'Adam Clarke']

## Henry Alford:
1. "For (enforcing of the same by example) in this manner (i.e. with the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit) formerly also the holy women, who hoped in God, adorned themselves, being in subjection to their own husbands." 
2. "The holy women, women of blessed note in the sacred history as servants of God."
3. "Being thus in subjection, they were adorned with the meek and quiet spirit which belongs to it."

## Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "The ornament of a meek and quiet spirit" is compared to the portrait of a godly wife. This suggests that having a gentle and peaceful disposition is a valuable attribute for women.
2. The word "trusted" in Greek can also be translated as "hoped." This implies that having hope in God is essential for true holiness.
3. Women were adorned by their subordination, as their beauty came from being in submission. Vanity was discouraged as it contradicted the concept of female subjection.

## Albert Barnes:
1. "The reason is, that this characterized the pious and honored females of ancient times - those females who had been most commended of God, and who were most worthy to be remembered on earth."
2. "They were characterized by simple trust or hope in God, rather than by a fondness for external adorning."
3. "Piety was understood to consist much in proper respect for others, according to the relations sustained toward them."

## Marvin Vincent:
1. "The use of the imperfect tense suggests that adorning oneself was a habitual practice for the women in this context."

2. "The word 'adorned' implies that the women were not just decorating themselves outwardly, but also seeking to enhance their inner beauty and character."

3. "This verse reminds us that true beauty comes from within, and that our focus should be on cultivating a gentle and quiet spirit rather than solely on external appearances."

## John Calvin:
1. "He sets before them the example of pious women, who sought for spiritual adorning rather than outward meretricious ornaments."
2. "Sarah, who, having been the mother of all the faithful, is especially worthy of honor and imitation on the part of her sex."
3. "Peter means, that Sarah usually spoke thus, because she knew that a command had been given her by the Lord, to be subject to her husband."

## Philip Schaff:
1. "The example of the women whose lives are recorded in the ancient history of God’s people furnishes another incentive to the cultivation of the kind of attraction just explained."
2. "They were accustomed to seek in the beauty of wifely character their best adornment, and one chief evidence of their being women of this spirit was the respect and subordination which they exhibited in relation to their husbands."
3. "Their eye turned Godward, not earthward; their life drew its inspiration not from the present, but from the future; their expectation looked to the performance of God’s promises, not to what things as they were could yield."

## Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Used to adorn themselves." 
2. "Tribute to holy women of the O.T." 
3. "The participle υποτασσομενα repeats verse 1 Peter 3:1."

## Adam Clarke:
1. "No female head ever looks so well as when adorned with its own hair alone. This is the ornament appointed by God." 
2. "To cut it off or to cover it is an unnatural practice; and to exchange the hair which God has given for hair of some other colour, is an insult to the Creator." 
3. "The women who trust NOT in God are fond of dress and frippery; those who trust in God follow nature and common sense."


# BHT:
In this verse, women are encouraged to focus on cultivating a meek and quiet spirit, which was exemplified by the holy women in the past. Their beauty came from their submission and trust in God, rather than external adornments. These women were esteemed for their character and respect for their husbands. True beauty was found within, as they sought to enhance their inner qualities and live in accordance with God's commandments. This verse reminds us to value humility, trusting in God's promises, and seeking spiritual adorning rather than superficial embellishments.
