## Henry Alford:

2. "As long as ye do good, and are not afraid of any sudden fear." 
3. "Within the limits of propriety and decorum, the common usage is the rule."

## Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Ye are...children" of Abraham and Sara by faith, whereas ye were Gentile aliens from the covenant." 
2. "Act well, and be not thrown into sudden panic, as weak females are apt to be, by any opposition from without."
3. "You need fear no man in doing what is right: not thrown into fluttering agitation by any sudden outbreak of temper on the part of your unbelieving husbands, while you do well."

## Albert Barnes:
1. "Nothing is said, in the brief records of her life, of any passion for outward adorning; much is said of her kindness to her husband, and her respect for him."
2. "The word lord has the elementary idea of ruling, and this is the sense here - that she acknowledged that he had a right to direct the affairs of his household, and that it was her duty to be in subjection to him as the head of the family."
3. "The welfare of society, and the happiness of individuals, are not diminished by showing proper respect for all classes of persons in the various relations of life."

3. "The word means a scare, or nervous excitement."

## John Calvin:
1. "The weakness of the sex causes women to be suspicious and timid, and therefore morose; for they fear lest by their subjection, they should be more reproachfully treated."
2. "Willingly submit to the authority of your husbands, nor let fear prevent your obedience, as though your condition would be worse, were you to obey."
3. "Let them not raise up commotions at home. For as they are liable to be frightened, they often make much of a little thing, and thus disturb themselves and the family."

## Philip Schaff:
1. "Taking ‘as’ in the sense of ‘according as’...the point would be, that not only did these holy women of olden time submit themselves to their own husbands, but they regulated the measure of their wifely obedience by no lower standard than the noble example of Sarah."
2. "The terms in which she spoke of Abraham in relation to herself are instanced as the natural expression of the spirit of meek subordination which animated her."
3. "The statement is not that these women are Sarah’s children, far less that they shall be such, but that they became or were made such."

## Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Obeyed Abraham" - Sarah's obedience to Abraham is highlighted, emphasizing her submission and respect for her husband.
2. "Calling him lord" - Sarah's address of Abraham as "lord" reflects her recognition of his authority and her willingness to honor and submit to him.
3. "Whose children ye now are" - This phrase emphasizes the spiritual connection between believers and Sarah, highlighting the idea that Christians are part of the same family as Sarah, sharing in her faith and heritage.

## Adam Clarke:
1. "The words of the apostle imply that she acknowledged his superiority, and her own subjection to him, in the order of God."
2. "A son of Abraham is a true believer; a daughter of Sarah is the same."
3. "If ye do well, and act conscientiously your part as faithful wives, ye will at no time live under the distressing apprehension of being found out, or terrified at every appearance of the discovery of infidelities, or improper conduct."


# BHT:
This verse highlights the importance of submission and respect within marriage. Sarah's obedience and reverence for Abraham served as an example for all women to follow. By addressing him as "lord," she acknowledged his authority and demonstrated her willingness to submit. Believers are also reminded that through faith, they become part of the same spiritual family as Sarah. Living faithfully and conscientiously eliminates the fear and anxiety associated with dishonesty and improper conduct.
