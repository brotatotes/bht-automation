# choicest prompt v1 X bht prompt v3; ['Henry Alford', 'Jamieson Fausset Brown', 'Albert Barnes', 'Marvin Vincent', 'John Calvin', 'Philip Schaff', 'Archibald T Robertson', 'Adam Clarke']

## Henry Alford:
1. "Ye husbands in like manner, dwelling according to knowledge with the feminine as with the weaker vessel." - The commentary explains that husbands should treat their wives with understanding and consideration, recognizing their weaknesses and vulnerabilities.

2. "Giving honor as to those who are also fellow-inheritors of the grace of life." - The commentary emphasizes that husbands should honor their wives as equal partners in the blessings of God's grace and eternal life.

3. "In order that your prayers be not hindered." - The commentary suggests that if husbands do not give proper honor and respect to their wives, it may hinder their prayers and their spiritual connection with God.

## Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Both husband and wife are vessels in God's hand, and of God's making, to fulfill His gracious purposes. Both weak, the woman the weaker. The sense of his own weakness, and that she, like himself, is God's vessel and fabric, ought to lead him to act with tender and wise consideration towards her who is the weaker fabric." 
2. "The reason why the man should give honor to the woman is, because God gives honor to both as fellow heirs." 
3. "He does not take into account the case of an unbelieving wife, as she might yet believe."

## Albert Barnes:
1. "It was an important advance made in society when the Christian religion gave such a direction as this, for everywhere among the pagan, and under all false systems of religion, woman has been regarded as worthy of little honor or respect."
2. "The reasons assigned for doing this seem to imply it."
3. "This passage contains a very important truth in regard to the female sex. Under every other system of religion but the Christian system, woman has been regarded as in every way inferior to man. Christianity teaches that, in respect to her higher interests, the interests of religion, she is every way his equal."

## Marvin Vincent:
1. "With an intelligent recognition of the nature of the marriage relation."
2. "The female vessel as weaker."
3. "The word means, literally, to portion out, and is appropriate to the husband as controlling what is to be meted out to the wife."

## John Calvin:
1. "And doubtless many foolish things must be endured by them, many unpleasant things must be borne with; and they must at the same time beware lest their indulgence should foster folly."
2. "For nothing destroys the friendship of life more than contempt; nor can we really love any but those whom we esteem; for love must be connected with respect."
3. "For since the Lord is pleased to bestow in common on husbands and wives the same graces, he invites them to seek an equality in them; and we know that those graces are manifold in which wives are partakers with their husbands."

## Philip Schaff:
1. "There is a submission which husbands, notwithstanding that the man is the head of the woman, have to yield, not less than wives, to the idea and object of the married state as one form of the ‘every ordinance of man.’"
2. "If the home life is to be regulated so as to be ‘according to knowledge,’ there must be a considerate recognition of the natural weakness of the woman, and a readiness to give her the honourable regard which is due to her as the husband’s associate in life and in grace."
3. "The same claim upon his respect and honour is made yet stronger by the fact that all natural differences disappear in the spiritual relation which makes them joint-heirs of the grace of life."

## Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Dwell with (συνοικουντες). Present active participle of συνοικεω, old verb for domestic association, here only in N.T. Used as imperative here like the participle in 1 Peter 2:18; 1 Peter 3:1."
2. "Giving honour unto the woman as unto the weaker vessel (ως ασθενεστερω σκευε τω γυναικειω απονεμοντες τιμην). Present active participle of απονεμω, old verb, to assign, to portion out (or off), here only in N.T."
3. "Joint-heirs of the grace of life (συνκληρονομο χαριτος ζωης). Late double compound found in an Ephesian inscription and the papyri, in N.T. only here, Romans 8:17; Ephesians 3:6; Hebrews 11:9."

## Adam Clarke:
1. "Dwell with them according to knowledge — Give your wives, by no species of unkind carriage, any excuse for delinquency."
2. "Giving honour unto the wife — Using your superior strength and experience in her behalf, and thus honouring her by becoming her protector and support."
3. "Being heirs together — Both the man and woman being equally called to eternal glory: and as prayer is one great means of obtaining a meetness for it, it is necessary that they should live together in such a manner as to prevent all family contentions."


# BHT:
In this Bible verse, husbands are encouraged to treat their wives with understanding, honor, and respect. They should recognize and consider their wives' weaknesses and vulnerabilities, honoring them as equal partners in God's grace and eternal life. By doing so, husbands ensure that their prayers are not hindered and that they maintain a strong spiritual connection with God. Through this passage, we learn the importance of mutual respect and equality in marriage, as well as the transformative power of Christianity in elevating the status of women.
