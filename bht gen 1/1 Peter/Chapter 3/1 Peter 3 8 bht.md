## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "τί χρὴ ἰδιολογεῖσθαι; ἁπλῶς πᾶσι φημί · τοῦτο γὰρ τέλος καὶ πρὸς τοῦτο πᾶσιν ὁ σκοπὸς ἀφορᾷ τῆς σωτηρίας, καὶ τοῦτο νόμος πᾶσιν ἀγάπης" - This commentary highlights that the purpose and goal of all believers is to love one another, as it is the law of love that leads to salvation.

2. "sympathising (συμπάθεια ὁ πρὸς τοὺς κακῶς πάσχοντας ὡς καὶ ἐφʼ ἑαυτοῖς ἔλεος)" - This quote emphasizes the importance of showing compassion and mercy towards those who are suffering, not only externally but also within ourselves.

3. "humble-minded (the word forms a note of transition to the next verse: humility being essential both to true gentleness of love and to true patience under injuries)" - This commentary highlights the connection between humility and the ability to love others genuinely and patiently, even in the face of mistreatment or harm.

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Having compassion one of another—Greek, 'sympathizing' in the joy and sorrow of others." 

2. "Love as brethren—Greek, 'loving the brethren.'" 

3. "Courteous—genuine Christian politeness; not the tinsel of the world's politeness; stamped with unfeigned love on one side, and humility on the other."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Be ye all of one mind - See the notes at Romans 12:16. The word used here (ὁμόφρων homophrōn) does not elsewhere occur in the New Testament. It means, of the same mind; like-minded; and the object is to secure harmony in their views and feelings."

2. "Having compassion one of another - 'Sympathizing,' (συμπαθεῖς sumpatheis;) entering into one another’s feelings, and evincing a regard for each other’s welfare. See the notes at Romans 12:15. Compare 1 Corinthians 12:26; John 11:35."

3. "Love as brethren - Margin, 'loving to the;' that is, the brethren. The Greek word (φιλάδελφος philadelphos) does not elsewhere occur in the New Testament. It means loving one’s brethren; that is, loving each other as Christian brethren - Robinson, Lexicon. Thus, it enforces the duty so often enjoined in the New Testament, that of love to Christians as brethren of the same family."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Indicating unity of thought and feeling."
2. "Interchange of fellow - feeling in joy or sorrow."
3. "The nobler entrails, which are regarded as the seat of the affections, and hence equivalent to our popular use of heart."

### John Calvin:
1. "For though friends are at liberty to think differently, yet to do so is a cloud which obscures love; yea, from this seed easily arises hatred."
2. "Sympathy extends to all our faculties, when concord exists between us; so that every one condoles with us in adversity as well as rejoices with us in prosperity."
3. "Wisely then does Peter bid us to be humble-minded, lest pride and haughtiness should lead us to despise our neighbors."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "It is expressed by an adjective, which occurs nowhere else in the N. T. It denotes the agreement of those whose mind and will are set upon the same objects... It is not to be limited to agreement in doctrinal opinion." 
2. "It denotes oneness in feeling, and covers Paul’s ‘rejoice with them that do rejoice,’ as well as his ‘weep with them that weep’." 
3. "In Christianity it becomes a grace, contrasted with the heathen virtue of ‘high-mindedness,’ and born of the sense of unworthiness. It is the thinking ourselves little because we are little."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Conclusion, not of the Epistle, but only of the addresses to various classes." 
2. "Our 'sympathetic' in original sense." 
3. "Late and rare compound (ευ and σπλαγχνον), in Hippocrates, Apocrypha, in N.T. only here and Ephesians 4:32."

### John Gill:
1. "Be ye all of one mind...in the same judgment; for as the church is but one body, of which Christ is the head, there should be but one mind in it."
2. "Having compassion one of another...rejoicing with them that rejoice...and weeping with them that weep."
3. "Love as brethren...show itself in praying for each other, in bearing one another's burdens, in forgiving each other, in admonishing in love, and building up one another on their most holy faith."

### John Wesley:
1. "Sympathizing — Rejoicing and sorrowing together."
2. "Love all believers as brethren."
3. "Be courteous — To all men. Courtesy is such a behaviour toward equals and inferiors as shows respect mixed with love."
