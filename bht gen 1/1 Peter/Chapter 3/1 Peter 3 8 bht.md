# choicest prompt v1 X bht prompt v3; ['Henry Alford', 'Jamieson Fausset Brown', 'Albert Barnes', 'Marvin Vincent', 'John Calvin', 'Philip Schaff', 'Archibald T Robertson', 'Adam Clarke']

## Henry Alford:
1. "τί χρὴ ἰδιολογεῖσθαι ; ἁπλῶς πᾶσι φημί · τοῦτο γὰρ τέλος καὶ πρὸς τοῦτο πᾶσιν ὁ σκοπὸς ἀφορᾷ τῆς σωτηρίας , καὶ τοῦτο νόμος πᾶσιν ἀγάπης" - This quote highlights that the purpose of the verse is to emphasize the importance of love and unity among believers.

2. "sympathising ( συμπάθεια ὁ πρὸς τοὺς κακῶς πάσχοντας ὡς καὶ ἐφ ʼ ἑαυτοῖς ἔλεος" - This quote explains that the concept of sympathy extends beyond sorrow and includes showing mercy and compassion towards others.

3. "compassionate (in classical Greek, of strong courage, lit. 'of strong bowels,' as in Hippocr. p. 89 C)" - This quote provides a unique insight into the meaning of compassion, suggesting that it involves having strong courage and a deep sense of empathy.

## Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Having compassion one of another—Greek, 'sympathizing' in the joy and sorrow of others."
2. "Love as brethren—Greek, 'loving the brethren.'"
3. "Courteous—genuine Christian politeness; not the tinsel of the world's politeness; stamped with unfeigned love on one side, and humility on the other."

## Albert Barnes:
1. "Be ye all of one mind - See the notes at Romans 12:16. The word used here (ὁμόφρων homophrōn) does not elsewhere occur in the New Testament. It means, of the same mind; like-minded; and the object is to secure harmony in their views and feelings."
2. "Having compassion one of another - “Sympathizing,” (συμπαθεῖς sumpatheis;) entering into one another’s feelings, and evincing a regard for each other’s welfare."
3. "Love as brethren - Margin, “loving to the;” that is, the brethren. The Greek word (φιλάδελφος philadelphos) does not elsewhere occur in the New Testament. It means loving one’s brethren; that is, loving each other as Christian brethren."

## Marvin Vincent:
1. "Indicating unity of thought and feeling."
2. "Interchange of fellow - feeling in joy or sorrow."
3. "From eu, well, and splagcna, the nobler entrails, which are regarded as the seat of the affections, and hence equivalent to our popular use of heart."

## John Calvin:
1. "For though friends are at liberty to think differently, yet to do so is a cloud which obscures love; yea, from this seed easily arises hatred."
2. "Sympathy extends to all our faculties, when concord exists between us; so that every one condoles with us in adversity as well as rejoices with us in prosperity."
3. "Wisely then does Peter bid us to be humble-minded, lest pride and haughtiness should lead us to despise our neighbors."

## Philip Schaff:
1. "It is expressed by an adjective, which occurs nowhere else in the N. T. It denotes the agreement of those whose mind and will are set upon the same objects... It is the harmony of many minds which ‘springs from the sense of a common origin, from common relations, and interests, and aims, and hopes’." 
2. "The unity of mind and the unity of feeling are associated again in Romans 12:15-16, and Philippians 2:1-2."
3. "In Christianity it becomes a grace, contrasted with the heathen virtue of ‘high-mindedness,’ and born of the sense of un-worthiness. It is the thinking ourselves little because we are little."

## Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Conclusion, not of the Epistle, but only of the addresses to various classes." 
2. "Our 'sympathetic' in original sense." 
3. "Late and rare compound (ευ and σπλαγχνον), in Hippocrates, Apocrypha, in N.T. only here and Ephesians 4:32."

## Adam Clarke:
1. "Unity, both in the family and in the Church, being essentially necessary to peace and salvation."

3. "Let your bowels yearn over the distressed and afflicted."
