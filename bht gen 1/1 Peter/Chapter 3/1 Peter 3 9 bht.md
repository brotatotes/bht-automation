## Henry Alford:
1. "Not giving back evil for evil, or reproach for reproach."
2. "On the contrary, blessing the evil doer or speaker."
3. "Because to this you were called, that you might inherit blessing."

## Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "No railing can injure you." 
2. "Imitate God who 'blesses' you." 
3. "The first fruits of His blessing for eternity are enjoyed by the righteous even now."

## Albert Barnes:
1. "Knowing that you were called to be Christians in order that you should obtain a blessing infinite and eternal in the heavens."
2. "Expecting such a blessing yourselves, you should be ready to scatter blessings on all others."
3. "The hope of eternal life should make your minds calm; and the prospect that you are to be so exalted in heaven should fill your hearts with benignity and love."

## Marvin Vincent:
1. "Rendering evil, etc." - This phrase refers to the act of retaliating or seeking revenge when someone does evil to us. It emphasizes the importance of not responding to evil with evil, but rather choosing a different course of action.

2. "Be not rendering evil, but be blessing." - This quote highlights the contrast between responding with evil and responding with blessing. It encourages us to choose a path of kindness, forgiveness, and goodwill towards others, even when they treat us poorly.

3. "Blessing [ευλογουντες] . Not a noun governed by rendering, but a participle." - This statement clarifies that "blessing" is not a noun that should be understood as the object of the verb "rendering." Instead, it is a participle that emphasizes the ongoing and continuous nature of blessing others, as opposed to retaliating with evil.

## John Calvin:
1. "In order to preserve love, we must bear with many things."
2. "Evils are to be overcome by acts of kindness."
3. "If we submissively bear injuries, the Lord will bestow on us his blessing."

## Philip Schaff:
1. "An undue esteem of ourselves is inconsistent either with the oneness of mind and feeling which makes genuine brotherliness, or with the Christian law of overcoming evil with good."
2. "The return which we are to render for injury done us, whether in the form of the evil deed or the reviling word, is to desire and pray for the good of the injurers."
3. "The duty which was formerly enjoined on slaves by an appeal to Christ’s example, is now repeated as a duty applicable to all Christians, and as involved in the Divine call which first makes us Christians."

## Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Not rendering evil for evil." - This phrase emphasizes the principle of not retaliating or seeking revenge when someone does evil to us. It echoes the teachings of Jesus in Matthew 5:38, where he calls for a rejection of the "eye for an eye" mentality.

2. "Reviling for reviling." - This phrase refers to the act of responding to insults or verbal abuse with more insults. It points to the example of Christ, who did not retaliate or respond in kind when he was reviled.

3. "But contrariwise blessing." - This phrase highlights the alternative response that Christians are called to have. Instead of returning evil or insults, they are to bless those who mistreat them. This echoes the teachings of Jesus in Luke 6:28, where he instructs his followers to bless those who curse them.

## Adam Clarke:
1. "Not rendering evil for evil — Purposing, saying, doing nothing but good; and invariably returning good for evil." 
2. "Ye are thereunto called — This is your calling-your business in life, to do good, and to do good for evil, and to implore God's blessing even on your worst enemies." 
3. "And this is not only your duty, but your interest; for in so doing you shall obtain God's blessing, even life for evermore."
