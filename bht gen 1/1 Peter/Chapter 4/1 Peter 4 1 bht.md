## Henry Alford:
1. "Do ye also arm yourselves with the same mind (intent, resolution; scil., to suffer in the flesh, as He did."
2. "He that hath suffered in the flesh is made to cease from sin."
3. "The general assertion itself, here and in Rom. l. c., is enthymematic, resting on the fact that the flesh is the element of sin, and he that has mortified it by suffering has in the same proportion got rid of sin."

## Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "The Christian is by faith one with Christ: as then Christ by death is judicially freed from sin; so the Christian who has in the person of Christ died, has no more to do with it judicially, and ought to have no more to do with it actually." 
2. "The flesh is the sphere in which sin has place." 
3. "The same mind of suffering with patient willingness what God wills you to suffer."

## Albert Barnes:
1. "The design was to set the suffering Redeemer before them as an example in their trials."
2. "This readiness to suffer and die...will answer the purpose of armour in engaging in the conflicts and strifes which pertain to us as Christians."
3. "If a Christian becomes dead in a moral sense...he may be expected to cease from sin."

## Marvin Vincent:
1. "Arm yourselves." - This phrase emphasizes the need for believers to be prepared and equipped for spiritual battles. (Quote 1)
2. "The thought as determining the resolution." - This suggests that one's thoughts should guide their determination and resolve to follow Christ, even in the face of suffering. (Quote 2)
3. "Since Christ has suffered in the flesh, be ye also willing to suffer in the flesh." - This highlights the importance of believers being willing to endure hardships and persecution for the sake of their faith, following the example of Christ. (Quote 3)

## John Calvin:
1. "The Scripture recommends to us a twofold likeness to the death of Christ, that we are to be conformed to him in reproaches and troubles, and also that the old man being dead and extinct in us, we are to be renewed to a spiritual life."
2. "It is by his Spirit that we are really made conformable to his death, so that it becomes effectual to the crucifying of our flesh."
3. "He that hath suffered...intimating that we are really and effectually supplied with invincible weapons to subdue the flesh, if we partake as we ought of the efficacy of Christ’s death."

## Philip Schaff:
1. "The ‘suffered’ is a general expression here, covering His death as well as what He endured previous to that." 
2. "The course which they have to run is one of conflict. They must have an equipment for their warfare, if they are to wage it worthily, and the armour or equipment which will make them ready is that with which their Captain Himself faced his curriculum of suffering."
3. "In their conflict Christians were to arm themselves with the same purpose with which their Lord Himself endured suffering. What that purpose in His case was, appears from the previous section. It was to do good to wrong-doers, by bringing them to God."

## Archibald T Robertson:
1. "The fact that Christ suffered for us."
2. "Arm yourselves also."
3. "Temptation has lost its appeal and power with such a man."

## Adam Clarke:
1. "He is your proper pattern; have the same disposition he had; the same forgiving spirit, with meekness, gentleness, and complete self-possession."
2. "The man who suffers generally reflects on his ways, is humbled, fears approaching death, loathes himself because of his past iniquities, and ceases from them."
3. "Those who have firmly resolved, if called to it, to suffer death rather than apostatize from Christianity, have consequently ceased from, or are delivered from, the sin of saving their lives at the expense of their faith."


# BHT:
This verse calls believers to equip themselves with the same mindset and resolve to suffer for their faith, following the example of Christ. By willingly enduring hardships, believers are freed from the power of sin and are able to combat spiritual battles. This mindset of suffering not only serves as armor in their Christian journey but also reflects a willingness to do good to those who wrong them. It is through this conformity to Christ's death that believers are able to overcome temptation and reflect on their ways, leading to transformation and a cessation of sinful practices.
