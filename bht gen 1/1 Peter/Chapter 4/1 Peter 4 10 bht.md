# 1 Peter 4:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Bible verse being described emphasizes the idea of believers as stewards of the gifts they have received from God. The gifts are described as gracious divine endowments, freely given and meant for the benefit of the Christian community. They are to be used as a store at the service of the Church's needs, with each believer being a good steward of the manifold grace of God. This unity in sharing and using the various gifts is meant to promote the good of both individuals and the body of Christ.
