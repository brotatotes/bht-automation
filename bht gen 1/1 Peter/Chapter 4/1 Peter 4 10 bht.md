# choicest prompt v1 X bht prompt v3; ['Henry Alford', 'Jamieson Fausset Brown', 'Albert Barnes', 'Marvin Vincent', 'John Calvin', 'Philip Schaff', 'Archibald T Robertson', 'Adam Clarke']

## Henry Alford:
1. "Each man even as he received a gift of grace, to each other ministering it as good stewards." 
2. "The idea that all are members of one body." 
3. "Ministering to the need of others; his store out of which he ministers being that gift thus bestowed upon him."

## Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "The Spirit's gifts...are the common property of the Christian community, each Christian being but a steward for the edifying of the whole." 
2. "Minister the same...not discontentedly envying or disparaging the gift of another." 
3. "In seeking the good of other members they are promoting the good of themselves."

## Albert Barnes:
1. "The word rendered 'the gift' (χάρισμα charisma,) in the Greek, without the article, means 'endowment' of any kind, but especially that conferred by the Holy Spirit."
2. "Regard what you have and they have not as a gift bestowed upon you by God for the common good, and be ready to impart it as the needs of others require."
3. "Regarding yourselves as the mere stewards of God; that is, as appointed by him to do this work for him, and entrusted by him with what is needful to benefit others."

## Marvin Vincent:
1. "A gift of grace, freely given."
2. "A gracious divine endowment."
3. "An extraordinary gift of the Holy Spirit."

## John Calvin:
1. "Nothing is more fitted to correct our murmurings than to remember that we do not give our own, but only dispense what God has committed to us."
2. "If then we excel others in any gift, let us remember that we are as to this the stewards of God, in order that we may kindly impart it to our neighbors as their necessity or benefit may require."
3. "This bond of unity has been observed and noticed by heathens. But Peter teaches us here that God had designedly done this, that he might bind men one to another."

## Philip Schaff:
1. "The ‘gift’ is to be understood generally, not of official gifts merely, but (as in Romans 12:6; 1 Corinthians 12:4; 1 Corinthians 12:28) of spiritual gifts of all kinds."
2. "The gift is not to be ‘rendered unfruitful through neglect, or perverted to the purposes of a selfish ostentation, but is to be used as a store at the service of the Church’s need."
3. "They are stewards, not owners, of what they have, and they are to use it as ‘good,’ that is, honourable, stewards, against whom there shall be no reproach."

## Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Gift (χαρισμα). Late N.T. word (in late papyri) from χαριζομα, to give graciously. It is used here by Peter as one of the gifts of the Holy Spirit."
2. "Ministering (διακονουντες). Present active participle plural of διακονεω, common verb (Matthew 20:28), though εκαστος (each) is singular."
3. "As good stewards (ως καλο οικονομο). For 'steward' (οικονομος, house-manager) see Luke 16:1; 1 Corinthians 4:1 (used by Paul of himself) and of any bishop (Titus 1:7), but here of any Christian."

## Adam Clarke:
1. "A gift; any blessing of providence or grace."
2. "It may include those, but it signifies anything given by the mere mercy and bounty of God."
3. "Whatever gifts or endowments any man may possess, they are properly speaking, not his own; they are the Lord's property, and to be employed in his work, and to promote his glory."


# BHT:
As good stewards, we are each entrusted with a gift of grace, bestowed upon us by the Holy Spirit. These gifts, whether they be official or spiritual, are not our own, but rather, they are freely given to us by God. As stewards, we are to use these gracious divine endowments for the benefit of others, recognizing that everything we have is ultimately the Lord's and should be used to promote His work and glory. Through our unity and selfless ministering, we can fulfill our role as stewards and build a strong bond among believers.
