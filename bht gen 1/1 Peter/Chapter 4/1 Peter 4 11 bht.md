2. "That in all things God may be glorified through Jesus Christ."
3. "To whom is the glory and the might to the ages of the ages."

## Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "His divinely inspired words are not his own, but God's, and as a steward (1 Peter 4:10) having them committed to him, he ought so to speak them."
2. "Note, the very same term as is applied in the only other passages where it occurs (Acts 7:38; Romans 3:2; Hebrews 5:12), to the Old Testament inspired writings, is here predicated of the inspired words (the substance of which was afterwards committed to writing) of the New Testament prophets."
3. "That God in all things may be glorified—the final end of all a Christian's acts."

## Albert Barnes:
1. "Let him speak as the oracles of God - As the oracles of God speak; to wit, in accordance with the truth which God has revealed, and with an impressive sense of the responsibility of delivering a message from him."
2. "The word rendered 'oracles' (λόγια logia) means, properly, something 'spoken' or 'uttered'; then anything uttered by God - a divine communication - a revelation."
3. "That God in all things may be glorified - That he may be honored; to wit, by our doing all the good we can to others, and thus showing the power of his religion."

## Marvin Vincent:

2. "Giveth [χορηγει] . Only here and 2 Corinthians 9:10."
3. "Peter uses the compound ejpicorhgew, furnish, in 2 Peter 1:5; which see."

## John Calvin:
1. "He who speaks, then, that is, who is rightly appointed by public authority, let him speak as the oracles of God; that is, let him reverently in God’s fear and in sincerity perform the charge committed to him, regarding himself as engaged in God’s work, and as ministering God’s word and not his own."
2. "He, therefore, leaves no room for human inventions; for he briefly defines the doctrine which ought to be taught in the Church."
3. "Let him then minister as by God’s power, that is, let him regard nothing as his own, but let him humbly render service to God and his Church."

## Philip Schaff:
1. "They who speak in the Church are to do so, therefore, as ‘oracles of God.’" 
2. "Such gifts, however, were to be used as of the strength which God supplies, that is, with the faithfulness of stewards, and with the humility befitting men who were conscious that they drew not from stores of their own, but from what God Himself furnished." 
3. "The object is finally added which the possessors of gifts are to set before them, and with a view to which they are to use these various gifts in the spirit already enjoined. It is that not they, but God Himself, may have the glory."

## Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Speaking as it were oracles of God" - This phrase emphasizes the authority and weight of the words spoken by Christian teachers, as they are seen as the utterances of God Himself.

2. "God is the supplier of strength" - This highlights the role of God in providing the necessary resources and abilities for those who serve in ministry.

3. "That God may be glorified" - The purpose of speaking and ministering is ultimately to bring glory to God, emphasizing the importance of aligning one's actions and words with His will.

## Adam Clarke:
1. "Let him do it as those did to whom the living oracles were committed: they spoke as they were inspired by the Holy Ghost."
2. "Their teaching should be what the oracles of God, the Holy Scriptures, teach and authenticate."
3. "The actor is not the author, God is the author; and the poor man should be taught to consider him as his immediate benefactor."


# BHT:
When speaking or teaching, one should do so with a profound sense of responsibility, as if speaking the very words of God Himself. In doing so, we must align our words and actions with the teachings of the Scriptures, which serve as a divine revelation. It is crucial to recognize God as the ultimate source of strength and guidance in our ministry, focusing on bringing glory to Him rather than ourselves. Thus, our role is to faithfully deliver the message, understanding that we are mere vessels through which His wisdom and grace flow.
