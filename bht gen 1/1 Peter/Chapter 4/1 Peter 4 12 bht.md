# 1 Peter 4:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Believers should not be surprised or bewildered by the hardships and trials they face, including persecution and suffering, as it is a common experience for followers of Christ. These afflictions serve as a refining fire, testing and strengthening the faith and commitment of believers. The persecution faced by early Christians, often through martyrdom by fire, exemplifies the intensity of the trials endured. This suffering, permitted by God's wisdom, serves a greater purpose in shaping and deepening the spiritual lives of believers.
