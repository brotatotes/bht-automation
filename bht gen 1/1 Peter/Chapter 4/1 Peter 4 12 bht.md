# choicest prompt v1 X bht prompt v3; ['Henry Alford', 'Jamieson Fausset Brown', 'Albert Barnes', 'Marvin Vincent', 'John Calvin', 'Philip Schaff', 'Archibald T Robertson', 'Adam Clarke']

## Henry Alford:
1. "Beloved, be not astonished at the passing through the fire, which is taking place in your case, for a trial to you." 
2. "The passing through the fire, in its later use, smelting, trying of metal by fire."
3. "The πύρωσις in your case happening for a πειρασμός to you."

## Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "They might think it strange that God should allow His chosen children to be sore tried."
2. "Fiery trial - like the fire by which metals are tested and their dross removed."
3. "Instead of its 'happening to you' as some strange and untoward chance, it 'is taking place' with the gracious design of trying you; God has a wise design in it - a consolatory reflection."

## Albert Barnes:
1. "Do not consider it as anything which you had no reason to expect; as anything which may not happen to others also."
2. "Referring, doubtless, to some severe persecution which was then impending."
3. "It cannot be demonstrated from this word that they were literally to suffer by fire, but it is clear that some heavy calamity was before them."

## Marvin Vincent:
1. "Think it not strange... alien from you and your condition as Christians." 
2. "The word means burning... as silver is smelted." 
3. "The A. V. thus makes the trial a thing of the future... represents the trial as actually in progress."

## John Calvin:
1. "That we may then be in a prepared state of mind when the waves of persecutions roll over us, we ought in due time to habituate ourselves to such an event by meditating continually on the cross."
2. "However, the chief consolation is to be derived from a fellowship with Christ. Hence Peter not only forbids us to think it strange, when he sets this before us, but also bids us to rejoice."
3. "For we must bear in mind this truth, that we have the dying of Christ in our flesh, that his life may be manifested in us."

## Philip Schaff:
1. "What he says first of all is to deprecate their looking on their trials as things beyond understanding or expectation."
2. "The trial itself is expressed by a term which is well represented by the ‘fiery trial’ of the A. V."
3. "The ‘which is to try you’ of the A. V. makes that future which Peter gives as present. The trial was then taking place, as the terms imply, and that with the object of proving and so purifying them."

## Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Be not amazed."
2. "Instrumental case, 'by the among you burning,' metaphorical sense of old word."
3. "Present middle participle of γινομα (already coming) with dative case υμιν."

## Adam Clarke:
1. "The metaphor is old, but noble; it represents the Christians at Pontus as having fire cast upon them for the trying of their faith, as gold is tried by fire." 
2. "He intimates that it was not a strange or unusual thing for the people of God to be persecuted."
3. "If they suffered here as Christ did, they should hereafter be glorified with him."


# BHT:
In this verse, the commentators warn believers not to be surprised or astonished by the trials and persecutions they face, as it is not something unexpected or uncommon. The trials can be compared to passing through fire, a metaphorical smelting process that tests and refines their faith. Despite the sufferings, there is comfort in knowing that these trials are not random, but have a purpose in proving and purifying them, ultimately leading to glorification and a closer fellowship with Christ.
