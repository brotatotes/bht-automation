# choicest prompt v1 X bht prompt v3; ['Henry Alford', 'Jamieson Fausset Brown', 'Albert Barnes', 'Marvin Vincent', 'John Calvin', 'Philip Schaff', 'Archibald T Robertson', 'Adam Clarke']

## Henry Alford:
1. "Ye are partakers with the sufferings of Christ... have a share, in your own persons, of those sufferings which He personally bare." 
2. "It is not the sufferings of Christ mystical in His Body the church which are meant: in these the readers might bear their part, but could hardly be said κοινωνεῖν."
3. "Rejoice... ye may also at the revelation of His glory rejoice... exulting."

## Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "By suffering, we become partakers of Christ's sufferings, entering into a realizing fellowship with Him." 
2. "We willingly suffer for His sake, just as He suffered for us." 
3. "Now, amidst our sufferings, we can rejoice with exulting joy. But in the future, we shall exult forever, free from all sufferings."

## Albert Barnes:
1. "They were to regard it as a matter of rejoicing that they were identified with Christ, even in suffering."
2. "Being admitted to the rewards which he will then confer on his people."
3. "Every good man will have joy when, immediately at death, he is received into the presence of his Saviour; but his joy will be complete only when, in the presence of assembled worlds, he shall hear the sentence which shall confirm him in happiness forever."

## Marvin Vincent:
1. "Inasmuch as ye are partakers." - This phrase highlights the idea that believers are not merely observers or bystanders, but active participants in the blessings and inheritance of Christ. It emphasizes the intimate relationship between believers and their shared identity with Christ.

2. "Be glad with exceeding joy [χαρητε αγαλλιωμενοι]." - This exhortation encourages believers to not just experience joy, but to rejoice with an overwhelming and exultant joy. It suggests that the joy of believers should be marked by an intensity and exuberance that goes beyond ordinary happiness.

3. "Ye may rejoice exulting." - This phrase emphasizes the voluntary nature of rejoicing. It implies that believers have the choice to actively engage in rejoicing and to do so with great enthusiasm and celebration. It suggests that rejoicing is not a passive response, but a deliberate and intentional act of worship and gratitude.

## John Calvin:
1. "The whole consolation of the godly...that hereafter they may be partakers of his glory."
2. "The day of its revelation is not to be overlooked, but ought to be expected."
3. "The first is mingled with grief and sorrow, the second is connected with exultation."

## Philip Schaff:
1. "The fellowship intended is fellowship with Christ in the things which He Himself suffered. Peter is not referring apparently to the deep mystery of a fellowship of life between Christ and believers in all things, but to the simple fact that the world hates Christians because it hates Christ in them, and they, therefore, have to endure the same contradiction of sinners which He had to endure." 

2. "The only sufferings which can bring us joy are those which we share with Him, sufferings like His. And the measure of the participation is the measure of the joy."

3. "There is a present joy, a 'light sown for the righteous, a gladness for the upright in heart' (Psalms 97:11), which suffering, instead of quenching it, should kindle. And there is the joy which the unveiling of the glory of the once suffering Christ shall bring with it, a joy 'exultant' surpassing this life’s measure."

## Archibald T Robertson:
1. "In so far forth as" ("according to which thing")
2. "Ye are partakers of"
3. "That ye may rejoice with exceeding joy"


# BHT:
Believers are called to embrace a profound connection with Christ, sharing not only in His sufferings but also in His glory. This fellowship grants them the privilege to rejoice with a joy that surpasses ordinary happiness. It is a voluntary and intentional act of worship, as they eagerly anticipate the day when the glory of the suffering Christ will be revealed and their exultant joy will be fulfilled. This shared identity with Christ compels them to endure the world's opposition and find solace in the consolation of participating in both suffering and glory.
