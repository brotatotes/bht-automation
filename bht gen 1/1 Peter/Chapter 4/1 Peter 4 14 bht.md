2. "Reproach affects noble minds more than loss of goods, or even bodily sufferings."
3. "Believers may well overcome the 'reproach'... seeing that 'the Spirit of glory' rests upon them, as upon Him."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The sense of the word 'happy' here is the same as 'blessed' in Matthew 5:3-5, etc. It means that they were to regard their condition or lot as a blessed one."
2. "If they were called to suffer in the cause of the Redeemer, they would not be left or forsaken. They might hope that God would impart his Spirit to them in proportion to their sufferings in behalf of religion, and that they would have augmented joy and peace."
3. "In sickness, bereavement, loss of property, disappointment in their worldly plans, and death itself, they may hope that larger measures of the Spirit’s influences will rest upon them."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The repetition of the article identifies the spirit of God with the spirit of glory: the spirit of glory, and therefore the spirit of God: who is none other than the spirit of God himself."
2. "Resteth. Compare Isaiah 11:2; Luke 10:6; Numbers 11:25, Numbers 11:26; Mark 6:31; Matthew 26:45; Revelation 14:13. Also, Matthew 11:28, where the word is used in the active voice, to give rest or refreshment."
3. "The spirit of glory and the spirit of God."

### John Calvin:
1. "To obviate this evil, Peter pronounces those blessed, according to what Christ says, (Mark 8:35,) who are reproached for the sake of the Gospel."
2. "Then Peter shews, that it is no hindrance to the happiness of the godly, that they sustain reproach for the name of Christ, because they nevertheless retain a complete glory in the sight of God, while the Spirit, who has glory ever connected with him, dwells in them."
3. "He intimates that it is enough for the godly, that the Spirit of God testifies that the reproaches endured for the sake of the Gospel, are blessed and full of glory."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The phrase ‘in the name of Christ,’ which is paraphrased by both the A. V. and the R. V. as ‘for the name of Christ,’ is best interpreted, as is done by most, in the light of Christ’s own explanation in Mark 9:41 in my name, because ye belong to Christ. It covers, therefore, all kinds of reproach endured on account of bearing Christ’s name and belonging to Him."
2. "The sentence, however, is understood by most to contain two titles (some of the oldest manuscripts, indeed, make them three, by inserting the words ‘and of power’ after ‘glory’) of the same Spirit. He is first described as the Spirit of glory, i.e to whom glory belong whose nature is glory, and whose gilt, therefore, is also glory; as God also has the titles ‘the God of glory’ (Acts 7:2), and ‘the Father of glory’ (Ephesians 1:17). And it is then added that this Spirit is God’s Spirit."
3. "His relation to suffering Christians is described as a resting upon them. The word is one which, either in itself or in a compound form, occurs in several suggestive passages of the O. T., in Numbers 11:25-26, of the prophetic Spirit resting on the seventy elders; in 2 Kings 2:15, of the spirit of Elijah resting on Elisha; and above all in Isaiah 11:2 (which is probably in Peter’s mind here), of the Spirit of the Lord that was to rest upon Messiah."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "If ye are reproached (ε ονειδιζεσθε)...For the name of Christ (εν ονοματ Χριστου)." 
2. "This is the only N.T. example of just ονομα Χριστου, here used because of the use of Χριστιανος in verse 1 Peter 4:16."
3. "The Spirit of glory and the Spirit of God (το της δοξης κα το του θεου πνευμα). Note repetition of the article (το) though πνευμα only once."

### John Gill:
1. "For the Spirit of glory, and of God, resteth upon you; alluding to Isaiah 11:2... and his resting on them denotes his inhabitation in them, and his abiding with them, and remaining in them; and which appears by the comfort they enjoy in their souls amidst all the reproaches and revilings of men, and by the strength which they have to bear up under and endure shame and persecution for the sake of Christ; and which casts an honour upon them, and makes them both glorious and cheerful."

2. "The Jews have a saying that the Holy Ghost does not dwell on any, but on him that has a cheerful heart."

3. "On the part of the revilers, the person, office, work, and grace, the operations and influences of the Spirit are blasphemed and ridiculed; but on the part of the sufferers he is glorified; inasmuch as they continue to bear a testimony to his grace, depend upon his strength, and ascribe all their comfort and gracious experience unto him."

### John Wesley:
1. "Reproaches and cruel mockings were always one part of their sufferings."
2. "The Spirit of glory and of God resteth upon you."
3. "While they are blaspheming Christ, you glorify him in the midst of your sufferings."
