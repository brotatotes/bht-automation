# choicest prompt v1 X bht prompt v3; ['Henry Alford', 'Jamieson Fausset Brown', 'Albert Barnes', 'Marvin Vincent', 'John Calvin', 'Philip Schaff', 'Archibald T Robertson', 'Adam Clarke']

## Henry Alford:
1. "If ye are reproached in the name of Christ... blessed are ye, because the Spirit of glory and that of God resteth upon you." 
2. "The Apostle does not mean, by repeating the art., two different spirits, but identifies the same Spirit under two different denominations: the Spirit of glory, which is also the Spirit of God."
3. "On you, as on Him: cf. also Numbers 11:25-26; Numbers 4:0 Kings 1 Peter 2:15."

## Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Let your suffering be on account of Christ, not on account of evil-doing."
2. "Reproach affects noble minds more than loss of goods, or even bodily sufferings."
3. "Believers may well overcome the 'reproach'... seeing that 'the Spirit of glory' rests upon them, as upon Him."

## Albert Barnes:
1. "The sense of the word 'happy' here is the same as 'blessed' in Matthew 5:3-5, etc. It means that they were to regard their condition or lot as a blessed one."
2. "It would be a blessed condition, because it would be like that of their Saviour; would show that they were his friends; would be accompanied with rich spiritual influences in the present world; and would be followed by the rewards of heaven."
3. "If they were called to suffer in the cause of the Redeemer, they would not be left or forsaken. They might hope that God would impart his Spirit to them in proportion to their sufferings in behalf of religion, and that they would have augmented joy and peace."

## Marvin Vincent:
1. "The repetition of the article identifies the spirit of God with the spirit of glory: the spirit of glory, and therefore the spirit of God: who is none other than the spirit of God himself."
2. "Resteth. Compare Isaiah 11:2; Luke 10:6; Numbers 11:25, Numbers 11:26; Mark 6:31; Matthew 26:45; Revelation 14:13. Also, Matthew 11:28, where the word is used in the active voice, to give rest or refreshment."
3. "The spirit of glory and the spirit of God."

## John Calvin:
1. "There is often more bitterness in [reproaches] than in the loss of goods, or in the torments or agonies of the body."
2. "Peter pronounces those blessed, according to what Christ says, who are reproached for the sake of the Gospel."
3. "It is no hindrance to the happiness of the godly, that they sustain reproach for the name of Christ, because they nevertheless retain a complete glory in the sight of God, while the Spirit, who has glory ever connected with him, dwells in them."

## Philip Schaff:
1. "The phrase ‘in the name of Christ,’ which is paraphrased by both the A. V. and the R. V. as ‘for the name of Christ,’ is best interpreted, as is done by most, in the light of Christ’s own explanation in Mark 9:41 in my name, because ye belong to Christ. It covers, therefore, all kinds of reproach endured on account of bearing Christ’s name and belonging to Him."
2. "The sentence, however, is understood by most to contain two titles (some of the oldest manuscripts, indeed, make them three, by inserting the words ‘and of power’ after ‘glory’) of the same Spirit. He is first described as the Spirit of glory, i.e to whom glory belong whose nature is glory, and whose gilt, therefore, is also glory; as God also has the titles ‘the God of glory’ (Acts 7:2), and ‘the Father of glory’ (Ephesians 1:17)."
3. "This is the reason why even in reproach and persecution they are ‘blessed.’ They whom the Spirit thus visits, though the shame of the Cross in heathen eyes may be theirs, have glory already with them; for He is the Spirit whose nature glory is, and where He enters, there the earnest of all glory is. They with whom the Spirit is pleased to dwell, have God Himself with them; for He is the Spirit of God, and where that presence is, there is rest."

## Archibald T Robertson:
1. "If ye are reproached...for the name of Christ." - This verse highlights the potential for believers to face reproach and persecution because of their association with Christ. (Quote 1)
2. "The Spirit of glory and the Spirit of God." - This phrase emphasizes the divine nature of the Holy Spirit, who brings both glory and the presence of God to believers. (Quote 2)
3. "He rests upon the Christian as the Shechinah rested upon the tabernacle." - This comparison draws a parallel between the indwelling of the Holy Spirit in believers and the presence of God in the tabernacle, signifying the sacredness and significance of this relationship. (Quote 3)

## Adam Clarke:
1. "To be reproached for the name of Christ is to be reproached for being a Christian, that is, for being like Christ. This is the highest honour to which any man can arrive in this world." 
2. "The Spirit of glory and of God resteth upon you. As this Divine Spirit rested upon Jesus, so does it rest upon his persecuted followers."
3. "What constituted them unhappy in the sight of the world was their chief happiness in the sight of God; they carried Christ the fountain of blessedness in their heart, and therefore could not be unhappy."


# BHT:
In this verse, believers are encouraged to embrace the reproach they may face for the sake of Christ. The Holy Spirit, referred to as the Spirit of glory and of God, accompanies and supports them through these difficulties. This divine Spirit, which rested upon Jesus, now rests upon believers, signifying their sacred connection to Christ. Though they may be deemed unhappy by the world, their true happiness lies in carrying Christ in their hearts, making them blessed in the eyes of God.
