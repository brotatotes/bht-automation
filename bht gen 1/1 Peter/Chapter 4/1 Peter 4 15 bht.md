# choicest prompt v1 X bht prompt v3; ['Henry Alford', 'Jamieson Fausset Brown', 'Albert Barnes', 'Marvin Vincent', 'John Calvin', 'Philip Schaff', 'Archibald T Robertson', 'Adam Clarke']

## Henry Alford:
1. "Let no one of you suffer as a murderer or a malefactor." - This quote emphasizes the importance of avoiding actions that would bring reproach or persecution upon oneself as a Christian.

2. "Do not suffer as a prier into other men's matters." - This quote highlights the need to refrain from being overly curious or judgmental about the actions of non-believers, as it is not within the Christian's calling to act as judges in such matters.

3. "The word probably alludes to the ἐπίσκοπος of the church, combining it with ἀλλοτριο - to show the incongruity." - This quote suggests that the term "a prier into other men's matters" may refer to those Christians who, out of thoughtlessness or impulsiveness, meddle in the affairs of unbelievers and try to pass judgment on them, which is incongruous with their true calling.

## Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Reproached in the name of Christ" - This phrase highlights the potential consequences of being a busybody in other people's matters. It implies that Christians who meddle in the affairs of unbelievers may face reproach or criticism, possibly because they are overstepping their boundaries or acting self-righteously.

2. "Mistaken zeal, under the plea of faithfulness" - This quote suggests that Christians may sometimes act out of misguided enthusiasm, believing that they are being faithful to their calling. However, the commentary warns against using this zeal as an excuse to judge or interfere in the lives of others.

3. "A bishop in what is (not his own, but) another's province" - This phrase uses the metaphor of a bishop or overseer to describe the behavior of a busybody. It implies that when Christians involve themselves in the affairs of others, they are assuming a position of authority or control that does not rightfully belong to them. This serves as a caution against overstepping boundaries and interfering in areas that are not within one's own responsibility.

## Albert Barnes:
1. "If you must be called to suffer, see that it be not for crime."
2. "They were to be careful that their sufferings were brought upon them only in consequence of their religion, and not because any crime could be laid to their charge."
3. "Or as a busy-body in other men’s matters - one who pries into the affairs of another; who attempts to control or direct them as if they were his own."

## Marvin Vincent:
1. "A busybody in other men's matters." - This phrase refers to someone who meddles in the affairs of others without any authority or right to do so.
2. "One who usurps authority in matters not within his province." - It describes someone who takes control or interferes in matters that do not concern them, overstepping their boundaries.
3. "It may refer to the officious interference of Christians in the affairs of their Gentile neighbors, through excess of zeal to conform them to the Christian standard." - This suggests that the commentary sees the verse as cautioning against Christians who, out of excessive zeal, try to impose their beliefs and standards on non-believers.

## John Calvin:
1. "It behoved Christians to deserve well of all, even when they were badly and cruelly treated by the world."
2. "The Apostle commands Christians to be such as they ought to be."
3. "Though there are always many sins in the elect, which God might justly punish, yet according to his paternal indulgence he spares his own children."

## Philip Schaff:
1. "It is of reproach in the name of Christ, and of that only, that I speak; for let no one suppose that he can suffer with just cause as an evil-doer, and yet have the blessedness that I affirm."
2. "The fourth form of evil is marked off, by the repetition of the 'as,' from the former three as of a different kind and gravity."
3. "The term points, therefore, to an offence, which came as close to the peculiar temptations of Christians, as the other three forms of evil seemed to lie at a distance from them."

## Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Let no one of you suffer." - This verse emphasizes the prohibition against suffering, indicating that believers should not willingly endure harm or injustice.
2. "Two specific crimes (murderer, thief) and one general phrase (evildoer)." - The commentary highlights the specific sins mentioned in the verse, indicating that Christians should not be involved in acts of violence or theft.
3. "The idea is apparently one who spies out the affairs of other men." - This quote explains the meaning of the term "meddler in other men's matters," suggesting that it refers to someone who intrudes into the private affairs of others.

## Adam Clarke:
1. "Meddling with other people's concerns, and forgetting their own; such persons are hated of all men."
2. "Meddle not with the affairs of state, leave public offices and public officers to their own master."
3. "Strive to live peaceably with all men, and show yourselves to be humble and unaspiring."
