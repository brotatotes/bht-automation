# choicest prompt v1 X bht prompt v3; ['Henry Alford', 'Jamieson Fausset Brown', 'Albert Barnes', 'Marvin Vincent', 'John Calvin', 'Philip Schaff', 'Archibald T Robertson', 'Adam Clarke']

## Henry Alford:
1. "But if he suffer as a Christian, let him not be ashamed, but let him glorify God in this name." - This verse emphasizes that even in the face of suffering and persecution, Christians should not be ashamed of their faith. Instead, they should glorify God and find honor in being identified as followers of Christ.

2. "The word appears here, as in Acts 26:28, to be used as carrying contempt, from the mouth of an adversary." - The term "Christian" was originally used as a derogatory label by those who opposed the faith. This highlights the reality that believers may face ridicule and contempt for their beliefs, but they should remain steadfast and unashamed.

3. "Let him glorify God in this name, viz. that of χριστιανός: at, or in, the fact that he is counted worthy to suffer by such a name." - The commentary suggests that believers should find glory and honor in the fact that they are considered worthy to suffer for the name of Christ. It encourages them to see their suffering as a testament to their faith and a way to bring glory to God.

## Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "The rise of the new name marked a new epoch in the Church's life, a new stage of its development, namely, its missions to the Gentiles."
2. "To suffer for one's own faults is no honor, for Christ, is no shame."
3. "But the honor is to be given to God, who counts him worthy of such an honor, involving exemption from the coming judgments on the ungodly."

## Albert Barnes:
1. "He is to regard his religion as every way honorable, and all that fairly results from it in time and eternity as in every respect desirable."
2. "A man should be ashamed only of that which is wrong. He should glory in that which is right, whatever may be the consequences to himself."
3. "We are never to be ashamed of our religion, whatever results may follow from our attachment to it."

## Marvin Vincent:
1. "A Christian. Only three times in the New Testament, and never as a name used by Christians themselves, but as a nickname or a term of reproach." 

2. "Hence Peter's idea is, if any man suffer from the contumely of those who contemptuously style him Christian." 

3. "If any man suffer from the contumely of those who contemptuously style him Christian."

## John Calvin:
1. "And truly it is no common kindness from God, that he calls us, freed and exempted from the common punishment of our sins, to so honorable a warfare as to undergo for the testimony of his Gospel either exiles, or prisons, or reproaches, or even death itself."
2. "But when he says, as a Christian, he regards not so much the name as the cause. It is certain that the adversaries of Christ omitted nothing in order to degrade the Gospel. Therefore, whatever reproachful words they made use of, it was enough for the faithful, that they suffered for nothing else but for the defense of the Gospel."
3. "For since all afflictions derive their origin from sin, this thought ought to occur to the godly, 'I am indeed worthy to be visited by the Lord with this and even with greater punishment for my sins; but now he would have me to suffer for righteousness, as though I were innocent.' For how much soever the saints may acknowledge their own faults, yet as in persecutions they regard a different end, such as the Lord sets before them, they feel that their guilt is blotted out and abolished before God. On this behalf, then, they have reason to glorify God."

## Philip Schaff:
1. "The verse is of great interest as one of three passages (Acts 11:20; Acts 26:28, and this one) to which the occurrence of the name Christian in the New Testament is limited, and the only passage of the kind in the Epistles."
2. "The name which was thus made for the Church by those outside it, was soon adopted by Christians themselves, and gloried in as their most proper title, while it as soon became a term of obloquy with others."
3. "Those who were called to suffer for being Christians were to regard that not as a shameful thing, but as an honourable, and they were to suffer not in the spirit which took honour to themselves, but in that which gave all the glory to the God who counted them worthy of such a vocation."

## Archibald T Robertson:
1. "It is word of Latin formation coined to distinguish followers of Christ from Jews and Gentiles."
2. "The Jews used Ναζωραιο (Nazarenes) as a nickname for Christians."
3. "Peter had once been ashamed to suffer reproach or even a sneer for being a disciple of Christ."

## Adam Clarke:
1. "Let him not be ashamed, but let him rather glorify God on this very account." - The commentary emphasizes that instead of feeling ashamed, a persecuted Christian should take pride in their faith and use their suffering as an opportunity to glorify God.

2. "Christ suffered by the Jews because he was holy; Christians suffer because they resemble him." - This quote highlights the connection between the suffering of Christ and the suffering of Christians. It suggests that persecution is a result of Christians striving to live a holy life and imitate Christ.

3. "The word χριστιανος, Christian, is used only here and in Acts 11:26; Acts 26:28." - This statement provides additional information about the term "Christian," indicating that it is a relatively rare word used to describe followers of Christ.


# BHT:
In this verse, the commentator notes that when a Christian suffers, they should not be ashamed but rather use their suffering as an opportunity to glorify God. The suffering is seen as a result of believers resembling Christ and striving to live a holy life. Although the term "Christian" is used rarely in the New Testament, it signifies followers of Christ who may face persecution for their faith.
