### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "God's own household first, their chastisement being here, for which they should glorify Him as a proof of their membership in His family, and a pledge of their escape from the end of those whom the last judgment shall find disobedient to the Gospel."

3. "If even the godly have chastening judgments now, how much more shall the ungodly be doomed to damnatory judgments at last."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "That judgment must begin - The word 'judgment' here (κρίμα krima) seems to mean 'the severe trial which would determine character.' It refers to such calamities as would settle the question whether there was any religion, or would test the value of that which was professed."
2. "The sense here is, therefore, that the series of calamities referred to were to commence with the church, or were to come first upon the people of God."
3. "If God brings such trials upon us who have obeyed his gospel, what have we not reason to suppose he will bring upon those who are yet in their sins? And if we are selected first as the objects of this visitation, if there is that in us which requires such a method of dealing, what are we to suppose will occur in the end with those who make no pretensions to religion, but are yet living in open transgression?"

### John Calvin:
1. "For except we desire to be blotted out from the number of the faithful, we must submit our backs to the scourges of God."
2. "It is a sweet consolation, that God does not execute his judgments on us as on others, but that he makes us the representatives of his own Son, when we do not suffer except for his cause and for his name."
3. "God so regulates his judgments in this world, that he fattens the wicked for the day of slaughter. He therefore passes by their many sins, and, as it were, connives at them. In the meantime, he restores by corrections his own children, for whom he has a care, to the right way, whenever they depart from it."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The judgment is conceived of as a process which makes the house of God its starting-point, which is even now commencing there in the Church’s baptism of suffering, and which cannot stop there." 
2. "To the ‘house of God’ itself this judgment was a process of sifting and separation, a judgment like that referred to by Paul (1 Corinthians 11:31), which had for its object that those tried by it should not be condemned with the world." 
3. "The judgment of God works its searching course out of the Church into the world of heathenism. And if it visits even the household of faith as a refining fire, what end can it portend for those who withstand the Gospel of Him whose prerogative judgment is?"

### John Gill:
1. "By the house of God is either meant the temple at Jerusalem, which is often so called, because it was built for God, and where were the symbol of his presence, and his worship; and now the time was come, or at hand, that God would begin at his sanctuary, and leave this house desolate, and not one stone should be left upon another, as Christ had foretold."
2. "And by judgment is meant, not punishment for sin, strictly speaking, because Christ has endured this in the room and stead of his church and people, and therefore in justice cannot be inflicted on them; but afflictions and persecutions, and which are fatherly chastisements, and different from God's judgment on the world, and condemnation with it."
3. "The first times of Christianity, or of the preaching of the Gospel, were times of trouble and distress; for as it was necessary the Gospel should be confirmed by signs and wonders, so that it should be tried and proved by the sufferings of the saints for it."

### John Wesley:
1. "The time is come for judgment to begin at the house of God" - God's judgment starts with his own people, holding them accountable for their actions and testing their faithfulness.

2. "God first visits his church, and that both in justice and mercy" - God's judgment is not solely punitive, but also an opportunity for his people to experience his mercy and receive correction.

3. "What shall the end be of them that obey not the gospel" - Those who reject the gospel and refuse to obey will face severe consequences, as God's judgments become increasingly severe over time.
