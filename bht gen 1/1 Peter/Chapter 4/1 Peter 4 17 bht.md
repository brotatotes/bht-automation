# choicest prompt v1 X bht prompt v3; ['Henry Alford', 'Jamieson Fausset Brown', 'Albert Barnes', 'Marvin Vincent', 'John Calvin', 'Philip Schaff', 'Archibald T Robertson', 'Adam Clarke']

## Henry Alford:
1. "It is the season of the judgment beginning at the house of God." 
2. "The reference is to prophecies like Jeremiah 25:15 ff., Ezekiel 9:6; Amos 3:2."
3. "The argument, 'a minori ad majus,' see expanded above. Cf. our Lord's question, Luke 23:31, εἰ ἐν τῷ ὑγρῷ ξύλῳ ταῦτα ποιοῦσιν, ἐν τῷ ξηρῷ τί γένηται?"

## Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "God's own household first, their chastisement being here, for which they should glorify Him as a proof of their membership in His family."
2. "Judgment is already begun, the Gospel word, as a 'two-edged sword,' having the double effect of saving some and condemning others."
3. "If even the godly have chastening judgments now, how much more shall the ungodly be doomed to damnatory judgments at last."

## Albert Barnes:
1. "That judgment must begin - The word 'judgment' here (κρίμα krima) seems to mean 'the severe trial which would determine character.' It refers to such calamities as would settle the question whether there was any religion, or would test the value of that which was professed."
2. "The sense here is, therefore, that the series of calamities referred to were to commence with the church, or were to come first upon the people of God."
3. "If God brings such trials upon us who have obeyed his gospel, what have we not reason to suppose he will bring upon those who are yet in their sins? And if we are selected first as the objects of this visitation, if there is that in us which requires such a method of dealing, what are we to suppose will occur in the end with those who make no pretensions to religion, but are yet living in open transgression?"

## John Calvin:
1. "For except we desire to be blotted out from the number of the faithful, we must submit our backs to the scourges of God."
2. "It is a sweet consolation, that God does not execute his judgments on us as on others, but that he makes us the representatives of his own Son, when we do not suffer except for his cause and for his name."
3. "God so regulates his judgments in this world, that he fattens the wicked for the day of slaughter. He therefore passes by their many sins, and, as it were, connives at them. In the meantime, he restores by corrections his own children, for whom he has a care, to the right way, whenever they depart from it."

## Philip Schaff:
1. "The judgment is conceived of as a process which makes the house of God its starting-point, which is even now commencing there in the Church’s baptism of suffering, and which cannot stop there." 
2. "To the ‘house of God’ itself this judgment was a process of sifting and separation, a judgment like that referred to by Paul (1 Corinthians 11:31), which had for its object that those tried by it should not be condemned with the world." 
3. "The judgment of God works its searching course out of the Church into the world of heathenism. And if it visits even the household of faith as a refining fire, what end can it portend for those who withstand the Gospel of Him whose prerogative judgment is?"

## Archibald T Robertson:
1. "The phrase that follows comes from the vision of Ezekiel (chapter 1 Peter 4:9)."
2. "The persecution on hand (1 Peter 1:7) was a foretaste of more to come."
3. "By 'house of God' he can mean the same as the 'spiritual house' of 1 Peter 2:5 or a local church."

## Adam Clarke:
1. "Judgment must begin at the house of God" - Our Lord had predicted that, previously to the destruction of Jerusalem, his own followers would have to endure various calamities.

2. "That the converted Jews suffered much from their own brethren, the zealots, or factions into which the Jews were at that time divided, needs little proof."

3. "It was a Jewish maxim that, when God was about to pour down some general judgment, he began with afflicting his own people in order to correct and amend them, that they might be prepared for the overflowing scourge."


# BHT:
Amidst the turmoil and trials faced by the early Christians, the verse speaks of a judgment that commences first within the family of believers. This process of refinement is likened to the cleansing fires of God's correction, reminiscent of past prophecies and patterns of divine judgment. As the faithful experience these trials, it serves both as a proof of their membership in God's household and as preparation for the greater judgments that await those who reject the Gospel. Through these sufferings, God is purifying His people and distinguishing them from the unbelieving world.
