# choicest prompt v1 X bht prompt v3; ['Henry Alford', 'Jamieson Fausset Brown', 'Albert Barnes', 'Marvin Vincent', 'John Calvin', 'Philip Schaff', 'Archibald T Robertson', 'Adam Clarke']

## Henry Alford:
1. "The citation is verbatim from the LXX, except that μέν is omitted between ὁ and δίκαιος." 
2. "if the righteous is with difficulty saved, on account of the sharpness of the trial, and his own weakness." 
3. "the ungodly and sinner, where shall he appear?"

## Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "The 'scarcely' marks the severity of the ordeal, and the unlikelihood (in a mere human point of view) of the righteous sustaining it; but the righteousness of Christ and God's everlasting covenant make it all sure."
2. "The righteous man has always more or less of trial, but the issue is certain, and the entrance into the kingdom abundant at last."
3. "The same man is at once God-forgetting and sin-loving."

## Albert Barnes:
1. "The word implies that there is some difficulty, or obstruction, so that the thing came very near not to happen, or so that there was much risk about it."
2. "The difficulty of forming a plan of salvation, involving a degree of wisdom wholly beyond that of man, and of such a character that beforehand it would have been problematical and doubtful whether it could be."
3. "Often it seems to be wholly doubtful whether those who have been converted will be kept to eternal life. They have so little religion; they yield so readily to temptation; they conform so much to the world; they have so little strength to bear up under trials, that it seems as if there was no power to preserve them and bring them to heaven."

## John Calvin:
1. "The design of what he says, as I have already stated, is to shew that the children of God should not faint under the bitterness of present evils, but that they ought, on the contrary, calmly to bear their afflictions for a short time, as the issue will be salvation, while the ungodly will have to exchange a fading and fleeting prosperity for eternal perdition."
2. "But the argument is from the less to the greater; for if God spares not his own children whom he loves and who obey him, how dreadful will be his severity against enemies and such as are rebellious!"
3. "And this is said, lest we should securely indulge ourselves, but carefully proceed in our course, and lest we should also seek the smooth and easy road, the end of which is a terrible precipice."

## Philip Schaff:
1. "If the righteous man has his reward on earth, much more shall the unrighteous man be requited for his sins." 
2. "The word rendered 'scarcely'...indicates with what difficulty and at what cost even the man who is in a right relation with God, is made secure in the judgment." 
3. "How shall it be with the man who, as being both careless of God and in practice a sinner, is in a wrong relation to the Judge?"

## Archibald T Robertson:
1. "The Christian is not saved by his own righteousness." (Philippians 3:9; Revelation 7:14)
2. "The righteous is scarcely saved." (Quotation from Proverbs 11:31)
3. "For the question see Mark 10:24-26."

## Adam Clarke:
1. "If the righteous scarcely be saved, where shall the ungodly and the sinner appear?" - This verse highlights the extreme difficulty faced by Christians in escaping the impending destruction of Jerusalem, emphasizing the dire fate of the ungodly and sinful.
2. "Behold, to the righteous it shall be returned on the earth; and also to the wicked and the transgressor." - The original Hebrew text suggests that both the righteous and the wicked will face recompense on earth, further emphasizing the consequences of their actions.
3. "When Cestius Gallus came against Jerusalem, many Christians were shut up in it; when he strangely raised the siege the Christians immediately departed to Pella in Coele-syria, into the dominions of King Agrippa, and there they were in safety." - This historical context reveals how Christians managed to escape the destruction of Jerusalem by fleeing to Pella, highlighting the fulfillment of the verse's warning.


# BHT:
"The righteous is scarcely saved," warns the verse, resonating with the struggles faced by Christians in escaping the impending destruction of Jerusalem. While highlighting the extreme difficulty faced by the righteous, it also leaves us contemplating the fate of the ungodly and sinful. In the face of impending judgment, the consequences of one's actions are made clear, as demonstrated by the historical account of Christians seeking refuge in Pella to escape the destruction.
