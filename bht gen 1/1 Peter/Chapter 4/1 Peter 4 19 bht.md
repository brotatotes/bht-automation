## Henry Alford:
1. "If the sufferings of Christians as Christians are a sign of God’s favour towards them, in subjecting them to His judgments, with a view to their not perishing with the ungodly world, then have they every reason to trust Him in those sufferings, and to take comfort." 
2. "Continuing in that same well-doing which is their very element and condition."
3. "This addition, ἐν ἀγαθοπ ., shews that the confident surrender to God is to be joined, not with careless indolence, but with active practice of good."

## Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Seeing that the godly know that their sufferings are by God's will, to chasten them that they may not perish with the world, they have good reason to trust God cheerfully amidst sufferings, persevering in well-doing."
2. "God's will that the believer should suffer is for his good."
3. "Our committing of ourselves to God is to be, not in indolent and passive quietism, but accompanied with active well-doings."

## Marvin Vincent:
1. "Commit [παρατιθεσθωσαν]. Give in charge as a deposit." - This quote highlights the idea that surrendering ourselves to God is like entrusting a valuable deposit into His care. It implies a sense of trust and reliance on God's faithfulness.

2. "The surrender to God is to be coupled with the active practice of good." - This quote emphasizes the importance of not only surrendering to God but also actively living out our faith through good deeds. It suggests that true surrender involves a transformation of our actions and behavior.

3. "The word is used by Christ in commending his soul to God (Luke 23:46)." - This quote references Luke 23:46, where Jesus uses the same word to commend His soul to God. It adds depth to the concept of surrender, showing that even Jesus Himself entrusted His life to God in the ultimate act of surrender.

## John Calvin:
1. "Persecutions ought to be submissively endured, for the condition of the godly in them is much happier than that of the unbelieving, who enjoy prosperity to their utmost wishes."
2. "We suffer nothing except according to the permission of God, which tends much to comfort us."
3. "Let them commit themselves to God, it is the same as though he had said, 'Let them deliver themselves and their life to the safe keeping of God.'"

## Philip Schaff:
1. "The advice with which the train of thought is brought to a close worthy of it, is to fearless faith and earnest well-doing."
2. "The 'according to the will of God' does not refer to the submissive spirit in which the sufferers endure, but to the animating consideration that their sufferings come only by God's purpose."
3. "Their souls are regarded as a deposit which they should be willing to leave confidently in God's hands... The God who is to be confidently trusted with so precious a deposit is designated a faithful Creator."

These quotes highlight the importance of having fearless faith, understanding that suffering comes by God's purpose, and entrusting our souls to God as a faithful Creator.

## Archibald T Robertson:

2. "In well-doing (εν αγαθοποιια). Late and rare word, only here in N.T., from αγαθοποιεω (1 Peter 2:15; 1 Peter 2:20)."

3. "Picking up the thread of consolation again (Bigg)."

## Adam Clarke:
1. "A man suffers according to the will of God who suffers for righteousness' sake; and who, being reviled, reviles not again." 

2. "Commit the keeping of their souls — Place their lives confidently in his hand, who, being their Creator, will also be their preserver, and keep that safely which is committed to his trust."

3. "He who is employed in God's work will have God's protection. The path of duty ever was, and ever will be, the only way of safety."


# BHT:
In this verse, believers are encouraged to endure suffering for the sake of righteousness, entrusting their lives to God's faithful care. The surrender to God is not passive, but accompanied by active practice of good. This act of surrender is like depositing a valuable treasure into God's hands, knowing that as our Creator, He will faithfully protect and preserve what is entrusted to Him. Trusting in God's will and committing our souls to His safekeeping brings comfort and assurance, for it is in following the path of duty that we find true safety.
