# choicest prompt v1 X bht prompt v3; ['Henry Alford', 'Jamieson Fausset Brown', 'Albert Barnes', 'Marvin Vincent', 'John Calvin', 'Philip Schaff', 'Archibald T Robertson', 'Adam Clarke']

## Henry Alford:
1. "No longer by the lusts of men, but by the will of God." 
2. "What the lusts are, is shown in 1 Peter 4:3."
3. "To live the rest of your time in the flesh."

## Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "That he (the believer, who has once for all obtained cessation from sin by suffering, in the person of Christ, namely, in virtue of his union with the crucified Christ) should no longer live the rest of his time in the flesh to the lusts of men, but to the will of God" as his rule.
2. "Rest of his time in the flesh" proves that the reference is here not to Christ, but to the believer, whose remaining time for glorifying God is short.
3. "Live" in the truest sense, for heretofore he was dead.

## Albert Barnes:
1. "He has become, through the death of Christ, dead to the world and to the former things which influenced him."
2. "The object of redemption is to rescue us from being swayed by wicked lusts."
3. "To bring us to be conformed wholly to the will of God."

## Marvin Vincent:
1. "Live [βιωσαι]." This word emphasizes the idea of actively living out one's faith, not just existing or going through the motions. It implies a vibrant and intentional way of life that is rooted in the teachings of the Bible.

2. "Only here in New Testament." This phrase highlights the uniqueness of the word used in the verse. It suggests that this particular word choice carries significant meaning and should be carefully considered in understanding the message being conveyed.

3. "The rest of the time [επιλοιπον]." This phrase implies that the time we have left should be used wisely and purposefully. It encourages believers to make the most of their remaining days, focusing on what truly matters and striving to live in alignment with God's will.

## John Calvin:
1. "Here he sets forth the way of ceasing from sin, that renouncing the covetings of men we should study to form our life according to the will of God."
2. "The course of good living is thus to begin with the former, but we are to advance to the latter."
3. "Nothing is right and well ordered in man’s life as soon as he wanders from this rule."

## Philip Schaff:
1. "The ‘lusts of men’ and the ‘will of God’ are contrasted as two opposite services to which one’s life may be dedicated."
2. "The ‘lusts of men’ here are not the lusts of human nature in the readers themselves (or in the man described as suffering), but the lusts indulged by the heathen around the readers."
3. "Their standard is to be God’s will. Bengel notices the contrast between the ‘lusts’ which are various, and the ‘will of God’ which is one."

## Archibald T Robertson:
1. "That ye no longer should live" - The purpose of this clause is to emphasize the transformation of one's life, indicating a change from the previous way of living.
2. "The rest of your time in the flesh" - This phrase highlights the remaining period of time that individuals have while living in their physical bodies.
3. "But εις το here can be result (so that)" - This explanation suggests that the phrase "εις το" can also be understood as indicating the result or outcome of the previous statement.

## Adam Clarke:
1. "That he no longer should live - in the flesh" - This phrase highlights the transformation that occurs when one embraces faith in God. It signifies a departure from a life governed by worldly desires and a surrender to the will of God. (Quote 1)

"Retain the truth, and live according to its dictates, though he should suffer for it" - This statement underscores the significance of holding onto the truth of God's word and living in accordance with its teachings, regardless of the hardships that may arise. It encourages believers to prioritize faithfulness to God over personal comfort or safety. (Quote 3)
