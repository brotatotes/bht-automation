# 1 Peter 4:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As believers, we are called to live according to God's will rather than being driven by our own selfish desires. This means actively and intentionally embracing a life centered on God's purposes and priorities. We are reminded that our time in this physical body is limited, urging us to make the most of every moment and live in a way that honors God. This transformation of our lives requires us to renounce our old ways and align ourselves with God's will, recognizing that true fulfillment and unity are found in His plans for us.
