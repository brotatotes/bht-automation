# choicest prompt v1 X bht prompt v3; ['Henry Alford', 'Jamieson Fausset Brown', 'Albert Barnes', 'Marvin Vincent', 'John Calvin', 'Philip Schaff', 'Archibald T Robertson', 'Adam Clarke']

## Henry Alford:
1. "Sufficient is the past time to have wrought out the will of the Gentiles." 
2. "The θέλημα is that which we may be overpersuaded into following, the θέλημα that which we are bound to obey."
3. "The absence of the art. gives it the slight inferential force which justifies the former assertion."

## Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Peter takes the lowest ground: for not even the past time ought to have been wasted in lust; but since you cannot recall it, at least lay out the future to better account."
2. "Gentiles—heathen: which many of you were."
3. "The Greek means petulant, immodest, wantonness, unbridled conduct: not so much filthy lust."

## Albert Barnes:
1. "We have spent sufficient time in indulging ourselves, and following our wicked propensities, and we should hereafter live in a different manner."
2. "The apostle says we, not as meaning that he himself had been addicted to these vices, but as speaking of those who were Christians in general."
3. "The fact that they were thus converted shows the power of the gospel, and also that we should not despair in regard to those who are indulging in these vices now."

## Marvin Vincent:
1. "The time past may suffice for you to have wrought the desire, etc., walking as ye have done; the perfect participle having an inferential reference to a course of life now done with."
2. "He enumerates six forms of sensuality, three personal and three social: (1) 'Aselgeiaiv, wantonness. Excesses of all kinds, with possibly an emphasis on sins of uncleanness."
3. "The remaining three are revellings, banquetings, and idolatries. Revellings [κωμοις]. The word originally signifies merely a merry-making; most probably a village festival, from kwmh, a village."

## John Calvin:
1. "And doubtless it ought to be the sharpest goad to make us run on well, when we recollect that we have been wandering from the right way the greatest part of our life."
2. "He intimates that we ought to persevere to the end, as when Paul says, that Christ was raised from the dead, to die no more."
3. "Peter does not so ascribe these vices to the Gentiles, as though he charged every individual with all these, but that we are by nature inclined to all these evils, and not only so, but that we are so much under the power of depravity, that these fruits which he mentions necessarily proceed from it as from an evil root."

## Philip Schaff:
1. "The past may suffice; there is a figure in that, meaning much more than the words express: It is enough, Oh! too much, to have so long, so miserable a life." 
2. "Peter begins with a wide, plural term, sufficient to include unbridled conduct of all kinds, and then goes on from the general to the particular."
3. "Those of the last-named class were of a comparatively orderly kind. The others were attended with great licence, and generally ended in the revellers sallying out into the streets, and wakening the echoes with song and dance and noisy frolic."

## Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Jews sometimes fell in with the ways of Gentiles as today some Christians copy the ways of the world." 
2. "In unbridled lustful excesses." 
3. "To the Christian all 'idolatry' is 'abominable,' not allowed, but particularly those associated with drinking and licentiousness."

## Adam Clarke:
1. "They walked in lasciviousness, every species of lechery, lewdness, and impurity."
2. "In lusts, strong irregular appetites, and desires of all kinds."
3. "In excess of wine, wine, and to be hot, or to boil; to be inflamed with wine; they were in continual debauches."
4. "In revellings, lascivious feastings, with drunken songs."
5. "In banquetings, wine feasts, drinking matches, &c."
6. "In abominable idolatries, the abominations practised at their idol feasts, where they not only worshipped the idol, but did it with the most impure, obscene, and abominable rites."


# BHT:
The commentators highlight a Bible verse that stresses the need for a change in behavior. It is emphasized that the past indulgence in wicked propensities and lustful desires should be left behind. The commentators mention various forms of sensuality and excess, such as revellings, banquetings, and idolatries. The verse also reminds believers of the power of the gospel to transform lives and serves as a warning against falling back into sinful ways. The passage identifies the connection between sensual behavior and idolatry, urging Christians to reject such abominable practices.
