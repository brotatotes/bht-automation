## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Sufficient is the past time to have wrought out the will of the Gentiles." 
2. "The θέλημα is that which we may be overpersuaded into following, the θέλημα that which we are bound to obey." 
3. "Walking as ye have done in lasciviousnesses, lusts, wine-bibbings, revellings, drinking-bouts, and nefarious idolatries."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Peter takes the lowest ground: for not even the past time ought to have been wasted in lust; but since you cannot recall it, at least lay out the future to better account."
2. "Gentiles—heathen: which many of you were."
3. "the Greek means petulant, immodest, wantonness, unbridled conduct: not so much filthy lust."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "We have spent sufficient time in indulging ourselves, and following our wicked propensities, and we should hereafter live in a different manner."
2. "The apostle says we, not as meaning that he himself had been addicted to these vices, but as speaking of those who were Christians in general."
3. "The fact that they were thus converted shows the power of the gospel, and also that we should not despair in regard to those who are indulging in these vices now."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The time past may suffice for you to have wrought the desire, etc., walking as ye have done; the perfect participle having an inferential reference to a course of life now done with."
2. "He enumerates six forms of sensuality, three personal and three social: (1) 'Aselgeiaiv, wantonness. Excesses of all kinds, with possibly an emphasis on sins of uncleanness."
3. "The remaining three are revellings, banquetings, and idolatries. Revellings [κωμοις]. The word originally signifies merely a merry-making; most probably a village festival, from kwmh, a village."

### John Calvin:
1. "And Peter reminds us, that it would be most unreasonable were we not to change the course of our life after having been enlightened by Christ."
2. "He intimates that we ought to persevere to the end, as when Paul says, that Christ was raised from the dead, to die no more."
3. "Peter does not so ascribe these vices to the Gentiles, as though he charged every individual with all these, but that we are by nature inclined to all these evils, and not only so, but that we are so much under the power of depravity, that these fruits which he mentions necessarily proceed from it as from an evil root."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The past may suffice; there is a figure in that, meaning much more than the words express: It is enough, Oh! too much, to have so long, so miserable a life" (Leighton).
2. "The allusion to the 'desire of the Gentiles' (which is practically equivalent here to the desire of the heathen), especially as that desire or intent is interpreted by the following catalogue of sins, suits Christians who had been heathen, rather than Christians who had been Jews."
3. "Here, as so often elsewhere, idolatry and immorality are associated as going hand in hand with each other. The 'abominable' of the A. V. and R. V. scarcely conveys the point of the adjective. It describes the idolatries as 'unlawful,' outside the pale of Divine law."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "May suffice. No copula in the Greek, probably is rather than can. Late and rare verbal adjective from αρκεω, to suffice, in the papyri several times, in N.T. only here and Matthew 6:34; Matthew 10:25, apparently referring to Christ's words in Matthew 6:34 (possibly an axiom or proverb)."

2. "To have wrought. Perfect middle infinitive of κατεργαζομα, common compound (κατα, εργον work) as in 1 Corinthians 5:3."

3. "In unbridled lustful excesses" (2 Peter 2:7; 2 Corinthians 12:21)."

4. "The Greeks actually carried lust and drunkenness into their religious observances (Aphrodite, for instance)."

5. "To the Christian all 'idolatry,' (ειδωλον, λατρεια), worship of idols, is 'abominable,' not allowed (alpha privative and θεμιτος, θεμιστος the old form, verbal of θεμιζω, to make lawful), but particularly those associated with drinking and licentiousness."

### John Gill:
1. "These converted persons, in the past time of their life, before conversion, 'walked' in sin; which denotes a series and course of sinning, a persisting and progress in it, with delight and pleasure, promising themselves security and impunity."
2. "The particular sins they walked in are reducible to these three heads, unchastity, intemperance, and idolatry."
3. "Now when they walked in these things, they 'wrought the will of the Gentiles'; they did the things which the sinners of the Gentiles, the worst of men, that knew not God, took pleasure in, and what they would have others do."

### John Wesley:
1. "Revellings, banquetings — Have these words any meaning now? They had, seventeen hundred years ago."
2. "Then the former meant, meetings to eat; meetings, the direct end of which was, to please the taste."
3. "Both of which Christians then ranked with abominable idolatries."
