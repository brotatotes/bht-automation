# choicest prompt v1 X bht prompt v3; ['Henry Alford', 'Jamieson Fausset Brown', 'Albert Barnes', 'Marvin Vincent', 'John Calvin', 'Philip Schaff', 'Archibald T Robertson', 'Adam Clarke']

## Henry Alford:
1. "The aim of this verse is well given by Gerhard: 'monuit hæc προθεραπεία ipsorum animos, ne perversis et præposteris illis impiorum judiciis ac blasphemis sermonibus turbentur, multo vero minus ad pristinorum vitiorum societatem sese pertrahi patiantur.'"
2. "They must give offence to their former companions: for this there is no help."
3. "They are astonished, think it strange, that you run not with them to the same slough of profligacy, speaking evil of you."

(Note: The commentary is quite lengthy, so I have selected three quotes that provide a good overview of the main points.)

## Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Abandonment of your former walk"
2. "Run not with them—eagerly, in troops"
3. "Speaking evil—charging you with pride, singularity, hypocrisy, and secret crimes"

## Albert Barnes:
1. "Even the kindred of the Saviour regarded him as 'beside himself,' and Festus supposed that Paul was mad." 
2. "They do not appreciate the motives which influence those who leave them. They feel that it is proper to enjoy the world, and to make life cheerful, and they do not understand what it is to act under a deep sense of responsibility to God, and with reference to eternity."
3. "They do not yet see the guilt and folly of sinful pleasures. They are not convinced of the deep sinfulness of the human soul, and they think it strange that others should abandon a course of life which seems to them so innocent."

## Marvin Vincent:
1. "Run not with them. 'In a troop' (Bengel); like a band of revellers." 
2. "Excess [αναχυσιν]. Only here in New Testament. Lit., pouring forth." 
3. "Riot [ασωτιας]. From aj, not, and swzw, to save. Lit., unsavingness, prodigality, wastefulness; and thence of squandering on one's own debased appetites, whence it takes the sense of dissoluteness or profligacy."

## John Calvin:
1. "Peter fortifies the faithful, lest they should suffer themselves to be disturbed or corrupted by the perverse judgments or words of the ungodly."
2. "Thus they accuse the children of God, as though they attempted a separation from the whole world. Then the Apostle anticipated this, and forbade the faithful to be discouraged by such reproaches and calumnies."
3. "He proposed to them, as a support, the judgment of God: for this it is that can sustain us against all assaults, that is, when we patiently wait for that day, in which Christ will punish all those who now presumptuously condemn us, and will show that we and our cause are approved by Him."

## Philip Schaff:
1. "The several terms are remarkable for their force and vividness."
2. "With what power do these few bold strokes depict the rush of the mass of the heathen over all barriers that stand in the way of vicious indulgence."
3. "Wordsworth thinks the point of the comparison is the idea of 'foul streams flowing together into one and the same sink.'"

## Archibald T Robertson:
1. "They think it strange... 'They are surprised or astonished.'" - The commentary highlights the reaction of others to the Christian way of life, emphasizing the sense of astonishment or surprise that it evokes.

2. "That ye run not with them... 'running with certain folks.'" - This quote explains the metaphor of running together, suggesting that Christians should not participate in the same excessive and riotous behavior as those outside the faith.

3. "Speaking evil of you... 'regarding them as the enemies of all joy, and therefore of the human race.'" - The commentary sheds light on the negative perception of Christians by others, who viewed them as enemies of joy and the human race due to their abstention from certain social pleasures.

## Adam Clarke:
1. "They think it strange — ξενιζονται. They wonder and are astonished at you, that ye can renounce these gratifications of the flesh for a spiritual something, the good of which they cannot see."
2. "Excess of riot — ασωτιας αναχυσιν. Flood of profligacy; bearing down all rule, order, and restraints before it."
3. "Speaking evil of you] βλασφημουντες. Literally, blaspheming; i.e. speaking impiously against God, and calumniously of you."


# BHT:
This verse addresses the tension that arises when believers distance themselves from their former companions who engage in immoral behavior. Commentators emphasize the astonishment and criticism Christians face for their decision to forsake indulgence and embrace a spiritual life. The verse warns against running alongside those who engage in excessive and riotous behavior. Those outside the faith view Christians as enemies of joy and even blaspheme against both God and believers in their disapproval.
