# choicest prompt v1 X bht prompt v3; ['Henry Alford', 'Jamieson Fausset Brown', 'Albert Barnes', 'Marvin Vincent', 'John Calvin', 'Philip Schaff', 'Archibald T Robertson', 'Adam Clarke']

## Henry Alford:
1. "The consideration is propounded for the comfort and stay of Christians unjustly slandered."
2. "Shall render account to Him that is ready to judge."
3. "Living and dead."

## Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "They who now call you to account falsely, shall have to give account themselves for this very evil-speaking." (Judges 1:15) - This quote highlights the concept of accountability and reminds us that those who falsely accuse others will face consequences for their actions.

2. "Ready—very speedily." (1 Peter 4:7; 2 Peter 3:10) - This quote emphasizes the imminence of Christ's coming and serves as a reminder to always be prepared for His return.

3. "Christ's coming is to the believer always near." - This quote underscores the belief that believers should constantly be aware of the nearness of Christ's coming and live accordingly.

## Albert Barnes:
1. "They are guilty in this of a great wrong and they must answer for it to God."
2. "The meaning is, not that he was about to do it, or that the day of judgment was near at hand - whatever the apostle may have supposed to be true on that point - but that he was prepared for it; all the arrangements were made with reference to it; there was nothing to hinder it."
3. "They should bear their trials and the opposition which they would meet with patiently, not feeling that they were forgotten, nor attempting to avenge themselves; for the Lord would vindicate them when he should come to judgment, and call those who had injured them to an account for all the wrongs which they had done to the children of God."

## Marvin Vincent:
1. "Having himself in readiness" - This phrase suggests that Jesus is fully prepared and equipped to fulfill his role as the Savior and Judge. It highlights his divine authority and power.
2. "There at God's right hand in heaven" - This imagery emphasizes Jesus' exalted position and his close proximity to God. It signifies his divine authority and his role as the mediator between God and humanity.
3. "Implying, also, a near judgment" - This statement suggests that Jesus' presence at God's right hand indicates that a judgment is imminent. It implies that Jesus will soon execute justice and hold people accountable for their actions.

## Philip Schaff:
1. "The formula ‘ready to’ (which is used again only in Acts 21:13; 2 Corinthians 12:14), along with the tense in which the ‘to judge’ is cast, points to the last judgment as certain and near, and to the Judge as prepared to judge once for all." 
2. "This Judge, too, as we may infer from the general conclusion to which chap. 1 Peter 3:17-22 led up, is Christ, the Christ who is reviled when Christians are reviled, the Christ who, in the time of His own suffering, committed His case to Him that judgeth righteously."
3. "The universality and impartiality of the judgment are thus expressed. For the phrase ‘quick and dead’ is not to be limited either to the heathen slanderers, or (with Schott) to the Christians who are to get their rights, whether alive or dead, at Christ’s coming."

## Archibald T Robertson:
1. "For this use with λογον (account) see Matthew 12:36; Luke 16:2; Acts 19:40; Hebrews 13:17."
2. "The sudden use of the relative ο see Romans 3:8."
3. "Those living at the time and those already dead (1 Thessalonians 4:15)."

## Adam Clarke:
1. "They shall give account of these irregularities to Him who is prepared to judge both the Jews and the Gentiles." 
2. "The Gentiles, previously to the preaching of the Gospel among them, were reckoned to be dead in trespasses and sins."
3. "The Jews had at least, by their religious profession, a name to live; and by that profession were bound to give to God."
