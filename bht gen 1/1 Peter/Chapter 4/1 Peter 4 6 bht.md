## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "νεκροῖς in 1Pe 4:6 must be kept as wide in its reference as νεκρούς in 1 Peter 4:5; i. e., that it must not be interpreted as applying merely to the blasphemers of the Christians who should have died before the judgment, or merely to such blasphemed Christians themselves as shall have then died, or merely to the spirits in prison of ch. 1 Peter 3:19, but must be treated as a general assertion in the literal meaning of νεκροῖς."
2. "The persons pointed at are those spirits in prison to whom our Lord went and preached, ch. 1 Peter 3:19. This supposition, but always with the protest raised above, that νεκροῖς does not refer only to these, but to the dead generally, and that these are only the occasion of the general assertion."
3. "The aim and end introduced by the ἵνα, which on this, and on no other rendering, receives meaning and perspicuity."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The sense seems to be, Peter, as representing the true attitude of the Church in every age, expecting Christ at any moment, says, The Judge is ready to judge the quick and dead—the dead, I say, for they, too, in their lifetime, have had the Gospel preached to them, that so they might be judged at last in the same way as those living now." 

2. "He says, 'live,' not 'made alive' or quickened; for they are supposed to have been already 'quickened together with Christ'."

3. "The Gospel, substantially, was 'preached' to the Old Testament Church; though not so fully as to the New Testament Church."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The expression, 'For, for this cause,' refers to an end to be reached, or an object to be gained, or a reason why anything referred to is done."
2. "The most natural and obvious interpretation is to refer it to those who were then dead, to whom the gospel had been preached when living, and who had become true Christians."
3. "The apostle was addressing those who were suffering persecution. It was natural, in such a connection, to refer to those who had died in the faith, and to show, for their encouragement, that though they had been put to death, yet they still lived to God."

### John Calvin:
1. "It is then a remarkable consolation to the godly, that death itself brings no loss to their salvation."
2. "Though Christ, then, may not appear a deliverer in this life, yet his redemption is not void, or without effect; for his power extends to the dead."
3. "The sum of what he says is, that though the condition of the dead in the flesh is worse, according to man, yet it is enough that the Spirit of Christ revives them, and will eventually lead them to the perfection of life."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The main points in dispute, however, are the time, scene, and subjects of this preaching. The preaching itself can be understood only as an offer of grace."
2. "For the whole statement then takes this form ‘Christ is ready to judge quick and dead; and with justice shall the dead, no less than the living, be judged by Him; for His Gospel is preached to all, in the other world, if not in this.’"
3. "The two things have something like this relation to each other ‘in order that, though once judged indeed, as other men are, as regards the flesh, they might, as regards the spirit, have an enduring life such as God lives.’"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "There are those (Augustine, Luther, etc.) who take 'dead' here in the spiritual sense (dead in trespasses and sins as in Colossians 2:13; Ephesians 2:1), but consider it 'impossible' for Peter to use the same word in two senses so close together." 

2. "Bigg takes it to mean that all men who did not hear the gospel message in this life will hear it in the next before the final judgment."

3. "There is contrast also between κατα ανθρωπους (according to men) and κατα θεον (according to God)."

### John Gill:
1. "By the Gospel is meant the good news of the incarnation, sufferings, and death of Christ, and salvation by him: and includes all the doctrines of grace, as of pardon, righteousness, and eternal life."
2. "The Gospel has been preached also to them that are already dead, as well as to those who are now alive."
3. "Such are intended, to whom the Gospel had been preached, and to whom it had been effectual unto salvation; who had received it in the love of it, had sincerely professed it, and had suffered for it even death itself."

### John Wesley:
1. "For to this end was the gospel preached — Ever since it was given to Adam." 
2. "That they might be judged — That though they were judged. In the flesh according to the manner of men - With rash, unrighteous judgment." 
3. "They might live according to the will and word of God, in the Spirit; the soul renewed after his image."
