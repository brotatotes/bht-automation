## Henry Alford:
1. "νεκροῖς in 1Pe 4:6 must be kept as wide in its reference as νεκρούς in 1 Peter 4:5; i.e., that it must not be interpreted as applying merely to the blasphemers of the Christians who should have died before the judgment, or merely to such blasphemed Christians themselves as shall have then died, or merely to the spirits in prison of ch. 1 Peter 3:19, but must be treated as a general assertion in the literal meaning of νεκροῖς."
2. "The want of the article does not justify any limitation of this word: for the art. is also wanting before νεκρούς in 1 Peter 4:5, which indisputably is universal in its reference."
3. "Our Lord is ready to judge the dead: and with reason: for even they have not been without opportunity of receiving His gospel: as the example which was adduced in ch. 1Pe 3:19 shows. For this end the gospel was preached even to the dead, that they might not indeed escape the universal judgment on human sin, which is physical death, but, that they might be judged (aor.; be in the state of the completed sentence on sin, which is death after the flesh) according to (as) man as regards the flesh (this first clause following ἵνα being the subordinate one, of the state which the εὐηγγελίσθη left remaining), but (notwithstanding) might live (pres.; of a state to continue) according to God (a life with God, and divine) as regards the spirit."

## Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "The sense seems to be, Peter, as representing the true attitude of the Church in every age, expecting Christ at any moment, says, The Judge is ready to judge the quick and dead—the dead, I say, for they, too, in their lifetime, have had the Gospel preached to them, that so they might be judged at last in the same way as those living now."
2. "He says, 'live,' not 'made alive' or quickened; for they are supposed to have been already 'quickened together with Christ.'"
3. "The Gospel, substantially, was 'preached' to the Old Testament Church; though not so fully as to the New Testament Church."

## Albert Barnes:
1. "The expression, 'For, for this cause,' refers to an end to be reached, or an object to be gained, or a reason why anything referred to is done."
2. "The most natural and obvious interpretation is to refer it to those who were then dead, to whom the gospel had been preached when living, and who had become true Christians."
3. "The apostle was addressing those who were suffering persecution. It was natural, in such a connection, to refer to those who had died in the faith, and to show, for their encouragement, that though they had been put to death, yet they still lived to God."

## John Calvin:
1. "It is then a remarkable consolation to the godly, that death itself brings no loss to their salvation."
2. "Though Christ, then, may not appear a deliverer in this life, yet his redemption is not void, or without effect; for his power extends to the dead."
3. "The sum of what he says is, that though the condition of the dead in the flesh is worse, according to man, yet it is enough that the Spirit of Christ revives them, and will eventually lead them to the perfection of life."

## Philip Schaff:
1. "The main points in dispute, however, are the time, scene, and subjects of this preaching. The preaching itself can be understood only as an offer of grace."
2. "For the whole statement then takes this form ‘Christ is ready to judge quick and dead; and with justice shall the dead, no less than the living, be judged by Him; for His Gospel is preached to all, in the other world, if not in this.’"
3. "On the latter it amounts to this, ‘Have done for ever with the vile, pagan life; the heathen will persecute you, and justify their persecutions by reviling your character; be not moved by that. Christ is Judge, and the cause of all is safe with Him, of those who die, not less than of those who survive."

## Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Does Peter here mean preached to men after they are dead or to men once alive but dead now or when the judgment comes?" 
2. "There are those who take 'dead' here in the spiritual sense, but consider it 'impossible' for Peter to use the same word in two senses so close together; but Jesus did it in the same sentence."
3. "Bigg takes it to mean that all men who did not hear the gospel message in this life will hear it in the next before the final judgment."

## Adam Clarke:
1. "For this indeed was the effect of the preaching of the Gospel to the dead, (the unconverted Gentiles,) that some will be punished as carnal men; but others, (those converted to Christianity,) lead a spiritual life unto God." - WAKEFIELD.

2. "For this purpose hath the Gospel been preached even to the dead, (i.e. the Gentiles,) that although they might be condemned, indeed, by men in the flesh, (their persecutors,) yet they might live eternally by God in the Spirit." - MACKNIGHT.

3. "But if the apostle had the same fact in view which he mentions, 1 Peter 3:19; 1 Peter 3:20, then the antedilevians are the persons intended...hearing this Gospel by Noah, they may believe, and live according to God in the Spirit - live a blessed life in eternity according to the mercy of God, who sent his Spirit to strive with them."


# BHT:
The verse under scrutiny emphasizes that the Gospel is not limited to the living, but extends even to the dead. Commentators debate whether the dead refers to those who have physically died or to those who were spiritually dead during their lifetime. Nevertheless, the prevailing view is that the Gospel is proclaimed indiscriminately, offering grace and the opportunity for eternal life to everyone, regardless of whether they are alive or dead. The purpose of this universal proclamation is twofold: to bring judgment to those who reject the Gospel and to offer spiritual life and salvation to those who accept it.
