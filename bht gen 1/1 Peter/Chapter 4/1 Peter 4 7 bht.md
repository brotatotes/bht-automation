# choicest prompt v1 X bht prompt v3; ['Henry Alford', 'Jamieson Fausset Brown', 'Albert Barnes', 'Marvin Vincent', 'John Calvin', 'Philip Schaff', 'Archibald T Robertson', 'Adam Clarke']

## Henry Alford:
1. "The end of all things is at hand...be therefore of temperate mind and be sober unto prayers." 
2. "Above all things, having your love towards one another intense, because love covereth a multitude of sins."
3. "Every sin which love hides from man's sight, is hidden in God's sight also."

## Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "The nearness meant is not that of mere 'time,' but that before the Lord; as he explains to guard against misapprehension, and defends God from the charge of procrastination."
2. "We live in the last dispensation, not like the Jews under the Old Testament. The Lord will come as a thief; He is 'ready' to judge the world at any moment."
3. "Temperance promotes wakefulness or watchfulness, and both promote prayer. Drink makes drowsy, and drowsiness prevents prayer."

## Albert Barnes:
1. "The phrase, 'the end of all things,' would naturally refer to the end of the world; the winding up of human affairs."
2. "The fact that it is such language as we now naturally address to people, saying that in respect to them 'the end of all things is at hand,' shows that it cannot be demonstrated that Peter did not use it in the same sense."
3. "The important truth, then, taught by this passage is, 'that the near approach, of the end of all things should make us serious and prayerful.'"

## Marvin Vincent:
1. "The word constantly used of the coming of Christ and his kingdom."
2. "Be ye of sound mind."
3. "Prayers of all kinds, private or public."

## John Calvin:
1. "Hence the Apostle, that he might rouse them from the drowsiness of the flesh, reminds them that the end of all things was nigh; by which he intimates that we ought not to sit still in the world, from which we must soon remove."
2. "But were the trumpet of Christ to sound in our ears, it would powerfully rouse us and not suffer us to lie torpid."
3. "The watchfulness and the sobriety to which he exhorted them, belong, as I think, to the mind rather than to the body."

Note: The commentary provides additional insights and explanations about the verse, but the selected quotes focus on the urgency of the end times and the need for spiritual alertness.

## Philip Schaff:
1. "The 'end' is the new view-point from which they are offered to the eye, but the graces themselves are such as relate specially to what Christians should be in face of temptations to heathen vice and under the burden of heathen persecution."
2. "The event with which the New Testament is accustomed to fill the Christianâ€™s vision of the future, and which it proposes as a supreme motive to a circumspect walk, is an event of universal, not of merely personal, importance that Second Coming of Christ which is to put an end to the present world itself."
3. "Soundness of mind and sobriety are essential to the prayerful frame, and specially so where the believer suffers from the contagion of vicious surroundings and the distraction of trial."

## Archibald T Robertson:
1. "The end of all things is at hand." - Peter emphasizes the imminence of the end times, urging believers to be prepared and ready for the coming of Christ. (Quote 1)
2. "Be ye therefore of sound mind." - Peter encourages believers to have a sober and clear-minded perspective in light of Christ's imminent return. (Quote 2)
3. "Be sober unto prayer." - Peter urges believers to be vigilant and alert in their prayers, emphasizing the importance of maintaining a focused and sober mindset in their communication with God. (Quote 3)

## Adam Clarke:
1. "The end of all things is at hand; and this he spoke when God had determined to destroy the Jewish people and their polity by one of the most signal judgments that ever fell upon any nation or people."
2. "To this destruction, which was literally then at hand, the apostle alludes when he says, The end of all things is at hand; the end of the temple, the end of the Levitical priesthood, the end of the whole Jewish economy, was then at hand."
3. "Be sober-make a prudent and moderate use of all you possess; and watch against all occasions of sin; and pray for the supporting hand of God to be upon you for good, that ye may escape the destruction that is coming upon the Jews, and that ye may be saved from among them when the scourge comes."
