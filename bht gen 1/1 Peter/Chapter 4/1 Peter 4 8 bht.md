# choicest prompt v1 X bht prompt v3; ['Henry Alford', 'Jamieson Fausset Brown', 'Albert Barnes', 'Marvin Vincent', 'John Calvin', 'Philip Schaff', 'Archibald T Robertson', 'Adam Clarke']

## Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Above all things—not that 'charity' or love is placed above 'prayer,' but because love is the animating spirit, without which all other duties are dead."
2. "By prayer for them, love tries to have them covered by God; and so being the instrument of converting the sinner from his error, 'covereth a (not 'the,' as English Version) multitude of sins.'"
3. "It is not, as Rome teaches, 'covereth' his own sins; for then the Greek middle voice would be used; and Proverbs 10:12; Proverbs 17:9 support the Protestant view."

## Albert Barnes:
1. "Above all things - More than all things else."
2. "For charity shall cover the multitude of sins - Love to another shall so cover or hide a great many imperfections in him, that you will not notice them."
3. "The subject on which the apostle is treating is the advantage of love in our conduct toward others, and this he enforces by saying that it will make us kind to their imperfections, and lead us to overlook their faults."

## Marvin Vincent:
1. "Fervent [εκτενη]." This word highlights the intensity and sincerity of love. It implies a passionate and wholehearted expression of love, rather than a superficial or half-hearted one.

2. "Love covereth, etc." This phrase suggests that love has the power to overlook and forgive the faults and shortcomings of others. It emphasizes the importance of showing grace and compassion, rather than dwelling on the mistakes or weaknesses of others.

3. "Compare James 5:20; Proverbs 10:12." This reference encourages readers to explore other biblical passages that reinforce the idea that love has the ability to heal and restore relationships. It invites readers to seek wisdom and guidance from these related verses.

## John Calvin:
1. "And above all things He commends charity or love as the first thing, for it is the bond of perfection."
2. "But the more sins love covers, the more evident appears its usefulness for the wellbeing of mankind."
3. "Though charity, or benevolence, hides the faults of others from the severity of our censure, yet charity or almsgiving is totally unable to conceal our own from the observance of our all-righteous Judge."

## Philip Schaff:
1. "The preference which is given to brotherly love is not given as if it were superior to prayer and the other virtues, or as if these were to be subordinated to the interests of that, but because without it nothing else can make the inner life of the Church what it should be." 
2. "Love works for concord, throwing a covering over sins, forgiving them, excusing them, making as little of them as possible, while the genius of hatred is the opposite." 
3. "Thus the sins referred to are our neighbour’s sins, and the covering meant is the veil of charity."

## Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Above all things" - This phrase emphasizes the importance and priority of the following instruction. (James 5:12)
2. "Being fervent" - Describing the attitude of holding intent love among believers, highlighting the active and passionate nature of love. (James 5:12)
3. "For love covereth a multitude of sins" - Explaining that love has the power to forgive and overlook the sins of the one loved, emphasizing the transformative and redemptive nature of love. (James 5:20)

## Adam Clarke:
1. "Have fervent charity — αγαπηνεκτενη. Intense love; for love shall cover a multitude of sins." 
2. "A loving disposition leads us to pass by the faults of others, to forgive offences against ourselves, and to excuse and lessen, as far as is consistent with truth, the transgressions of men." 
3. "It does not mean that our love to others will induce God to pardon our offences."
