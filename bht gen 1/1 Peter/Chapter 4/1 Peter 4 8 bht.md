# 1 Peter 4:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we are reminded of the paramount importance of love. The commentators emphasize that love should be fervent and intense, not passive or lukewarm. Love has the power to cover and forgive the faults and sins of others, promoting unity and reconciliation. It urges us to have a charitable and empathetic perspective, focusing on the positive qualities of others and interceding for their forgiveness. When we demonstrate unconditional love, we open ourselves up to receiving God's abundant love and blessings in return.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The preference which is given to brotherly love is not given as if it were superior to prayer and the other virtues, or as if these were to be subordinated to the interests of that, but because without it nothing else can make the inner life of the Church what it should be."
