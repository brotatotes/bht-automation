## Henry Alford:
1. "Loquitur non de pomposa hospitalitate... sed de Christiana illa et sancta hospitalitate, qua peregrinos egenos, maxime vero propter religionis veræ professionem exules Christiani ex sincera caritate promte in ædes suas recipiunt, eos amanter et benigne complectuntur, tanquam Christi membra et ecclesiæ concives fovent" &c. Gerhard - "He is not speaking of pompous hospitality... but of that Christian and holy hospitality, by which Christians, out of sincere love, readily receive needy strangers into their homes, especially those who are exiles for the sake of the true profession of religion, and embrace them lovingly and kindly, as members of Christ and fellow citizens of the church" &c. Gerhard.

2. "The opposite to γογγυσμός in hospitality is simple open-heartedness" - The opposite of murmuring in hospitality is simple open-heartedness.

3. "The consequence of it, 'occulta maledicentia, odiosa exprobratio beneficiorum,' as Gerhard here" - The consequence of murmuring is hidden slander and hateful reproach of benefits.

## Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Not the spurious hospitality which passes current in the world, but the entertaining of those needing it, especially those exiled for the faith, as the representatives of Christ."
2. "All hospitality to whomsoever exercised from genuine Christian love."
3. "He that giveth, let him do it with simplicity, that is open-hearted sincerity; with cordiality."

## Albert Barnes:
1. "Without grudging - Greek, 'without murmurs;' that is, without complaining of the hardship of doing it; of the time, and expense, and trouble required in doing it."
2. "The idea of grudging, in the common sense of that word - that is, of doing it unwillingly, or regretting the expense, and considering it as ill-bestowed, or as not producing an equivalent of any kind - is not exactly the idea here."
3. "It greatly enhances the value of hospitality, that it be done on our part with entire cheerfulness."

## Marvin Vincent:
1. "Using hospitality" in Romans 12:13 refers to the act of welcoming and showing kindness to strangers or guests. It emphasizes the importance of extending love and care to others, especially those in need, as a reflection of Christ's love for us.

2. This verse reminds us that hospitality is not just a mere act of politeness, but a genuine expression of love and compassion towards others. It encourages us to go beyond our comfort zones and open our hearts and homes to those who may be different from us.

It reminds us that hospitality is not just a passive virtue, but a deliberate choice to reach out and make others feel valued and welcomed.

## John Calvin:
1. "After having generally exhorted them to love one another, he specially mentions one of the duties of love."
2. "He then bids them mutually to exercise it, so that no one might require more from others than what he himself was prepared to render."
3. "The Apostle would have us to show kindness willingly and with a cheerful mind."

## Philip Schaff:
1. "The duty of hospitality occupies a very notable place in the New Testament teaching, in respect both of private Christians and of those in office."
2. "Taking it for granted, however, that the laws of hospitality are honoured, and that believers who have the power will be ready to open the door to every needy brother, Peter deals here with the spirit in which all should be done."
3. "It should be ‘without grudging,’ or rather... ‘without murmuring,’ that is, without giving vent to hard or selfish thoughts about the cost and trouble."
