# choicest prompt v1 X bht prompt v3; ['Henry Alford', 'Jamieson Fausset Brown', 'Albert Barnes', 'Marvin Vincent', 'John Calvin', 'Philip Schaff', 'Archibald T Robertson', 'Adam Clarke']

## Henry Alford:
1. "Hortatio mutua inter æquales et collegas inprimis valet." (Translation: "Mutual exhortation among equals and colleagues is especially valuable.") 
2. "I who say to you χριστὸς ἔπαθεν σαρκί, say this of sufferings which my own eyes saw." 
3. "He came to them with great weight of authority as an exhorter having seen the sufferings of which he speaks, and being himself an heir of that glory to which he points onwards."

## Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "To put one's self on a level with those whom we exhort, gives weight to one's exhortations."
2. "The presidents over the presbyters and deacons, by whatever name designated, angel, bishop, or moderator, have virtually succeeded to a superintendency of the Church analogous to that exercised by the apostles."
3. "An eye-witness of Christ's sufferings, and so qualified to exhort you to believing patience in suffering for well-doing after His example."

## Albert Barnes:
1. "The language which Peter uses is not that of stern and arbitrary command; it is that of kind and mild Christian exhortation."
2. "He does not put it on the ground of his apostolical authority; or urge it because he was the vicegerent of Christ; or because he was the head of the church; or because he had any pre-eminence over others in any way."
3. "His own solemn declaration here makes it certain that he was present. He alludes to it now, evidently because it qualified him to exhort those whom he addressed."

## Marvin Vincent:
1. "The expression is decisive against the primacy of Peter."
2. "The word is used in the New Testament to denote: (a) a spectator or eye-witness... (b) One who testifies to what he has seen... (c) In the forensic sense, a witness in court... (d) One who vindicates his testimony by suffering: a martyr."
3. "The eye-witness, as a spectator, is always such with a view to giving testimony."

## John Calvin:
1. "Pastors ought not to exercise care over the flock of the Lord, as far only as they are constrained; for they who seek to do no more than what constraint compels them, do their work formally and negligently." 
2. "Whosoever has not this end in view, to spend himself and his labor disinterestedly and gladly in behalf of the Church, is not a minister of Christ, but a slave to his own stomach and his purse."
3. "It is the same as though he had said that they are to preside for this end, to be eminent in holiness, which cannot be, except they humbly subject themselves and their life to the same common rule."

## Philip Schaff:
1. "Such as are elders among you I exhort."
2. "The term 'elders,' or 'presbyters,' is used in the official sense."
3. "One distinction, and only one, is alluded to. It is that of having seen what Christ suffered."

## Archibald T Robertson:
1. "For the word πρεσβυτερος in the technical sense of officers in a Christian church (like elder in the local synagogues of the Jews) see Acts 11:30; Acts 20:17."
2. "It is noteworthy that here Peter the Apostle (1 Peter 1:1) calls himself an elder along with (συν) the other 'elders.'"
3. "A witness (μαρτυς). This is what Jesus had said they must be (Acts 1:8) and what Peter claimed to be (Acts 3:15; Acts 10:39). So Paul was to be a μαρτυς (Acts 22:15)."

## Adam Clarke:
1. "They were as pastors or shepherds of the flock of God, the Christian people among whom they lived." 
2. "Had he been what the popes of Rome say he was...could he have spoken of himself as he here does?" 
3. "He was with Christ in the garden; he was with him when he was apprehended. and he was with him in the high priest's hall."
