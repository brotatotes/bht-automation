# choicest prompt v1 X bht prompt v3; ['Henry Alford', 'Jamieson Fausset Brown', 'Albert Barnes', 'Marvin Vincent', 'John Calvin', 'Philip Schaff', 'Archibald T Robertson', 'Adam Clarke']

## Henry Alford:
1. "The God of all grace, who called you unto His eternal glory in Christ Jesus."
2. "When ye have suffered a little while, shall Himself perfect, shall confirm, shall strengthen, shall ground you."
3. "He who has begun grace with a view to glory, will not cut off grace till it be perfected in glory."

## Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Comforting assurance that God will finally 'perfect' His work of 'grace' in them, after they have undergone the necessary previous suffering." 
2. "The God to whom as its source all grace is to be referred; who in grace completes what in grace He began."
3. "Christ is He in virtue of whom, and in union with whom, believers are called to glory."

## Albert Barnes:
1. "The God of all grace - The God who imparts all needful grace."
2. "After you have suffered as long as he shall appoint. The Greek is, 'having suffered a little,' and may refer either to time or degree."
3. "The tendency of affliction is to make us perfect."
4. "Stablish - The Greek word means 'to set fast; to fix firmly; to render immovable.'"
5. "Settle you - Literally, found you, or establish you on a firm foundation."

## Marvin Vincent:
1. "Christ as the life, head, and very principle of all existence to the Christian" (Cook).
2. "The A. V. overlooks the aujtov, himself, which is very significant as indicating God's personal interest and energy in the work of confirming his children."
3. "Shall perfect, that no defect remain in you : shall stablish, that nothing may shake you : shall strengthen, that you may overcome every adverse force. A saying worthy of Peter. He is strengthening his brethren."

## John Calvin:
1. "Doctrine is in vain poured forth into the air, unless God works by his Spirit."
2. "He calls God the author of all grace, and reminds them that they were called to eternal glory, his purpose no doubt was, to confirm them in the conviction, that the work of their salvation, which he had begun, would be completed."
3. "He further fixes the foundation of calling in Christ. Both these things serve to give perpetual confidence, for if our calling is founded on Christ, and refers to the celestial kingdom of God and a blessed immortality, it follows that it is not transient nor fading."

## Philip Schaff:
1. "This assurance is introduced as a contrast with, or qualification of, what has been said of the burdens of believers. Hence the opening ‘but,’ or ‘moreover’ (not ‘and’). Such things they must expect from the adversary, but what may they not expect from God?" 
2. "The designation of God as the ‘God of all grace,’ the God who is so rich in grace that all grace comes from Him, adds to the strength of the assurance. The title is itself a consolation."
3. "The glory, indeed, into which they were called is to be theirs only after suffering. Yet the space of suffering will be brief."

## Archibald T Robertson:
1. "The God of all grace" - This phrase highlights the abundance and completeness of God's grace, emphasizing His character as the source of all grace. (Quote 1)
2. "In Christ" - This expression signifies the believer's union with Christ and the transformative power of being in Him. It echoes Pauline theology and underscores the significance of being connected to Christ. (Quote 2)
3. "After that ye have suffered a little while" - This phrase acknowledges the reality of suffering in the Christian life but also offers hope by emphasizing the temporary nature of such suffering. It encourages believers to persevere, knowing that their suffering will ultimately be overcome. (Quote 3)

## Adam Clarke:
1. "The God of all grace — The Fountain of infinite compassion, mercy, and goodness."
2. "Having suffered a little time; that is, while ye are enduring these persecutions, God will cause all to work together for your good."
3. "Put you in complete joint as the timbers of a building... Make you firm in every part; adapt you strongly to each other, so that you may be mutual supports, the whole building being one in the Lord... Cramp and bind every part, so that there shall be no danger of warping, splitting, or falling... Cause all to rest so evenly and firmly upon the best and surest foundation."


# BHT:
In this verse, we see the assurance that God, the source of all grace, will perfect His work of grace in believers. Through Christ, believers are called to eternal glory, and God's personal interest and energy confirm His children. Though suffering may be experienced for a little while, it serves to ultimately strengthen and ground them. The temporary nature of suffering is acknowledged, and believers are encouraged to persevere, knowing that God will establish and settle them on a firm foundation.
