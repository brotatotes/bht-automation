## Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Silvanus—Silas, the companion of Paul and Timothy: a suitable messenger by whom to confirm, as Peter here does, Paul's doctrine of 'the true grace of God' in the same churches."
2. "He did not know, by positive observation, Silvanus' faithfulness to them; he therefore says, 'faithful to you, as I suppose,' from the accounts I hear; not expressing doubt."
3. "Their sufferings for the Gospel made them need some attestation and confirmation of the truth, that they should not fall back from it."

## Albert Barnes:
1. "An epistle conveyed by his hands could not but be welcome."
2. "No small part of the Epistle is taken up with exhortations."
3. "That the religion in which you stand, or which you now hold, is that which is identified with the grace or favor of God."

## Marvin Vincent:
1. "Brother has the definite article, the faithful brother, designating him as one well known for his fidelity."
2. "The verb denotes a settled persuasion or assurance... as the result of our reasoning."
3. "The writer regards the time of writing as his correspondent will do when he shall have received the letter."

Note: The provided commentary is quite technical and specific, making it difficult to extract meaningful quotes that enrich the understanding of the Bible verse. However, the quotes provided above highlight the significance of Silvanus as a faithful brother, the assurance and reasoning behind the writer's words, and the writer's perspective on the timing of the letter.

## John Calvin:
1. "He first commends the brevity of his Epistle, lest the reading of it should be tedious to them."
2. "The living voice might be added to what was written; for this was the design of the testimony he bears to his fidelity."
3. "No doctrine can strike firm and perpetual roots in men’s hearts, if it be accompanied with any doubt."

## Philip Schaff:
1. "This comrade of Paul was a suitable messenger, both because he was known to the churches addressed, and because he had been to Peter as faithful a brother as he had been to Paul." 
2. "The 'grace of God' here means much the same as 'this grace' in Romans 5:1. What is in view, therefore, is not the 'state of grace,' as contrasted with the state of nature. It is the gift of grace whereof God had made them possessors through the preaching of the Gospel."
3. "He regards the readers as already in that grace. But by whose means they had first been introduced to it, he does not specify. So far, however, as they had been introduced by Paul into 'this grace' of which Peter had been writing, Peter sets the seal of his own testimony to that form of the Gospel which Paul had made known to them, and by which they had become what they now were."

## Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Silvanus (Silas) was the amanuensis and the bearer of the Epistle." (1 Peter 5:12-14)
2. "Peter uses Paul's phrase in giving approval to Paul's former companion." (1 Peter 5:12-14)
3. "Peter includes the whole of the Epistle by God's grace and obedience to the truth." (1 Peter 5:12-14)

## Adam Clarke:
1. "I have written to you, as I consider, briefly, by Silvanus, the faithful brother." 
2. "I conclude him to be a trustworthy person one by whom I may safely send this letter; who will take care to travel through the different regions in Asia, Pontus, Galatia, and Bithynia; read it in every Church; and leave a copy for the encouragement and instruction of Christ's flock."
3. "Exhorting — Calling upon you to be faithful, humble, and steady. And testifying — Earnestly witnessing, that it is the true grace-the genuine Gospel of Jesus Christ, in which ye stand, and in which ye should persevere to the end."
