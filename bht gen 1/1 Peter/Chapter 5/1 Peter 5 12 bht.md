### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Silvanus—Silas, the companion of Paul and Timothy: a suitable messenger by whom to confirm, as Peter here does, Paul's doctrine of 'the true grace of God' in the same churches."
2. "Silvanus may have stood in a close relation to the churches in Asia, perhaps having taken the oversight of them after Paul's departure, and had afterwards gone to Peter, by whom he is now sent back to them with this Epistle."
3. "The grace wherein we stand must be true, and our standing in it true also."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "An epistle conveyed by his hands could not but be welcome."
2. "No small part of the Epistle is taken up with exhortations."
3. "That the religion in which you stand, or which you now hold, is that which is identified with the grace or favor of God."

### Marvin Vincent:

2. "The verb denotes a settled persuasion or assurance."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "This comrade of Paul was a suitable messenger, both because he was known to the churches addressed, and because he had been to Peter as faithful a brother as he had been to Paul." 
2. "The 'grace of God' here means much the same as 'this grace' in Romans 5:1. What is in view, therefore, is not the 'state of grace,' as contrasted with the state of nature. It is the gift of grace whereof God had made them possessors through the preaching of the Gospel." 
3. "He regards the readers as already in that grace. But by whose means they had first been introduced to it, he does not specify. So far, however, as they had been introduced by Paul into 'this grace' of which Peter had been writing, Peter sets the seal of his own testimony to that form of the Gospel which Paul had made known to them, and by which they had become what they now were."
