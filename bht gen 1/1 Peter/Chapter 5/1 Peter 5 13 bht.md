## Henry Alford:
1. "Still it seems hardly probable, that there should be joined together in the same sending of salutation, an abstraction, spoken of thus enigmatically, and a man, Μάρκος ὁ υἱός μου, by name." 
2. "These considerations induce me to accede to the opinion of those, who recognize here the ἀδελφὴ γυνή whom St. Peter περιῆγεν, 1 Corinthians 9:5; and to find, in the somewhat unusual periphrastic way of speaking of her, a confirmation of this view."
3. "The fact of Peter taking refuge in the house of Mary the mother of John Mark (Act 12:2), casts hardly any weight on the side of the former interpretation: but it derives some probability from the circumstance that St. Mark is reported by Eus. l. c., and iii. 39, 1 Peter 5:8, vi. 14, 25, to have been the ἀκόλουθος and μαθητής and ἑρμηνευτὴς Πέτρου, on the authority of Papias and Clement of Alexandria."

## Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "That portion of the whole dispersion, or Church of Christianized Jews, with Gentile converts, which resides in Babylon."
2. "As Peter and John were closely associated, Peter addresses the Church in John's peculiar province, Asia, and closes with 'your co-elect sister Church at Babylon saluteth you.'"
3. "Babylon was the center from which the Asiatic dispersion whom Peter addresses was derived."

## Albert Barnes:
1. "The interpretation seems to be confirmed by the word rendered 'elected together with' - συνεκλεκτὴ suneklektē. This word would be properly used in reference to one individual if writing to another individual, but would hardly be appropriate as applied to an individual addressing a church."
2. "It could not readily be supposed, moreover, that any one female in Babylon could have such a prominence, or be so well known, that nothing more would be necessary to designate her than merely to say, 'the elect female.'"
3. "Why he was now with Peter is unknown. If this was the Mark referred to, then the word son is a title of affection, and is used by Peter with reference to his own superior age."

## Marvin Vincent:
1. "The majority of interpreters...refer it to the church."
2. "In favor of the literal interpretation are the weighty names of Alford, Huther, Calvin, Neander, Weiss, and Reuss."
3. "The fact, however, that the word is mystically used in a mystical book like the Apocalypse...is no argument for the mystical use of the word in writings of a different type."

## John Calvin:
1. "Moreover, let them only retain the name of Peter’s chair, and they will not refuse to set Rome in the infernal regions."
2. "If Mark formed, as they say, the Alexandrian Church, and had been long a bishop there, he could never have been at Rome with Peter."
3. "In saying that the Church there was a partaker of the same election, his object was to confirm others more and more in the faith; for it was a great matter that the Jews were gathered into the Church, in so remote a part of the world."

## Philip Schaff:
1. "The great majority of interpreters, however, including Luther, Calvin, and most of those of our own day, prefer the other view; and there is an obvious fitness in giving the greetings of the Christian community, within whose bounds Peter was at present resident, as the greetings of a church which, though widely separated geographically, was ‘co-elect’ with those ‘elect sojourners’ in other countries to whom he was writing."
2. "The allegorical interpretation becomes still less likely when it is observed that other geographical designations in this Epistle (chap. 1 Peter 1:1) have undoubtedly the literal meaning."
3. "Here, however, in Babylon, the scene of so much decayed greatness, Silvanus and Mark are found together once more, acting along with Peter, the friend of Paul. Near the end of his career Paul bears witness to Timothy that Mark was ‘profitable to him for the ministry’ (2 Timothy 4:11)."

## Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Either actual Babylon or, as most likely, mystical Babylon (Rome) as in the Apocalypse."
2. "If Peter is in Rome about A.D. 65, there is every reason why he should not make that fact plain to the world at large and least of all to Nero."
3. "The natural way to take it is for Peter's wife."

## Adam Clarke:
1. "The apostle does not mean Babylon in Egypt, nor Jerusalem, nor Rome as figurative Babylon, but the ancient celebrated Babylon in Assyria, which was... the metropolis of the eastern dispersion of the Jews." 
2. "Fellow elect, or elected jointly with you. Probably meaning that they, and the believers at Babylon, received the Gospel about the same time." 
3. "He is called here Peter's son, i.e. according to the faith, Peter having been probably the means of his conversion."


# BHT:
Amidst various interpretations, this verse refers to a greeting from a specific place that is likely the ancient Babylon in Assyria. It is probable that the mention of "elect" refers to the believers at Babylon and the recipients of the letter being elected together at a similar time. Additionally, the reference to Mark being "Peter's son" suggests a close relationship and the possibility that Peter played a role in his conversion.
