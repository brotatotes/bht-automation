# 1 Peter 5:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The description of the Bible verse includes interpretations from various commentaries. The verse is speculated to be referring to the church in Babylon, either literally referring to the city in Assyria or symbolically referring to Rome. There is a likelihood that the greetings from the church in Babylon were meant for the scattered Christian community addressed by Peter, emphasizing their shared election in Christ. The mention of "my son" alludes to Mark, who had a close relationship with Peter and a role in service to him.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "No mention has occurred in the Epistle of the word ἐκκλησία, to which reference might be made: if such reference be sought for, διασπορά, in ch. 1 Peter 1:1, is the only word suitable, and that could hardly be used of the congregation in any particular place."
2. "These considerations induce me to accede to the opinion of those, who recognize here the ἀδελφὴ γυνή whom St. Peter περιῆγεν, 1 Corinthians 9:5; and to find, in the somewhat unusual periphrastic way of speaking of her, a confirmation of this view."
3. "The fact of Peter taking refuge in the house of Mary the mother of John Mark (Act 12:2), casts hardly any weight on the side of the former interpretation: but it derives some probability from the circumstance that St. Mark is reported by Eus. l. c., and iii. 39, 1 Peter 5:8, vi. 14, 25, to have been the ἀκόλουθος and μαθητής and ἑρμηνευτὴς Πέτρου, on the authority of Papias and Clement of Alexandria: and that Irenæus (Hær. iii. 11, p. 174, Eus. 1Pe 5:8) reports the same."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "That portion of the whole dispersion, or Church of Christianized Jews, with Gentile converts, which resides in Babylon." 
2. "Peter addresses the Church in John's peculiar province, Asia, and closes with 'your co-elect sister Church at Babylon saluteth you'."
3. "Babylon was the center from which the Asiatic dispersion whom Peter addresses was derived."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The interpretation seems to be confirmed by the word rendered 'elected together with' - συνεκλεκτὴ suneklektē. This word would be properly used in reference to one individual if writing to another individual, but would hardly be appropriate as applied to an individual addressing a church."
2. "It could not readily be supposed, moreover, that any one female in Babylon could have such a prominence, or be so well known, that nothing more would be necessary to designate her than merely to say, 'the elect female.'"
3. "Why he was now with Peter is unknown. If this was the Mark referred to, then the word son is a title of affection, and is used by Peter with reference to his own superior age."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The majority of interpreters...refer it to the church."
2. "In favor of the literal interpretation are the weighty names of Alford, Huther, Calvin, Neander, Weiss, and Reuss."
3. "The fact, however, that the word is mystically used in a mystical book like the Apocalypse...is no argument for the mystical use of the word in writings of a different type."

### John Calvin:
1. "Many of the ancients thought that Rome is here enigmatically denoted... nor do they care for Christ, provided Peter be left to them." 
2. "This old comment has no color of truth in its favor... If Mark formed, as they say, the Alexandrian Church, and had been long a bishop there, he could never have been at Rome with Peter." 
3. "Since, then, Peter had Mark as his companion when he wrote this Epistle, it is very probable that he was at Babylon: and this was in accordance with his calling; for we know that he was appointed an apostle especially to the Jews."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The great majority of interpreters, however, including Luther, Calvin, and most of those of our own day, prefer the other view; and there is an obvious fitness in giving the greetings of the Christian community, within whose bounds Peter was at present resident, as the greetings of a church which, though widely separated geographically, was ‘co-elect’ with those ‘elect sojourners’ in other countries to whom he was writing."
2. "The allegorical interpretation becomes still less likely when it is observed that other geographical designations in this Epistle (chap. 1 Peter 1:1) have undoubtedly the literal meaning."
3. "The old friendship, therefore, is found still alive after a long and changeful interval. It was this Mark who was the occasion of the sharp contention between Paul and Barnabas, which is noticed in Acts 15:0."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Either actual Babylon or, as most likely, mystical Babylon (Rome) as in the Apocalypse."
2. "If Peter is in Rome about A.D. 65, there is every reason why he should not make that fact plain to the world at large and least of all to Nero."
3. "The natural way to take it is for Peter's wife. Cf. εκλεκτη κυρια in 2 John 1:1 (also verse 2 John 1:13)."

### John Gill:
1. "It is best therefore to understand it literally, of Babylon in Assyria, the metropolis of the dispersion of the Jews, and the centre of it, to whom the apostle wrote."
2. "The church in this place is said to be elected together with you; that is, were chosen together with them in Christ, before the foundation of the world, to grace here, and glory hereafter."
3. "This Church, he says, saluteth you; wishes all peace, happiness, and prosperity of every kind, and so doth Marcus, my son."

### John Wesley:
1. "The church that is at Babylon - Near which St. Peter probably was, when he wrote this epistle."
2. "Elected together with you - Partaking of the same faith with you."
3. "My son - Probably converted by St. Peter. And he had occasionally served him, 'as a son in the gospel'."
