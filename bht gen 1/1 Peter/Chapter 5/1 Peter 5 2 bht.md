# choicest prompt v1 X bht prompt v3; ['Henry Alford', 'Jamieson Fausset Brown', 'Albert Barnes', 'Marvin Vincent', 'John Calvin', 'Philip Schaff', 'Archibald T Robertson', 'Adam Clarke']

## Henry Alford:
1. "The verb includes in one word the various offices of a shepherd; the leading, feeding, heeding."
2. "He orders them to feed the flock of God, not generally, nor œcumenically, but locally, as far as concerned that part of it found among them."
3. "Prompted by a desire not of gain, but of good to the flock; ready and enthusiastic, as the children of Israel, and even the workmen, gave their services eagerly and gratuitously to build the tabernacle of old."

## Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Feed—Greek, 'Tend as a shepherd,' by discipline and doctrine."
2. "The dignity is marked by the term 'elder'; the duties of the office, to tend or oversee, by 'bishop.'"
3. "Necessity is laid upon them, but willingness prevents it being felt, both in undertaking and in fulfilling the duty."

## Albert Barnes:
1. "Feed the flock of God - Discharge the duties of a shepherd toward the flock."
2. "Taking the oversight thereof - ἐπισκοποῦντες episkopountes. The fair translation of this word is, 'discharging the episcopal office'; and the word implies all that is always implied by the word 'bishop' in the New Testament."
3. "Not by constraint, but willingly - Not as if you felt that a heavy yoke was imposed on you, or a burden from which you would gladly be discharged. Go cheerfully to your duty as a work which you love, and act like a freeman in it, and not as a slave."

## Marvin Vincent:
1. "Feed [ποιμανατε]. Better, Rev., tend, since the verb denotes all that is included in the office of a shepherd - guiding, guarding, folding, no less than feeding." 

2. "Feeding is part of tending." 

3. "The word filthy is intended to convey the idea which lies in aijscrov, base or dishonorable; becoming such if it is made the motive of the minister's service."

## John Calvin:
1. "Let us then remember to distinguish between the institution of Christ and the confusion of the Pope, it being as different as light is from darkness."
2. "The flock of Christ cannot be fed except with pure doctrine, which is alone our spiritual food."
3. "He then shows how they were rightly to perform the pastoral office, though the word ἐπισκοπεῖν generally means to preside or to oversee."

## Philip Schaff:
1. "The charge reminds us also of Paul’s counsel to the Ephesian elders (Acts 20:28). In the oldest of the classical writers the relations of ruler to people are familiarly described as the relations of shepherd to flock."
2. "The designation ‘the flock of God’ expresses both the unity of the Church and the fact that it is God’s possession, not that of the elders."
3. "This first definition describes the elder’s duty as one which is not to be taken up like an unwelcome burden imposed on one, or a task from which one cannot retreat."

## Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Jesus used this very word to Peter in the interview by the Sea of Galilee (John 21:16) and Peter doubtless has this fact in mind here." 
2. "See 1 Peter 2:25 for the metaphor."
3. "Clearly the elders received stipends, else there could be no such temptation."

## Adam Clarke:
1. "Feed the flock — Do not fleece the flock."
2. "This is another proof that bishop and presbyter were the same order in the apostolic times, though afterwards they were made distinct."
3. "Not for filthy lucre — Could the office of a bishop, in those early days, and in the time of persecution, be a lucrative office? Does not the Spirit of God lead the apostle to speak these things rather for posterity than for that time?"


# BHT:
The verse being described speaks of the duty of shepherding and tending to the flock of God. It emphasizes the comprehensive role of a shepherd, including leading, feeding, and guarding. The commentators stress the importance of pure doctrine in nourishing the flock and the distinction between Christ's institution and the corruption of the Pope. The verse also highlights the unity of the Church as God's possession and encourages shepherds to fulfill their duties willingly, with love and integrity, without seeking personal gain. The reference to Peter and the distinction between bishop and presbyter further shed light on the historical context.
