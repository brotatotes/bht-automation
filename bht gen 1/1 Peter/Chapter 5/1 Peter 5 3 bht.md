# choicest prompt v1 X bht prompt v3; ['Henry Alford', 'Jamieson Fausset Brown', 'Albert Barnes', 'Marvin Vincent', 'John Calvin', 'Philip Schaff', 'Archibald T Robertson', 'Adam Clarke']

## Henry Alford:
1. "Christian rulers of the church are προϊστάμενοι, ἡγούμενοι, but not κυριεύοντες." 
2. "One is their κύριος, and they are His διάκονοι."
3. "The tyrannizing could only apply to the portion over which their authority extended, but the good example would be seen and followed by the whole church."

## Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Not that we have dominion over your faith." - This quote highlights the humility of the speaker, emphasizing that they do not seek to control or oppress others in matters of faith.

2. "The flock, as one whole, is God's heritage, or flock in the singular. Regarded in relation to its component sheep, divided among several pastors, it is in the plural 'heritages'." - This quote provides a nuanced understanding of the term "God's heritage," explaining that it can refer to both the collective flock of believers and the individual portions entrusted to different pastors.

3. "The most effective recommendation of precept." - This quote emphasizes the power of leading by example, suggesting that actions can speak louder than words in influencing others.

These quotes offer insights into the themes of humility, stewardship, and the importance of setting a good example in matters of faith.

## Albert Barnes:
1. "Their dominion is not to be that of temporal lordship; it is to be that of love and truth."
2. "This command would prohibit all assumption of temporal power by the ministers of religion."
3. "The meaning here is, 'not lording it over the possessions or the heritage of God.'"

These quotes emphasize the importance of humility, love, and servant leadership in the role of ministers of religion, rather than seeking power or dominion over others. They also highlight the need to avoid the corruption and misuse of authority that has been seen in some religious institutions throughout history.

## Marvin Vincent:
1. "This carries the idea of high-handed rule."
2. "The word here, though its interpretation is somewhat disputed, seems to refer to the several congregations - the lots or charges assigned to the elders."
3. "Peter uses three different terms for a pattern or model: uJpogrammov, uJpodeigma, and tupov."

## John Calvin:
1. "Peter here condemns unreasonable exercise of power, as the case is with those who consider not themselves to be the ministers of Christ and his Church, but seek something higher."
2. "He calls particular churches 'lots,' (cleros ;) for as the whole body of the Church is the Lord’s heritage, so the churches, scattered through towns and villages, were as so many farms, the culture of which he assigns to each presbyter."
3. "Peter, indeed, expressly gives the churches this title, in order that we may know that whatever men ascribe to themselves is taken away from the Lord, as in many places he calls the Church his peculiar treasure, and the rod of his heritage, when he intends to claim his entire dominion over it."

## Philip Schaff:
1. "If lordship, therefore, is nowhere recognised, much more is oppressive rule, or ‘overruling’ as the margin of the A. V. gives it, repudiated."
2. "The point of the phrase lies then in the idea that these churches were God’s possession, and not at the disposal of the elders."
3. "The secret of their rule was to lie not in a lordly spirit, but in the persuasion of a consistent life."

## Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Lording it over" - This phrase refers to the act of exercising authority or control in a domineering or oppressive manner. It suggests a misuse of power and a failure to lead with humility and servanthood.

2. "The charge allotted to you" - This phrase emphasizes the responsibility and duty assigned to leaders. It implies that leadership is not about personal gain or control, but about faithfully fulfilling the tasks and obligations entrusted to them.

3. "Making yourselves ensamples" - This phrase highlights the role of leaders as examples or models for others to follow. It suggests that leaders should not only teach and instruct, but also live out the principles and values they espouse, serving as a positive influence on those under their care.

## Adam Clarke:
1. "According to him there are to be no lords over God's heritage, the bishops and presbyters who are appointed by the head of the Church are to feed the flock, to guide and to defend it, not to fleece and waste it." 
2. "And in humility, self-abasement, self-renunciation, and heavenly-mindedness, they are to be ensamples, τυποι, types, to the flock, moulds of a heavenly form, into which the spirits and lives of the flock may be cast, that they may come out after a perfect pattern." 
3. "Do they feed themselves, and not the flock? Are they lords over the heritage of Christ, ruling with a high eeclesiastico-secular hand, disputing with their flocks about penny-farthing tithes and stipends, rather than contending for the faith once delivered to the saints?"


# BHT:
The verse being described emphasizes the importance of humble leadership and servanthood in the Church. It warns against the abuse of power and controlling behavior by leaders, instead urging them to fulfill their responsibilities with love and truth. The verse also emphasizes the need for leaders to be examples to the flock, living out the values they teach and guiding others in a manner consistent with a heavenly pattern. It serves as a reminder for leaders to prioritize the spiritual well-being of the Church rather than pursuing personal gain or disputes over material possessions.
