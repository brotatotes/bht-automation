2. "‘the heritage of God’ is taken as the meaning by Cyril (on Isaiah 3:12), Calv., Beza (and consequently E. V.), Grot., Benson, al. But the objections to this are, that κλῆροι could not be taken for portions of κλῆρος, and that θεοῦ could in this case hardly be wanting."
3. "the tyrannizing could only apply to the portion over which their authority extended, but the good example would be seen and followed by the whole church: hence τῶν κλήρων in the prohibition, but τοῦ ποιμνίου in the exhortation."
