3. "That fadeth not away" - This is essentially the same word, though somewhat different in form, which occurs in 1 Peter 1:4.

## Marvin Vincent:
1. "The last thing Peter could have dreamed of as possible would be its misapplication to himself or his so-called successors" (Cook).
2. "Compare Hebrews 13:20, great Shepherd; and John 10:11, John 10:14, good Shepherd. Also, Ezekiel 34:15, Ezekiel 34:16, Ezekiel 34:23."
3. "The crown of victory in the games; of military valor; the marriage wreath, or the festal garland, woven of leaves or made of gold in imitation of leaves."

## John Calvin:
1. "Except pastors retain this end in view, it can by no means be that they will in good earnest proceed in the course of their calling, but will, on the contrary, become often faint." 
2. "Lest, then, the faithful servant of Christ should be broken down, there is for him one and only one remedy, — to turn his eyes to the coming of Christ."

2. "Peter speaks of ‘the crown’ the one well known to Christian hope. He calls it ‘the crown of glory,’ meaning by that not merely that it is a glorious one, but that it consists of glory."
3. "The figure being that of a wreath constructed of immortelles, which change neither in contour nor in colour."


## Archibald T Robertson:
1. "When the chief Shepherd shall be manifested." - The phrase highlights the future revelation of the chief Shepherd, implying that there is a higher authority who will ultimately oversee and guide the flock.

2. "Ye shall receive the crown of glory that fadeth not away." - This quote emphasizes the eternal nature of the reward awaiting believers, contrasting it with earthly crowns that fade and lose their glory over time.

3. "The amarantine (unfading) crown of glory." - The use of the term "amarantine" to describe the crown signifies its everlasting and immortal nature, symbolizing the believer's eternal victory and honor.

## Adam Clarke:
1. "When he shall appear to judge the world in righteousness, ye who have fed his flock, who have taken the superintendency of it, not by constraint, nor for filthy lucre's sake, not as lords over the heritage, but with a ready mind, employing body, soul, spirit, time and talents, in endeavouring to pluck sinners as brands from eternal burnings, and build up the Church of Christ on its most holy faith." 

2. "Ye shall receive a crown of glory that fadeth not away, an eternal nearness and intimacy with the ineffably glorious God."

3. "Ye who have turned many to righteousness shall shine, not merely as stars, but as suns in the kingdom of your Father!"

When the chief Shepherd is manifested, believers will receive the amarantine crown of His glory— an everlasting, unfading flower. This crown, distinguished from earthly crowns, is incorruptible and fades not away. It is a glorious diadem, symbolizing the eternal victory and honor that awaits those who faithfully serve the Lord, turning sinners to righteousness. As pastors and shepherds, they labor with a ready mind and unwavering dedication, knowing that a great reward is prepared for them by the Lord who will one day appear to judge the world in righteousness.
