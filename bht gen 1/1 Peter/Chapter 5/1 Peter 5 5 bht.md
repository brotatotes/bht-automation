# choicest prompt v1 X bht prompt v3; ['Henry Alford', 'Jamieson Fausset Brown', 'Albert Barnes', 'Marvin Vincent', 'John Calvin', 'Philip Schaff', 'Archibald T Robertson', 'Adam Clarke']

## Henry Alford:
1. "In like manner (i. e. ‘mutatis mutandis,’ in your turn: see ch. 1 Peter 3:7 ; with the same recognition of your position and duties), ye younger, be subject to the elders."
2. "Yea, all gird on humility to one another."
3. "God opposeth Himself to the proud, but giveth grace to the humble."

## Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "The deacons were originally the younger men, the presbyters older; but subsequently as presbyter expressed the office of Church ruler or teacher, so Greek 'neoteros' means not (as literally) young men in age, but subordinate ministers and servants of the Church."
2. "The 'young men' are undoubtedly the deacons of the Church of Jerusalem, of whom, as being all Hebrews, the Hellenistic Christians subsequently complained as neglecting their Grecian widows, whence arose the appointment of the seven others, Hellenistic deacons."
3. "Clothing was the original badge of man's sin and shame. Pride caused the need of man's clothing, and pride still reigns in dress; the Christian therefore clothes himself in humility."
4. "God resisteth the proud. Other sins flee from God: pride alone opposeth itself to God; therefore, God also in turn opposes Himself to the proud."
5. "Humility is the vessel of all graces."

## Albert Barnes:
1. "Submit yourselves unto the elder - That is, with the respect due to their age, and to the offices which they sustain."
2. "You are not to attempt to lord it over one another, but are to treat each other with deference and respect."
3. "They were to be willing to take any place, and to perform any office, however humble, in order to serve and benefit others."

## Marvin Vincent:
1. "Put on and wrap yourselves about with humility, so that the covering of humility cannot possibly be stripped from you."
2. "Pride calls out God's armies. No wonder, therefore, that it 'goeth before destruction.'"
3. "To the humble."

## John Calvin:
1. "He bids every one that is inferior in age to obey the counsels of the elders, and to be teachable and humble; for the age of youth is inconstant, and requires a bridle."
2. "When authority is granted to the elders, there is not given them the right or the liberty of throwing off the bridle, but they are also themselves to be under due restraint, so that there may be a mutual subjection."
3. "Surround yourselves with humility on every side, as though he had said, 'Surround yourselves with humility on every side, as with a garment which covers the whole body.'"

## Philip Schaff:
1. "The exhortation clearly is to the cherishing of a spirit of deference on the part of one class to another."
2. "The term ‘elder’ in the Hebrew Church was first a title of age and then a title of office."
3. "The importance of the duty of humility is enforced by a sentence taken from the Greek text of Proverbs 3:34: 'God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace to the humble.'"

## Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Be subject unto the elder. Here the antithesis between younger and elder shows that the word refers to age, not to office as in 1 Peter 5:1." 
2. "Gird yourselves with humility. Peter here is thinking of what Jesus did when he girded himself with a towel and taught the disciples, Peter in particular, the lesson of humility." 
3. "The proud. Dative plural of υπερηφανος (James 4:6; Romans 1:30) after αντιτασσετα (present middle indicative of αντιτασσω as in James 4:6 (quoted there as here from Proverbs 3:34)."

## Adam Clarke:
1. "Be subject one to another - Strive all to serve each other; let the pastors strive to serve the people, and the people the pastors; and let there be no contention, but who shall do most to oblige and profit all the rest." 

2. "Be clothed with humility - Be ye truly humble; and let your outward garb and conduct be a proof of the humility of your hearts." 

3. "God resisteth the PROUD, and giveth grace to the HUMBLE - the proud, with all their ornaments, God resists; while those who are clothed with the humble garment he adorns."


# BHT:
In this verse, the apostle Peter encourages the younger members of the community to show respect and obedience to their elders, while also emphasizing the importance of mutual humility and service. Commentators highlight the significance of humility, describing it as a protective garment to be wrapped around oneself. They warn against pride, which invites resistance from God but extol the virtues of humility, as it enables one to receive God's grace. The verse underscores the need for deference, humility, and mutual subjection in the community of believers.
