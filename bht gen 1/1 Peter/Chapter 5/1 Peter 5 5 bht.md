## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "ye younger, be subject to the elders... νεώτεροι... cannot mean younger in age merely, but those who were the ruled, the disciples, of the πρεσβύτεροι."
2. "all gird on humility to one another... an allusion to our Lord’s action of girding Himself with a napkin in the servile ministration of washing the disciples’ feet."
3. "God opposeth Himself to the proud... but giveth grace to the humble."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The deacons were originally the younger men, the presbyters older; but subsequently as presbyter expressed the office of Church ruler or teacher, so Greek 'neoteros' means not (as literally) young men in age, but subordinate ministers and servants of the Church."
2. "The 'young men' are undoubtedly the deacons of the Church of Jerusalem, of whom, as being all Hebrews, the Hellenistic Christians subsequently complained as neglecting their Grecian widows, whence arose the appointment of the seven others, Hellenistic deacons."
3. "Clothing was the original badge of man's sin and shame. Pride caused the need of man's clothing, and pride still reigns in dress; the Christian therefore clothes himself in humility."
4. "God resisteth the proud—Quoted, as James 4:6; Proverbs 3:34. Peter had James before his mind, and gives his Epistle inspired sanction. Compare 1 Peter 5:9; James 4:7, literally, 'arrayeth Himself against.' Other sins flee from God: pride alone opposeth itself to God; therefore, God also in turn opposes Himself to the proud."
5. "Humility is the vessel of all graces."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Submit yourselves unto the elder - That is, with the respect due to their age, and to the offices which they sustain."
2. "You are not to attempt to lord it over one another, but are to treat each other with deference and respect."
3. "They were to be willing to take any place, and to perform any office, however humble, in order to serve and benefit others."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Put on and wrap yourselves about with humility, so that the covering of humility cannot possibly be stripped from you."
2. "Pride calls out God's armies. No wonder, therefore, that it 'goeth before destruction.'"
3. "To the humble."

### John Calvin:
1. "He bids every one that is inferior in age to obey the counsels of the elders, and to be teachable and humble; for the age of youth is inconstant, and requires a bridle."
2. "When authority is granted to the elders, there is not given them the right or the liberty of throwing off the bridle, but they are also themselves to be under due restraint, so that there may be a mutual subjection."
3. "Surround yourselves with humility on every side, as though he had said, 'Surround yourselves with humility on every side, as with a garment which covers the whole body.'"

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The exhortation clearly is to the cherishing of a spirit of deference on the part of one class to another." 
2. "The term ‘elder’ in the Hebrew Church was first a title of age and then a title of office." 
3. "The importance of the duty of humility is enforced by a sentence taken from the Greek text of Proverbs 3:34."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Be subject unto the elder...Here the antithesis between younger and elder shows that the word refers to age, not to office as in 1 Peter 5:1."
2. "Gird yourselves with humility...Peter here is thinking of what Jesus did when he girded himself with a towel and taught the disciples, Peter in particular, the lesson of humility."
3. "The proud...after αντιτασσετα...quoted there as here from Proverbs 3:34."

### John Gill:
1. "Submit yourselves unto the elder; not merely in age, but in office... by attending constantly on the word preached by them, and receiving it, so far as it agrees with the Scriptures of truth; and by joining with them in all the ordinances of Christ, and their administrations of them."
2. "Yea, all [of you] be subject one to another... they should submit to the superior judgments of one another, esteeming each other better than themselves, and not be tenacious of their own way of thinking and judging of things."
3. "And be clothed with humility... a grace which shows itself in a man's thinking and speaking the best of others, and the worst of himself; in not affecting places and titles of eminence; in being content with the lowest place, and patiently bearing the greatest contempt."

### John Wesley:
1. "Ye younger, be subject to the elder" - This verse reminds us of the importance of respecting and submitting to those who are older and wiser than us. It teaches humility and the willingness to learn from others.

2. "Subject to each other" - This phrase emphasizes the mutual submission and humility that should characterize our relationships with one another. It encourages a spirit of cooperation and unity, where everyone is willing to put the needs and interests of others before their own.

3. "Be clothed with humility" - This powerful imagery suggests that humility should be an essential part of our character, something that we intentionally put on and wear at all times.
