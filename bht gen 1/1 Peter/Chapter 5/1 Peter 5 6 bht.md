# choicest prompt v1 X bht prompt v3; ['Henry Alford', 'Jamieson Fausset Brown', 'Albert Barnes', 'Marvin Vincent', 'John Calvin', 'Philip Schaff', 'Archibald T Robertson', 'Adam Clarke']

## Henry Alford:
1. "Humble yourselves...under the mighty hand of God, that He may exalt you." 
2. "The strong hand of God is laid on the afflicted and suffering, and it is for them to acknowledge it in lowliness of mind."
3. "This humility implies patience, waiting God's time: 'ut nimiæ festinationi simul obviam eat' (that excessive haste may be avoided at the same time), Calv."

## Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Accept His chastisements, and turn to Him that smiteth you." 
2. "He depresses the proud and exalts the humble." 
3. "Wait humbly and patiently for His own fit time."

## Albert Barnes:
1. "Humble yourselves therefore - Be willing to take a low place - a place such as becomes you."
2. "Under the mighty hand of God - This refers probably to the calamities which he had brought upon them, or was about to bring upon them; represented here, as often elsewhere, as the infliction of his hand."
3. "There is no situation in which one will be more likely to feel humility than in scenes of affliction."

## Marvin Vincent:
1. "Mighty hand [κραταιαν χειρα]": This phrase, although not found elsewhere in the New Testament, is significant as it appears in the Septuagint and highlights the power and strength associated with God's hand.
2. "The adjective kratrian, mighty, is, moreover, used only here": The unique use of the adjective emphasizes the exceptional nature of God's power and reinforces the idea of His strength being unmatched.
3. "Compare Luke 1:51, Luke 1:52": This reference to other verses in Luke draws a parallel between God's mighty hand and the acts of power described in those passages, further emphasizing the divine strength displayed throughout the Bible.

## John Calvin:
1. "We must ever bear in mind for what end he bids us to be humble before God, even that we may be more courteous and kind to our brethren, and not refuse to submit to them as far as love demands."
2. "He therefore exhorts all the godly to submit to God’s authority; and he calls God’s power his hand, that he might make them to fear the more."
3. "But as we are wont commonly to fear, lest our humility should be a disadvantage to us, and others might for this reason grow more insolent, Peter meets this objection, and promises eminency to all who humble themselves."

## Philip Schaff:
1. "The Hand that lays low also exalts."
2. "Self-exaltation will frustrate His purpose. But if we humble ourselves as He humbles us, we shall reap the ‘interest of tears’ and be glorified through sorrow."
3. "God has His own time, nevertheless, for fulfilling the purpose of His chastenings. That time, whether it come late or early, not our own hour, for which, like Mary at the marriage in Cana, we are so apt impatiently to plead, is the ‘due time,’ the fit season."

## Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Be humbled." - Peter is emphasizing the importance of humility, urging his audience to lower themselves before God.

2. "Under the mighty hand of God." - This phrase draws on the imagery from the Old Testament, highlighting God's power and authority over all things.

3. "That he may exalt you." - Peter explains that by humbling themselves, they can expect to be lifted up and exalted by God in His perfect timing.

## Adam Clarke:
1. "Humble yourselves - Those who submit patiently to the dispensations of God's providence he lifts up."
2. "If we humble not ourselves under God's grace, he will humble us under his judgments."
3. "Those who patiently submit to him, he exalts in due time; if his hand be mighty to depress, it is also mighty to exalt."
