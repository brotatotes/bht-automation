# choicest prompt v1 X bht prompt v3; ['Henry Alford', 'Jamieson Fausset Brown', 'Albert Barnes', 'Marvin Vincent', 'John Calvin', 'Philip Schaff', 'Archibald T Robertson', 'Adam Clarke']

## Henry Alford:
1. "The art. also shews that the μέριμνα was not a possible, but a present one; that the exhortation is addressed to men under sufferings."
2. "As to the connexion, we may remark, that this participial clause is explanatory of the former imperative one, inasmuch as all anxiety is a contradiction of true humility."
3. "μέριμνα, by which the spirit μερίζεται, part for God, part for unbelief, is in fact an exalting self against Him."

## Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "The advantage flowing from humbling ourselves under God's hand (1 Peter 5:6) is confident reliance on His goodness."
2. "Exemption from care goes along with humble submission to God."
3. "Care is a burden which faith casts off the man on his God."

## Albert Barnes:
1. "If we suffer heavy trials; if we lose our friends, health, or property; if we have arduous and responsible duties to perform; if we feel that we have no strength, and are in danger of being crushed by what is laid upon us, we may go and cast all upon the Lord; that is, we may look to him for grace and strength, and feel assured that he will enable us to sustain all that is laid upon us."
2. "He is not like the gods worshipped by many of the pagan, who were supposed to be so exalted, and so distant, that they did not interest themselves in human affairs; but He condescends to regard the needs of the meanest of his creatures."
3. "What more can one wish than to be permitted to feel that the great and merciful Yahweh thinks on him? What are we - what have we done, that should be worthy of such condescension?"

## Marvin Vincent:
1. "Throwing the whole life with its care on him."
2. "Not every anxiety as it arises, for none will arise if this transference has been effectually made."
3. "Pride is at the root of most of our anxiety."

## John Calvin:
1. "But this fear arises from our ignorance of divine providence."
2. "Now, on the other hand, as soon as we are convinced that God cares for us, our minds are easily led to patience and humility."
3. "We ought the more to dwell on this thought, that God cares for us, in order, first, that we may have peace within; and, secondly, that we may be humble and meek towards men."

## Philip Schaff:
1. "The fact that God retains a loving concern for us is our reason for rolling the burden of our anxieties upon Him."
2. "Humility of mind is a chief protection against anxiety."
3. "The anxiety is described here as a burden (= ‘your whole anxiety’) which is to be cast as one whole upon God."

## Adam Clarke:
1. "Casting all your care on him, for he cares for you." - This verse reminds us to entrust our anxieties and worries to God, knowing that He is concerned about every aspect of our lives.

2. "Whatever things concern a follower of God, whether they be spiritual or temporal, or whether in themselves great or small, God concerns himself with them." - This quote emphasizes that God is interested in every aspect of our lives, both big and small, and we can confidently bring all our concerns to Him.
