## Henry Alford:
1. "This sobriety of mind, as opposed to intoxication with μέριμναι βιωτικαί, is necessary to the ἀντιστῆναι στερεοί: only he who is sober stands firm." 
2. "Can it be that Peter thought of his Lord’s οὕτως οὐκ ἰσχύσατε μίαν ὥραν γρηγορῆσαι μετʼ ἐμοῦ, on the fatal night when he denied Him?"
3. "Your great and well-known adversary: 'ut sciant, hac lege se Christi fidem profiteri, ut cum diabolo continuum bellum habeant. Neque enim membris parcet, qui cum capite prœliatur,' Calv."

## Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Be sober, that is, self-restrained."
2. "Let this be your 'care.' God provides, therefore do not be anxious. The devil seeks, therefore watch."
3. "Through man's sin he got God's justice on his side against us; but Christ, our Advocate, by fulfilling all the demands of justice for us, has made our redemption altogether consistent with justice."

## Albert Barnes:
1. "Do not doubt that he is able and willing to support and befriend you, but be watchful against your foes." 
2. "It means that we should exercise careful circumspection, as one does when he is in danger."
3. "Satan opposes man in his best interests. He resists his efforts to do good; his purposes to return to God; his attempts to secure his own salvation."

## Marvin Vincent:
1. "Be sober...be watchful." - These verbs emphasize the need for alertness and self-control in the face of spiritual opposition. (Quote 1)
2. "The devil...roaring like a lion." - This vivid imagery portrays Satan as a fierce and relentless adversary, seeking to devour and destroy. (Quote 2)
3. "Walketh about...devour." - Peter's use of the word "Peripatetic" to describe Satan highlights his constant activity and desire to consume and overpower believers. (Quote 3)

## John Calvin:
1. "We must, he says, carry on a warfare in this world; and he reminds us that we have to do with no common enemy, but one who, like a lion, runs here and there, ready to devour."
2. "Paul stimulates us with the same argument in Ephesians 6:10, where he says that we have a contest not with flesh and blood, but with spiritual wickedness, etc."
3. "He compares the devil to a lion, as though he had said, that he is a savage wild beast."

## Philip Schaff:
1. "Sobriety is noticed as a condition to the highest type of Christian hope."
2. "The word ‘adversary’ means primarily an opponent in a lawsuit, and then an opponent generally."
3. "The fury and vigilance of this enemy, the dread means which he employs and the end to which he applies them, make sobriety and watchfulness imperative on our side."

## Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Be watchful (γρηγορησατε)."
2. "Your adversary (ο αντιδικος υμων)."
3. "The devil (διαβολος)."

Note: The commentary provides additional information about the words and their meanings, but the quotes themselves are the most relevant and enriching parts for understanding the verse.

## Adam Clarke:
1. "Be sober — Avoid drunkenness of your senses, and drunkenness in your souls; be not overcharged with the concerns of the world." 
2. "Be vigilant — Awake, and keep awake; be always watchful; never be off your guard; your enemies are alert, they are never off theirs."
3. "Your adversary the devil — This is the reason why ye should be sober and vigilant; ye have an ever active, implacable, subtle enemy to contend with."
