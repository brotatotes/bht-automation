# choicest prompt v1 X bht prompt v3; ['Henry Alford', 'Jamieson Fausset Brown', 'Albert Barnes', 'Marvin Vincent', 'John Calvin', 'Philip Schaff', 'Archibald T Robertson', 'Adam Clarke']

## Henry Alford:
1. "Knowing that they do not stand alone against him; that others are, as Gerhard expresses it, not only παθημάτων συμμέτοχοι, but in “precibus et pugna contra Satanam σύμμαχοι”."
2. "The very same sufferings are being accomplished in the case of the ἀδελφότης."
3. "Your brotherhood in the world, identifying their state with yours: who, like yourselves, are in the world, and thence have, like yourselves, to expect such trials."

## Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Satan's power exists only in respect to the unbelieving; the faithful he cannot hurt." (James 4:7) This quote highlights the limited power of Satan and emphasizes the strength of the faithful in resisting his influence.

2. "Faith gives strength to prayer, the great instrument against the foe." (James 1:6) This quote emphasizes the importance of faith in prayer as a means of combating the enemy.

3. "It is a sign of God's favor rather than displeasure, that Satan is allowed to harass you, as he did Job." This quote provides a perspective shift, suggesting that trials and tribulations can be seen as a sign of God's favor rather than punishment.

## Albert Barnes:
1. "You are in no instance to yield to him, but are in all forms to stand up and oppose him."
2. "The means of successful resistance are to be found in the resources of faith."
3. "We can bear pain more easily if we feel that we are not alone - that it is the common lot - that we are in circumstances where we may have sympathy from others."

## Marvin Vincent:
1. "Withstand is, moreover, the more accurate rendering; as the verb means rather to be firm against onset than to strive against it." 
2. "Steadfast is Anglo - Saxon, stede, a place, and faest, fast; and hence means firm in its place; but stereoi conveys also the sense of compactness, compact solidity, and is appropriate, since a number of individuals are addressed and exhorted to withstand the onset of Satan as one compacted body."
3. "The present infinitive denotes something in process of accomplishment."

## John Calvin:
1. "The issue of the war will be prosperous, if we indeed fight under the banner of Christ; for whosoever comes to this contest, endued with faith, he declares that he will certainly be a conqueror."
2. "There is sufficient strength in faith."
3. "We have a contest in common with all the children of God; for Satan dangerously tries us, when he separates us from the body of Christ."
4. "Nothing happens to us but what we see does happen to other members of the Church."
5. "We have always to do with our spiritual enemy, however adversities may come, or whatever they may be."

## Philip Schaff:
1. "Only he who is strong in the faith which makes him a Christian, is strong enough to vanquish this foe in the assaults which he makes with the engine of persecution." 
2. "Their courage in withstanding, with a firm faith, the devil’s attempts to seduce them through their sufferings, should be helped by the consideration that they occupied no singular position."
3. "The same dispensation of tribulation was fulfilling itself in them and in the brotherhood, the same tribute of suffering was being paid by them and by the brotherhood, and for the same reason."

## Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Cowardice never wins against the devil (2 Timothy 1:7), but only courage." 
2. "Steadfast in your faith (στερεο τη πιστε). Locative case πιστε. Στερεος is old adjective for solid like a foundation (2 Timothy 2:19)." 
3. "The same sufferings (τα αυτα των παθηματων). An unusual construction with the genitive rather than the usual τα αυτα παθηματα, perhaps as Hofmann suggests, 'the same tax of sufferings' ('the same things in sufferings')."

## Adam Clarke:
1. "Though invulnerable, he is not unconquerable: the weakest follower of God can confound and overpower him, if he continue steadfast in the faith-believing on the Son of God, and walking uprightly before him."
2. "To a soul thus engaged he can do no damage."
3. "The brotherhood, αδελφοτης, the Christian Church, everywhere is exposed to the assaults of men and devils; you are persecuted by the heathen among whom ye live, and from among whom ye are gathered into the fold of Christ."


# BHT:
In this verse, we are reminded that as believers, we are not alone in the battle against the enemy. Through our faith, we have the strength to resist and stand firm against Satan's attacks. The trials and sufferings we face are not unique to us, but a shared experience among the brotherhood of believers. By remaining steadfast in our faith, we can confidently face these challenges and overcome them, knowing that we have the support and sympathy of fellow Christians.
