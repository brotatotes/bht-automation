# 1 Peter 5:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the midst of trials and opposition, it is important to remain steadfast and unyielding, standing firm against the cunning tactics of the enemy. As we face the same kind of afflictions experienced by our fellow believers, we should find encouragement in knowing that we are not alone in our struggles. These trials serve a purpose, and we can endure them with patience and cheerfulness, knowing that there is a predetermined measure to the suffering we endure.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Knowing that they do not stand alone against him; that others are, as Gerhard expresses it, not only παθημάτων συμμέτοχοι, but in 'precibus et pugna contra Satanam σύμμαχοι'." 
2. "The very same sufferings are being accomplished in the case of the ἀδελφότης, according to the will of God, and by the appointment of God."
3. "Your brotherhood in the world, identifying their state with yours: who, like yourselves, are in the world, and thence have, like yourselves, to expect such trials."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Satan's power exists only in respect to the unbelieving; the faithful he cannot hurt." (James 4:7) 
2. "Faith gives strength to prayer, the great instrument against the foe." (James 1:6) 
3. "It is a sign of God's favor rather than displeasure, that Satan is allowed to harass you, as he did Job."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "You are in no instance to yield to him, but are in all forms to stand up and oppose him."
2. "Steadfast in the faith - Confiding in God. You are to rely on him alone, and the means of successful resistance are to be found in the resources of faith."
3. "The fact that others were enabled to bear their trials should be an argument to prove to them that they would also be able."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Resist having been already used in ver. 5 for ajntitassetai. Withstand is, moreover, the more accurate rendering; as the verb means rather to be firm against onset than to strive against it." 
2. "Steadfast is Anglo - Saxon, stede, a place, and faest, fast; and hence means firm in its place; but stereoi conveys also the sense of compactness, compact solidity, and is appropriate, since a number of individuals are addressed and exhorted to withstand the onset of Satan as one compacted body."
3. "The same afflictions [τα αυτα των παθηματων] . Rev., better, sufferings. A very peculiar construction, occurring nowhere else in the New Testament. Lit., the same things of sufferings, emphasizing the idea of identity."

### John Calvin:
1. "The issue of the war will be prosperous, if we indeed fight under the banner of Christ; for whosoever comes to this contest, endued with faith, he declares that he will certainly be a conqueror."
2. "There is sufficient strength in faith."
3. "We have a contest in common with all the children of God; for Satan dangerously tries us, when he separates us from the body of Christ."

Note: The provided commentary is quite long, so I have selected three quotes that I believe capture the essence of the author's message.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Only he who is strong in the faith which makes him a Christian, is strong enough to vanquish this foe in the assaults which he makes with the engine of persecution." 
2. "Their courage in withstanding, with a firm faith, the devil’s attempts to seduce them through their sufferings, should be helped by the consideration that they occupied no singular position."
3. "The same dispensation of tribulation was fulfilling itself in them and in the brotherhood, the same tribute of suffering was being paid by them and by the brotherhood, and for the same reason."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Cowardice never wins against the devil (2 Timothy 1:7), but only courage."
2. "Steadfast in your faith (στερεο τη πιστε)."
3. "The same sufferings (τα αυτα των παθηματων). Probably this is correct and is like Xenophon's phrase in the Memorabilia (IV. 8. 8), τα του γηρως επιτελεισθα (to pay the tax of old age)."
