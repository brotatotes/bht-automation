## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:

2. "So realizing was their Christian faith, that they were able hourly to look for the Lord Jesus."
3. "This marks that they were no longer heathen."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Silvanus, or Silas, and Timothy were properly united with him on this occasion, because they had been with him when the church was founded there." 
2. "Silas is first mentioned in the New Testament as one who was sent by the church at Jerusalem with Paul to Antioch and he afterward became his traveling companion."
3. "Which is in God the Father, and in the Lord Jesus Christ - Who are united to the true God and to the Redeemer; or who sustain an intimate relation to the Father and the Lord Jesus."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The reason for its omission in every case appears to have been the intimate and affectionate character of his relations with the parties addressed, which rendered an appeal to his apostolic authority unnecessary."
2. "Paul 's confidence in him appears in Philippians 2:19-22, and is implied in his sending him from Athens to the Thessalonian church to establish and comfort its members (1 Thessalonians 3:2)."
3. "In both Hebrew and N. T. usage, ejkklhsia implies a community based on a special religious idea, and established in a special way."

### John Calvin:
1. "The brevity of the inscription clearly shows that Paul's doctrine had been received with reverence among the Thessalonians, and that without controversy they all rendered to him the honor that he deserved."
2. "The ministers of Satan, it is true, had endeavored to trouble this Church also, but it is evident that their machinations were fruitless."
3. "We may, however, at the same time infer from it, that a Church is to be sought for only where God presides, and where Christ reigns, and that, in short, there is no Church but what is founded upon God, is gathered under the auspices of Christ, and is united in his name."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The omission of the official title Apostle can scarcely be accounted for by supposing that Paul had not yet assumed it, but is due to the affection subsisting between him and his Thessalonian converts, which did not require that he should urge his apostolic authority." 
2. "In God the Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ. At this early period the ‘Church’ needed some such distinguishing appellation. The former predicate ‘in God the Father,’ distinguishes it from the Gentile assemblies; the latter, ‘in the Lord Jesus Christ,’ from the Jewish congregation. In indicates living union and fellowship."
3. "Grace unto you, and peace. A Christian adaptation and blending of the ordinary Greek and Hebrew salutation. Paul wishes them a participation in God’s undeserved favour, the grace that has brought salvation to men; and in that peace which the Lord bequeathed to His followers, the restored harmony with God and conscience, the equanimity and confidence of God’s children, the ‘convalescence and healthfulness of the new life.’"

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Paul does not here call himself 'apostle' as in the later Epistles, perhaps because his position has not been so vigorously attacked as it was later." 
2. "In the very beginning of this first Epistle of Paul we meet his Christology. He at once uses the full title, 'Lord Jesus Christ,' with all the theological content of each word."
3. "Grace to you and peace...These words, common in Paul's Epistles, bear 'the stamp of Paul's experience' (Milligan). They are not commonplace salutations, but the old words 'deepened and spiritualised' (Frame)."

### John Gill:
1. "Paul was the inspired writer of it, and who is called by his bare name, without any additional epithet to it, as elsewhere in his other epistles."
2. "This church is said to be in God the Father; were interested in his love and free favour, as appears by their election of God."
3. "They were in the faith of God the Father, as the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, and in the profession of it, and so were distinguished from an assembly of Heathens that were in the faith of idols."

### John Wesley:
1. "St. Paul neither uses the title of an apostle, nor any other, as writing to pious and simple-hearted men, with the utmost familiarity."
2. "There is a peculiar sweetness in this epistle, unmixed with any sharpness or reproof."
3. "Those evils which the apostles afterward reproved having not yet crept into the church."
