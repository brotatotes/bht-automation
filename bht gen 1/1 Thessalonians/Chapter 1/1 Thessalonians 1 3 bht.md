## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "ὑμῶν is regarded as the genitive after μνημον . standing alone, and ἕνεκα supplied before the other genitives. But such a construction may be doubted, and at all events it is much simpler here to regard ὑμ . as the genitive governed by τοῦ ἔργου." 
2. "τοῦ ἔργου τῆς πίστεως: 'that work (energetic activity) which faith brings forth' (as Chrys. ἡ πίστις διὰ τῶν ἔργων δείκνυται)." 
3. "τοῦ κόπου: probably towards the sick and needy strangers, not in the word and ministry."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Not an otiose assent; but a realizing, working faith; not 'in word only,' but in one continuous chain of 'work'." 
2. "The Greek implies toil, or troublesome labor, which we are stimulated by love to bear."
3. "Your 'faith, hope, and love' were not merely such as would pass for genuine before men, but 'in the sight of God,' the Searcher of hearts."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Remembering without ceasing - Remembering your faith and love whenever we pray. This is not to be understood literally, but it is language such as we use respecting anything that interests us much. It is constantly in our mind."
2. "Your work of faith - That is, your showing or evincing faith. The reference is probably to acts of duty, holiness, and benevolence, which proved that they exercised faith in the Lord Jesus Christ."
3. "And labour of love - Labour produced by love, or showing that you are actuated by love. Such would be all their kindness toward the poor, the oppressed, and the afflicted; and all their acts which showed that they loved the souls of people."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The salutations of Paul reproduce ordinary conventional forms of greeting. Thus the familiar Greek greeting cairein be joyful, hail, welcome, appears in cariv grace."
2. "It is further to be noticed that many passages of Paul's Epistles give evidence of having been shaped by expressions in letters received by him from the parties he is addressing. In his answer he gives them back their own words, as is common in correspondence."
3. "The great triad of Christian graces, corresponding to 1 Corinthians 8:0. Hope is prominent throughout the two Epistles."

### John Calvin:
1. "The more that any one excels in piety and other excellences, so much the more ought we to hold him in regard and esteem. For what is more worthy of love than God? Hence there is nothing that should tend more to excite our love to individuals, than when the Lord manifests himself in them by the gifts of his Spirit."
2. "Work of faith I understand as meaning the effect of it. This effect, however, may be explained in two ways — passively or actively, either as meaning that faith was in itself a signal token of the power and efficacy of the Holy Spirit, inasmuch as he has wrought powerfully in the exciting of it, or as meaning that it afterwards produced outwardly its fruits."
3. "To hope he assigns patience, as it is always conjoined with it, for what we hope for, we in patience wait for, and the statement should be explained to mean, that Paul remembers their patience in hoping for the coming of Christ. From this we may gather a brief definition of true Christianity — that it is a faith that is lively and full of vigor, so that it spares no labor, when assistance is to be given to one’s neighbors, but, on the contrary, all the pious employ themselves diligently in offices of love, and lay out their efforts in them."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "That which faith does is to make us ‘walk worthy of God who hath called us unto His kingdom and glory’"
2. "Labour of love, i.e. the fatiguing and devoted toil in the service of others, which was dictated by the love they had for one another"
3. "The Thessalonians were distinguished by the vivid expectation they cherished of the second coming of the Lord, and this expectation enabled them to display an unwavering constancy in persecution"

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Without ceasing" - Paul's instruction to the Thessalonians to be mindful of their work of faith and labor of love without ceasing emphasizes the continuous and unwavering nature of their dedication to God. 

2. "Labour of love" - The phrase "labour of love" highlights the sacrificial and selfless nature of the Thessalonians' work. It is a reminder that love is not just a feeling, but an active and toiling commitment towards others. 

3. "Patience of hope" - The combination of patience and hope signifies the endurance and perseverance that believers need in the face of challenges and setbacks. It is the confident expectation of the fulfillment of God's promises that sustains and motivates them to keep going.

### John Gill:
1. "Faith is a working grace, it has a deal of work to do, it has its hands always full, and is employed about many things; it is the grace by which a soul goes to God, as its covenant God, lays hold on him as such, pleads his promises with him, asks favours of him, and is very importunate, and will have no denial."
2. "Love is a laborious grace when in lively exercise; love to God and Christ will constrain a believer to engage in, and go through, great hardships, difficulties, toil, and labour, for their sakes; and love to the saints will exert itself, by serving them in things temporal and spiritual."
3. "These persons had a good hope through grace given unto them, and which was founded in Christ Jesus, in his person, blood, and righteousness, and so was as an anchor sure and steadfast; and it had him for its object, it was a hope of interest in him, of being forever with him, of his second coming and glorious appearance, and of eternal life and happiness through him."

### John Wesley:
1. "Remembering in the sight of God — That is, praising him for it."
2. "Your work of faith — Your active, ever-working faith."
3. "Labour of love — Love continually labouring for the bodies or souls of men."
