# 1 Thessalonians 2:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we see that the early Christian communities faced persecution from their own countrymen, the Jews. This shared experience of persecution served as proof of their true Christianity. The believers in Christ Jesus not only endured afflictions but also imitated the faith and order of the Gospel, becoming equal to their fellow believers. Despite the opposition they faced, they remained steadfast and unshaken, demonstrating their intimate communion with Christ. This passage portrays the early churches as courageous and enduring, firmly rooted in their faith even in the face of fierce opposition.
