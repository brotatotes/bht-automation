# 1 Thessalonians 2:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the commentators highlight the actions and attitudes of a particular group of people towards God and mankind. The Jews are portrayed as the ones who had a history of opposing God and persecuting His messengers, even going so far as to kill Jesus Himself. Not only did they reject and harm the prophets sent to them, but they also exhibited hostility towards all men and hindered the spread of the Gospel. Despite considering themselves God's chosen people, their actions were displeasing to Him and they were contrary to the well-being and salvation of all.

2. "Their opposition to the Thessalonians, therefore, was no proof that God was opposed to them, and they should not allow themselves to be troubled by such opposition. It was rather proof that they were the friends of God - since those who now persecuted them had been engaged in persecuting the most holy people that had lived."
3. "They do not merely differ from other people in customs and opinions - which might be harmless - but they keep up an active opposition to all other people. It was not opposition to one nation only, but to all; it was not to one form of religion only, but to all - even including God’s last revelation to mankind."
