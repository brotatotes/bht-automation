# 1 Thessalonians 2:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse being described is a powerful condemnation of the actions and mindset of a specific group. The commentators highlight the accumulated sins, the coming wrath, and the hopelessness of their state. It is clear that the Jews, in their opposition to the gospel and envy towards the Gentiles, filled up the measure of their sins, leading to the divine wrath being poured upon them. The commentators emphasize that their actions have sealed their fate and their destruction is imminent.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "ἀναπλ. to bring up the measure of their sins to the prescribed point."
2. "the (predestined, or predicted, or merited) wrath (of God) came upon them."
3. "the wrath: so that it shall exhaust all its force on them."

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Their hindrance of the Gospel preaching to the Gentiles was the last measure added to their continually accumulating iniquity, which made them fully ripe for vengeance."
2. "The divine wrath has come upon them to the uttermost"; not merely partial wrath, but wrath to its full extent, "even to the finishing stroke."
3. "The past tense implies that the fullest visitation of wrath was already begun. Already in A.D. 48, a tumult had occurred at the Passover in Jerusalem, when about thirty thousand were slain; a foretaste of the whole vengeance which speedily followed."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Paul maintained that the Jews and Gentiles were now on a level with regard to salvation; that the wall of partition was broken down; that the Jew had no advantages over the rest of mankind in this respect, and that the pagan might be saved without becoming Jews, or being circumcised."
2. "Paul maintained just the opposite opinion, that pagans might be saved without becoming proselytes to the Jewish system, and that, in fact, salvation was as freely offered to them as to the children of Abraham."
3. "The 'wrath of God' may be said to have come upon a man when he abandons him, even though there may not be as yet any external expressions of his indignation."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "To speak - that they might be saved." 
2. "Always blind and stubborn, the Jews filled up the measure of their sins by their treatment of Christ and his apostles." 
3. "The wrath of God had not come upon them to the uttermost. The meaning is that the divine wrath had reached the point where it passed into judgment."

### John Calvin:
1. "By this calumny they made divisions in the Churches, they took away from the Gentiles the hope of salvation, and they obstructed the progress of the gospel."
2. "Paul charges them with this crime — that they regard the salvation of the Gentiles with envy, but adds, that matters are so, in order that their sins may be filled up, that he may take away from them all reputation for piety."
3. "He means that they are in an utterly hopeless state, inasmuch as they are vessels of the Lord’s wrath. 'The just vengeance of God presses upon them and pursues them, and will not leave them until they perish.'"

Note: The commentary is quite long, so I had to condense it significantly to fit within the word limit.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The Jews were always blind and stubborn; but when they slew their Lord, and drove forth His apostles, they filled up the measure of their iniquities." (Ellicott)
2. "In the beginning of sin and evil it seems as if men were free agents and had the power of going on or retreating. But as the crisis of their late approaches, they are bound under a curse; and the form in which their destiny presents itself to our minds, is as though it were certain, and only a question of time now soon it is to be fulfilled." (Jowett)
3. "Paul sees the punishment as if it had already fallen. To the apostle, reading the future in the present, the state of Judæa at any time during the last thirty years before the destruction of the city, would have been sufficient to justify the expression, ‘wrath is come upon them to the uttermost’." (Jowett)

### Archibald T Robertson:

2. "Such was their envy at the Gentiles, and their hatred of them, that could they have believed it to be the means of salvation, they would have forbidden the preaching of it to them."
3. "It is a rule with the Jews that if a Gentile studies in the law, he is guilty of death."

### John Wesley:
1. "The measure of their sins always, as they have ever done." 
2. "The vengeance of God is come upon them." 
3. "Will speedily complete their destruction."
