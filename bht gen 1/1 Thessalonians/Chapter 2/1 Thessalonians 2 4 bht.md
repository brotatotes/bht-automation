# 1 Thessalonians 2:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse being described is about the apostles' preaching and their aim to please God rather than men. They were chosen and approved by God for their work, not relying on their own abilities but on His grace and mercy. Their focus was not to please others, but to declare the truth and obtain God's approval. As tested and proven messengers, they spoke the gospel with sincerity and devotion, accountable to God alone.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "We must not introduce any ascertained fitness of them in themselves into the idea: it is only the free choice of God which is spoken of."
2. "ὡς belongs to the whole sentence, not merely to ἀνθρ. ἀρέσκ.: for in that case the second member would involve almost too harsh an ellipsis."
3. "ἡμῶν, of us, not said generally, of all men: but of us, Paul and Silvanus and Timotheus."

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "We have been approved on trial," "deemed fit."
2. "This approval as to sincerity depends solely on the grace and mercy of God."
3. "Not as pleasing... characteristic of false teachers."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The gospel is a system of truth and sincerity, and we evinced the same."
2. "An effectual restrainer from mere management and trick will always be found in a deep conviction of the truth and importance of religion."
3. "It was not the direct object of his preaching to please them. It was to declare the truth, and to obtain the approbation of God whatever people might think of it."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "We came and spoke to you as tested men." 
2. "Pleasing [αρεσκοντες]. As being those who seek to please." 
3. "Who proveth [δοκιμαζοντι]. Word - play with dedokimasmeqa we were approved."

### John Calvin:
1. "God, when he assigned me this office, bore witness to me as a faithful servant; there is no reason, therefore, why men should have doubts as to my fidelity, which they know to have been approved of by God."
2. "Paul contrasts pleasing men, and pleasing God, as things that are opposed to each other."
3. "True ministers of the gospel ought to make it their aim to devote to God their endeavors, and to do it from the heart, not from any outward regard to the world, but because conscience tells them that it is right and proper."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Approved by God. This expression indicates a selection on the part of God of men suitable for the work which He designed to do." 
2. "Paul was chosen to be an apostle, because of a natural fitness for the office. But it is not on any natural fitness Paul leans for his authority, but on God who gave him his commission."
3. "We speak as men responsible to God, and are thereby preserved from unworthy motives."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Perfect passive indicative of δοκιμαζω, old verb to put to the test, but here the tense for completed state means tested and proved and so approved by God." 
2. "To be entrusted with the gospel (πιστευθηνα το ευαγγελιον). First aorist passive infinitive of πιστευω, common verb for believing, from πιστις (faith), but here to entrust rather than to trust."
3. "Not as pleasing men (ουχ ως ανθρωποις αρεσκοντες). Dative case with αρεσκω as in Galatians 1:10. Few temptations assail the preacher more strongly than this one to please men, even if God is not pleased, though with the dim hope that God will after all condone or overlook."

### John Gill:
1. "Such was the good will and pleasure of God, that he from all eternity chose and appointed them to this work."
2. "The discharge of such a trust requires great faithfulness, and which the apostles had."
3. "Studying to approve themselves to God, whose Gospel was committed to them, from whom they received gifts to preach it, and to whom they were accountable for all."
