2. "The comparison is exceedingly tender and beautiful."
3. "Because ye became very dear to us."

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "As a nursing mother is ready to impart not only her milk to them, but her life for them, so we not only imparted gladly the spiritual milk of the word to you, but risked our own lives for your spiritual nourishment, imitating Him who laid down His life for His friends, the greatest proof of love."
