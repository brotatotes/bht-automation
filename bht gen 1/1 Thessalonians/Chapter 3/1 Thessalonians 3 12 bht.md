The verse encourages believers to grow not just in numbers, but also in faith, knowledge, and love. It calls for an increase in love, not only towards fellow believers, but also towards all people, including enemies.

The prayer is that God, as the source of all love, will cause believers to abound in love, ultimately leading to the fulfillment of the law and the perfection of their love.
