### John Calvin:
1. "It is, on the other hand, a great thing that he deprives himself of a brother and fellow-laborer, and one to whom, as he declares in Philippians 2:20, he found no equal, inasmuch as all aimed at the promotion of their own interests."
2. "Paul’s undaunted constancy was fitted so much the more to animate them, so as to keep them from giving way. And, assuredly, the fellowship which ought to subsist between the saints and members of Christ extends even thus far — that the faith of one is the consolation of others."
3. "Paul, accordingly, means that they ought to be fortified by his example, so as not to give way under their afflictions."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The expression ‘fellow-labourer with God' is supported by 1 Corinthians 3:9."
2. "Paul bestows these commendatory titles on Timothy partly from his affection for his young assistant, partly to illustrate still further his love for the Thessalonians."
3. "Paul’s fear was that the faith of the recent converts might fail under the persecution to which they were exposed."

### John Gill:
1. "And minister of God; of his making, and not man's; of his calling and sending, and of his blessing and succeeding; and who was a minister of the things of God, of the mysteries of God, of the truths of his Gospel."
2. "He was a labourer, and not a loiterer in the Lord's vineyard; one that laboured in the word and doctrine, that studied to show himself a workman, that gave himself wholly to meditation, reading, exhortation, and doctrine."
3. "This is another end of the Gospel ministry, to comfort afflicted minds, and distressed consciences; it is the will of God that his people should be spoke comfortably to; the doctrines of the Gospel are calculated for that purpose, and the ministers of it should be Barnabases, sons of consolation."
