## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "λοιπόν has no reference to time, ἀεὶ κ . εἰς τὸ διηνεκές...but introduces this second portion, thus dividing it from the first, and implying the close of the Epistle." 
2. "παρακ. ἐν κυρ. Ἰησ.] we exhort you in the Lord Jesus, that as ye received from us how ye ought to walk and to please God, as also ye are walking, that ye abound yet more." 
3. "The repetition of ἵνα after so long an intervening clause is too natural to have given rise...to the insertion) that ye abound yet more, viz.: ἐν τῷ οὕτως περιπατεῖν."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Furthermore—Greek, 'As to what remains.' Generally used towards the close of his Epistles."
2. "We now give you exhortation, beseech—'ask' as if it were a personal favor."
3. "Walk and please God—that is, 'and so please God,' namely, by your walk; in contrast to the Jews who 'please not God'."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Furthermore then - Τὸ λοιπὸν To loipon. 'As to what remains.' That is, all that remains is to offer these exhortations." 
2. "We beseech you - Margin, 'request.' The Greek is, 'we ask you' - ἐρωτῶμεν erōtōmen. It is not as strong a word as that which follows. And exhort you - Marg, 'beseech.' This is the word which is commonly used to denote earnest exhortation."
3. "By the Lord Jesus - In his name and by his authority. That as ye have received of us - As you were taught by us. Paul doubtless had given them repeated instructions as to their duty as Christians."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The formula is often used by Paul where he attaches, in a somewhat loose way, even in the midst of an Epistle, a new subject to that which he has been discussing."
2. "Rev. not so well, finally, although the word is sometimes rightly so rendered."
3. "Furthermore [λοιπον]... The word is sometimes rightly so rendered."

### John Calvin:
1. "The sum is this, that they should be more especially careful to make progress in the doctrine which they had received, and this Paul places in contrast with frivolous and vain pursuits."
2. "Paul, accordingly, reminds them in what manner they had been instructed, and bids them aim at this with their whole might."
3. "Now, there is a law that is here enjoined upon us — that, forgetting the things that are behind, we always aim at farther progress."

These quotes emphasize the importance of continuous growth and progress in the Christian faith, contrasting it with worldly distractions and encouraging believers to wholeheartedly pursue the teachings they have received.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Only as the organ of the Lord does Paul presume to exhort them; and only as believers united to Christ, and living in Him, does he expect that they will listen to his admonition."
2. "Many persons, like the son in the parable, seem to think that their knowledge of duty, and recognition of it in conscience, is some sort of compensation for their non-performance of it."
3. "The Thessalonians, however, were walking as Paul had directed them; but he knew the tendency there is to be content with a half-completed course, to allow some sin to remain because much has been cast out, to weary before the whole work is accomplished, and therefore be is bent upon having them ‘abound yet more.’"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Finally (λοιπον). Accusative of general reference of λοιπος, as for the rest. It does not mean actual conclusion, but merely a colloquial expression pointing towards the end (Milligan) as in 2 Corinthians 13:11; 2 Timothy 4:8."
2. "We beseech (ερωτωμεν). Not 'question' as in ancient Greek, but as often in N.T. (1 Thessalonians 5:12; 2 Thessalonians 2:1; Philippians 4:3) and also in papyri to make urgent request of one."
3. "That ye abound (ινα περισσευητε). Loose construction of the ινα clause with present subjunctive after two subordinate clauses with καθως (as, even as) to be connected with 'beseech and exhort.'"

### John Gill:
1. "The apostle does not lay his commands upon them as he might have done, and sometimes does, but endeavours to work upon them by way of entreaty, and which he doubtless thought the most effectual method to win upon them, and gain them."
2. "Their external walk is not as it was before conversion, according to the course of this world, or as other Gentiles walk, but in a holy religious life and conversation; and this requires spiritual life, strength and direction from Christ."
3. "The manner in which saints are to walk is as Christ himself walked, after the Spirit, and not after the flesh, according to the rule of the word, which is the standard of faith and practice, with prudence, wisdom, circumspection, and worthy of God, and of that calling wherein they are called."

### John Wesley:
1. "It is not enough to have faith, even so as to please God..."
2. "...unless we abound more and more therein."
3. "Faith is not a stagnant state, but a dynamic and growing relationship with God."
