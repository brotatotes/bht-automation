# 1 Thessalonians 4:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This verse reminds us of the powerful impact Christianity has on our perspective towards death and the hope of resurrection. It calls us to resist excessive mourning, not to lose hope, and to find comfort in the knowledge that death is but a temporary sleep. Through Christianity, our love for the departed is both preserved and transformed, as we are reminded of the steadfastness of God's love and the promise of reunion with our loved ones.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Those who are sleeping; so the present is used in the well-known epitaph, 'hieron hypnon koimatai; thneskein me lege tous agathous.'"
2. "He forbids lupeisthai altogether. But we must remember, what sort of lupeisthai it was. Surely not absolutely the mourning for our loss in their absence, but for theirs (see above), and in so far, for ours also."
3. "This shows of what kind their lȳpē was: viz. a grief whose ground was unbelief in a resurrection: which regarded the dead as altogether cut off from Christ’s heavenly kingdom."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The word 'cemetery' means a sleeping-place. Observe, the glory and chief hope of the Church are not to be realized at death, but at the Lord's coming; one is not to anticipate the other, but all are to be glorified together at Christ's coming."
2. "Death affects the mere individual; but the coming of Jesus the whole Church; at death our souls are invisibly and individually with the Lord; at Christ's coming the whole Church, with all its members, in body and soul, shall be visibly and collectively with Him."
3. "Not all natural mourning for dead friends is forbidden: for the Lord Jesus and Paul sinlessly gave way to it; but sorrow as though there were 'no hope,' which indeed the heathen had not: the Christian hope here meant is that of the resurrection."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "This verse reminds us that God's love is not based on our performance or worthiness, but on His own character and nature."
2. "It is a comforting reminder that God's love is steadfast and unchanging, regardless of our circumstances or failures."
3. "This verse challenges us to trust in God's love and to find our security and identity in Him, rather than in the opinions or acceptance of others."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "I would not have you to be ignorant. A formula often used by Paul to call special attention to what he is about to say."
2. "The Thessalonians were plainly distressed at the thought of separation from their departed brethren, and had partially lost sight of the elements of the Christian hope - reunion with them and fellowship with the Lord."
3. "The resurrection of Jesus involves the resurrection of believers. The living and the dead Christians shall alike be with the Lord."

### John Calvin:
1. "For the sum of the whole is this — that we must not bewail the dead beyond due bounds, inasmuch as we are all to be raised up again."
2. "He forbids them to grieve in the manner of unbelievers, who give loose reins to their grief, because they look upon death as final destruction."
3. "The hope of a blessed resurrection, which is the mother of patience, will effect this."

Note: The commentary provides additional context and explanations for these quotes, but the quotes themselves are the most concise and impactful statements that enrich the understanding of the verse.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Death is called sleep by Pagan as well as by Christian writers, and it is therefore probable that the euphemism was first suggested by the stillness and repose, and cessation of intercourse with outward things, which characterize both conditions."
2. "No sleep lasts for ever, else it is not sleep; a waking follows every sleep. And so death is called a sleep, to remind us that it is not a final cessation of life, even in the case of the body, but only a transitory state out of which body and soul shall together arise."
3. "These words do not merely forbid such sorrowing as the hopeless indulge in, but all sorrowing. They who look for no resurrection sorrow for the dead, but ye are not to do so."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "We do not wish. No advantage in ignorance of itself." 
2. "Present tense gives idea of repetition, from time to time fall asleep." 
3. "This picture of the hopelessness of the pagan world about the future life is amply illustrated in ancient writings."

### John Gill:
1. "It was in common use among the Eastern nations, when they spoke of their dead, to say they were asleep. This way of speaking is used frequently both in the Old and the New Testament." 
2. "The apostle's view is not to encourage and establish a stoical apathy, a stupid indolence, and a brutal insensibility, but to forbid excessive and immoderate sorrow, and all the extravagant forms of it the Gentiles ran into." 
3. "The words are to be understood not of other Christians, who have no hope of the eternal welfare of their deceased friends; not but that the sorrow of those who have a good hope of the future well-being of their dear relatives must and ought to be greatly different from that of others, who have no hope at all."

### John Wesley:
1. "The efficacy of Christianity greatly appears, that it neither takes away nor embitters, but sweetly tempers, that most refined of all affections, our desire of or love to the dead."
2. "Christianity does not diminish or sour our love for the departed, but rather brings a gentle balance to it."
3. "This verse highlights the unique power of Christianity to preserve and sanctify our love for those who have passed away."
