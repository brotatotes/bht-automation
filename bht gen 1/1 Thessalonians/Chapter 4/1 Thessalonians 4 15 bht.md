# 1 Thessalonians 4:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This Bible verse is a revelation from the Lord, bearing the certainty and authority of His word. The apostle Paul, along with the believers in Thessalonica and all generations, expected to be alive at the glorious return of the Lord. This verse corrects the misconception that those who are alive will have an advantage over the faithful who have passed away. Rather, the order of the resurrection will commence with those who have died in Christ, as believers of all ages are part of the same body under Christ as the Head.
