# 1 Thessalonians 4:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we see a vivid description of the awaited moment when Christ Himself will descend from heaven, surrounded by His angelic hosts and accompanied by the sounding of a trumpet. The Lord will come as a victorious King, issuing commands to the heavenly hosts. With a shout, the voice of the archangel, and the trumpet of God, the dead in Christ will rise first, followed by those who are alive. This glorious event will signify the reunification of believers and the ultimate triumph of Christ over sin, death, and Satan.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "With a shout - The word here used (κέλευσμα keleusma), does not elsewhere occur in the New Testament. It properly means a 'cry’ of excitement, or of urging on; an outcry, clamor, or shout, as of sailors at the oar, Luc. Catapl. 19; of soldiers rushing to battle, Thuc. 3:14; of a multitude of people, Diod. Sic. 3:15; of a huntsman to his dogs, Xen. Ven. 6:20."
2. "With the voice of the archangel - The word archangel occurs nowhere else in the New Testament, except in Jude 1:9, where it is applied to Michael. It properly means a chief angel; one who is first, or who is over others - ἄρχων archōn."
3. "And with the trump of God - The trump which God appoints to be sounded on that solemn occasion. It does not mean that it will be sounded by God himself; see the notes on Matthew 24:31."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The following description of the Lord's descent from heaven is intended to emphasize the fact that the reunion of dead and living believers will be accomplished by the Lord in person."
2. "With a shout [εν κελευσματι]. N. T. o. Once in LXX, Proverbs 24:6 Proverbs 24:2 (English Bib 30:27). From keleuein to summon. Often in Class. Lit. a shout of command, as of a general to his army, an admiral to his oarsmen, or a charioteer to his horses."
3. "The Pauline angelology shows traces of Rabbinical teachings in the idea of orders of angels. See Ephesians 1:21; Colossians 1:16; Romans 8:38. The archangels appear in the apocryphal literature. In the Book of Enoch (see on Jude 1:14) four are named, Michael, Uriel, Raphael, and Gabriel."
