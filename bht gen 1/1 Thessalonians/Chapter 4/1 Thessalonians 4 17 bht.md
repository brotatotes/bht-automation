# 1 Thessalonians 4:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, commentators highlight the concept of believers being caught up together with the risen saints, with no distinction between the living and the dead. They mention the swift and divine nature of this event, as believers will be elevated in the air to meet the Lord. The gathering in the air is seen as a token of the new conditions and identifies believers with Christ. The ultimate outcome is the eternal life and residence with Him, where believers will be united and ever with the Lord.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The word here rendered 'then' (ἔπειτα epeita), does not necessarily mean that this would occur immediately. It properly marks succession in time, and means 'afterward, next, next in the order of events.'" 
2. "The word should not be construed, however, as implying that there will be any reluctance on the part of the saints to appear before the Saviour, but merely with reference to the physical fact that power will be necessary to elevate them to meet him in the air." 
3. "It would seem from this, that the Lord Jesus, in his coming, would not descend to the earth, but would remain at a distance from it in the air, where the great transactions of the judgment will occur."

### Marvin Vincent:

2. "For the life of believers, when they have once been gathered into one kingdom, will have no end any more than Christ’s."
3. "We must observe also what he says — we shall be, for he means that we profitably entertain a hope of eternal life, only when we hope that it has been expressly appointed for us."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The bodily ascent will be a token of the new conditions into which the body has passed, and will serve to identify the glorified body of the believer with that of Christ."
2. "The general idea of a gathering to the Lord is conveyed, but a literal representation of all the details here mentioned would fail to furnish us with an accurate picture of what will actually take place."
3. "The restoration to lost friends is much, but is enhanced by the introduction to Christ and everlasting residence with Him."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Together with them (αμα συν αυτοις). Note both αμα (at the same time) and συν (together with) with the associative instrumental case αυτοις (the risen saints)."
2. "Shall be caught up (αρπαγησομεθα). Second future passive indicative of αρπαζω, old verb to seize, to carry off like Latin rapio."

### John Gill:
1. "And this rapture of the living saints will be together with them; with the dead in Christ, that will then be raised; so that the one will not come before the other, or the one be sooner with Christ than the other; but the one being raised and the other changed, they will be joined in one company and general assembly, and be caught up together."
2. "These will be the chariots, in which they will be carried up to him; and thus, as at our Lord's ascension a cloud received him, and in it he was carried up out of the sight of men, so at this time will all the saints ride up in the clouds of heaven."
3. "Now the saints are with him at times, and have communion with him, but not always; but then they shall be ever with him; wherever he is; first in the air, where they shall meet him; then in the third heaven, where they shall go up with him; then on earth, where they shall descend and reign with him a thousand years; and then in the ultimate glory to all eternity."

### John Wesley:
1. "Together — In the same moment." This quote highlights the idea that both the wicked and the righteous will face judgment at the same time, emphasizing the impartiality of God's judgment.

2. "The wicked will remain beneath, while the righteous, being absolved, shall be assessors with their Lord in the judgment." This quote suggests that the wicked will be separated from the righteous, with the wicked remaining in a lower state while the righteous are exalted to a position of authority alongside God during the judgment.

3. "With the Lord — In heaven." This quote emphasizes that the righteous will be in the presence of God, indicating their close relationship with Him and the ultimate reward of being in His presence in heaven.
