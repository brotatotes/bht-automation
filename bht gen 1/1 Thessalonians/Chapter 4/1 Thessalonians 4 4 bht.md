### Henry Alford:
1. "On the meaning of τὸ σκεῦος, there has been much difference. Very many Commentators understand it of ‘the body.’"
2. "But a more fatal objection than any of the former is, that the context is entirely against the meaning. The ἁγιασμός has been explained to consist in ἀπέχεσθαι ἀπὸ τῆς πορνείας."
3. "Thus the context would be satisfied, and the emphatic position of ἑαυτοῦ (as in 1Co 7:2); and κτᾶσθαι would retain its proper meaning: that each of you should know how to acquire his own vessel (for this purpose) in sanctification (κτᾶσθαι ἐν ἁγ . belong together) and honour."
