# 1 Thessalonians 5:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the commentators emphasize the significance of recognizing and respecting the leaders within the community. These leaders, referred to as presbyters, bishops, or deacons, are entrusted with the responsibility of laboring, overseeing, and admonishing the congregation. Their role extends beyond mere teaching, as they are dedicated to guiding and ministering to the spiritual needs of the community. It is essential to appreciate their work, seek their counsel, and support them in their efforts to ensure the proper functioning of the church.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The persons indicated by κοπιῶντας, προϊσταμένους, and νουθετοῦντας, are the same, viz. the πρεσβύτεροι or ἐπίσκοποι."
2. "ἐν κυρίῳ, as the element in which, the matter with regard to which, their presidency takes place: = 'in divine things.'"
3. "οὐκ ἐν τοῖς κοσμικοῖς, ἀλλʼ ἐν τοῖς κατὰ κύριον."

2. Recognize their office, and treat them accordingly with reverence and liberality in supplying their needs.
3. The ministers are laboring, overseeing, and admonishing the church, with gentle yet faithful admonition in divine matters.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The word 'know' seems to mean that they were not to make themselves strangers to them - to be cold and distant toward them - to be ignorant of their needs, or to be indifferent to them."
2. "They should seek to be personally acquainted with him, and make him their confidant and counselor in their spiritual troubles."

1. "Recognize them for what they are, and as entitled to respect because of their office."
2. "The ecclesiastical nomenclature of the Pauline Epistles is unsettled, corresponding with the fact that the primitive church was not a homogeneous body throughout christendom."

Note: The commentary is quite lengthy, so I have selected three quotes that provide insights into the verse and the context of the early church.

### John Calvin:
1. "As the kingdom of God is lightly esteemed, or at least is not esteemed suitably to its dignity, there follows also from this, contempt of pious teachers." 
2. "The reason why less honor is shown to teachers themselves than is befitting, is because their labor is not ordinarily taken into consideration." 
3. "Those whom God makes ministers in connection with so great a matter, ought to be held by us in great esteem."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "To know. ‘That is, to appreciate, not to be unaware of their real work’ (Vaughan)."
2. "Those who labour among you, and preside over you and admonish you. All three functions belong to the same office."
3. "But if not in Thessalonica, in other churches, symptoms soon appeared of a separation of the ruling from the teaching elders."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Old word for toil even if weary." 
2. "Literally, those who stand in front of you, your leaders in the Lord, the presbyters or bishops and deacons."
3. "Putting sense into the heads of people. A thankless, but a necessary, task."

### John Gill:
1. "They laboured in the word and doctrine; gave up themselves to meditation, reading, and prayer; laboured hard in private, to find out the meaning of the word of God; and studied to show themselves workmen, that need not be ashamed."
2. "They laboured to enlighten their understandings, to inform their judgments, to raise their affections, and to bring their wills to a resignation to the will of God."
3. "They ministered unto you in holy things, being servants to you for Jesus' sake."

### John Wesley:
1. "Know them that labour among you: See, mark, take knowledge of them and their work."
2. "Are over you in the Lord: Sometimes the same person may both labour, that is, preach; be over, or govern."
3. "Admonish you: Sometimes two or more different persons, according as God variously dispenses his gifts."

These quotes emphasize the importance of recognizing and acknowledging those who work diligently, lead with authority, and provide guidance and correction within the community. It also highlights the danger of individuals taking on such roles without the necessary qualifications, questioning their motives and integrity.
