### Albert Barnes:
1. "The duties here enjoined are such as pertain to all Christians in their appropriate spheres, and should not be left to be performed by ministers only."
2. "One reason why there is so little piety in the church...is, that the great mass of church members feel no responsibility on this subject."
3. "Many a church is like an army where half the soldiers are out of the line...where not half of them could be depended on for efficient service in a campaign."
4. "To do this [comfort the feeble-minded] is also the duty of each church member...Christians are assailed by temptation...and find no comfort. In such circumstances, how consoling is the voice of a friend!"
5. "Every Christian...has a fund of experience which is the property of the church, and which may be of incalculable value to those who are struggling now amidst many embarrassments along the Christian way."

### Marvin Vincent:

3. "The primary sense is, keeping one's self directly opposite to another so as to sustain him."

### John Calvin:
1. "He commands, therefore, that the unruly be admonished, that is, those who live dissolutely. The term admonition, also, is employed to mean sharp reproof, such as may bring them back into the right way, for they are deserving of greater severity, and they cannot be brought to repentance by any other remedy." 

2. "On the other hand, he commands that the unruly should be admonished sharply, in order that the weak may be treated with kindness and humanity, and that the faint-hearted may receive consolation."

3. "He recommends, however, patience towards all, for severity must be tempered with some degree of lenity, even in dealing with the unruly. This patience, however, is, properly speaking, contrasted with a feeling of irksomeness, for nothing are we more prone to than to feel wearied out when we set ourselves to cure the diseases of our brethren."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The counsels of this verse are addressed not to the ministers alone, nor to the people alone, but to all."

3. "How are we to treat the scrupulous, conscientiously bigoted, slow, obstructive, little-minded members? We are to support, or, as the word means, hold to them. We are to befriend and consider them."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Put sense into the unruly mob who break ranks."
2. "Local conditions often cause some to lose heart and wish to drop out, be quitters."
3. "Hold out with them. What a wonderful ideal Paul here holds up for church leaders!"

### John Gill:
1. "Warn them that are unruly; or disorderly, idle persons, working not at all, busying themselves with other men's matters, and living upon the church's stock, reprove them for their sloth, exhort them to work with their own hands, to do their own business, and with quietness eat their own bread." 

2. "Comfort the feebleminded: such as are not able to bear the loss of near and dear relations; are ready to stagger under the cross, and at the reproaches and persecutions of the world; and are almost overset with the temptations of Satan; and are borne down and discouraged with the corruptions of their hearts, speak a comfortable word to them, encourage them with the doctrines of grace, and the promises of the Gospel."

3. "Support the weak; who are weak in faith and knowledge, strengthen them, hold them up; or as the Syriac version renders it, 'take the burden of the weak' and carry it, bear their infirmities, as directed in Romans 15:1."
