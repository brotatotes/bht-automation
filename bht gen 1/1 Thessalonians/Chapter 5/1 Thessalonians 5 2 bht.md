# 1 Thessalonians 5:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This verse speaks of a future event known as the "day of the Lord," in which Jesus will manifest His power and goodness or penal justice. It will come suddenly and unexpectedly, like a thief in the night, without warning or indication. Believers are urged to be aware of their limited knowledge about the timing of this event, emphasizing the need for contentment with the knowledge they already possess. The focus is not on acquiring more knowledge, but on applying and living out the knowledge they have.
