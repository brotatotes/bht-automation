## BHT:
Despise not prophesyings. This verse reminds us not to disregard or underestimate the importance of prophetic messages. Stop counting them as insignificant or unimportant, for prophecy was indeed a great gift and means of grace in the apostolic church. These prophecies, whether they concern the first coming of Christ or things to be done under the Gospel dispensation, should be highly valued and esteemed. To despise them, under whatever pretense, is to risk quenching the Spirit. Let us not neglect nor underestimate the power and influence of these prophetic teachings, for they have the potential to convert and transform lives.
