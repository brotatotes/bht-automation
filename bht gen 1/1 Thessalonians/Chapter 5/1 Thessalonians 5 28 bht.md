# 1 Thessalonians 5:28 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse under consideration reveals the triune nature of God - the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. It signifies the believer's identification with Christ's death, burial, and resurrection through baptism, symbolizing their new life in Christ. The verse concludes with a salutation, highlighting the apostle's desire for the Thessalonians to experience the unmerited favor and blessing that comes through Jesus Christ. The subscription attached to the epistle is deemed erroneous, as the epistle was written from Corinth, not Athens.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The triune nature of God is revealed in this verse, as it mentions the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. This highlights the unity and equality of the three persons of the Godhead." 

2. "The mention of baptism in this verse signifies the believer's identification with Christ's death, burial, and resurrection. It symbolizes the believer's new life in Christ and their commitment to follow Him."

3. "The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ refers to the unmerited favor and divine empowerment that believers receive through their faith in Jesus. It is through His grace that they are saved and enabled to live a life pleasing to God."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Paul ends as he began with 'grace.'" 
2. "The oldest manuscripts omit 'Amen,' which probably was the response of the Church after the public reading of the Epistle."
3. "The subscription is a comparatively modern addition. The Epistle was not, as it states, written from Athens, but from Corinth; for it is written in the names of Silas and Timothy (besides Paul), who did not join the apostle before he reached the latter city."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It is a subject of express divine command that the people should have access to the Holy Scriptures."
2. "There is great iniquity in all those decisions and laws which are designed to keep the Scriptures from the common people."
3. "The richest blessing of heaven to mankind is the Bible; and there is no book ever written so admirably adapted to the common mind, and so fitted to elevate the sunken, the ignorant, and the degraded."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The grace. That is, the free favour, the unmerited kindness." 
2. "This is the usual closing benediction with which Paul concludes his letters." 
3. "The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ is the source of all blessings and the foundation of our salvation."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Paul prefers this noble word to the customary ερρωσθε (Farewell, Be strong)." 
2. "The full Trinitarian benediction we find in 2 Corinthians 13:13." 
3. "A bit shorter form in 1 Corinthians 16:23; Romans 16:20 and still shorter in Colossians 4:18; 1 Timothy 6:21; Titus 3:15; 2 Timothy 4:22."

### John Gill:
1. "The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you, Amen. This is the apostle's usual salutation in all his epistles, and the token of the genuineness of them." 

2. "The subscription to this epistle is not genuine, which runs thus, 'The first Epistle unto the Thessalonians was written from Athens'; whereas it appears from 1 Thessalonians 3:1 compared with Acts 18:1 that it was written from Corinth, and not from Athens."

3. "The salutation 'The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you' is a powerful reminder of the unmerited favor and blessing that comes through Jesus Christ. It is a declaration of the apostle's desire for the Thessalonians to experience the fullness of God's grace in their lives."
