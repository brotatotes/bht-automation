# 1 Thessalonians 5:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we see a vivid description of an event happening suddenly and unexpectedly, likened to the sudden pang of labor that comes upon a woman. The commentators emphasize the surprise and unpreparedness of those who will experience this event. They caution against complacency and reliance on false peace and security, highlighting the need to be alert and watchful. The imagery of a thief in the night and the suddenness of destruction serve as warnings against disregarding God's warnings and living in disobedience.
