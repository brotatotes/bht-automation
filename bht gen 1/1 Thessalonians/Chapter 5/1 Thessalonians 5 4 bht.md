1. "But ye, brethren, are not in darkness... they are born in darkness, and are brought up in it, and willingly, walk in it; they are covered with it... and dwell in it... their understandings are darkened... and which is the case of God's elect themselves, while unregenerate."

2. "but now these persons were called out of darkness, turned from it, and delivered from the power of it; and therefore knew that the day of the Lord comes as above described... and needed not to be informed about that matter."

3. "these saints were not in the dark, but in the light, and so could see when the day of the Lord came; and would not be surprised with it... since they would be, or at least should be on their watch, and be looking out for, and hasting to the coming of the day of God."

### John Wesley:
