Believers are children of light and day, originating from and belonging to the realm of enlightenment and righteousness. They have no reason to fear or be surprised by the coming of the day of the Lord. The transformation that comes with being a Christian aligns them with the light, separating them from the darkness. In this new realm of light, believers are wakeful, vigilant, and expectant of Christ's coming, living in accordance with the truth they have received.
