# 1 Thessalonians 5:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, there is a clear distinction between those who are spiritually asleep and intoxicated, and those who are spiritually awake and sober. The commentators emphasize how being in darkness, whether it is through slumber or indulgence, is connected to spiritual ignorance and a love for sin. On the other hand, being in the light of day represents living in righteousness, being aware of the truth, and having a spiritual awakening. This verse serves as a reminder for believers to remain vigilant, avoiding spiritual lethargy and ignorance, and instead embracing the light of God's word.
