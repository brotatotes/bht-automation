### Henry Alford:
1. "Notice, that these arms are defensive only, as against a sudden attack and belong therefore not so much to the Christian’s conflict with evil, as (from the context) to his guard against being surprised by the day of the Lord as a thief in the night."
2. "The best defences against such a surprise are the three great Christian graces, Faith, Hope, Love, which are accordingly here enumerated."
3. "We must not perhaps press minutely the meaning of each part of the armour, in the presence of such variation in the two passages."
