# 1 Timothy 1:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This verse describes someone who was a blasphemer, persecutor, and insulter, acting out of arrogance and contempt for others. Despite their violent and wicked actions, their ignorance and unbelief are considered mitigating circumstances, not excuses. Their past conduct, fueled by rage and cruelty, led to shame and remorse. However, their ignorance opens the door to mercy, as they had not sinned willfully against a clear understanding of the truth.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "being before a blasphemer and persecutor and insulter"
2. "howbeit I had mercy shewn me"
3. "because I did it ignorantly in unbelief"

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "One who acts injuriously from arrogant contempt of others."
2. "God's mercy, and Paul's want of it, stand in sharp contrast."
3. "Ignorance does not in itself deserve pardon; but it is a less culpable cause of unbelief than pride and wilful hardening of one's self against the truth."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "People may have very different views of their conduct when they come to look at it in subsequent life. What they now regard as harmless, or even as right and proper, may hereafter overwhelm them with shame and remorse."
2. "The ignorance and unbelief of Paul were not such excuses for what he did that they would wholly free him from blame, nor did he regard them as such - for what he did was with a violent and wicked spirit - but they were mitigating circumstances."
3. "Rather, [ignorance] is a reason why they are not excluded from mercy. It shows why persons so guilty are not beyond its pale. This is, we think, the true key both to the passage, and that in Luke 23:34. The ignorance is not a reason why God should bestow mercy on such persons, rather than on others left to perish, but a reason why they obtain mercy at all, who, by their blasphemies had been supposed to have reached the sin against the Holy Spirit."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Paul was uJbristhv when he persecuted the church."
2. "He was uJbrisqeiv shamefully entreated at philippi (1 Thessalonians 2:2)."
3. "In speaking of his conversion, Paul uses cariv grace."

### John Calvin:
1. "Not satisfied with having called himself a 'persecutor,' he intended to express more fully his rage and cruelty by an additional term, an oppressor."
2. "He appears to insinuate that there is no room for pardon unless when ignorance can be pleaded in excuse."
3. "The sin against the Holy Spirit...is open rebellion against God in the transgression of the first table; secondly, it is a malicious rejection of the truth."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "A blasphemer . . . Probably in both senses of the word, as implying (1) violent and railing speech against men, (2) actual blasphemy against the Name which be now recognised as above every name."
2. "Adding wanton outrage to the inevitable severity of persecution, the ‘haling’ men and women, punishing them, probably by scourging, in the synagogues."
3. "From one point of view St. Paul looked upon his past state as one in which he had been as ‘the chief of sinners.’ Yet, on the other hand, his eyes had not been opened, he had not sinned wilfully against a light clearly seen, and so the sin was one of ignorance leading to unbelief; and thus mercy, though he could not claim it as deserved, was still possible."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Formerly, as in Galatians 4:13." 
2. "Concessive participle agreeing with με." 
3. "Old word either from βλαξ (stupid) and φημη, speech, or from βλαπτω, to injure."

3. "God had mercy on him when he was in the career of his sin, and stopped him; and of his abundant mercy begat him again to a lively hope of forgiveness and eternal life."

### John Wesley:
1. "But I obtained mercy - He does not say, because I was unconditionally elected; but because I did it in ignorance."
2. "Not that his ignorance took away his sin; but it left him capable of mercy."
3. "which he would hardly have been, had he acted thus contrary to his own conviction."
