### John Calvin:
1. "He shews that it was profitable to the Church that he had been such a person as he actually was before he was called to the apostleship, because Christ, by giving him as a pledge, invited all sinners to the sure hope of obtaining pardon."
2. "Let this preface be to our ears like the sound of a trumpet to proclaim the praises of the grace of Christ, in order that we may believe it with a stronger faith."
3. "Accordingly, the more any one is oppressed by his sins, let him the more courageously betake himself to Christ, relying on this doctrine, that he came to bring salvation not to the righteous, but to 'sinners'."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Faithful is the saying." - This phrase indicates that certain truths had become widely known and accepted within the early Christian community, possibly originating from prophets or teachers in the Church. St. Paul cites them as already known to Timothy.

2. "Came into the world to save sinners." - St. Paul uses this phrase, which later became characteristic of St. John's Gospel, to emphasize the belief in the mystery of the Incarnation and the purpose of Jesus' coming: to save all who are categorized as sinners.

3. "Of whom I am chief." - St. Paul's declaration that he is the chief of sinners emphasizes his personal recognition of his own sinfulness and need for God's mercy. This echoes the cry of the publican in the parable and reflects the universal cry of the conscience when confronted with the reality of one's own sinfulness.

1. "Faithful is the saying (πιστος ο λογος)."
2. "This very phrase (Christ coming into the world) occurs in John 9:37; John 11:27; John 16:28; John 18:37."
3. "It is not mock humility here, but sincere appreciation of the sins of his life (cf. Romans 7:24) as a persecutor of the church of God (Galatians 1:13), of men and even women (Acts 22:4; Acts 26:11)."

### John Gill:
1. "It is a true saying, and not to be disputed or doubted of, but to be believed most firmly; it is certain that God the Father sent his Son into the world for this purpose; and Christ himself assures us, that he came for this end; his carriage to sinners, and his actions, testified the same; his works and miracles confirm it; and the numberless instances of sinners saved by him evince the truth of it."

2. "It is the Christian Cabala, or the evangelical tradition, delivered by the Father to Christ, by him to his apostles, and by them to the saints, by whom it is cordially received. The apostle seems to allude to the Cabala of the Jews, their oral law, which they say was delivered to Moses on Mount Sinai, and by him to Joshua; and by Joshua to the elders; and by the elders to the prophets; and so from one to another to his times: but here he suggests, that if they would have a Cabala, here is one, that is firm, and true, and certain, and worthy to be received, whereas the Jewish one was precarious, yea, false and untrue."

3. "Christ came into the world, being sent by his Father, but not against his will, but with his free consent: he came voluntarily in the fulness of time into this sinful world, where he was ill treated; and this was not by local motion, or change of place, but by assumption of nature; and the end of it was, that he might be the Saviour of lost sinners, as all men are, both by Adam's sin, and their own transgressions; though he came not to save all, for then all would be saved, whereas they are not; and if he came to save them, he must have then so far lost his end; but he came to save sinners, of all sorts, even notorious sinners, the worst and chief of sinners."

### John Wesley:
1. "This is a faithful saying — A most solemn preface." 
2. "And worthy of all acceptation — Well deserving to be accepted, received, embraced, with all the faculties of our whole soul." 
3. "That Christ — Promised. Jesus — Exhibited. Came into the world to save sinners — All sinners, without exception."
