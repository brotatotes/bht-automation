## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The doxology is to the Father, not to the Trinity (Thdrt.), nor to the Son (Calov., al.): cf. ἀοράτῳ), incorruptible, invisible, the only God." 
2. "Comparing these with the well-known εἰς τοὺς αἰῶνας τῶν αἰώνων, εἰς τοὺς αἰῶνας, and the like, it is far more likely that οἱ αἰῶνες here should mean eternity, than the ages of this world, as many have understood it."
3. "Beware of taking ἀφθάρτῳ, ἀοράτῳ with θεῷ, as recommended by Bishop Middleton, on the ground of the articles being wanting before these adjectives. It is obvious that no such consideration is of any weight in a passage like the present."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "It is from the experimental sense of grace that the doxology flows."
2. "The 'life everlasting' suggested here 'the King eternal,' or everlasting."
3. "The thought of eternity (terrible as it is to unbelievers) is delightful to those assured of grace."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It is just an instance of the joy and gratitude which fill the soul of a Christian when he is led along in a train of reflections which conduct him to the recollections of his former sin and danger, and to the fact that he has obtained mercy and has now the hope of heaven."
2. "The meaning of this expression - 'the King of ages' - is, that he is a king who rules throughout all ages. This does not mean that he himself lives for ever, but that his dominion extends over all ages or generations."
3. "The gods of the pagan are 'vanity and a lie,' and they are wholly destitute of wisdom."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "King eternal [βασιλει των αιωνων] . Lit. the king of the ages." 
2. "In Paul, applied to God only, Romans 1:23. Invisible [αορτω] . Applied to God, Colossians 1:15; Hebrews 11:27." 
3. "Honor and glory [τιμη και δοξα] . This combination in doxology only here and Revelation 5:12, Revelation 5:13."

### John Calvin:
1. "And is there anything more astonishing than Paul’s conversion?"
2. "The Apostle calls him the King eternal, not liable to any change; Invisible, because he dwells in light that is inaccessible; and, lastly, the Only Wise, because he renders foolish, and condemns as vanity, all the wisdom of men."
3. "He means that the infinite and incomprehensible wisdom of God should be beheld by us with such reverence that, if his works surpass our senses, still we may be restrained by admiration."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The thought of God's great mercy leads the apostle to break out into a jubilant doxology."
2. "The phrase 'the king of the ages' refers to all the periods which man's thought can apprehend in the remotest past or future."
3. "The word 'only,' as applied to God, is not uncommon in the New Testament, but is especially characteristic of this Epistle and St. John."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "This noble doxology is a burst of gratitude for God's grace to Paul."
2. "For God's creative activity (King of the ages) see 1 Corinthians 10:11; Ephesians 2:7; Ephesians 3:9; Ephesians 3:11."
3. "The only God (μονω θεω). So Romans 16:27; John 5:44; John 17:3."

### John Gill:
1. "He is the everlasting King, or the King of ages, or of worlds; he is Maker of the worlds, and the Governor of them throughout all ages and generations; he only has immortality, and is the incorruptible God, and who is invisible, whose shape has never been seen, nor his voice heard."
2. "Christ is the living God, and the living Redeemer and though he died as man, he will die no more, but ever lives to make intercession for his people, and to reign over them, and protect them."
3. "Christ is crowned with honour and glory, and he is worthy of it; and it becomes all men to honour the Son, as they do the Father: he is the brightness of his glory, and equal to him; and the glory of deity, of all the divine perfections, and works, and also worship, should be given him; as well as the glory of salvation, and of all the grace the sons of men partake of; and that not only now, but to all eternity."
