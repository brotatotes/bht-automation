# 1 Timothy 1:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, we see the importance of holding on to faith and maintaining a good conscience. Faith is compared to a precious liquor, while a good conscience is described as a clean glass. However, there are those who willingly reject and thrust away their faith, choosing to retain their sins instead. Without faith and a good conscience, there is a risk of shipwrecking one's belief.
