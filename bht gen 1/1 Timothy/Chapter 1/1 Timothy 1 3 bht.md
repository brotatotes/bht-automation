## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "As I exhorted thee, &c., but in his negligence of writing, the Apostle does not finish the construction: neither 1 Timothy 1:5, nor 12, nor 18, will form the apodosis without unnatural forcing."
2. "The sense of προσμεῖναι, to tarry, or stay at a place, is sufficiently clear from ref. Acts."
3. "The meanings of ‘other teaching’ and ‘false teaching,’ when we remember that the faith which St. Paul preached was incapable (Gal 1:8-9) of any the least compromise with the errors subsequently described, lie very close to one another."

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "The office of superintending overseer, needed for a time at Ephesus or Crete, in the absence of the presiding apostle, subsequently became a permanent institution on the removal, by death, of the apostles who heretofore superintended the churches."
2. "He meant to have added, 'so I still beseech thee,' but does not complete the sentence until he does so virtually, not formally."
3. "The terms of the former were not that he should never visit Ephesus again (which this verse implies he did), but that they all should 'see his face no more.'"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It is clear from this, that Paul and Timothy had been laboring together at Ephesus, and the language accords with the supposition that Paul had been compelled to leave before he had completed what he had designed to do there."
2. "The word charge here - παραγγειλης parangeilēs - seems to mean more than is commonly implied by the word as used by us. It seems rather to refer to that continuous instruction which would convince these various errorists and lead them to inculcate only the true doctrine."
3. "That they teach no other doctrine - That is, no other doctrine than that taught by the apostles. We may learn here what was the design for which Timothy was left at Ephesus."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "To abide [προσμειναι] . To continue on. The compound does not occur in Paul, but is found in Acts 11:23; Acts 13:43; Acts 18:18."
2. "The expression is contemptuous. It is assumed that Timothy knows who they are. This is after the Pauline manner."
3. "The charge is not to teach anything contrary to the sound teaching (verse 10) or irreconcilable with it."

Note: The commentary provided is quite technical and may not be easily understood without further context.

### John Calvin:
1. "In the injunction given to Timothy, to occupy his place at Ephesus, we ought to observe the holy anxiety of the Apostle; for while he labored so much to collect many churches he did not leave the former churches destitute of a pastor."
2. "The word forbid denotes power; for Paul wishes to arm him with power to restrain others."
3. "Whoever departs from that, disfigures and corrupts the doctrine itself; and, therefore, 'to teach differently,' must relate to the form."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "On the assumption of the conclusion there arrived at, it would be at the close of St. Paul’s last visit to Ephesus, after his first imprisonment at Rome."
2. "The first part of the word implies (as in 2 Corinthians 6:14) ‘unequally yoked,’ something discordant and out of harmony."
3. "The undefined way in which St. Paul usually speaks of his Judaizing opponents and others whom he condemns."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "To tarry (προσμεινα). First aorist active infinitive of προσμενω, old verb, attributed by Luke to Paul in Acts 13:43."
2. "That thou mightest charge (ινα παραγγειληις). Subfinal clause with ινα and the first aorist active subjunctive of παραγγελλω, old verb, to transmit a message along (παρα) from one to another."
3. "Certain men (τισιν). Dative case. Expressly vague (no names as in 1 Timothy 1:20), though Paul doubtless has certain persons in Ephesus in mind."

### John Gill:
1. "than what had been preached by the apostle at Ephesus, and the saints there had received; than what was agreeably to the Scriptures of truth, and was according to godliness"
2. "nor would he have them teach in another way, in new words, but hold fast the form of sound words; for new words often produce new doctrines"
3. "the apostle perhaps by other doctrine chiefly respects the doctrine of justification by the works of the law"
