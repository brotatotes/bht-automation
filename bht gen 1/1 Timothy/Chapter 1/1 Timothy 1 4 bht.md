## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Jewish fables" (Colossians 2:18-23). "Profane, and old wives' fables" (1 Timothy 4:7; 2 Timothy 4:4).
2. The Judaizers here alluded to, while maintaining the perpetual obligation of the Mosaic law, joined with it a theosophic ascetic tendency, pretending to see in it mysteries deeper than others could see.
3. Paul opposes to their "aeons," the "King of the aeons (so the Greek, 1 Timothy 1:17), whom be glory throughout the aeons of aeons."
4. "Questions and strifes of words" (1 Timothy 6:4): "to no profit" (1 Timothy 6:4); "gendering strifes" (1 Timothy 6:4). "Vain jangling" (1 Timothy 1:6; 1 Timothy 1:7) of would-be "teachers of the law."
5. The oldest manuscripts read, "the dispensation of God," the Gospel dispensation of God towards man (1 Timothy 1:7), "which is (has its element) in faith."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The 'fables' here referred to were probably the idle and puerile superstitions and conceits of the Jewish rabbis."
2. "One of the most successful arts of the adversary of souls has been to mingle fable with truth."
3. "No point of controversy is worth much trouble, which, if it were settled one way or the other, would not tend to convert the soul from sin, or to establish some important principle in promoting true religion."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Give heed...to give assent to." 
2. "Fables...a saying, a story, true or false." 
3. "Endless genealogies...without object, useless."

### John Calvin:
1. "Let them not give heed to fables of that character and description to which genealogies belong."
2. "For every thing that does not edify ought to be rejected, although it has no other fault; and everything that is of no avail but for raising contentions, ought to be doubly condemned."
3. "All doctrines must be tried by this rule, that those which contribute to edification may be approved, and that those which give ground for unprofitable disputes may be rejected as unworthy of the Church of God."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The 'fables' are called 'Jewish'...legends that had been engrafted on the history of the Old Testament." 
2. "Whether the 'genealogies' were pedigrees...or lists such as those of the later Gnostics...we cannot now decide." 
3. "From St. Paul's point of view, these studies, whatever they were, were altogether profitless. They were 'interminable.'"

1. "To give heed (προσεχειν). With νουν understood. Old and common idiom in N.T. especially in Luke and Acts (Acts 8:10). Not in Paul's earlier Epistles." 

2. "To fables (μυθοις). Dative case of old word for speech, narrative, story, fiction, falsehood. In N.T. only 2 Peter 1:16; 1 Timothy 1:4; 1 Timothy 4:7; Titus 1:14; 2 Timothy 4:4." 

3. "A dispensation (οικονομιαν). Pauline word (1 Corinthians 9:17; Colossians 1:25; Ephesians 1:9; Ephesians 3:9; 1 Timothy 1:4), Luke 16:2-4 only other N.T. examples."

1. "Neither give heed to fables...or Jewish fables...anything that was not true; or if it was, yet idle, vain, trifling, and unprofitable." 
2. "These genealogies often produced questions and debates, causing disputes among the Jews." 
3. "The endless pursuit of genealogies and disputes about them are useless and unedifying, rather than promoting godly edifying in faith."
