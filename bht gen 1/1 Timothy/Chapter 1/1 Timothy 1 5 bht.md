# 1 Timothy 1:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Bible verse under consideration emphasizes the central importance of love. This love extends both to God and to one another. It is not a mere outward expression, but a love that stems from a pure heart, a good conscience, and an unfeigned faith. Love is the essence and fulfillment of the law, connecting faith, conscience, and genuine belief in the proper way. It is a love that originates from a heart purified from selfishness and self-serving attitudes, allowing for the manifestation of true love in actions and deeds towards others.
