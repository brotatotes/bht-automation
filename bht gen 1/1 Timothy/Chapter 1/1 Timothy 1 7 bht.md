# 1 Timothy 1:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, we find a warning against certain individuals who desire to be teachers of the law but lack a true understanding of it. These pretentious teachers twist the law with fables and immoral interpretations, corrupting its true meaning. They speak confidently but without understanding, their words lacking true knowledge and insight. Despite their claims to expertise, they fail to grasp the depth and true nature of the law they attempt to teach. Instead, their empty words only serve to deceive and mislead others.

2. "Their error was not in maintaining the obligation of the law, but in abusing it by fabulous and immoral interpretations of, and additions to, it."
