## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "For sanctification, the law gives no inward power to fulfill it; but as the justified man often does not give himself up wholly to the inward leading of the Spirit, he morally needs the outward law to show him his sin and God's requirements."
2. "The reason why the ten commandments have no power to condemn the Christian is not that they have no authority over him, but because Christ has fulfilled them as our surety."
3. "The opposers of God, from the law comes; those inwardly impure, and those deserving exclusion from the outward participation in services of the sanctuary; sinners against the third and fourth commandments; sinners against the fifth commandment; sinners against the sixth commandment."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The purpose of the law was not to fetter and perplex those who were righteous, and who aimed to do their duty and to please God. It was not intended to produce a spirit of servitude and bondage. The main purpose of the law was to restrain the wicked from sin."
2. "No good man feels himself lettered and manacled by wholesome laws, nor does he feel that the purpose of law is to reduce him to a state of servitude. It is only the wicked who have this feeling - and in this sense the law is made for a man who intends to do wrong."
3. "There is no sin which man will not commit if unrestrained, and there is in fact no conceivable form of crime of which he has not been guilty."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Is not laid down, set, appointed."
2. "Morally upright. Not in the Pauline sense of justified by faith."
3. "Recognizing no law; a sense which accords better with the following context than not having a law."

### John Calvin:
1. "A remarkable and striking instance of this is found in those who maintain the righteousness of works and defend free-will. They have continually in their mouth these words, 'Perfect holiness, merits, satisfactions;' but their whole life cries out against them, that they are outrageously wicked and ungodly, that they provoke in every possible way the wrath of God, and fearlessly set his judgment at naught."
2. "He takes for granted the well-known sentiment, that 'from bad manners have sprung good laws,' and maintains that the law of God was given in order to restrain the licentiousness of wicked men; because they who are good of their own accord do not need the authoritative injunction of the law."
3. "He therefore wished to repress the impudence of adversaries, who armed themselves with the name of 'the law' against godly men, whose whole life exhibits the actual role of the law, since they had very great need of the law, and yet did not care much about it."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The law would not be needed but for the lawless element in men which needs correction."
2. "The next four words...speak of evil in its relation to God, of sins against the First Table."
3. "In the strong words chosen to indicate the sins of deepest dye in each case, we may probably trace a righteous indignation at the sins of the Heathen world."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The use of κειτα for τεθειτα (perfect passive of τιθημ) is a common enough idiom." 
2. "Dative (like all these words) of the late verbal (α privative and υποτασσω)."
3. "Old word from βαινω, to go, and βηλος, threshold."

### John Gill:
1. "No man is naturally righteous since Adam, excepting the man Christ Jesus."
2. "Those only are righteous men, who are made so through the imputation of Christ's righteousness to them."
3. "The law does not lie upon a righteous man, or against him. It does not lie as a weight or burden on him; its precept does not lie on him, as a task to be performed; nor does its penalty, the curse, lie on him as a punishment to be bore by him."

### John Wesley:
1. "The law doth not lie against a righteous man." 
2. "Against the lawless and disobedient — They who despise the authority of the lawgiver violate the first commandment, which is the foundation of the law, and the ground of all obedience."
3. "Against the ungodly and sinners — Who break the second commandment, worshipping idols, or not worshipping the true God."
