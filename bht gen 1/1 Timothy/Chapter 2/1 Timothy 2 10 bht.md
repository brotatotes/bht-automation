# 1 Timothy 2:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Women who profess godliness are advised to adorn themselves not only with good works but also with a chaste and becoming appearance. The mention of "godliness" emphasizes the comprehensive nature of their commitment to religion, both inwardly and in their actions. Outward adornments are given less importance compared to the beauty derived from living a virtuous and godly life. Good works function as the genuine adornment that enhances one's person, profession of faith, and the Gospel message itself.

1. "But (which becometh women professing god likeness),.... By which is meant not any particular grace, was it, the fear of God might be designed, and so the Syriac version renders it; nor the whole of internal religion only; nor the form of godliness, or the whole scheme of Gospel truth, which is according to godliness; nor only outward holiness of life and conversation; but the whole of all this, all religion, internal and external, the whole of godliness, both in a doctrinal and in a practical way."

2. "All this, these women the apostle gives directions unto, had made a profession of, and had been baptized upon it, and received members of churches; and as yet held their profession: and such persons, it best became them not so much to adorn themselves with any outward adornings, as with good works; such as are mentioned in 1 Thessalonians 5:10."

3. "Good works are like good clothes, to which the apostle alludes; they do not make persons men and women, but they adorn them as such; so good works, they do not make men and women Christians, or believers, but they adorn them as such; they are ornaments to their persons, and to their profession, and to the Gospel they profess. See Titus 2:10."
