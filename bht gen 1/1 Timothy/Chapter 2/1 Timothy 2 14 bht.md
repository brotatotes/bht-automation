# 1 Timothy 2:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, we see the contrast between Adam and Eve's responses to temptation. While Eve was deceived by the serpent and persuaded Adam to partake in the forbidden fruit, Adam was not deceived but willingly chose to follow Eve's lead. This highlights the different roles and responsibilities bestowed upon the man and woman, with Eve's deception leading to her transgression. The verse also sheds light on the power of deception and the consequences that follow when one falls into its trap.

1. "Adam never was deceived at all; neither by the serpent, with whom he never conversed; nor by his wife, he knew what he did, when he took the fruit of her, and ate; he ate it not under any deception, or vain imagination, that they should not die, but should be as gods, knowing good and evil."
2. "And this is elsewhere said of her, 2 Corinthians 11:3 which never is of Adam. She really thought the serpent spoke truth, that she and her husband should not die, if they ate of the fruit; but that it was good to make them wise; and that, upon eating it, they should be as gods, knowing good and evil."
3. "Now inasmuch as the serpent did not attack Adam, he being the stronger and more knowing person, and less capable of being managed and seduced; but made his attempt on Eve, in which he succeeded; and since not Adam, but Eve, was deceived, it appears that the man is the more proper person to bear rule and authority."
