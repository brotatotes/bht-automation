# 1 Timothy 2:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, women are assured of their salvation despite the challenges they face due to childbirth. They are not condemned or abandoned, but rather offered hope and comfort. Through the birth of Christ and their faithful obedience to their God-given roles, women can experience redemption and be part of God's plan for salvation. It is emphasized that salvation is not limited to women alone, but is available to all who believe and continue to live in faith, love, and holiness.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "She shall be saved through her child-bearing...not only exemption from that curse in its worst and heaviest effects: not merely that she shall safely bear children: but the Apostle uses the word σωθήσεται purposely for its higher meaning." 
2. "Just as that man should be saved through, as passing through, fire which is his trial, his hindrance in his way, in spite of which he escapes, so she shall be saved, through, as passing through, her child-bearing, which is her trial, her curse, her hindrance in the way of it."
3. "If they have remained in faith and love and holiness with self-restraint."

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "In spite of the trial of childbearing which she passes through, she shall be saved."
2. "The very curse will be turned into a condition favorable to her salvation, by her faithfully performing her part in doing and suffering what God has assigned to her."
3. "This may be an ulterior reference of the Holy Spirit in this verse; but the primary reference required by the context is the one above given."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "By the remark in this verse, however, Paul shows that it was not his intention to overwhelm her with anguish. He did not design to harrow up her feelings by an unkind allusion to a melancholy fact in her history."
2. "She was not to be regarded as degraded and abandoned. She was not to be overwhelmed by the recollection of what 'the mother of all living' had done."
3. "The apostle designed to comfort woman, or to alleviate the sadness of the picture which he had drawn respecting her condition. The way of salvation was open to her as well as to men, and was to be entered in the same manner."

### Marvin Vincent:
1) "Saved is used in the ordinary N. T. sense."
2) "She shall be saved is set over against hath fallen into transgression."
3) "The subject of swqhsetai shall be saved is the same as that of ejn parabasei gegonen hath fallen into transgression."
4) "The promise does not exempt them from the cultivation of Christian virtues and the discharge of Christian duties."

### John Calvin:
1. "For these reasons he modifies what he had said by adding a consolation; for the Spirit of God does not accuse or reproach us, in order to triumph over us, when we are covered with shame, but, when we have been cast down, immediately raises us up." 
2. "Paul, in order to comfort them and render their condition tolerable, informs them that they continue to enjoy the hope of salvation, though they suffer a temporal punishment."
3. "When a woman, considering to what she has been called, submits to the condition which God has assigned to her, and does not refuse to endure the pains, or rather the fearful anguish, of parturition, or anxiety about her offspring, or anything else that belongs to her duty, God values this obedience more highly than if, in some other manner, she made a great display of heroic virtues, while she refused to obey the calling of God."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "She shall be saved by the childbirth," i.e. by the seed of the woman, the incarnate Christ. It is scarcely credible that St. Paul, if he meant this, would have expressed it so obscurely.
2. We may, I believe, see in this a kind of bold Luther-like way of stating that home life rather than public life, the functions of a mother rather than of a teacher, are appointed for her.
3. The other graces, excellent as they are, require, each and all, to be coupled with the self-reverence, as contrasted with self-assertion, on which St. Paul is insisting.

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "This translation makes it refer to the birth of the Saviour as glorifying womanhood."
2. "Paul does not have mostly in mind that child-bearing, not public teaching, is the peculiar function of woman with a glory and dignity all its own."
3. "She will be saved in this function, not by means of it."

### John Gill:
1. "Not Eve, though no doubt she is saved; since she had a sense of her sin, and shame for it, a revelation of the Messiah to her, and faith in him."
2. "But rather any woman, particularly such as profess godliness, who shall be saved in childbearing."
3. "The meaning of the words is, that there is salvation through the incarnate Messiah, for all sorts of persons; for all men and women who believe in him, with that faith which works by love, and shows itself in holiness and sobriety; provided that they continue herein."

### John Wesley:
1. "Women in general, who were all involved with Eve in the sentence pronounced, Genesis 3:16."
2. "Carried safe through the pain and danger which that sentence entails upon them for the transgression."
3. "Finally saved, if they continue in loving faith and holy wisdom."
