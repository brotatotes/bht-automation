# 1 Timothy 2:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Bible verse encourages Christians to pray for kings and those in authority, recognizing the importance of their character, plans, and the impact they have on society. Praying for them brings peace and order to the state. The prayers aim for the hearts of leaders to be inclined towards righteousness, protecting the freedom of religion and promoting moral behavior. This promotes a tranquil and quiet life, where godliness and honesty are upheld, resulting in a dignified and reverent society.

1. "For kings, and for all that are in authority... these are particularly mentioned, the then governors, whether supreme or subordinate, who were avowed enemies, and violent persecutors of the saints; and it might be a scruple with some of them, whether they should pray for them, and therefore the apostle enjoins it."
2. "which does not merely design the end of civil government by kings and magistrates, which is to preserve the peace and quiet of the commonwealth; to protect the persons and properties of men, that they may possess their own undisturbed; and to secure to them their civil and religious rights and liberties, that they may have the free use and exercise of religion, signified by 'all godliness'; and to encourage morality and virtue, expressed by 'honesty'; and so is an argument for prayer, taken from the advantage of civil government."
3. "that since the hearts of kings are in the hands of the Lord, and he can turn them as he pleases, prayer should be made to him for them, that he would either convert them, and bring them to the knowledge of the truth, they now persecuted; or at least so dispose their hearts and minds, that they might stop the persecution, and so saints might live peaceably under them, enjoy their religious liberty, and be encouraged in their moral conversation."
