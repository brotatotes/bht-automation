### Albert Barnes:
1. "The word 'will' cannot be taken here in the absolute sense, denoting a decree like that by which he willed the creation of the world, for then it would certainly be done."
2. "God wills that all people should be saved. It would be in accordance with his benevolent nature. He has made ample provision for it. He uses all proper means to secure their salvation."
3. "This verse proves: (1) That salvation is provided for all - for if God wished all people to be saved, he would undoubtedly make provision for their salvation; (2) That salvation should be offered to all people - for if God desires it, it is right for his ministers to announce that desire; (3) That people are to blame if they are not saved."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Prayer to God for all is acceptable to him, because he wills the salvation of all."
2. "Epignwsiv is a favorite Pauline word. It signifies advanced or full knowledge."
3. "The logical relation in the writer's mind between salvation and the knowledge of the truth is not quite clear. Knowledge of the truth may be regarded as the means of salvation, or it may be the ideal goal of the whole saving work."

### John Calvin:
1. "What is more reasonable than that all our prayers should be in conformity with this decree of God?"
2. "The calling is a proof of the secret election, so they whom God makes partakers of his gospel are admitted by him to possess salvation."

1. "No assertion of the universal love of God can be more clear than this."
2. "Men were tempted to draw a line of demarcation in their prayers, and could hardly bring themselves to pray for a Nero or a Tigellinus."
3. "The nature of the 'salvation' is expressed in the words that stand as in opposition with it. It is found in the 'knowledge' mil and deep, more than the mere gnosis of the understanding, of the truth which is eternal."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "God's wish and will in so far as he can influence men." 
2. "First aorist passive infinitive of σωζω with accusative of general reference." 
3. "Paul is anxious as in Colossians and Ephesians that the Gnostics may not lead the people astray."

### John Gill:
1. "The salvation which God wills that all men should enjoy, is not a mere possibility of salvation, or a mere putting them into a salvable state; or an offer of salvation to them; or a proposal of sufficient means of it to all in his word; but a real, certain, and actual salvation, which he has determined they shall have."
2. "The will of God, that all men should be saved, is not a conditional will, or what depends on the will of man, or on anything to be performed by him, for then none might be saved; and if any should, it would be of him that willeth, contrary to the express words of Scripture; but it is an absolute and unconditional will respecting their salvation, and which infallibly secures it."
3. "Moreover, the same persons God would have saved, he would have also come to the knowledge of the truth: of Christ, who is the truth, and to faith in him, and of all the truth of the Gospel, as it is in Jesus; not merely to a notional knowledge of it, which persons may arrive unto, and not be saved, but a spiritual and experimental knowledge of it."

### John Wesley:
1. "Who willeth seriously all men - Not a part only, much less the smallest part." 
2. "To be saved - Eternally."
3. "And, in order thereto, to come - They are not compelled."
4. "To the knowledge of the truth - Which brings salvation."
