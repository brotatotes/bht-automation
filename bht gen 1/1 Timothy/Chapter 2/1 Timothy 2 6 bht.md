### John Gill:
1. "What the Mediator gave as a ransom for men is 'himself', his body and his soul, which were both made an offering for sin; and his life, which is the result of union between soul and body; his whole human nature as in union with his divine person, and so might be truly said to be himself." 

2. "This he gave into the hands of men, of justice and of death; and that voluntarily, which shows his great love to his people; and also as a 'ransom', or a ransom price for them, in their room and stead; to ransom them from the slavery of sin, and damnation by it, from the captivity of Satan, and the bondage of the law, and from the grave, death, hell, ruin, and destruction."

3. "But the meaning is, either that he gave himself a ransom for many, as in Matthew 20:28 for the Hebrew word כל, to which this answers, signifies sometimes many, a multitude, and sometimes only a part of a multitude, as Kimchi observes; or rather it intends that Christ gave himself a ransom for all sorts of men, for men of every rank and quality, of every state and condition, of every age and sex, and for all sorts of sinners, and for some out of every kindred, tongue, people, and nation, for both Jews and Gentiles."

### John Wesley:
1. "Who gave himself a ransom for all" - This highlights the sacrificial nature of Jesus' act, where he offered himself as a payment to redeem all of humanity.
2. "Such a ransom, the word signifies, wherein a like or equal is given" - This emphasizes that Jesus' sacrifice was not just any ransom, but one that required an equal exchange, demonstrating the magnitude of his selflessness.
3. "To be testified of in due season" - This suggests that the testimony of Jesus' redemptive act was not only planned by God, but also revealed at the perfect time according to His divine wisdom.
