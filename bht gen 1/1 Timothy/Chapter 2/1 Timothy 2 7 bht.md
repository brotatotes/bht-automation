## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "I am ordained—literally, 'I was set': the same Greek, as 'putting me,' c." 
2. "He recurs to himself, as in Titus 1:3- :, in himself a living pattern or announcement of the Gospel, so here 'a herald and teacher of (it to) the Gentiles'." 
3. "The universality of his commission is an appropriate assertion here, where he is arguing to prove that prayers are to be made 'for all men'."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "I am placed or constituted" - The word "ordain" has now acquired a technical signification, meaning to set apart solemnly to a sacred office by the imposition of hands; but it has not that meaning here.
2. "I speak the truth in Christ, and lie not" - Paul makes a solemn declaration similar to this in regard to his call to the apostleship, in Galatians 1:20.
3. "A teacher of the Gentiles" - Specially appointed to carry the gospel to the Gentiles or the pagan.

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "A preacher [κηρυξ] . Lit. a herald. See on 2 Peter 2:5. Paul does not use the noun, but the kindred verb khrussein to proclaim or preach is very common in his writings." 

2. "I speak the truth in Christ and lie not. Omit in Christ. A strange asseveration to an intimate and trusted friend. Apparently an imitation of Romans 9:1." 

3. "In faith and verity [εν πιστει και αληθεια] . Or faith and truth. The combination only here. Paul has sincerity and truth (1 Corinthians 5:8), and sanctification of the Spirit and faith of the truth (2 Thessalonians 2:13). The phrase must not be explained in true faith, nor faithfully and truly. It means that faith and truth are the element or sphere in which the apostolic function is discharged."

### John Calvin:
1. "He affirms that God had appointed him for this purpose, that he might bring the Gentiles, who had formerly been alienated from the kingdom of God, to have a share in the gospel." 
2. "His apostleship was a sure foundation of the divine calling." 
3. "He preaches the gospel to the Gentiles, not only with pure affection, but also with an upright and fearless conscience; because he does nothing but by the command of God."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "It might have been thought that in writing to one like Timothy, loving and beloved, there would have been little need for this vindication of his authority, as if he were asserting his claims against the Judaizing teachers of Galatia or Corinth."
2. "The strong asseveration ('I speak truth, I lie not,' as in Romans 9:1) and the emphatic pronoun are perhaps intended to emphasize the marvel that such an one as he had been had been called to that high office."
3. "Looking, however, to the objective sense of 'truth' in 1 Timothy 2:4, it would seem better to take the word in its higher sense here as defining the region in which he was a teacher, that region being the faith in man, answering to the truth revealed in Christ."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "The testimony of Jesus in his self-surrender." - This quote highlights the significance of Jesus' testimony and self-surrender in relation to the verse.
2. "First aorist passive indicative of τιθημ." - This quote provides a grammatical explanation of the verb tense used in the verse, giving insight into the author's intention.
3. "A Pauline touch." - This phrase suggests that the statement "I speak the truth, I lie not" is characteristic of Paul's writing style, indicating its importance in conveying his message.

### John Gill:
1. "He was ordained or appointed to be a preacher of the Gospel from all eternity, and was separated or set apart unto it in time, and was put into the ministry of it by Christ himself." 
2. "I speak the truth in Christ, and lie not; which are a sort of an oath, or an appeal to Christ the omniscient God, for the truth of what he said, concerning his ordination to the Gospel."
3. "His work and ministry lay among them, and therefore he is called the apostle of the Gentiles: and so he was in faith and verity; which may regard the subject matter of his teachings and ministry; it was the faith and truth of the Gospel, even the whole of it, the faith which was once delivered to the saints, and the truth as it is in Jesus."
