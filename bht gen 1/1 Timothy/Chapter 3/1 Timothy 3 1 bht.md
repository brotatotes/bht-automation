## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Faithful is the saying...if any man seeks the overseership, he desires a good work."
2. "It behoves then an overseer to be blameless, husband of one wife."
3. "Apt in teaching."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Faithful is the saying." A needful preface to what follows: for the office of a bishop or overseer in Paul's day, attended as it was with hardship and often persecution, would not seem to the world generally a desirable and "good work."
2. desire—literally, "stretch one's self forward to grasp"; "aim at": a distinct Greek verb from that for "desireth." What one does voluntarily is more esteemed than what he does when asked (1 Corinthians 16:15). This is utterly distinct from ambitious desires after office in the Church.
3. good work—literally, "honorable work." Not the honor associated with it, but the work, is the prominent thought. He who aims at the office must remember the high qualifications needed for the due discharge of its functions.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The idea here is, that it was worthy of credence; it was not to be doubted."
2. "The Lord, undoubtedly, by his Spirit, often excites an earnest and irrepressible desire to preach the gospel - a desire so strong, that he in whom it exists can be satisfied in no other calling."
3. "No one who 'desires' the office of the ministry should conclude that he is called to it, unless these qualifications substantially are found in him."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Faithful is the saying." - This phrase emphasizes the reliability and truthfulness of the statement being made.
2. "Desireth...implies not only desiring but seeking after." - The word "desireth" conveys a sense of eagerness and active pursuit, indicating a genuine longing for the role of a bishop.
3. "The term 'episkopos'...came about in a natural way." - The adoption of the term "episkopos" as a designation for a superintendent or overseer in the church was a natural progression, influenced by the association of authority with age and the use of similar titles in clubs and guilds.

### John Calvin:
1. "Let these words, therefore, be received as a preface intended to point out the importance of the subject."
2. "The Apostle affirms that this is no inconsiderable work, such as any man might venture to undertake."
3. "It is no light matter to be a representative of the Son of God, in discharging an office of such magnitude, the object of which is to erect and extend the kingdom of God, to procure the salvation of souls which the Lord himself hath purchased with his own blood, and to govern the Church, which is God’s inheritance."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The office of a bishop, or overseer, was not likely, at the time when St. Paul wrote, to be an object of worldly ambition." 
2. "Men were likely to draw back from the burden of responsibility, and to accept it only by constraint." 
3. "Hence the stimulus of a new motive was needed, and was found in the half-proverbial maxim which named the office, with all its labour and risk, as a goodly and noble work for a man to aim at."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Faithful is the saying (πιστος ο λογος). Here the phrase points to the preceding words (not like 1 Timothy 1:15) and should close the preceding paragraph."
2. "If a man seeketh (ε τις ορεγετα). Condition of first class, assumed as true. Present middle indicative of ορεγω, old verb to reach out after something, governing the genitive."
3. "The office of a bishop (επισκοπης). Genitive case after ορεγετα. Late and rare word outside of LXX and N.T. (in a Lycaonian inscription). From επισκοπεω and means 'over-seership' as in Acts 1:20."

### John Gill:
1. "This is a doctrine that is true, and to be believed, that there is salvation through the birth of a Son, or through the incarnate Son of God, for men and women that believe in him, and continue in the faith of him, and love to him, joined with works of righteousness and holiness."

2. "The apostle, having denied to women the work and office of teaching, proceeds to observe, that though this belonged to men, yet not to every man; and therefore he gives the qualifications of such; which might serve as a direction to churches, in the choice of them; as well as be a means of stirring up persons in such an office, to a proper regard to themselves and their work."

3. "The office of a bishop, elder, or pastor of a church, 'is a work', and a very laborious one; wherefore such are called labourers in the word and doctrine: it is not a mere title of honour, and a place of profit, but it is a business of labour and care; yet a good one, a famous and excellent one."

### John Wesley:
1. "He desireth a good work" - This phrase suggests that the work being referred to is not just any work, but a noble and virtuous one. It implies that God has a desire for believers to engage in meaningful and impactful endeavors.
