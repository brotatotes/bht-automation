3. "This verse best suits the theory that this First Epistle was not written after Paul's visit and departure from Ephesus when he had resolved to winter at Corinth after passing the summer in Macedonia, but after his first imprisonment at Rome; probably at Corinth, where he might have some thoughts of going on to Epirus before returning to Ephesus."
