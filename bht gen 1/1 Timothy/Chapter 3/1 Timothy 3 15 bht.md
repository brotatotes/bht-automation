## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "The fact that the sphere of thy functions is 'the congregation of the living God' is the strongest motive to faithfulness in this behavior as president of a department of the house." 
2. "The Church is 'the pillar of the truth,' as the continued existence (historically) of the truth rests on it; for it supports and preserves the word of truth." 
3. "The Church is to be the stay of the truth and its conserver for the world, and God's instrument for securing its continuance on earth, in opposition to those heresies."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "That thou mayest know how thou oughtest to behave thyself - That is, that he might have just views about settling the affairs of the church."
2. "The church is called the 'house of God,' because it is that in which he dwells."
3. "The truth is, in fact, upheld in the world by the church. The people of the world feel no interest in defending it, and it is to the church of Christ that it is owing that it is preserved and transmitted from age to age."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The reference is not to Timothy's conduct as the A. V. impliest but rather to the instructions which he is to give to church members." 
2. "House of God [οικω θεου] . An O. T. phrase, used of the temple. More frequently, house of the Lord [κυριου] ; see 1 Kings 3:1; 1 Kings 6:1; 1 Chronicles 22:2, 1 Chronicles 22:11; 1 Chronicles 29:2, etc. Applied to the church only here."
3. "The idea is that the church is the pillar, and, as such, the prop or support of the truth."

### John Calvin:
1. "If any person has the superintendence of a large house, he labors night and day with earnest solicitude, that nothing may go wrong through his neglect, or ignorance, or carelessness. If only for men this is done, how much more should it be done for God?"
2. "The reason why the Church is called the 'pillar of truth' is, that she defends and spreads it by her agency. God does not himself come down from heaven to us, nor does he daily send angels to make known his truth; but he employs pastors, whom he has appointed for that purpose."
3. "For, if the Church 'is the pillar of truth,' it follows that the Church is not with them [Papists], when the truth not only lies buried, but is shockingly torn, and thrown down, and trampled under foot."

### Philip Schaff:
1) "The title, at first applied locally, as in Genesis 28:17; Genesis 28:19, and continuing so applied throughout the whole period of the Old Testament, received a new significance in the teaching of our Lord."
2) "St. Paul is never weary of dwelling on the thought from every point of view."
3) "The words admit grammatically of three possible constructions... Of these (1) may be rejected as having but little authority, involving an awkward anti-climax, and leaving the sentence from which the words are thus detached to close abruptly."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "But if I tarry long" - Condition of third class with εαν and the present active subjunctive of βραδυνω, old verb, to be slow (usually intransitive), from βραδυς (slow, dull, Luke 24:25), in N.T. only here and 2 Peter 3:9.
2. "That thou mayest know" - Final clause with ινα and second perfect active subjunctive of οιδα, to know.
3. "The pillar and ground of the truth" - Paul changes the metaphor again as he often does. Those words are in apposition to εκκλησια and οικος. On στυλος, old word for pillar, see Galatians 2:9; Revelation 3:12 (only other N.T. examples). Hεδραιωμα, late and rare word (from εδραιοω, to make stable) occurs here first and only in ecclesiastical writers later. Probably it means stay or support rather than foundation or ground. See Colossians 1:23; 2 Timothy 2:19 for similar idea. See also Matthew 16:18.

### John Gill:
1. "These things are written, that thou mayest know how thou oughtest to behave thyself in the house of God." 
2. "It is called the house of God, because as an edifice, it is of his building and repairing, and in which he dwells; and as a family, is what he provides for." 
3. "The church of the living God; in opposition to, and distinction from the houses and temples of idols, which are inanimate and senseless creatures; whereas the true God is the living God."

### John Wesley:
1. "That thou mayest know how to behave" - The purpose of the epistle is to provide guidance on proper conduct.
2. "In the house of God" - Referring to the church, emphasizing God's authority as the master of the family.
3. "By the house of God, I mean the church" - Clarifying that the house of God refers to the church, highlighting its significance in the context of the verse.
