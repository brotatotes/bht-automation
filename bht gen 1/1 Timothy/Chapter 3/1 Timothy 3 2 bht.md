# 1 Timothy 3:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
A bishop, or an overseer, must have a blameless reputation, free from any scandal or wrongdoing in the eyes of others. They should have only one spouse at a time, adhering to a literal interpretation of marital faithfulness. In addition, a bishop should be vigilant and wise, displaying both passion and prudence in their actions and decisions. This role requires a combination of moral integrity, commitment to monogamy, and a balanced and discerning approach to leadership.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Episcopacy was adopted in apostolic times as the most expedient form of government, being most nearly in accordance with Jewish institutions, and so offering the less obstruction through Jewish prejudices to the progress of Christianity."
2. "The feeling which prevailed among the Gentiles, as well as the Jews, against a second marriage would, on the ground of expediency and conciliation in matters indifferent and not involving compromise of principle, account for Paul's prohibition here in the case of one in so prominent a sphere as a bishop or a deacon."
3. "The new man bears somewhat of a sacred festival character, incompatible with all confusion, disorder, excess, violence, laxity, assumption, harshness, and meanness."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Must be blameless - ... he should be a man against whom no charge of immorality, or of holding false doctrine, is alleged. His conduct should be irreprehensible or irreproachable."
2. "The husband of one wife - ... the most obvious meaning of the language, and it would doubtless be thus understood by those to whom it was addressed. At a time when polygamy was not uncommon, to say that a man should 'have but one wife' would be naturally understood as prohibiting polygamy."
3. "A minister of the gospel should be a finished gentleman in his manners, and there is no excuse for him if he is not. His religion, if he has any, is adapted to make him such. He has usually received such an education as ought to make him such, and in all cases 'ought' to have had such a training."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Blameless: one who cannot be laid hold of, who gives no ground for accusation."
2. "The motive for marriage, namely, protection against incontinency, which is adduced by Paul in 1 Corinthians 7:2, 1 Corinthians 7:9, is given in 1 Timothy 5:11-14."
3. "In the Pastorals we see a reflection of the conditions of the earlier post-apostolic age, when a non-Pauline asceticism was showing itself."

### John Calvin:
1. "He wishes a bishop to be blameless, instead of which, in the Epistle to Titus, He has used the word ἀνέγκλητον, meaning by both words, that he must not be marked by any infamy that would lessen his authority." (quote 49)
2. "The only true exposition, therefore, is that of Chrysostom, that in a bishop he expressly condemns polygamy, which at that time the Jews almost reckoned to be lawful." (quote 50)
3. "They who have the charge of governing the people, ought to be qualified for teaching...he rather commends wisdom in applying the word of God judiciously to the advantage of the people." (quote 55)

### Philip Schaff:
1. "A bishop must be blameless, giving no handle to reproach, unassailable."
2. "The bishop is not to have more than one wife at a time, and that the permission of polygamy by Jewish teachers and among the Greeks made this restriction necessary."
3. "The most prominent fact in the social life both of Jews and Greeks at this period was the frequency of divorce. The apostle, taking up the law which Christ had laid down, infers that any breach of that law would at least so far diminish a man’s claim to respect as to disqualify him for office."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "The word [bishop] does not in the N.T. have the monarchical sense found in Ignatius of a bishop over elders." 
2. "Without reproach, irreproachable. In N.T. only here, 1 Timothy 5:7; 1 Timothy 6:14."
3. "Of one wife, one at a time, clearly."
4. "Temperate, sober-minded, seemly, decent conduct."
5. "Given to hospitality, from φιλος and ξενος, in N.T. only here, Titus 1:8; 1 Peter 4:9."

### John Gill:
1. "A bishop then must be blameless...not that it can be expected that such an one should be entirely free from sin, or be blameless in the sight of God; but that he should be one, who is so before men, and has not been guilty of any notorious and flagitious crime."
2. "The husband of one wife; which is not to be understood in a mystical and allegorical sense of his being the pastor of one church...but in a literal sense of his conjugal estate; though this rule does not make it necessary that he should have a wife; or that he should not marry, or not have married a second wife, after the death of the first; only if he marries or is married, that he should have but one wife at a time."
3. "An elder or pastor must also be one that is vigilant; or wakeful and watchful, who is diligent in his business, and attends to his care and charge; is watchful over himself, his words, and actions; and watches for the souls of men, to do them all the good he can; and is sober in body, is temperate, and uses moderation in eating and drinking; and in mind, is modest, humble, and prudent."

### John Wesley:
1. "A bishop...must be blameless - without fault or just suspicion."
2. "The husband of one wife - ministers, of all others, ought to stand clear of...polygamy and divorce."
3. "Vigilant, prudent - lively and zealous, yet calm and wise."
