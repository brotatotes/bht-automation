## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Not a brawler (properly, ‘one in his cups,’ ‘a man rendered petulant by much wine)." 
2. "Not a striker (this word also may have a literal and narrower, or a metaphorical and wider sense)." 
3. "Forbearing (reasonable and gentle)."

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Not given to wine—The Greek includes besides this, not indulging in the brawling, violent conduct towards others, which proceeds from being given to wine."
2. "No striker—with either hand or tongue: not as some teachers pretending a holy zeal."
3. "Not covetous—Greek, 'not a lover of money,' whether he have much or little."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The way in which the apostle mentions the subject here would lead us fairly to suppose that he did not mean to commend its use in any sense; that he regarded its use as dangerous, and that he would wish the ministers of religion to avoid it altogether."
2. "No man is under any 'obligation' of courtesy or Christian duty to use it; thousands of ministers of the gospel have brought ruin on themselves, and disgrace on the ministry, by its use."
3. "There is an instinctive feeling in the human bosom that such a man ought to be actuated by a nobler and a purer principle. As avarice, moreover, is the great sin of the world - the sin that sways more hearts, and does more to hinder the progress of the gospel, than all others combined - it is important in the highest degree that the minister of religion should be an example of what men 'should' be."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Better, quarrelsome over wine." - This quote highlights the commentary's interpretation of the phrase "given to wine" as being quarrelsome or argumentative when under the influence of alcohol.
2. "Some soften down the meaning into a pugnacious or combative person." - This quote emphasizes that the term "striker" can be understood as someone who is physically aggressive or prone to violence.
3. "Better, forbearing." - This quote suggests that the word "patient" should be translated as "forbearing," indicating a sense of tolerance and patience in dealing with others.

### John Calvin:
1. "By the word πάροινον, which is here used, the Greeks denote not merely drunkenness, but any intemperance in guzzling wine." 
2. "The true interpretation is that which is given by Chrysostom, that men of a drunken and fierce disposition ought to be excluded from the office of a bishop." 
3. "Mild — which, we have said, is contrasted with being 'addicted to wine' — is the term applied to him who knows how to bear injuries with a gentle and moderate disposition, who forgives much, who passes by insults."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The words imply that in the haste of the early organization of the Church, mistakes had been made which invested even such characters as those described with the office of a bishop or elder."
2. "No striker. This condition seems from our modern point of view a strange one, but the history of not a few of the Councils of the Church shows that even in a more advanced stage of Christian culture, it was not altogether needless."
3. "Patient. Better 'forbearing.' The reasonable temper which does not insist even on actual rights, and still less on satisfaction for real or supposed injuries."

2. "Not one who is nimble and ready at it, who no sooner is abused or injured, but he lifts up his hands and strikes."
3. "Not covetous of getting money, of amassing wealth and riches together; or desirous of popular applause and glory from men."
