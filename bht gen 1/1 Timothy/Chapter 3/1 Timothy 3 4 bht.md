3. "The fact that he has children who are in subjection to him in all gravity, is the recommendation in his favor as one likely to rule well the Church."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "A minister of the gospel would be, and ought to be, a married man... a qualification to govern a family well, would be an evidence of a qualification to preside properly in the church."

3. "He speaks chiefly of children, who may be expected to possess the natural disposition of their father; and therefore it will be a great disgrace to a bishop if he has children who lead a wicked and scandalous life."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "One that ruleth well his own house." - This qualification suggests that the experience of managing and leading a household is essential for effective pastoral leadership. It implies that the ability to govern and care for one's family is a reflection of one's ability to shepherd and guide a congregation.
