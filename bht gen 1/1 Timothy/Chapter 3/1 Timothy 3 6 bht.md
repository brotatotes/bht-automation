2. "The verb means primarily to make a smoke: hence, metaphorically, to blind with pride or conceit."
3. "The phrase judgment of the devil probably means the accusing judgment of the devil, and not the judgment passed upon the devil."

### John Calvin:
1. "Paul forbids that such persons shall be admitted to the office of a bishop, as soon as they have made profession of Christianity."
2. "Consequently, it is not without reason that they are excluded from the honor of a bishopric, till, in process of time their proud temper shall be subdued."
3. "There is an elegant contrast, which heightens the enormity of the case, 'If he who is placed over the Church of God fall, by his pride, into the same condemnation with the devil.'"

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Not a novice. Not referring to general inexperience, but specially to the state of one newly planted in the Church by conversion, and yet more definitely by baptism."
2. "The neophyte suddenly raised to power is excited as by the fever of authority, and, as we say, ‘loses his head.’"
3. "Accepting (2), therefore, the words imply a reference to the Rabbinic view of the history of Satan, how, created in perfect excellence, his first act was to admire himself, and so, fevered with ambition, to aspire after equality with God, and thus to bring upon himself the sentence of condemnation."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Not a novice (μη νεοφυτον). Our 'neophyte.' Vernacular word from Aristophanes on, in LXX, and in papyri in the original sense of 'newly-planted' (νεοσ, φυω). Only here in N.T." 
2. "Being puffed up (τυφωθεις). First aorist passive participle of τυφοω, old word (from τυφος, smoke, pride), to raise a smoke or mist (a smoke-screen of pride). In N.T. only here; 1 Timothy 6:4; 2 Timothy 3:4."
3. "The condemnation of the devil (κριμα του διαβολου). See Romans 3:8 for κριμα. Best to take του διαβολου as objective genitive, though subjective in verse 1 Timothy 3:7, 'the condemnation passed on or received by the devil' (not just 'the slanderer,' any slanderer)."

### John Gill:
1. "Not a novice,.... Or one newly planted, the Arabic version adds, 'in the faith'; meaning not a young man, for so was Timothy himself; but a young professor and church member; one that is lately come to the knowledge of the truth, and has just embraced and professed it, and become a member of a church, a new plant there."
2. "The reason why such a person should not be a bishop, elder, or pastor of a church, is, lest being lifted up with pride; through the dignity of the office he is advanced to, and the high opinion of men he stands in, and the great gifts qualifying him for such a place, he is supposed to have."
3. "For it seems from hence, that pride was the first sin of the devil, and the cause of his apostasy from God; being elated with his own knowledge, strength, and dignity; and not being able to bear it, that the human nature should be advanced above that of angels."

### John Wesley:
1. "Lest being puffed up...He fall into the condemnation of the devil." - This quote highlights the warning against pride and arrogance that comes with receiving honor or applause. It reminds us of the danger of falling into the same condemnation as the devil, who was brought down by his own pride.

2. "With this new honour, or with the applause which frequently follows it." - This quote emphasizes that the danger lies not only in the honor itself but also in the applause and recognition that often accompany it. It serves as a reminder that external validation can easily lead to pride if not handled with humility.

3. "The same into which the devil fell." - This quote draws a parallel between the potential downfall of those who are puffed up with honor and the condemnation that befell the devil. It underscores the seriousness of the warning and the need to guard against the same pride that led to the devil's downfall.
