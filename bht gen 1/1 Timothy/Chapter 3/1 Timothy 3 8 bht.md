# 1 Timothy 3:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The deacons in the church are appointed to serve and fulfill specific responsibilities. They should be men who inspire respect and can be relied on for the truth. This office in the church is not to be taken lightly, as it requires seriousness and a grave demeanor. They should also avoid the temptation of seeking wealth and gain through their position, as their duty is to serve with pure motives and devotion to God.

2. "The appointment of the seven grew out of a special emergency, and was made for a particular service; and the resemblance is not close between the duties and qualifications of deacons in the Pastorals and those of the seven."
3. "Double-tongued [διλογους]. Saying one thing and meaning another, and making different representations to different people about the same thing."

### John Calvin:
1. "It is certain that the Apostle speaks of those who hold a public office in the Church; and this refutes the opinion of those who think that domestic servants are here meant."
2. "It is manifest from other passages, that the term bishop belongs alike to all presbyters."

1. "The absence of that order, as contrasted with the recognition of the three grades in the Ignatian Epistles, is, so far as it goes, evidence of the early date of the Pastoral Epistles."
