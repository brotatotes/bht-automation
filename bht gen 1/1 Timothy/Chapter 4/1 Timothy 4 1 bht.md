# 1 Timothy 4:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the latter times, a burst of prophecy throughout the churches foretells a time of trial, persecution, heresy, and iniquity. Predicting a falling away from the true faith, the apostle warns of teachings inspired by deceiving spirits, leading many astray. This apostasy arises as a result of giving heed to doctrines that pervert and profane the spiritual worship of God, linking godliness with mere external rituals. But amidst the dangers, the Holy Spirit speaks expressly, providing clear guidance and discernment for those who remain faithful.

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The apostasy was to be within the Church, the faithful one becoming the harlot."
2. "The prophecy is connected with Gnostic errors, the seeds of which had already been sown in the Church."
3. "Seducing spirits working in the heretical teachers, opposed to the Spirit which speaketh in the true prophets against them."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It was not by mere hints, and symbols, and shadowy images of the future; it was in an open and plain manner - in so many words."
2. "The meaning is, that they would 'apostatize' from the belief of the truths of the gospel."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "In the latter times [εν υστεροις καιροις] . The phrase only here. For kairov particular sesson or junture, see on Matthew 12:1; Acts 1:7. Not the same as ejn ejscataiv in the last days, 2 Timothy 3:1, which denotes the peliod closing the present aeon, and immediately preceding the parousia; while this signifies merely a time that is future to the writer."
2. "Shall depart from the faith [αποστησονται της πιστεως] . The phrase only here. The verb in Paul only 2 Corinthians 12:8. Quite frequent in Luke and Acts. The kindred noun tasia (Acts 21:21; 2 Thessalonians 2:3) is almost literally transcribed in our apostasy."
3. "Teachings of demons [διδασκαλιαις δαιμονιων] . Better, teachings of demons. Comp. James 3:15. Didaskalia teaching often in Pastorals. A few times in Paul. See on 1 Timothy 1:10. Daimonion demon only here in Pastorals. Very frequent in Luke : in Paul only 1 Corinthians 10:20, 1 Corinthians 10:21. Teachings proceeding from or inspired by demons."

### John Calvin:
1. "Men being by nature inclined to hypocrisy, Satan easily persuades them that God is worshipped aright by ceremonies and outward discipline; and, indeed, without a teacher, almost all have this conviction deeply rooted in their hearts."
2. "He does not speak, in general terms, about false prophets, but plainly describes the kind of false doctrine; namely, that which, by linking godliness with outward elements, perverts and profanes, as I have already said, the spiritual worship of God."
3. "The controversy is not about flesh or fish, or about a black or ashy color, or about Friday or Wednesday, but about the mad superstitions of men, who wish to appease God by such trifles, and, by contriving a carnal worship of him, contrive for themselves an idol instead of God."

### Philip Schaff:

3. "Seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils." - The apostle recognizes a preternatural element in the workings of evil in the Church, with diverse teachings that lead astray.

### John Wesley:
