# 1 Timothy 4:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse described here speaks of believers who endure labor, reproach, and suffering due to their unwavering hope in God. With dedicated effort and perseverance, they strive against sin, Satan, and false teachings. Although God is the Savior of all humanity in a providential sense, believers experience His saving power in a deeper way. They trust in Him, facing worldly opposition, while acknowledging His role as the preserver of all and the one who offers eternal salvation.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The reason why 'we both labor and suffer reproach is because we have rested, and do rest our hope, on the living God." 
2. "Their 'labor and reproach' are not inconsistent with their having from the living God, their Saviour, even in this life."
3. "He is the Saviour of all men potentially; of believers alone effectually."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "We labor and suffer reproach, for we have hope in God. Through him we look for salvation. We believe that he has made this known to people, and believing this, we labor earnestly to make it known, even though it be attended with reproaches."

2. "There is something pertaining to 'them' in regard to salvation which does not pertain to 'all men.' It cannot mean that he brings all people to heaven, 'especially' those who believe - for this would be nonsense."

3. "When, therefore, it is said that he 'is the Saviour of 'all' people, 'especially' of those who believe,' it must mean that there is a sense in which it is true that he may be called the Saviour of all people, while, at the same time, it is 'actually' true that those only are saved who believe."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "To this end; or with a view to this."
2. "Both words denote strenuous and painful effort."
3. "We have set our hope on."

### John Calvin:
1. "The sum is, that believers are not miserable in afflictions, because a good conscience supports them, and a blessed and joyful end awaits them."
2. "Our afflictions are accompanied by hope in the living God, and, what is more, hope may be regarded as the foundation; but it never maketh ashamed."
3. "If there is no man who does not feel the goodness of God towards him, and who is not a partaker of it, how much more shall it be experienced by the godly, who hope in him? Will he not take peculiar care in them? Will he not more freely pour out his bounty on them? In a word, will he not, in every respect, keep them safe to the end?"

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Labour and suffer reproach. The Christian too often had nothing for it but reviling and reproach... The patient endurance of the Christian was a practical proof that the religion which he professed had for him the twofold promise of which the previous verse had spoken."
2. "We trust. Here... the force of the Greek... 'have hoped,' or 'fixed our hope.' And this hope is not in a dogma or an abstraction, but in a living God, who is the 'Saviour,' in the lower sense of the word as 'preserver,' no less than in the higher, thus including the 'life that now is,' as well as 'that which is to come.'"
3. "As in 1 Timothy 2:4, the purpose of God for a salvation which shall include all is assumed as an unquestionable truth, but those only who believe taste that salvation in the fulness of its power."

### Archibald T Robertson:

### John Gill:
1. "Not in the word and doctrine, though they did; nor in the exercise of internal godliness, though there is a work in faith, and a labour in love; nor with their own hands, at their trades and business, to support themselves, and others; but by enduring hardships and afflictions..."
2. "The Alexandrian copy, and another manuscript, read, 'we strive'; or contend even to an agony, combating with sin, Satan, and the world, with profane men, and with false teachers..."
3. "Who is the Saviour of all men; in a providential way, giving them being and breath, upholding them in their beings, preserving their lives, and indulging them with the blessings and mercies of life..."

1. "We both labour and suffer reproach — We regard neither pleasure, ease, nor honour."
2. "Because we trust — For this very thing the world will hate us."
3. "Who is the Saviour of all men — Preserving them in this life, and willing to save them eternally."
