## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Till I come...attend to the (public) reading" - The Apostle Paul instructs Timothy to continue the public reading of Scripture in the Ephesian church until his return. This emphasizes the importance of regularly engaging with the sacred texts as a community.

2. "This is certainly the meaning" - The commentator affirms that the primary purpose of the reading is for the congregation to receive exhortation and instruction. It is not simply a private practice, but a communal activity that promotes growth and understanding.

3. "Whether the O. T. Scriptures alone...cannot be determined with any certainty" - The commentator acknowledges that it is unclear whether only the Old Testament Scriptures or also the earlier gospels were included in the public reading at that time. This highlights the historical context and the potential diversity of texts being read in the early church.

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The practice of reading Scripture was transferred from the Jewish synagogue to the Christian Church."
2. "The New Testament Gospel and Epistles being recognized as inspired by those who had the gift of discerning spirits, were from the first, according as they were written, read along with the Old Testament in the Church."
3. "Scripture reading in private should be 'the fountain of all wisdom from which pastors ought to draw whatever they bring before their flock'."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Give attendance to reading - The word here used may refer either to public or to private reading... The more obvious interpretation here is to refer it to private reading, or to a careful perusal of those books which would qualify him for his public work."
2. "The then written portions of the sacred volume - the Old Testament - are doubtless specially intended here, but there is no reason to doubt that there were included also such other books as would be useful, to which Timothy might have access."
3. "The apostle himself, on more than one occasion, showed that he had some acquaintance with the classic writings of Greece."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The verb ajnaginwskein usually of public reading." 
2. "In post-classical Greek, sometimes of reading aloud with comments."
3. "Dr. Hatch says: 'It is probable that this practice of reading with comments... may account for the coordination of 'reading' with 'exhortation' and 'teaching' in 1 Timothy 4:13.'"

### John Calvin:
1. "How shall pastors teach others if they be not eager to learn?"
2. "Woe then to the slothfulness of those who do not peruse the oracles of the Holy Spirit by day and night."
3. "The Scripture is the fountain of all wisdom, from which pastors must draw all that they place before their flock."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The words seem to imply that Timothy’s work at Ephesus was thought of as temporary and provisional."
2. "One work of the special mission of the young disciple was to read in the Ecclesia the Scriptures of the Old Testament; apostolic records of our Lord’s ministry; apostolic Epistles."
3. "The two words are contrasted as in 1 Timothy 6:2, the former being more practical, ethical, individual; the latter more systematic and intellectual."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Give heed (προσεχε). Present active imperative, supply τον νουν, 'keep on putting thy mind on.'"
2. "The reading (τη αναγνωσε). Old word from αναγινωσκω. See 2 Corinthians 3:14. Probably in particular the public reading of the Scriptures (Acts 13:15), though surely private reading is not to be excluded."
3. "To exhortation (τη παρακλησε), to teaching (τη διδασκαλια). Two other public functions of the minister. Probably Paul does not mean for the exhortation to precede the instruction, but the reverse in actual public work. Exhortation needs teaching to rest it upon, a hint for preachers today."

### John Gill:
1. "Give attendance to reading; that is, of the Scriptures, which the Jews call 'reading'. And this is to be understood, not of the reading of the Scriptures in public, for the advantage of others, but in private, for his own use and service, that he might be more perfect, and more thoroughly furnished to the work and office to which he was called."
2. "Exhortation intends the stirring up of believers to the exercise of grace, and the discharge of duty; and is a considerable part of the work of the ministry, and on which a minister of Christ should much insist."
3. "Doctrine designs the teaching and instructing of the church in the mysteries of the Gospel; opening and explaining the truths of it; defending them against all opposers, and refuting errors and heresies contrary to them."

### John Wesley:
1. "Give thyself to reading" - This emphasizes the importance of dedicating oneself to the act of reading, both publicly and privately. It encourages individuals to actively engage with written material, recognizing it as a valuable means of acquiring knowledge and understanding.

2. "Both publicly and privately" - This highlights the need for a balanced approach to reading. It suggests that reading should not be limited to personal study alone, but also includes engaging with written material in a public setting, such as attending lectures or participating in discussions.

3. "Expect no end without the means" - This phrase serves as a reminder that in order to achieve a desired outcome or goal, one must put in the necessary effort and take the appropriate actions. It implies that reading is a means to an end, and by investing time and effort in reading, one can expect to see positive results and growth.
