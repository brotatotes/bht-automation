# 1 Timothy 4:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the commentators emphasize the goodness of all things created by God, particularly in relation to food. They argue against the idea of certain things being inherently impure or forbidden, instead highlighting that the key factor is the thankfulness and faith of the person receiving it. The verse counters Gnostic teachings and calls for an appreciation of God's provisions, with a reminder that purity comes from the right spiritual state rather than the physical characteristics of what is consumed. It encourages gratitude for the blessings of God and rejects notions of restriction or rejection based on external factors.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "A refutation by anticipation of the Gnostic opposition to creation: the seeds of which were now lurking latently in the Church."
2. "The old Gnostic heresy is now almost extinct; but its remains in the celibacy of Rome's priesthood, and in its fasts from animal meats, enjoined under the penalty of mortal sin, remain."
3. "Meats, though pure in themselves, become impure by being received with an unthankful mind."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It does not mean that every moral agent remains good as long as he is 'a creature of God,' but moral agents, human beings and angels, were good as they were made at first."
2. "Nor should it be inferred that what God has made is necessarily good 'after' it has been perverted by man. As God made it originally, it might have been used without injury."
3. "The sense is, that as God made it, and for the purposes for which he designed it, it is not to be held to be evil; or, which is the same thing, it is not to be prohibited as if there were merit in abstaining from it."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Creature [κτισμα] . Not in Paul. A created thing." 
2. "Refused [αποβλητον] . Lit. thrown away. In ecclesiastical writings, excommunicated." 
3. "On the whole verse, comp. Acts 10:15; Romans 11:15; 1 Corinthians 10:25, 1 Corinthians 10:26, 1 Corinthians 10:30, 1 Corinthians 10:31."

### John Calvin:
1. "The use of food must be judged, partly from its substance, and partly from the person of him who eats it."
2. "So far as relates to food, he asserts that it is pure, because God has created it; and that the use of it is consecrated to us by faith and prayer."
3. "Paul means, that those things which come from the hand of God, and are intended for our use, are not unclean or polluted before God, but that we may freely eat them with regard to conscience."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The higher word (καλόν, excellent, not ἀγαθόν) is used in the Greek, as in the LXX. of Genesis 1:0, and with a manifest reference to that history." 
2. "The repetition of the clause ('with thanksgiving') is striking, as showing how the apostle’s mind recognised that it was the spiritual state of the receiver, not the physical characteristics of the thing received, that determined the lawfulness of the reception." 
3. "The emphasis is on the attitude of thankfulness and the recognition that all good things come from God."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Creature (κτισμα). Late word from κτιζω, result of creating." 
2. "To be rejected (αποβλητον). Old verbal adjective in passive sense from αποβαλλω, to throw away, here only in N.T." 
3. "If it be received (λαμβανομενον). 'Being received.' Present passive participle of λαμβανω, in conditional sense, 'with thanksgiving.'"

### John Gill:
1. "For every creature of God is good,.... For food; and should be taken and used for that purpose, at all times, without distinction." 
2. "Nothing to be refused; or rejected as common and unclean, or to be abstained from at certain times." 
3. "If it be received with thanksgiving: if not, persons are very ungrateful, and very unworthy of such favours."
