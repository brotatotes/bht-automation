## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Contrasted with 'the younger men.' As Timothy was admonished so to conduct himself as to give no man reason to despise his youth (1 Timothy 4:12); so here he is told to bear in mind his youth, and to behave with the modesty which becomes a young man in relation to his elders."
2. "Rebuke not sharply: a different word from 'rebuke' in 1 Timothy 4:12- :."
3. "As brethren—and therefore equals; not lording it over them (1 Timothy 4:12- :)."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "By the direction not to rebuke, it is not to be supposed that the minister of the gospel is not to admonish the aged, or that he is not to show them their sins when they go astray, but that he is to do this as he would to a father."
2. "The precepts of religion always respect the proprieties of life, and never allow us to transgress them, even when the object is to reclaim a soul from error, and to save one who is wandering."
3. "The apostle would have Timothy, and, for the same reason, every other minister of the gospel, a model of this virtue."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The testimony of Clement of Rome goes to show that the Bishops are distinguished from the Presbyters, and that if the Bishops are apparently designated as Presbyters, it is because they have been chosen from the body of Presbyters, and have retained the name even when they have ceased to hold office."
2. "Presbyters signify a class or estate - members of long standing and approved character, and not office-bearers regularly appointed. Among these, the Bishops are to be sought."
3. "Presbyters as such are not invested with office. There is no formal act constituting a Presbyter. The Bishops are reckoned among the Elders, but the elders as such are not officers."

### John Calvin:
1. "Correction is a medicine, which has always some bitterness, and consequently is disagreeable."
2. "It is impossible not to be moved with reverence, when we place before our eyes our father or our mother; in consequence of which, instead of harsher vehemence, we are immediately influenced by modesty."
3. "He only wishes that some respect should be paid to their age, that they may more patiently bear to be admonished."

These quotes emphasize the importance of gentleness and respect in correcting and admonishing others, especially elders. They highlight the need to approach correction with humility and reverence, recognizing the impact of age and experience.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The fourfold classification of which this is part is all but decisive in favour of the latter [referring to age only]."
2. "The train of thought seems to rise out of a slight fear lest the counsel, ‘Let no man despise thy youth,’ should lead Timothy to rush into the opposite extreme, and to forget the respect due to the more advanced years of those whom he was called to guide."
3. "As a man would point out, if necessary, the faults of his own father, with counsel that implied sympathy and respect, so was Timothy to deal with those older than himself whose faults he could not altogether ignore."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Respect for age is what is here commanded, an item appropriate to the present time."
2. "Wise words for the young minister to know how to conduct himself with old men (reverence) and young men (fellowship, but not stooping to folly with them)."
3. "Rebuke not an elder... Respect for age is what is here commanded."

### John Gill:
1. "An ancient man, a member of a church, is not to be rebuked in a sharp and severe way... reproof is a smiting, and there is a gentle and a sharp one." 
2. "Entreat him as a father... use him as a father in Christ, that has known him that is from the beginning, and as of long standing in the church."
3. "Young men... were to be considered as brethren in Christ, and reproved in a brotherly way, and with brotherly love."

### John Wesley:
1. "Rebuke not" - This phrase reminds us to exercise caution and gentleness when correcting others, especially those who are younger or less experienced. It encourages us to approach rebuke with humility and understanding, rather than harshness or superiority.

2. "Considering your own youth" - This reminds us to be mindful of our own shortcomings and limitations when offering correction. It encourages us to approach rebuke with empathy and self-awareness, recognizing that we too have made mistakes and have room for growth.

3. "With such severity as would otherwise be proper" - This phrase emphasizes the importance of tempering our rebuke with wisdom and discernment. It reminds us not to be excessively harsh or judgmental, but to use appropriate measures of correction that are fair and just.
