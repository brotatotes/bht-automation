# 1 Timothy 5:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
A virtuous woman is described as someone who is known for her honorable works, which include bringing up children with care and providing assistance to those in need. She displays the spirit of humility and love through her acts of hospitality, not only to strangers but also to fellow believers. Washing the feet of the saints, a symbol of humility and servanthood, is one of the ways she demonstrates her selflessness and deep respect for others. This act fosters unity and promotes a spirit of love and compassion within the community of believers.
