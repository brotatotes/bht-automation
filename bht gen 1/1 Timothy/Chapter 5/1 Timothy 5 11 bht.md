## BHT:
In this passage, the verse cautions against admitting younger widows into a particular group, as they may be tempted to remarry and deviate from their commitment to Christ. The commentators explain that these widows face the danger of becoming overly independent, neglecting their original faith, and leading an immoral and lustful life. By refusing to prioritize their devotion to Christ and seeking marriage without considering God's glory, these widows risk forsaking their deliberate promise and jeopardizing their spiritual journey. The verse underscores the importance of making wise choices, remaining faithful to Christ, and valuing spiritual commitment above personal desires.
