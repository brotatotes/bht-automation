# 1 Timothy 5:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we see a warning against the behavior of certain widows. These women are described as idle and prone to gossip, carrying tales and causing mischief within the church. They have a curiosity that leads them to engage in idle talk and spread rumors, causing harm to the community. The writer emphasizes the dangers of idleness and the need for these widows to redirect their energies towards more productive pursuits, reminding us that idle gossip can easily corrupt and disrupt the harmony of the church.
