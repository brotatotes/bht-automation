# 1 Timothy 5:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Believers, both men and women, are called to fulfill their duty of caring for widows within their own families and households. This includes providing financial assistance and support to those in need. By doing so, the church is relieved of the burden and is able to focus its resources on caring for widows who are truly destitute and have no other means of support. This passage emphasizes the value of personal responsibility and the priority of helping those who are most vulnerable and lacking in support.
