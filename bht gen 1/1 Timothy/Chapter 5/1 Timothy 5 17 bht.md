## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Preside, viz. over their portion of the Church’s work. Chrys. has well expressed the meaning, but not all the meaning; for wisdom and ability must be taken also into account."
2. "be held worthy of double (not, as compared with the widows, as Chr., the deacons, as Chr., the poor, as Flatt, &c. but as compared with those who have not distinguished themselves by καλῶς προεστάναι; and evidently, as Chrys. 3, it is not to be taken in the mere literal sense of double, but implies increase generally."
3. "especially those that labour in (the) word and teaching (therefore the preaching of the word, and teaching, was not the office of all the πρεσβύτεροι)."

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Preside well," with wisdom, ability, and loving faithfulness, over the flock assigned to them.
2. "Double" is used for large in general.
3. Specially they who labor in the word and doctrine, implying two kinds of ruling presbyters: those who labor in teaching and those who do not.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The word used - 'elder' or 'presbyter' - properly refers to age, and is then used to denote the officers of the church, probably because the aged were at first entrusted with the administration of the affairs of the church."

2. "The word rendered 'rule' - προεστῶτες proestōtes - is from a verb meaning to be over; to preside over; to have the care of. The word is used with reference to bishops, Titus 1:5, Titus 1:7; to an apostle, 1 Peter 5:1; and is such a word as would apply to any officers to whom the management and government of the church was entrusted."

3. "Especially they who labour in word and doctrine - In preaching and instructing the people. From this it is clear that, while there were 'elders' who labored 'in the word and doctrine,' that is, in preaching, there were also those who did not labor 'in the word and doctrine,' but who were nevertheless appointed to rule in the church."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Double honor... includes pecuniary remuneration for services, if it is not limited to that." 
2. "Double, not in a strictly literal sense, but as pleiona timhn more honor."
3. "The passage lends no support to the Reformed theory of two classes of Elders - ruling and teaching."

These quotes highlight the concept of "double honor" in the verse, explaining that it may involve financial compensation but is not limited to that.

### John Calvin:
1. "For preserving the good order of the Church, it is likewise highly necessary that elders should not be neglected, but that due regard should be paid to them; for what could be more unfeeling than to have no care about those who have the care of the whole Church?"
2. "Paul had formerly enjoined that honor should be paid to widows; but elders are more worthy of being honored than widows, and, with respect to them, ought therefore to receive double honor."
3. "Yet he prefers those who labor in word and doctrine, that is, those who are diligent in teaching the word; for those two terms, word and doctrine, signify the same thing, namely, the preaching of the word."

1. "The apostle is practical enough to recognise even the value of money - payment as a recognition of higher gifts well used."
2. "The rule implies that the ‘elders’ of the Church were not all equally gifted."
3. "Some laboured in the more conspicuous and exhausting work of public preaching (the ‘word’) and continuous class-teaching (‘doctrine’), and for this there was to be a provision, such as that which we often find made for the dean of a cathedral or the head of a college, to twice the amount of that given to the other elders."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "The elders that rule well...in same sense as επισκοπος...Cf. Luke's use of πρεσβυτερος = Paul's επισκοπους."
