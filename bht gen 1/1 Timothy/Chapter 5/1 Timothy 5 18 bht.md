### Marvin Vincent:
1. "To the Jews hJ grafh signified the O. T. canon of Scripture; but in most cases hJ grafh is used of a particular passage of Scripture which is indicated in the context." 
2. "The passage cited here is Deuteronomy 25:4, also by Paul, 1 Corinthians 9:9."
3. "A second scriptural quotation would seem to be indicated, but there is no corresponding passage in the O. T. The words are found Luke 10:7, and, with a slight variation, Matthew 10:10."

### John Calvin:
1. "This is a political precept which recommends to us equity and humanity in general; as we have said in expounding the First Epistle to the Corinthians; for, if he forbids us to be unkind to brute animals, how much greater humanity does he demand towards men!"

3. "He does not quote this as a passage of Scripture, but as a proverbial saying, which common sense teaches to all."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "St. Paul had already quoted (in 1 Corinthians 9:9) and reasoned on the verse from Deuteronomy 25:4, going below the letter to the principle on which it rested, and applying that principle as a law of action for men in their dealings with each other." 
2. "Did St. Paul cite them from either of these Gospels, and so recognise their claim as Scripture, side by side with the law of Moses?" 
3. "There seems a strong preponderance of evidence for thinking that the words are taken from some written account of our Lord’s work and teaching, and that that record was probably at least the groundwork of the Gospel according to St. Luke."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Thou shalt not muzzle (ου φιμωσεις). Prohibition by ου and future (volitive) indicative of φιμοω (from φιμος, muzzle), old word, quoted also in 1 Corinthians 9:9 as here from Deuteronomy 25:4, and for the same purpose, to show the preacher's right to pay for his work." 

2. "The labourer is worthy of his hire (αξιος ο εργατης του μισθου αυτου). These words occur in precisely this form in Luke 10:7. It appears also in Matthew 10:10 with της τροφης (food) instead of του μισθου."

3. "In 1 Corinthians 9:14 Paul has the sense of it and says: 'so also the Lord ordained,' clearly meaning that Jesus had so said. It only remains to tell whether Paul here is quoting an unwritten saying of Jesus as he did in Acts 20:35 or even the Gospel of Luke or Q (the Logia of Jesus)."

### John Gill:
1. "The ox, for its strength and labour, is a fit emblem of a Gospel minister; and its treading the corn out of the husk and ear aptly represents the beating out, as it were, of Gospel truths, by the ministers of it, their making the doctrines of the Gospel clear, plain, and evident to the understandings of men."
2. "Wherefore, as the ox was not muzzled when it trod out the corn, but might freely and largely feed upon it, so such who labour in the preaching of the Gospel ought to have a sufficient and competent maintenance."
3. "The labourer is worthy of his reward; which seems to be taken from Luke 10:7 which Gospel was now written, and in the hands of the apostle; who here, by two testimonies, the one from Moses, and the other from Christ, supports the right of the honourable maintenance of the ministers of the Gospel."

### John Wesley:
1. "This verse teaches us the importance of treating animals with compassion and respect, even in the context of agricultural practices. It reminds us that we have a responsibility to care for and provide for the needs of the creatures under our care."

2. "The commandment to not muzzle an ox while it is treading out the grain goes beyond just the practical aspect of allowing the animal to eat. It also highlights the principle of fairness and justice, ensuring that those who work are able to enjoy the fruits of their labor."

3. "By extension, this verse can also be seen as a reminder to treat all workers fairly and justly, ensuring that they are able to benefit from their labor. It challenges us to consider how we can create systems and structures that promote fairness and dignity for all."

4. "Ultimately, this verse calls us to a higher standard of stewardship and compassion, reminding us that our treatment of animals and fellow human beings reflects our values and our relationship with God."
