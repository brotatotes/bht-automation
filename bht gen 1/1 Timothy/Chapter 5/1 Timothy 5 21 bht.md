## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "the holy angels, who are the chosen attendants and ministers of God." 
2. "electos vocat angelos non tantum ut a reprobis discernat, sed excellentiæ causa, ut plus reverentiæ habeat eorum testimonium." 
3. "that thou keep these things without prejudice, doing nothing according to partiality."

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "I adjure thee"; so it ought to be translated. He vividly sets before Timothy the last judgment, in which God shall be revealed, and Christ seen face to face with His angels.
2. "Elect angels" - an epithet of reverence. Not only "elect" in contradistinction to the reprobate angels, but also to mark the excellence of the angels in general and give more solemnity to their testimony.
3. "Without preferring one before another" - there ought to be judgment, but not prejudging. There should be no partiality or bias in favor of a man.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Paul gives this charge as in the presence of God, of the Redeemer, and of the elect angels, and wishes to secure that sense of its solemnity which must arise from the presence of such holy witnesses."
2. "No one can prove that the angels, and that the departed spirits of holy men, are not witnesses of what we do. At all events, it is right to urge on others the performance of duty as if the eye of a departed father, mother, or sister were fixed upon us, and as if we were encompassed by all the holy beings of heaven."
3. "The fact only is stated; the reasons which led to the choice, alike in regard to angels and human beings, are unknown to us; compare notes on Matthew 11:25."
4. "Let there be entire impartiality in all cases. Justice was beautifully represented by the ancients as holding a pair of scales equally balanced."
5. "There should be no purpose to find one guilty and another innocent; no inclination of heart toward one which would lead us to resolve to find him innocent; and no aversion from another which would make us resolve to find him guilty."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "For this sense, adjure, see Luke 16:28; Acts 2:40; 2 Timothy 2:14."
2. "It may refer to all angels, as special objects of divine complacency."
3. "In the Pauline sense of keeping the law, Romans 2:26; Galatians 6:13."

### John Calvin:
1. "Let us remember that, in the person of Timothy, all pastors are admonished, and that Timothy is armed, as with a shield, against wicked desires, which not infrequently occasion much trouble even to some excellent persons."
2. "He therefore places God before the eyes of Timothy, that he may know that he ought to execute his office not less conscientiously than if he were in the presence of God and of his angels."
3. "They are present as spectators, because they have been commanded to take care of the Church. And, indeed, he must be worse than stupid, and must have a heart of stone, whose indolence and carelessness are not shaken off by this single consideration, that the government of the Church is under the eye of God and the angels."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The solemnity of the adjuration here, as in 2 Timothy 4:1, implies a latent fear that the youth, the asceticism, the sensitiveness of Timothy might lead him beyond the line of strictly judicial action, to prejudice against the accused, or partiality in his favour."
2. "The meaning of the adjective is not quite clear. In one sense all good angels were among God’s elect; but the word is probably used of those who were chosen specially for ministering to the righteous judgments of God, and who, therefore, are thought of as looking on, approving or condemning, as the conduct of the earthly judge is in accord, or at variance, with His."
3. "A mistranslation. Read, as above, ‘without prejudice’ in the sense of ‘without pre-judging.’"

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Elect" in the sense of the "holy" angels who kept their own principality and who did not sin.
2. Paul shows his interest in angels.
3. "Without prejudgment."
4. "By partiality."

### John Gill:
1. "I charge thee before God,.... Who sees and knows all things, and is a righteous and most impartial Judge; with whom there is no respect of persons, and in whose place and stead, the judges of the earth, both civil and ecclesiastical, stand; and to whom they are accountable for the judgment they pass on men and things; and in whose house or church Timothy was, whose business he was doing, and which ought to be done, with a view to his glory; wherefore the apostle gives him this solemn charge as in his sight."
2. "And the elect angels; by whom are meant not some of the angels, the more choice, excellent, and principal among them; but this is a spurious account, and not to be credited; nor was it an ancient tradition of the Jews, that there were seven principal angels... But here all the good angels are designed, called sometimes the holy angels, and sometimes the angels in heaven; and here, by the Syriac version, 'his angels'; either the angels of God, as they are sometimes styled; or the angels of Jesus Christ, being made by him, and being ministers to him, and for him; and also 'elect', because chosen to stand in that integrity and holiness, in which they were created; and to enjoy everlasting glory and happiness, while others of the same species were passed by and left to fall from their first estate, and appointed to everlasting wrath and damnation."
3. "The mention of them in this charge gives no countenance to the worshipping of angels, since they are not set upon a level with God and Christ; nor is the charge delivered before them as judges, but as witnesses; nor are the words in the form of an oath, but of a charge; the angels are not sworn by, or appealed unto; only in their presence is this solemn charge given; and it may be observed, that even inanimate creatures, the heavens and the earth, are sometimes called upon as witnesses; and besides, it was usual with the Jews to make such kind of obtestations."

### John Wesley:
1. "I charge thee before God...that thou observe these things without prejudging." 
2. "Referring to the last judgment...the apostle looks through his own labours, and even through time itself, and seems to stand as one already in eternity."
3. "Or partiality - For or against any one."
