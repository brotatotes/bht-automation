# 1 Timothy 5:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, the commentators provide insights into the rationale behind Paul's counsel to Timothy regarding his consumption of wine. While it is not a call for complete asceticism, it is advised in acknowledgment of Timothy's physical condition and the need for moderation. The emphasis is on the use of a little wine for the sake of Timothy's health and well-being. Furthermore, this counsel serves to prevent misuse by others and maintain Timothy's purity and self-control. Ultimately, it is a practical exhortation to maintain bodily health while serving God and others.

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The presbyter and deacon were enjoined to be 'not given to wine' (1 Timothy 3:3; 1 Timothy 3:8)."
2. "Paul therefore modifies the preceding words, 'keep thyself pure,' virtually saying, 'Not that I mean to enjoin that kind of purity which consists in asceticism, nay, be no longer a water-drinker.'"
3. "Timothy was of a feeble frame and prone to timidity in his duties as overseer where vigorous action was needed; hence Paul exhorts him to take all proper means to raise his bodily condition above these infirmities."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The true connection, and the reason for the introduction of the counsel here, seems to me to be this: Paul appears to have been suddenly impressed with the thought - a thought which is very likely to come over a man who is writing on the duties of the ministry - of the arduous nature of the ministerial office."
2. "Thus considered, this direction is as worthy to be given by an inspired teacher as it is to counsel a man to pay a proper regard to his health, and not needlessly to throw away his life."
3. "The use of wine, and of all intoxicating drinks, was solemnly forbidden to the priests under the Mosaic law, when engaged in the performance of their sacred duties; Leviticus 10:9-10."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Timothy is not enjoined to abstain from water, but is bidden not to be a water-drinker, entirely abstaining from wine." 
2. "The appearance at this point of this dietetic prescription, if it is nothing more, is sufficiently startling; which has led to some question whether the verse may not have been misplaced." 
3. "Observe that oinov here, as everywhere else, means wine, fermented and capable of intoxicating, and not a sweet syrup made by boiling down grape-juice, and styled by certain modern reformers 'unfermented wine.'"

### John Calvin:
1. "What is said amounts to this, that Timothy should accustom himself to drink a little wine, for the sake of preserving his health; for he does not absolutely forbid him to 'drink water,' but to use it as his ordinary beverage." 
2. "In order to meet jeers of this kind, he declares that he provides only for a case of necessity; and at the same time he recommends moderation." 
3. "At the same time a general rule is laid down, that, while we ought to be temperate in eating and drinking, every person should attend to his own health, not for the sake of prolonging life, but that, as long as he lives, he may serve God, and be of use to his neighbors."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "All experience shows that it is the weakened bloodless brain that can least control its thoughts, and is most open to the assaults of impure imaginations."
2. "One who was necessarily brought face to face with the danger, or who needed promptness and decision to guard against it, would find it his wisdom to keep body and brain in a state of healthy equilibrium."
