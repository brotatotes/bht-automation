# 1 Timothy 5:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Commentary on the Bible verse focuses on the distinction between sins that are openly evident and those that remain hidden. Some individuals' sins are immediately apparent, leaving no room for doubt or debate about their suitability for ministry. These sins act as a precursor to judgment, signaling their disqualification from spiritual leadership. However, there are others whose sins are less conspicuous and may only come to light later on. The message advises caution in making judgments, urging a patient and thorough evaluation of individuals' character and actions.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The conservation of himself in health and vigour would ensure his being able to deal ably and firmly with the cases which should come before him for decision." 
2. "Of some men the sins are evident, going before them to judgment." 
3. "But some men again, their sins follow, after-proof brings out the correctness or otherwise of the judgment."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Two kinds of sins are specified: those palpably manifest (so the Greek for 'open beforehand' ought to be translated; so in 1 Timothy 5:24, it is translated 'evident'; literally, 'before' the eyes, that is, notorious), further explained as 'going before to judgment'; and those which follow after the men ('some men they, that is, their sins, follow after'), namely, not going beforehand, loudly accusing, but hidden till they come to the judgment."
2. "Both alike 'cannot be hid'; the former class in the case of bad and good are manifest already; the latter class in the case of both are not manifest now, but shall be so at the final judgment."
3. "Thus he implies that Timothy can only be responsible if he connive at manifest, or evident sins; not that those that are otherwise shall escape judgment at last: just as in the case of good works, he can only be responsible for taking into account in his judgments those which are patent to all, not those secret good works which nevertheless will not remain hidden at the final judgment."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Their conduct was apparent to all. About such people he ought not to hesitate a moment, and, no matter what their talents, or learning, or rank in the community, he ought to have no participation in introducing them to the ministry."
2. "Their character is well understood. There is no need of waiting for the day of judgment to know what they are. Their deeds so precede their own appearance at the judgment-bar, that the record and the verdict can be made up before they arrive there, and there will be scarcely need even of the formality of a trial."
3. "Though they have endeavored to hide their evil deeds, yet they will follow after them to the judgment-bar, and will meet them there. The meaning, in this connection, seems to be, that there ought to be circumspection in judging of the qualifications of men for the office of the ministry."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The meaning is openly manifested to all eyes."
2. "The open sins go before their perpetrator to the judgment-seat like heralds, proclaiming their sentence in advance."
3. "The sins follow up the offender to the bar of judgment, and are first made openly manifest there."

### John Calvin:
1. "The sins of some men are visible beforehand... Paul supports Timothy by this consolation, that, when it shall please God, they will one day be brought to public view. Thus he strengthens him for the exercise of patience; because he ought calmly to await the fit time which God in his wisdom has appointed."
2. "There is another kind of base conduct that sorely distresses good and holy pastors... Paul meets this case also, by informing Timothy, that there are some good works which are reserved for being brought to light at a future period; and consequently that, if their praise is, as it were, buried under ground by the ingratitude of men, that also ought to be patiently endured, till the time of revelation have arrived."
3. "We must bear what cannot be immediately corrected; we must sigh and groan, while the time for the remedy is not fully come; and we must not apply force to diseases, till they are either ripened or laid open. On the other hand, when virtue does not receive the honor which it deserves, we must wait for the full time of revelation, and endure the stupidity of the world, and wait quietly in darkness till the day dawn."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The ‘other men’s sins’ in which Timothy is not to be a partaker, are of two classes (1) flagrant, notorious, so conspicuous even before the trial, that they scarcely need witnesses, are, indeed, as the accusers who bring the criminal before the judge; (2) those which do not come out at first, but, as it were, creep on, and dog the man’s steps, and at last overtake him." 

2. "Receiving the words as applicable chiefly to the precept against hasty laying on of hands, they contain a warning against assuming fitness from the absence of open scandal."

3. "Even in such cases a careful inquiry was not to be neglected. It is obvious that the judgment spoken of is man’s and not God’s, temporal and not eternal in its results."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The sins are so plain that they receive instant condemnation."
2. "Associative instrumental case τισιν with επακολουθουσιν for which verb see verse 1 Timothy 5:10, 'dog their steps' (Parry) like 1 Peter 2:21."
3. "How true that is of secret sins."

### John Gill:
1. "Some men's sins are open before hand...there is no need of any inquiry about them, or any examination of them; or any witnesses to be called to their character, in order to pass judgment concerning them; they even prevent and supersede any formal process about them." 
2. "The characters of some men are so well known, and it is so plain a case, that they are destitute of the grace of God; have not ministerial gifts; or are unsound in the faith; or are men of immoral lives and conversations; so that there can be no dispute about them, whether they are to be admitted into the ministry of the word or rejected." 
3. "But there are other persons who may be proposed, whose sins or errors are so private, that they may not be known; and yet may appear afterwards; wherefore it is proper to take time, and not be too hasty, or lay hands suddenly on men."

### John Wesley:
1. "Some men's sins are manifest beforehand." - This quote highlights that certain individuals' sins are evident even before any investigation takes place. It suggests that their wrongdoing is so apparent that it does not require extensive scrutiny.

2. "Going before to judgment." - This phrase implies that these individuals' sins precede them, leading to a swift judgment that deems them unfit for any spiritual role. It emphasizes the immediate recognition of their unworthiness.

3. "And some they follow after." - This statement suggests that there are others whose sins are not as easily discernible. Their transgressions are more concealed or subtle, requiring a deeper examination to uncover their true nature.
