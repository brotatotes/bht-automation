# 1 Timothy 5:25 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, we are reminded not to hastily judge or acclaim others based on appearances alone. While some individuals may have their good deeds readily apparent, others may possess hidden virtues or intentions. However, true character and actions cannot remain concealed indefinitely, as diligent inquiry and the passage of time will bring them to light. Therefore, it is important to exercise patience and discernment in our assessment of others, avoiding both premature condemnation and undue praise.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Sometimes thou wilt find a man’s good character go before him, and at once approve him to thee: but where this is not so, do not therefore be rash to condemn thou mayest on examination soon discover, if there really be any good deeds accompanying him." 
2. "For they are things which cannot be hidden the good tree like the bad will be known by his fruits, and that speedily, on enquiry."

1. "The character of some people is clear, and accurately understood. There can be no doubt, from their works, that they are good people."
