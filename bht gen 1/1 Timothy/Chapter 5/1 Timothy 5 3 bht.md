## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "If the command be merely to hold them in honour, why should the destitute be held in more honour than those who had families?"
2. "We may fairly interpret it of this particular kind of honour, viz. being inscribed on the Church’s κατάλογος (1Ti 5:9) as a fit object of charitable sustenance."
3. "The Apostle commands, ‘Honour (by placing on the list) those who are widows indeed:’ for it is these especially, they who are destitute of earthly friends, who are most likely to carry out the true religious duties of a widow."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Honour—by setting on the church roll, as fit objects of charitable sustenance." 
2. "So 'honor' is used for support with necessaries." 
3. "widows indeed—Those really desolate; not like those having children or relations answerable for their support, nor like those 'who live in pleasure'; but such as, from their earthly desolation as to friends, are most likely to trust wholly in God, persevere in continual prayers, and carry out the religious duties assigned to Church widows."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The particular attention and respect which are enjoined here, seem to refer to the class of widows who were supported by the church, and who were entrusted with the performance of certain duties toward the other female members."
2. "The change of customs in society has made this class less necessary, and probably the arrangement was never designed to be permanent, but still it may be a question whether such an arrangement would not now be wise and useful in the church."
3. "What Paul regarded as constituting true widowhood, he specifies in 1 Timothy 5:4-5, 1 Timothy 5:9-10. He connects with it the idea that she had no persons dependent on her; that she was desolate, and evinced true trust in God; that she was so aged that she would not marry again; and that by her life she had given evidence of possessing a heart of true benevolence."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Honor [τιμα] . Not only by respectful treatment but by financial support."
2. "A widow, in the East, was peculiarly desolate and helpless."
3. "The council of Laoclicaea abolished this institution, or so modified it that widows no longer held an official relation to the church."

### John Calvin:
1. "Honor widows that are really widows." - The word "honor" here refers to the special care and support that the Church provided to widows in ancient times. It implies a responsibility to select and care for widows who are truly in need.

2. "For selecting widows that are to be taken under your care and that of the deacons, you ought to consider who they are that are really widows." - Paul emphasizes the importance of discernment in choosing which widows to support. Not all widows qualify for this special care, and it is necessary to determine their true need.

3. "Justly, therefore, does Paul forbid to receive the mothers of families, who are already bound by a charge of a different kind." - Paul excludes widows with children from receiving this support, as they have other responsibilities and obligations to fulfill. The focus is on those who can fully dedicate themselves to the service of the Church.

### Philip Schaff:
1) "The verses that follow depend for their right interpretation on a true estimate of the position of the ‘widows’ in a Christian community in the Apostolic Church."
2) "It was natural, however, in the simple communism of the period, that some conditions guarding against abuses should be attached to these privileges, that where there was still any capacity for work, that work should be required of them."
3) "Possibly, as the context indicates, with the secondary meaning of ‘support,’ as in Acts 28:10, and, to some extent, even in the Fifth Commandment."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "For οντως (actually, really), see Luke 23:47; 1 Corinthians 14:25; and verse 1 Timothy 5:5."
2. "Parry notes that in verses 1 Timothy 5:3-8 Paul discusses widows who are in distress and 1 Timothy 5:9-16 those who are in the employment of the local church for certain work."
3. "Both for individual cases of need and as a class Timothy is to show proper respect (τιμα, keep on honouring) the widows."

### John Gill:
1. "The honour to be given them is not a putting of them into the office of a deaconess, in the church...rather regards some external honour and respect to be shown them, by words and actions."
2. "Especially it designs an honourable provision for them, and maintenance of them."
3. "Giving gifts to the poor, or providing for their maintenance, is doing them honour."

### John Wesley:
1. "Honour — That is, maintain out of the public stock." 

2. "Honour is not just about external recognition, but also about taking responsibility for the well-being of others." 

3. "Maintaining honor means providing for the needs of those who are unable to provide for themselves."
