# 1 Timothy 5:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the Bible instructs us on the importance of family responsibilities, particularly the duties of children towards their parents. It emphasizes the need for children to honor and support their own family first, before seeking assistance from the church. The verse also highlights the significance of showing piety and gratitude towards parents, as a way of repaying them for their love and sacrifices. By fulfilling these obligations, we not only demonstrate our respect for our parents, but also cultivate virtues of gratitude and humility.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The case of the χήρα who is not ὄντως χήρα, having earthly relations answerable for her support."
2. "Either, ‘first of all duties,’ which seems supported by 1Ti 5:8 below; or first, before applying to the church for sustenance."
3. "Let them, the children or grandchildren, learn first to be piously grateful to (these members of) their own families, and to give back returns (a return in each case) to their progenitors."

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "A widow indeed," as having children who ought to support her.
2. "Nephews" in old English meant "grandchildren."
3. "Let them learn," implies that abuses of this kind had crept into the Church, widows claiming Church support though they had children or grandchildren able to support them.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Let them learn first to show piety at home... Thus they will have an opportunity of evincing Christian kindness, and of requiting her for her care." 
2. "This the apostle calls 'showing piety' - εὐσεβεῖν eusebein - that is, 'filial piety;' piety toward a parent by providing for the needs of that parent in advanced age."
3. "And to requite their parents - To repay them, as far as possible, for all their kindness. This debt can never be wholly repaid, but still a child should feel it a matter of sacred obligation to do as much toward it as possible."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Nephews [εκγονα] . N. T. o. Often in LXX Nephews, in the now obsolete sense of grandsons or other lineal descendants." 
2. "To show piety at home [τον ιδιον οικον ευσεβειν] . More correctly, to show piety toward their own family. Piety in the sense of filial respect, though not to the exclusion of the religious sense."
3. "To requite [αμοιβας αποδιδοναι] . An entirely unique expression. Amoibh requital, recompense is a familiar classical word, used with didonai to give, ajpotiqenai to lay down, tinein to pay, poieisqai to make."

### John Calvin:
1. "Let them learn, by the pious government of their family, to repay to their successors the education that they received from their ancestors."
2. "The Apostle teaches that the mother or grandmother is the person towards whom they should exercise their piety; for nothing is more natural than the return of filial for parental affection; and it is very unreasonable that it should be excluded from the Church."
3. "Let them learn to conduct themselves in a godly manner at home... that they should train themselves to the worship of God, by performing godly offices at home towards their relatives; for nature commands us to love our parents next to God; that this secondary piety leads to the highest piety."
4. "To shew piety towards their own house... lest a foolish and silly devotion should divest them of human feelings. Again, let widows learn to repay what they owe to their ancestors by educating their own offspring."
5. "Not to shew gratitude to our ancestors is universally acknowledged to be monstrous; for that is a lesson taught us by natural reason. And not only is this conviction natural to all, that affection towards our parents is the second degree of piety; but the very storks teach us gratitude by their example; and that is the etymology of the wordἀνιπελαργία."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The first group thus excluded from those that answer to the name of ‘widow,’ are such as have ‘children or nephews’ (i.e. grandchildren) who are able to support them."
2. "Let them learn. On simply grammatical grounds, the words may refer either to the widows or the children, and each view has found supporters."
3. "‘Let them show their piety’ not ‘at home,’ but ‘to their own house or family.’ As with the Romans and the Jews, so in some measure even with the Greeks, duty to parents came under the head of piety rather than of legal obligation."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "No acts of 'piety' toward God will make up for impiety towards parents." 
2. "Filial piety is primary unless parents interfere with duty to Christ." 
3. "To requite like for like."

### John Gill:
1. "Such are not widows indeed; they are not desolate, or alone, or without persons to take care of them."
2. "Let the children first learn to do well to their own house, or family."
3. "To neglect them in old age, when incapable of providing for themselves, would be base ingratitude; whereas to take care of them is but a requital of them, or a repaying them for former benefits had of them."

### John Wesley:
1. "Requiting parents is not just about repaying them monetarily, but also about showing gratitude and appreciation for all the care, trouble, and sacrifices they have made for us."
2. "This verse reminds us of the importance of honoring our parents, not just in words but also in our actions. It is a call to acknowledge and repay the debt of love and care that we owe to our parents."
3. "By requiting our parents, we not only fulfill a moral obligation but also cultivate a spirit of gratitude and humility, recognizing that we are who we are because of their love and guidance."
