## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Thus what follows is said more for moral eulogy of such a widow, than as commending her to the charity of the church."
2. "ἤλπικεν, has set and continues to set her hope."
3. "ἐπὶ τὸν θεόν, on God as its portion and ultimate aim, as distinguished from ἐπὶ τῷ θεῷ, on God as its present stay."

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "She must be not one 'that liveth in pleasure,' but one making God her main hope." 
2. "Her destitution of children and of all ties to earth would leave her more unencumbered for devoting the rest of her days to God and the Church." 
3. "Such a one, Paul implies, would be the fittest object for the Church's help; for such a one is promoting the cause of Christ's Church by her prayers for it."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "A widow indeed, and desolate - The word rendered 'desolate' means 'solitary, alone.' It does not necessarily imply the idea of discomfort which we attach to the word desolate."
2. "Trusteth in God - She has no one else to look to but God. She has no earthly reliance, and, destitute of husband, children, and property, she feels her dependence, and steadily looks to God for consolation and support."
3. "And continueth in supplications and prayers night and day - Continually; compare notes on 1 Timothy 2:1; see also the description of Anna in Luke 2:36-37."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "One entirely bereaved." This phrase emphasizes the complete loss and desolation experienced by the widow, highlighting the depth of her suffering and need for support.

2. "Hath directed her hope at God." This quote suggests that the widow's hope is solely focused on God, indicating her unwavering trust and reliance on Him in her time of need.

3. "Her hope set on God implies ejpi with the dative." This statement highlights the specific grammatical construction used in the original text, providing a deeper understanding of the widow's hope being placed directly on God as the object of her trust.

### John Calvin:
1. "He says that such persons hope in God... they have nothing to disturb their thoughts, from looking to God alone; because they find nothing in the world on which they can rely." 
2. "By this argument he commends them; for, when human aid and every refuge fails them, it is the duty of the Church to stretch forth her hand to render assistance; and thus the condition of the widow, who is childless and desolate, implores the aid of the pastor."
3. "Again, this constancy in prayer demands freedom from other cares; for they who are occupied with the government of a family have less freedom and leisure."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Desolate, i.e. left alone, in contrast with the widow who has children or grandchildren." 
2. "Trusteth. Better, 'has set her hope on God.'" 
3. "In supplications and prayers night and day. The parallelism with Luke 2:37 suggests the idea that St. Paul may have heard from his companion of the perfect picture of true widowhood presented by Anna the prophetess. The words may point either to personal devotions or to attendance at all meetings of the Church for that purpose."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Desolate (μεμονωμενη). Perfect passive participle of μονοω (from μονος), 'left alone,' old verb, here alone in N.T. Without husband, children, or other close kin."
2. "Hath her hope set on God (ηλπικεν επ θεον). Perfect active indicative of ελπιζω, 'hath placed her hope (and keeps it) on God.'"
3. "Night and day (νυκτος κα ημερας). 'By night and by day' (genitive, not accusative). Paul does not say that she should pray 'all night and day.'"
