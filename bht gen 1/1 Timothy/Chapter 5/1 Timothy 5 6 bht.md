# 1 Timothy 5:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse describes a woman who indulges in luxurious and pleasurable living, prioritizing worldly enjoyment over spiritual matters. She is characterized by indulgence and extravagance, but not necessarily in sinful activities. This woman is spiritually dead, separated from God and devoid of true life in the Spirit. Her lifestyle is contrary to the selfless and upright living expected of believers.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Contrast (δέ) to the character just described: and that certainly with a view to point out that this kind of widow is no object for the charity of the Church, as not being at all a partaker of the life unto God."
2. "σπαταλῶσα] Wetst. from the glossaries, gives σπαταλᾷ, λίαν τρυφᾷ, ἀσώτως ζῇ. In the Anthol., iv. 28. 14, we have coupled πᾶν τὸ βρότων σπατάλημα κ. ἡ πολύολβος ἐδωδή."
3. "ζῶσα τέθνηκεν] while alive in the flesh, has no real life in the Spirit: see ref. and Matthew 8:22; Ephesians 5:14."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "She that liveth in pleasure—the opposite of such a widow as is described in 1 Timothy 5:3, and therefore one utterly undeserving of Church charity."
2. "The Greek expresses wanton prodigality and excess."
3. "Dead while she liveth—dead in the Spirit while alive in the flesh."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It properly means to live in luxury, voluptuously; to indulge freely in eating and drinking; to yield to the indulgence of the appetites."
2. "It does not indicate grossly criminal pleasures; but the kind of pleasure connected with luxurious living, and with pampering the appetites."
3. "There is great emphasis in this expression, and nothing could convey more forcibly the idea that true happiness is not to be found in the pleasure of sense."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Life in worldly pleasure is only life in appearance" (Holtzmann).
2. "Is dead while she liveth" (ζωσα τεθνηκεν).
3. "Liveth in pleasure" (σπαταλωσα).

### John Calvin:
1. "Paul censures those who abuse their widowhood for this purpose, that, being loosed from the marriage yoke, and freed from every annoyance, they may lead a life of pleasant idleness."
2. "A woman 'is dead,' when she is useless, and does no good; for to what purpose do we live, if it be not that our actions may yield some advantage?"
3. "If they reckon themselves happy, when they have everything to their heart’s wish, and if they think that nothing but repose and luxury can be called life, for my part, I declare that they are dead."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "She that plays the wanton" implies one form of evil too definitely. 

2. "Is dead" refers to being spiritually dead, and should be treated as such for the purpose in hand. 

3. Her name should be struck off the register of those entitled to support.

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "She that giveth herself to pleasure" - This phrase refers to someone who indulges in excessive and extravagant living, prioritizing worldly pleasures over spiritual matters.

2. "Present active participle of σπλαταλαω" - The use of this specific Greek verb highlights the ongoing and active nature of the indulgence in pleasure.

3. "Late verb (Polybius) from σπαταλη" - The verb σπλαταλαω is a rare word in the New Testament, but it was used by Polybius to describe a lifestyle characterized by riotous and luxurious living.

These quotes shed light on the meaning of the phrase "she that giveth herself to pleasure" and provide linguistic and historical context for understanding its significance in the Bible verse.

### John Gill:
1. "There is a likeness between a moral and a corporeal death. In a corporeal death, the soul is separated from the body; and in a moral death, souls are separated from God, and are alienated from the life of God."
2. "Death defaces and deforms the man, and a moral death lies in the defacing of the image of God, first stamped on man, and in a loss of original righteousness."
3. "As dead men are helpless to themselves, so are they; they can do nothing of, nor for themselves, in matters of a spiritual nature; and as dead men are unprofitable unto others, so are they to God, and man."

Note: The commentary is quite lengthy and does not provide clear and concise quotes that enrich the understanding of the verse. However, the quotes provided above capture some of the key points made in the commentary.

### John Wesley:
1. "Delicately, voluptuously, in elegant, regular sensuality."
