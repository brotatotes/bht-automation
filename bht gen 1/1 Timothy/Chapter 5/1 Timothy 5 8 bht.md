# 1 Timothy 5:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Faith requires more than just personal belief; it necessitates action and responsibility, as various commentators explain. Neglecting one's obligations toward family and loved ones amounts to denying the faith, for true faith encompasses love and its works. As Christians, we are called to prioritize our immediate family, caring for their needs and not neglecting them, which is a clear demonstration of our love and faith. Faith does not discard natural responsibilities, but rather strengthens and perfects them, reminding us that our duty extends beyond ourselves to those around us.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Agreeably with their former interpretation, Chrys., &c. regard τίς as meaning ‘a widow:’ Calv. and Thdrt. unite both, widows and children."
2. "The Roman-Catholic Commentator Mack has some good remarks here, on the faith of which the Apostle speaks: 'Faith, in the sense of the Apostle, cannot exist, without including love...'"
3. "For even among heathens the common duties of family piety are recognized: if therefore a Christian repudiates them, he lowers himself beneath the heathen."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Faith without love and its works is dead; 'for the subject matter of faith is not mere opinion, but the grace and truth of God, to which he that believes gives up his spirit, as he that loves gives up his heart'." 

2. "If in any case a duty of love is plain, it is in relation to one's own relatives; to fail in so plain an obligation is a plain proof of want of love, and therefore of want of faith."

3. "Faith does not set aside natural duties, but strengthens them."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The meaning is, that the person referred to is to think beforehand of the probable needs of his own family, and make arrangements to meet them."
2. "He who neglected his own immediate family would be more guilty than he who neglected a more remote relative."
3. "We may hence learn that it is possible to deny the faith by conduct as well as by words; and that a neglect of doing our duty is as real a denial of Christianity as it would be openly to renounce it."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Faith demands works and fruits. By refusing the natural duties which Christian faith implies, one practically denies his possession of faith." 
2. "Faith does not abolish natural duties, but perfects and strengthens them." 
3. "Even an unbeliever will perform these duties from natural promptings."

### John Calvin:
1. "He says that they who do not care about any of their relatives, and especially about their own house, have 'denied the faith.' And justly; for there is no piety towards God, when a person can thus lay aside the feelings of humanity." 
2. "Would faith, which makes us the sons of God, render us worse than brute beasts? Such inhumanity, therefore, is open contempt of God, and denying of the faith." 
3. "This is true for two reasons. First, the further advanced any one is in the knowledge of God, the less is he excused; and therefore, they who shut their eyes against the clear light of God are worse than infidels. Secondly, this is a kind of duty which nature itself teaches; for they are natural affections."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The duty of the widow to 'provide' not in the material sense; but, in contrast to the wasteful wantonness of the spurious widow, to 'exercise forethought' for those connected with her."
2. "His own... Better, in each case, 'her own.' The latter as the closer word the former, like our phrase 'his people,' including servants, labourers, dependants of any kind."
3. "Worse than an infidel... Better 'unbeliever,' as not involving the stigma which now attaches to the secondary sense of the word; 'worse,' because the heathens as a rule laid stress on filial piety; worse, as sinning more against light and knowledge."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Condition of first class with ε and present active (or middle προνοειτα) indicative of προνοεω, old verb, to think beforehand." 
2. "His act of impiety belies (Titus 1:16) his claim to the faith (Revelation 2:13)."
3. "Ablative case of απιστου after the comparative χειρων. Who makes no profession of piety."

### John Gill:
1. "Not only for his wife and children, but for his parents, when grown old, and cannot help themselves."
2. "Though the tie of nature obliges him to take care of them, yet that of grace makes the obligation still more strong and binding."
3. "He must act both the inhuman and the unchristian part, that does not take care of his pious parents."

### John Wesley:
1. "Denying the faith does not mean abandoning one's religious beliefs, but rather neglecting one's responsibilities towards family and loved ones." 

2. "The verse challenges the notion of accumulating wealth for the sake of future generations, reminding us that our primary duty is to provide for our immediate family."

3. "It is important to remember that faith is not just about personal piety, but also about fulfilling our obligations towards others, especially those who are vulnerable and in need."
