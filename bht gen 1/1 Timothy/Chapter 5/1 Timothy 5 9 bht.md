# 1 Timothy 5:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, a woman who is at least sixty years old and has been the wife of one husband is to be enrolled as a widow. Being enrolled as a widow is like being chosen and assigned a special role within the church community, similar to deaconesses. These widows, supported by the church, have both a practical and spiritual purpose - ministering to the poor, caring for the sick, and serving as examples of continence and chastity. The age requirement signifies maturity, experience, and a dedication to the work of the church.

1. "Though some choose to understand these words of the number of such who were made deaconesses, and had the care of the poor widows of the church committed to them; and so the Arabic version renders it, 'if a widow be chosen a deaconess'; but the former sense is best, for it appears from 1 Timothy 5:1 that the apostle is still speaking of widows to be relieved."

2. "Now such were not to be taken under the church's care for relief, under threescore years old: for under this age it might be supposed they would marry, and so not be desolate, but would have husbands to provide for them; or they might be capable of labour, and so of taking care of themselves."

3. "Nor is the sense only, that she should be one who never had more husbands than one at once; for this was not usual for women to have more husbands than one, even where polygamy obtained, or where men had more wives than one: this rather therefore is to be understood of one who had never put away her husband, and married another, which was sometimes done among the Jews."
