## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Let as many as are slaves under the yoke hold their own masters worthy of all honor." 
2. "That the name of God and his doctrine be not spoken evil of."
3. "This verse obviously applies only to those slaves who had unbelieving masters."

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Let as many as are under the yoke (as) slaves" - The exhortation is natural as there was a danger of Christian slaves inwardly feeling above their heathen masters.
2. "Their own masters" - The phrase "their own" is an argument for submissiveness; it is not strangers, but their own masters whom they are required to respect.
3. "All possible and fitting honor" - All possible and fitting honor; not merely outward subjection, but that inward honor from which will flow spontaneously right outward conduct.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The word is that which was commonly applied to a slave, but it is so extensive in its signification as to be applicable to any species of servitude, whether voluntary or involuntary."
2. "The apostle did not regard slavery as a light or desirable thing."
3. "The slave ought to show the Christian spirit toward his master who was not a Christian; he ought to conduct himself so that religion would not be dishonored."

These quotes highlight the broad application of the term "servants," the apostle's view on slavery, and the importance of demonstrating a Christian spirit towards non-Christian masters.

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Yoke is used only here of the state of slavery."
2. "Their own [τους ιδιους] . Lit. private, personal, peculiar."
3. "Count [ηγεισθωσαν] . Implying a more conscious, a surer judgment, resting on more careful weighing of the facts."

### John Calvin:
1. "Owing to the false opinion of his own excellence which every person entertains, there is no one who patiently endures that others should rule over him." 
2. "He means that they must not inquire whether they deserve that lot or a better one; for it is enough that they are bound to this condition."
3. "No man renders either to a prince or to a master what he owes to them, unless, looking at the eminence to which God has raised them, he honor them, because he is subject to them."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The subject of Church discipline in the strict sense of the word had been finished."
2. "The influence of Christianity on the slave population of the Roman Empire was popularly regarded as a crucial test."
3. "Was a slave more honest, sober, truthful, generally a better servant, after his conversion?"

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Under the yoke" - Perhaps under heathen masters (1 Peter 2:18). For the slave problem, see also 1 Timothy 6:1; Colossians 3:22; Ephesians 6:5; Titus 2:9.
2. "Their own masters" - That is always where the shoe pinches. Our "despot" is this very Greek word, the strict correlative of slave (δουλος), while κυριος has a wider outlook. Old word only here, Titus 2:9; 2 Timothy 2:21; 1 Peter 2:18 for human masters. Applied to God in Luke 2:29; Acts 4:24; Acts 4:29 and to Christ in 2 Peter 2:1.
3. "The name of God" - If the heathen could say that Christian slaves were not as dependable as non-Christian slaves. Negative purpose with ινα μη and present passive subjunctive (βλασφημητα).

### John Gill:
1. "Not under the yoke of the law of God, or under the yoke of Christ; though the servants here spoken of were under both; but 'under the yoke of government', as the Arabic version renders it; that is, under the yoke of men, in a state of servitude, under the government of masters, and in their service."
2. "Count their own masters worthy of all honour; and give it to them; which includes subjection to them; obedience to all their lawful commands, which are consistent with religion and reason, with the laws of God, and with the light of nature; and all reverence of them, and respect unto them, expressed by words and gestures."
3. "That the name of God and [his] doctrine be not blasphemed; by unbelieving masters, who, should their believing servants be refractory, disobedient, rebellious, or disrespectful, would be apt to say, what a God do these men serve? is this their religion? is this the Gospel they talk of?"

### John Wesley:
1. "Let servants under the yoke — Of heathen masters." - This quote highlights the context of the verse, emphasizing that it specifically addresses servants who are under the authority of non-believing masters.

2. "Account them worthy of all honour - All the honour due from a servant to a master." - This quote emphasizes the importance of showing respect and honor to non-believing masters, regardless of their beliefs or actions.

3. "Lest the name of God and his doctrine be blasphemed — As it surely will, if they do otherwise." - This quote highlights the potential consequences of not honoring non-believing masters, suggesting that it can lead to the blasphemy of God's name and teachings.
