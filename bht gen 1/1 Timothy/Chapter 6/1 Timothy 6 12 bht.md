3. "Professed a good profession [ωμολογησας την καλην ομολογιαν]. Both the verb and the noun in Paul, but this combination only here. For the use of kalov good see ch. 1 Timothy 1:18, and ver. 12. Rend. confessed the good confession, and see on your professed subjection, 2 Corinthians 9:13."

1. "The thought is parallel to, but not identical with, the ‘good warfare’ of 1 Timothy 1:18.

2. "The conflict is to be a continuous life-long struggle, the ‘laying hold’ is to be one vigorous act."
3. "The metaphor of the conflict is dropped, and the words fit in with the spiritual realities of Timothy’s own experience."
