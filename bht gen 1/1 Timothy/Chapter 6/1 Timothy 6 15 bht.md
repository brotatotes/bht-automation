# 1 Timothy 6:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the manifestation of the kingdom of God is depicted in successive stages, each having its own appropriate time. God, the ultimate ruler and potentate, will reveal this manifestation at the times of His choosing. All the governments of the world may have authority, but they are subject to the dominion of God, who sets up and removes kings according to His will. The power, knowledge, and revelation of God's kingdom remain in His eternal mind, to be unveiled in His own appointed times.
