# 1 Timothy 6:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Bible verse being described speaks to the wealthy, cautioning them against placing their hope and pride in their riches, which are uncertain and fleeting. Instead, they are reminded to be rich in good works, generosity, and trust in the living God, who provides all things abundantly for enjoyment. By seeking fulfillment in God rather than wealth, they can lay a foundation for a truly meaningful and blessed life. This admonition serves as a counterpoint to the mindset that places trust and satisfaction in worldly riches, encouraging a shift towards a humble and faithful disposition.
