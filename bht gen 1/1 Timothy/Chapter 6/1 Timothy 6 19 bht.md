2. "The sure reversion of the future heavenly inheritance: earthly riches scattered in faith lay up in store a sure increase of heavenly riches."

1. "We need not be startled at the apparent contradiction between this reference to good works as a foundation, and the language in which St. Paul elsewhere asserts that the one foundation is Christ."
