# 1 Timothy 6:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse being described warns against the dangers of pride and ignorance. The person in question is filled with self-conceit and their knowledge is centered around meaningless arguments rather than the truth. They are prone to engaging in useless debates and their communication is marked by contentious disputes and suspicious thoughts. This ignorance and arrogance stem from their lack of understanding of true religion and the simplicity of the gospel. Their behavior not only harms their own peace and comfort but also breeds envy, strife, and slander.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "He is proud—literally, 'wrapt in smoke'; filled with the fumes of self-conceit." 
2. "Truth is not the center about which his investigations move, but mere word-strifes."
3. "These stand with them instead of 'godliness' and 'wholesome words'."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He is proud - That is, he is lifted up with his fancied superior acquaintance with the nature of religion."
2. "Knowing nothing - That is, that he does not understand the nature of religion as he supposes he does."
3. "But doting - The meaning here is, that such persons had a sickly or morbid desire for debates of this kind."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "He is proud [τετυφωται]. Knowing nothing [μηδεν επισταμενος]." - These phrases highlight the ignorance and arrogance of the person being described in the verse.

2. "Doting [νοσων]. Questions [ζητησεις]." - The use of these words suggests that the person is not only ignorant but also prone to unhealthy and pointless debates and arguments.

3. "Strifes of words [λογομαχιας]. Surmisings [υπονοιαι]." - These terms emphasize the negative and contentious nature of the person's communication, characterized by unnecessary conflicts and suspicious thoughts.

### John Calvin:
1. "Such persons Paul first charges with pride, foolish and empty pride."
2. "At the same time, he instructs all believers not to be carried away by that windy ostentation, but to remain steadfast in the simplicity of the gospel."
3. "He gives the name λογομαχίας (logomachies, or disputes about words) to contentious disputes about words rather than things, or, as it is commonly expressed, without substance or foundation."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "He is proud. The same Greek word as in 1 Timothy 3:6, ‘He has been and is under the stupefying influence of a fever.’ The word is thus brought into the sharpest possible contrast with the ‘healthy words’ of the previous verse."
2. "Doting. Here again the term is strictly medical: ‘raving’ mad after, morbidly dwelling on."
3. "Thinking that gain is godliness. The English Version exactly inverts the right order of the words, ‘thinking that godliness’ (better perhaps ‘religion’ or ‘piety’) ‘is a means of mining money.’ The words carry us back to the disturbing anti-social teaching against which the apostle had protested in 1 Timothy 6:1-2."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Ignorance is a frequent companion of conceit."
2. "Disputes of words, our 'logomachy,' are wars in words."
3. "Envy, strife, railings or slanders are all products of an ignorant and conceited mind."

### John Gill:
1. "The doctrines of grace are of an humbling nature, especially when they are spiritually and experimentally understood and received."
2. "He may have collected a medley of knowledge together, but what will be of no real use either to himself or others."
3. "The peace and comfort of particular persons, and even of whole communities, are broken and destroyed hereby; for foolish and unlearned questions gender strifes."

### John Wesley:
1. "He is puffed up — Which is the cause of his not consenting to the doctrine which is after inward, practical religion."
2. "Sick of questions — Doatingly fond of dispute; an evil, but common, disease; especially where practice is forgotten."
3. "Such disputants seldom like the prosperity of others, or to be less esteemed themselves."
