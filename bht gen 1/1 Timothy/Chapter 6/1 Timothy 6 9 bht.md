# 1 Timothy 6:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Bible verse describes the dangers of the desire to be rich. It warns that this desire leads people into temptation and a snare, causing them to fall into destructive and hurtful lusts. Commentaries explain that it's not the possession of riches itself that is harmful, but the love and pursuit of them. Those who wish to be rich are at risk of being captivated by the devil, sinking into a sea of avarice that ruins everything in this life and the next. The desire for wealth blinds people to their true needs, leading them into folly and ultimate destruction.
