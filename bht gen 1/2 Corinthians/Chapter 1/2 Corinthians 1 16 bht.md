# 2 Corinthians 1:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse being described is about the Apostle Paul's original plan to visit the Corinthians on his way to Macedonia, as well as after passing through it. However, due to new information he received from "them of Chloe," his intention changed. In his previous letter to the Corinthians, he mentioned the possibility of coming to them before passing through Macedonia. Despite criticism from some Corinthians, Paul's change of plans was motivated by love and a desire to address their concerns through an epistle first. This demonstrates the challenges and misunderstandings that can arise when dealing with human plans and perceptions.
