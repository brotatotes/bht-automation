## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "the levity of purpose which has been laid to my charge"
2. "the levity of purpose inherent in human nature"
3. "Or those things which I plan, do I plan after the flesh, so that my yea must be yea, and my nay, nay?"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Did I act with levity, or (on the other hand) do I purpose what I purpose like worldly (fleshly) men, so that my 'yea' must at all costs be yea, and my 'nay' nay?" - This quote highlights the contrast between levity and purpose, suggesting that the speaker is questioning whether they have been frivolous or inconsistent in their promises.

2. "The repetition of the 'yea' and 'nay' hardly agrees with ALFORD'S view, 'What I purpose do I purpose according to the changeable purposes of the fleshly (worldly) man, that there may be with me the yea yea, and the nay nay (that is, both affirmation and negation concerning the same thing)?'" - This quote discusses different interpretations of the repetition of "yea" and "nay," suggesting that it may not be equivalent to a single affirmation or negation, but rather represents both affirmation and negation concerning the same thing.

3. "The repetition will thus stand for the single yea and nay, as in Matthew 5:37; James 5:12. But the latter passage implies that the double 'yea' here is not equivalent to the single 'yea': BENGEL'S view, therefore, seems preferable." - This quote references other biblical passages to support the argument that the repetition of "yea" and "nay" does not have the same meaning as a single affirmation or negation. It suggests that the interpretation proposed by BENGEL is more likely to be correct.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "By the interrogative form here, he sharply denies that it was a purpose formed in a light and trifling manner."
2. "Paul denies in a positive manner that he formed such plans; and they should have known enough of his manner of life to be assured that that was not the nature of the schemes which he had devised."
3. "Paul says that this was not his character. He did not affirm a thing at one time and deny it at another; he did not promise to do a thing one moment and refuse to do it the next."

1. "His change of plan had given rise to the charge of fickleness."
2. "That I should say 'yes' at one time and 'no' at another; promising to come and breaking my promise."
3. "The yea, yea, and the nay, nay."

### John Calvin:
1. "There are two things, more especially, that prevent the purposes of men from being carried into effect, or their promises from being faithfully performed. The one is that they make changes upon them almost every hour, and the other is that they are too rash in forming their plans."
2. "To purpose, therefore, according to the flesh, is not owning God as our ruler, but, instead of this, being impelled by a rash presumption, which is afterwards justly derided by God, and punished."
3. "That with me there should be yea, yea...what has been once affirmed must remain fixed, and what has been once denied must never be done."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "This shews that his original plan had somehow become known at Corinth either through Timothy (1 Corinthians 4:17), or in the letter referred to in 1 Corinthians 5:9 and that advantage had been taken of the change to his prejudice." 

2. "That with me there should be yea yea, and nay nay? ‘saying yes and no to the same thing as suits the whim of the moment.’"

3. "That this is the meaning is clear from what follows."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "An indignant negative answer is called for by μητ." 
2. "Ελαφρια is a late word for levity from the old adjective, ελαφρος, light, agile."
3. "Paul raises the question of fickleness about any of his plans."

### John Gill:
1. "Did I use lightness in my resolutions and promises? did I promise certainly that I would come, without annexing any condition to it? did I not say, I would come to you shortly, if the Lord will?" 
2. "Or the things that I purpose, do I purpose according to the flesh? do I consult myself? my own interest and advantage? do I seek the gratification of any carnal affection, as covetousness, ambition, or vain glory?"
3. "Or when I have purposed anything, have I resolved upon it in my own strength? have I thought it lay in my own power to effect it? that with me there should be yea, yea, and nay, nay?"

### John Wesley:
1. "Did I use levity — Did I lightly change my purpose?"
2. "Do I purpose according to the flesh - Are my purposes grounded on carnal or worldly considerations?"
3. "So that there should be with me yea and nay - Sometimes one, sometimes the other; that is, variableness and inconstancy."
