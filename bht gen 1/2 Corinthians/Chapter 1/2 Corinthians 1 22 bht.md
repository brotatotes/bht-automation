# 2 Corinthians 1:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Bible verse in question highlights the concept of believers being sealed by the Holy Spirit. This sealing serves as a confirmation of their belonging to God and establishes their faith. It is like a token or pledge of the Spirit, given by God to assure them of their possession of His promises. The Holy Spirit also acts as an earnest, a down payment, which guarantees the fulfillment of all of God's promises in the lives of believers. The Spirit is a seal that cannot be broken, serving as an assurance and a witness of their relationship with God.
