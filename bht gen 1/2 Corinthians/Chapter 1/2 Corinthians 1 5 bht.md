# 2 Corinthians 1:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, we see the profound connection between the sufferings of Christ and the sufferings endured by his followers. The sufferings are not just physical, but encompass the trials and hardships endured for the cause of Christ. However, alongside these sufferings, believers find an overflowing and abundant comfort through their relationship with Christ. This comfort is not simply equal to the sufferings, but surpasses them, providing solace and strength in the midst of adversity. It is through this partnership with Christ in suffering that believers also share in the promise of glory.
