## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "We had in ourselves the response of death, i.e. our answer within ourselves to the question, ‘Life or Death?’ was, ‘Death.’" 
2. "Our thoughts were weaned from all hope of surviving in this life, and fixed on that better deliverance which God shall work when He raises us from the dead."
3. "Understanding it literally as above, I cannot see how it can be spoken with reference to the Ephesian tumult. If it alludes to any external danger, I should be disposed to refer it to the same obscure part of Paul’s history to which he alludes 1 Corinthians 15:32, where he also speaks of the hope of the resurrection as his great support."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Our only hope was fixed on the coming resurrection."
2. "His hope of the resurrection was what buoyed him up in contending with foes, savage as wild beasts."
3. "He touches only on the doctrine of the resurrection, taking it for granted that its truth is admitted by the Corinthians, and urging its bearing on their practice."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The word rendered 'sentence' means properly an answer, judicial response, or sentence; and is here synonymous with verdict. It means that Paul felt that he was condemned to die; that he felt as if he were under sentence of death and with no hope of acquittal."
2. "He felt that he must die; and that human aid was vain. According to every probability he would die; and all that he could do was to cast himself on the protection of that God who had power to save him even then, if he chose."
3. "The effect, therefore, of the near prospect of death was to lead him to put increased confidence in God. He felt that God only could save him; or that God only could sustain him if he should die."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Sentence of death... answer of death." - The commentary explains that the phrase "sentence of death" can also be understood as the "answer of death." This suggests that the struggle mentioned in the verse will ultimately lead to death.

### John Calvin:
1. "We must... take notice... that the saints themselves have some remains of this disease adhering to them, and that for this reason they are often reduced to an extremity, that, stripped of all self-confidence, they may learn humility."
2. "In God that raiseth the dead... Let us begin, therefore, with despairing of ourselves, but with the view of placing our hope in God. Let us be brought low in ourselves, but in order that we may be raised up by his power."
3. "The first thing in order, it is true, is this — that, by means of the strength with which God furnishes us, we should acknowledge him as the Author of life; but as in consequence of our dulness the light of life often dazzles our eyes, it is necessary that we should be brought to God by having death presented to our view."

### Archibald T Robertson:

2. "The answer of death...in the sense of decision or judgment rendered." 
3. "We ourselves have had within ourselves...the vivid recollection of that experience."

### John Gill:
1. "By the sentence of death is meant, not any decree of heaven, or appointment of God that they should die; nor any sentence of condemnation and death passed on them by the civil magistrate; but an opinion or persuasion in their own breasts, that they should die."
2. "To learn to lay aside all self-trust and confidence: that we should not trust in ourselves; in our strength, wisdom, and policy, to make our escape, and preserve our lives."
3. "To teach and encourage them to trust in God alone, and depend on his arm, on his almighty power: but in God which raiseth the dead."

### John Wesley:
