### John Calvin:
1. "Paul replies, that he is not bold except in so far as he is constrained by necessity, and that the meanness of his bodily presence, for which he was held in contempt, detracted nothing from his authority, inasmuch as he was distinguished by spiritual excellence, not by carnal show."
2. "The meaning is this: 'I beseech you, nay more, I earnestly entreat you by the gentleness of Christ, not to compel me, through your obstinacy, to be more severe than I would desire to be, and than I will be, towards those who despise me.'"
3. "Paul, in making mention of [gentleness], intimates that he is no stranger to it. 'I earnestly beseech you not to despise that gentleness, which Christ showed us in his own person, and shows us every day in his servants, nay more, which ye see in me.'"

3. "He here speaks of himself in the language of his adversaries, who meant by these characters to expose him to scorn and contempt: 'I Paul myself'; whose name the false teachers played upon, it signifying 'little'; and he being of little stature, they reproached him for it, and would insinuate, that as his name was 'little', and his person mean, his bodily presence weak, and his speech contemptible, that he had a little soul, was a man of small knowledge, mean parts, and a very insignificant minister."

### John Wesley:
1. "Now I Paul myself" - This expression emphasizes the personal involvement and authority of the writer, Paul, in addressing the situation at hand.
