# 2 Corinthians 10:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the emphasis is on the consistency and reliability of Paul and his companions. Their character and actions are not influenced by their physical presence or absence. They are the same in both word and deed, and their threats should not be taken lightly. The execution of their warnings can be trusted and will bring sorrow to those who oppose them.
