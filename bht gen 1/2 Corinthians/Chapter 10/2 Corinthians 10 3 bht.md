# 2 Corinthians 10:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, the writer addresses the accusation of walking according to the flesh. They acknowledge that though they live in the limitations of human existence, they do not wage war in a worldly or carnal manner. Their warfare is a spiritual battle against sin, evil, and the powers of darkness. Despite the frailties of the flesh, true ministers of Christ carry within them a divine power that shines forth despite their weaknesses.
