# 2 Corinthians 10:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse being described speaks of the Christian warfare, which is not fought with physical weapons, but with spiritual ones that possess power in the sight of God. The imagery used suggests the act of tearing down strongholds, both in a literal and metaphorical sense, in order to defend the truth and liberty of the Gospel. This warfare is not fought alone, but relies on the assistance of God and the efficacy of His Word.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "If the warfare were according to the flesh, its weapons would be carnal; whereas now, as implied, they are spiritual, powerful in the sight of God."
2. "In order to pulling down of strongholds."
3. "Recollections of the Mithridatic and piratical wars may have contributed to this imagery."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The power is not ours, but God's."
2. "The efficacy of the Christian religion proves its truth."
3. "The inspired servants of God inherit the commission of the Old Testament prophets."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The weapons of our warfare...are not carnal...They are not such as derive advantage from any power inherent in themselves. Their strength is derived from God alone."
2. "The sense is, that God is the author of the doctrines which we preach, and that he attends them with the agency of his Spirit, and accompanies them to the hearts of people."
3. "The Christian goes on his warfare, feeling that however well adapted the truths which he holds are to accomplish great purposes, and however wisely his plans are formed, yet that the efficacy of all depends on the agency of God."

These quotes emphasize that the weapons of a Christian's warfare are not physical or worldly, but rather spiritual and reliant on God's power. They highlight the importance of recognizing that victory comes from God's agency and that the Christian's role is to faithfully proclaim the truth and rely on God's strength to overcome the strongholds of sin and error.

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The idea of weakness attaches to that of fleshliness."
2. "Pulling down... also used of taking down pride, or refuting arguments."
3. "In its use here there may lie a reminiscence of the rock-forts on the coast of Paul's native Cilicia, which were pulled down by the Rom."

### John Calvin:
1. "The life of a Christian, it is true, is a perpetual warfare, for whoever gives himself to the service of God will have no truce from Satan at any time, but will be harassed with incessant disquietude."
2. "Whoever, therefore, is unarmed with the influence of the Holy Spirit, however he may boast that he is a minister of Christ, will nevertheless, not prove himself to be such."
3. "There is nothing in the world so strongly fortified as to be beyond his power to overthrow."


### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Στρατεια is campaign and not army as some MSS. have (στρατια)." 
2. "This dative of personal interest (ethical dative) can be like αστειος τω θεω (Acts 7:20), in God's eyes, as it looks to God." 
3. "Καθαιρεσις is old word from καθαιρεω, to take down, to tear down walls and buildings. Carries on the military metaphor."

### John Gill:
1. "The ministry of the word is so styled, because that as war is waged in defence of men's rights, properties, and liberties, and for the weakening of an enemy's power and possessions, and for the enlargement of kingdoms and dominions; so this is in defence of the truths and liberty of the Gospel, that they may continue and abide."
2. "The 'weapons' with which this warfare is managed are the Scriptures of truth, the sword of the Spirit, the word of God; and which indeed are an armoury, out of which may be taken weapons of all sorts, both offensive and defensive."
3. "Now these weapons are not carnal; such as the men of the world fight with, not the temporal sword; for Christ sent forth his apostles without that, naked and unarmed amidst their enemies, his kingdom not being of this world, and so not to be defended and propagated in such a way."

### John Wesley:
1. "The weapons of our warfare...are not carnal, but spiritual." 
2. "Mighty to the throwing down of strongholds." 
3. "The word of God seems to be here chiefly intended."
