# 2 Corinthians 10:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Do not merely judge a minister of Christ based on external factors, such as appearance or rank. Look beyond the surface and consider the true qualities and character of the person. Remember to reflect on your own tendency to make snap judgments and engage in introspection to overcome biases. Focus on the spiritual qualities and abilities of individuals rather than their outward appearance.

2. "Whoever these teachers were, it is evident that they claimed to be on the side of Christ, and to be appointed by him. They were probably Jews, and they boasted of their talents and eloquence, and possibly that they had seen the Saviour."

2. "If any man trusteth in himself that he is Christ’s, let him consider this again with himself" - Those who claim to belong to Christ should reflect on their own allegiance and consider the shared identity and belonging of all believers.
3. "Let those who set themselves up among you as the special servants of Christ... evidence their claims by recognizing mine" - The true servants of Christ should not only assert their own claims but also acknowledge and validate the claims of others who belong to Christ.

1. "A reproof for making judgment of persons and things, by the outward appearance of them."
2. "Let a man be ever so confident of his being a true minister of the Gospel, he will not be able to point out one criterion or proof of his being so, but what he might discern in the Apostle Paul, and the rest of his fellow ministers."
3. "In which may be observed the great modesty of the apostle, who does not go about to disprove others being Christ's, who so confidently boasted of it; nor bid them look to it to see if they were or not, since all that say so are not; only as if granting that they were, he would have them look upon him, and his fellow apostles as such also, who had at least equal pretensions to this character."

### John Wesley:
