# 2 Corinthians 11:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This verse speaks about Paul's determination to remove any opportunity for his detractors to criticize him. He refuses financial support so that those who seek an occasion to discredit him will have no grounds to do so. This decision is driven by Paul's desire for equality, as he wants his opponents to be held to the same standards, boasting only in their genuine service rather than relying on false appearances. Ultimately, Paul's steadfast refusal challenges his adversaries to either emulate his selflessness or abandon their baseless claims.
