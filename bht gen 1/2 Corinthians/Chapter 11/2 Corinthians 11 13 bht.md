# 2 Corinthians 11:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse being described emphasizes the presence of false apostles who are deceitful and lack true apostolic authority. These individuals are described as transforming themselves into apostles of Christ, pretending to be genuine workers for the Lord while ultimately serving their own selfish interests. They manipulate and deceive others, hiding their true nature behind a façade of righteousness and zeal. Like harlots wearing the clothes of decent matrons, they construct a deceptive outward appearance that disguises their ulterior motives and lack of authenticity.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "such men are false Apostles... ψευδαπόστολοι" - The commentary highlights the emphasis on the fact that these individuals are not just false apostles, but specifically "ψευδαπόστολοι," or false apostles. This distinction underscores their deceitfulness and lack of authenticity.

2. "dishonest workmen... changing themselves into Apostles of Christ" - The commentary points out that these false apostles are not only deceptive, but they also actively try to appear as genuine apostles of Christ. They use their role as teachers of the Gospel to further their own agenda.

3. "By the abundance of my sufferings, and distinctions vouchsafed by the Lord, my Apostolicity will be fully proved" - The commentary highlights the Apostle's confidence in his own apostolic authority. He believes that his endurance of suffering and the blessings bestowed upon him by the Lord serve as evidence of his true apostleship, in contrast to the false apostles.
