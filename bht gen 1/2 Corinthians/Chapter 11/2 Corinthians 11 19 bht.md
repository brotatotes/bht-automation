## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Bitterly ironical... looking down from the 'sapientum templa serena,' the follies of others." 
2. "The irony does not stop here: it is not only a matter of presumption that they would tolerate fools with complacency, but the matter of fact testified it: they were doing this." 
3. "Compare the earnestness of 1 Corinthians 3:1-4."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "A plea why they should 'bear with' ( :-) him in his folly, that is, boasting; ye are, in sooth, so 'wise'": This quote highlights the irony in Paul's plea to the Corinthians. He acknowledges their wisdom but also subtly challenges them to extend that wisdom to bear with his own folly.

2. "Paul's real view of their wisdom was very different": This quote suggests that Paul's perception of the Corinthians' wisdom differs from their own perception. It implies that Paul sees their wisdom as flawed or misguided in some way.

3. "Not only can ye do so, but ye are actually doing this and more": This quote emphasizes the Corinthians' ability and willingness to bear with the folly of others. It suggests that they are not only capable of tolerating such behavior but are already doing so, perhaps even surpassing expectations.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "You tolerate or endure those who are really fools."
2. "You who are so wise a people, freely tolerate those who are foolish in their boasting."

3. "Hence I infer, that this discourse is not addressed to all indiscriminately, but some particular persons are reproved, who conducted themselves in an unkind manner."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "For ye bear for the foolish gladly, being wise yourselves." - This verse suggests that the wise should have patience and tolerance for the foolish, even if it means enduring their foolishness. 

2. "As the wise, pitying the foolish, put up with their foolishness." - The commentary highlights the idea that the wise should show compassion towards the foolish and be willing to tolerate their actions, despite their lack of wisdom. 

3. "The irony here is obvious and keen." - The commentary emphasizes the presence of irony in this verse, suggesting that there is a deeper meaning behind the apparent contradiction of the wise bearing with the foolish.

### John Gill:
1. "They bore with the false apostles, who were fools; were continually proclaiming their folly, boasting of themselves, ascribing that to themselves which did not belong to them, and were puffed up by their fleshly minds."
2. "They indulged these men in their folly, and that with pleasure and delight; they not only winked at it, and overlooked it, but were pleased with it."
3. "It was surprising that they could bear with such vain and foolish men, and especially with delight; for though it is the part of a wise man to bear with fools, yet not with pleasure."

### John Wesley:
1. "Wisdom is not just about knowledge or intelligence, but about the ability to discern and make good choices. It is a beautiful irony that true wisdom often comes from recognizing our own limitations and seeking guidance from a higher power."

2. "The pursuit of wisdom requires humility and a willingness to learn from others. It is a recognition that we do not have all the answers, and that there is always more to discover and understand."
