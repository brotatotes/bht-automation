### John Calvin:
1. "Paul had asked, why the Corinthians showed more respect to others than to him, while he had not been by any means weak, that is, contemptible."
2. "He now confirms this, because, if a comparison had been entered upon, he would not have been inferior to any one in any department of honor."

### John Gill:
1. "These words may be considered either as explanative of the latter part of the former verse, 'if a man smite you on the face'; that is not to be understood strictly and literally, of one man's striking another on the face, but of reproach and contumelious language, used by the false apostles to the Corinthians."
2. "The apostle's meaning is, that as to the business of scandal and reproach he was speaking of, this was not confined to the Corinthians only, but they the true apostles had their share of it."
3. "Which moved the apostle to exert himself, and boldly rise up in his own defence, saying, howbeit, wherein soever any is bold; to boast of his pedigree, character, office, and usefulness, I speak foolishly; as it might seem, and be so interpreted by some, I am bold also."
