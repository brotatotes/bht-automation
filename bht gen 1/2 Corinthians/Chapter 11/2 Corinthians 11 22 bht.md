## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The three honourable appellations with which the adversaries magnified themselves, resting on their Jewish extraction, are arranged so as to form a climax."
2. "Ἑβραῖοι refers to the nationality, Ἰσραηλῖται to the theocracy, and σπέρμα Ἀβρ to the claim to a part in the Messiah."
3. "The interrogative form of the sentence is much more lively and consistent with the spirit of the context than the affirmative."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
