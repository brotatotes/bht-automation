## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "The beating by Roman magistrates at Philippi is the only one recorded in Acts, which does not profess to give a complete journal of his life, but only a sketch of it in connection with the design of the book, namely, to give an outline of the history of the Gospel Church from its foundation at Jerusalem, to the period of its reaching Rome, the capital of the Gentile world." 
2. "Once was I stoned— (Acts 16:23- :)." 
3. "Thrice . . . shipwreck—before the shipwreck at Melita (Acts 16:23- :). Probably in some of his voyages from Tarsus, where he stayed for some time after his conversion, and from which, as being a seafaring place, he was likely to make missionary voyages to adjoining places (Acts 9:30; Acts 11:25; Galatians 1:21)." 
4. "A night and a day . . . in the deep—probably in part swimming or in an open boat."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Thrice was I beaten with rods... This was a frequent mode of punishment among the ancient nations, and as Paul was often persecuted, he would be naturally subjected to this shameful punishment."

2. "Once I was stoned... The instance referred to here occurred at Lystra; Acts 14:19. Paley (Horae Paulinae) has remarked that this, when confronted with the history, furnished the nearest approach to a contradiction without a contradiction being actually incurred, that he ever had met with."

3. "Thrice I suffered shipwreck... Paul made many voyages in going from Jerusalem to Tarsus, and to Antioch, and to various parts of Asia Minor, and to Cyprus; and shipwrecks in those seas were by no means such unusual occurrences as to render this account improbable."

2. "While the narrative contained in the Acts of the Apostles gives an account of only one instance in which Paul was actually stoned, there was, previously to that, 'an assault' made upon Paul and Barnabas at Iconium, 'both of the Gentiles, and also of the Jews, with their rulers, to use them despitefully, and to stone them, but they were ware of it, and fled unto Lystra and Derbe.'"
3. "Truth is necessarily consistent; but it is scarcely possible that independent accounts, not having truth to guide them, should thus advance to the very brink of contradiction without falling into it."
