"τίς σκανδ.] 'Non priore, sed hac versiculi parte addit ego: nam illic infirmo se accommodat: hic dissimilem se scandalizantis fatetur, partes a scandalizante neglectas scandalizati causa ipse suscipiens. Partes a scandalizante neglectæ sunt amor, prudentia, &c. Idem tamen Paulus etiam partes scandalizati, sive incommodum quod scandalizatus sentit, in se suscipit.' Bengel."
