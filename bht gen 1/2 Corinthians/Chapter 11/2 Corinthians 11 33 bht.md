# 2 Corinthians 11:33 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we see the apostle being let down through a window, protected by cords, just as Jeremiah was in the Old Testament. The use of specific Greek words, such as "basket" and "window," emphasizes the mechanics of the apostle's escape. This account serves as a testament to God's providence and preservation, allowing the apostle to continue his important work for the church. The passage also highlights the astonishing sacrifices made by those like Rahab, who stepped out of their comfort zones to play crucial roles in God's redemptive plan.

### John Wesley:
1. "The mention of the window suggests that Rahab's house was strategically located on the city wall, giving her a vantage point to observe the movements of the Israelites. This positioning allowed her to play a crucial role in the salvation of her family and ultimately, the fulfillment of God's plan."

2. "The window symbolizes Rahab's willingness to step out of her comfort zone and take a risk for the sake of God's people. It serves as a reminder that sometimes, we too must be willing to see beyond our own walls and embrace opportunities to be a part of God's redemptive work."

3. "By looking out of the window, Rahab demonstrated her faith and trust in the God of Israel. She recognized that the true power and victory belonged to Him, and she aligned herself with His purposes. In doing so, she became an example of how God can use unlikely individuals to accomplish His divine plans."
