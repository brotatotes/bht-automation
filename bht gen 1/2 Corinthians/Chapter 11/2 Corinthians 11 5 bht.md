# 2 Corinthians 11:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This Bible verse addresses a situation where false teachers were trying to undermine the authority of the apostle Paul. Commentaries highlight the irony in Paul referring to them as "the very chiefest apostles" and "super apostles." Despite these false claims, Paul asserts that he is not inferior to them in gifts, grace, and usefulness. The commentators emphasize Paul's confidence in his apostolic authority and position, as well as the arrogance and self-promotion of the false teachers. Their actions are seen as misguided, as they exalted themselves above Paul and the recognized apostles.
