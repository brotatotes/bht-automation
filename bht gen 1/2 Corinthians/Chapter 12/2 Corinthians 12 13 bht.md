## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Except that one point, in which of all others they had least reason to complain."
2. "This one is put forward to indicate their deep ingratitude, if they did complain, seeing that the only point of difference in their treatment had been a preference."
3. "The irony here reaches its height."

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "wherein you were inferior—that is, were treated with less consideration by me than were other churches."
2. "I myself—I made a gain of you neither myself, nor by those others whom I sent, Titus and others."
3. "wrong—His declining support from the Corinthians might be regarded as the denial to them of a privilege, and a mark of their spiritual inferiority, and of his looking on them with less confidence and love."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "I have given among you the most ample proof of my apostolic commission. I have conferred on you the highest favors of the apostolic office."
2. "There is a delicate insinuation that they had not contributed to his needs... and an admission that he was in part to blame for this."
3. "It is a privilege to contribute to the support of the gospel, and they who are permitted to do it should esteem themselves highly favored."

Note: The commentary provided is quite lengthy, so I had to condense it into three quotes that capture the main ideas.

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Except that I was not a burden." - This quote highlights the apostle Paul's defense against the accusation that he refused to receive payment for his ministry as a sign of weakness or lack of love for the Corinthians. It shows his humility and selflessness in not burdening the Corinthians financially.

2. "Alluding to the possible objection that his refusal to receive pay was a sign either of his want of power to exact it, or of his want of affection for them." - This quote explains the possible objections that Paul anticipated regarding his refusal to accept payment. It reveals his awareness of the potential misunderstandings and clarifies his motives.

3. "Forgive, etc. Ironical." - This quote suggests that Paul's statement of forgiveness towards the Corinthians for not providing financial support is ironic. It implies that he is subtly pointing out their lack of generosity and highlighting the contrast between his actions and their behavior.

### John Calvin:
1. "Here is an aggravation of their ingratitude — that he had been distinguished, that they might receive benefit — that they had derived advantage from the attestation furnished of his Apostleship, and had, notwithstanding, given their concurrence to the slanders of the false Apostles."
2. "He subjoins one exception — that he had not been burdensome to them; and this, by way of irony, for in reality this was over and above so many acts of kindness, which he had conferred upon them — that he had served them gratuitously."
3. "They were doubly ungrateful, inasmuch as they not only contemned the man, by whose acts of kindness they had been brought under obligation, but even turned his kind disposition into an occasion of reproach."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "For what is there wherein ye were made inferior to the rest of the churches, except that I myself was not a burden to you?" - This quote highlights the apostle Paul's humility and selflessness in not burdening the Corinthians with his needs, contrasting it with other churches that may have expected support.
