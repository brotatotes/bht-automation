## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "This journey of Titus cannot, of course, be the one spoken of ch. 2Co 8:6; 2 Corinthians 8:17; 2 Corinthians 8:22; 2 Corinthians 8:24; but some previous mission to them before this Epistle was written: probably that from which he returned with the report of their penitence to Paul in Macedonia, ch. 2 Corinthians 7:6 ff."
2. "τὸν ἀδελφόν perhaps, one of the two mentioned ch. 2 Corinthians 8:18; 2 Corinthians 8:22; some other, well known to the Corinthians, but absolutely unknown to us: but not, a brother, as in E. V. It is plain from this and from what follows, that this brother was quite subordinate to Titus in the mission."
3. "The Spirit in which they walked was the Holy Spirit: τῷ αὐτῷ πνευματικῷ χαρίσματι; χάρισμα γὰρ καλεῖ τὸ στενούμενον μὴ λαβεῖν."

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "I desired Titus—namely, to go unto you." 
2. "Not the mission mentioned 2 Corinthians 8:6; 2 Corinthians 8:17; 2 Corinthians 8:22; but a mission previous to this Epistle, probably that from which he had just returned announcing to Paul their penitence."
3. "a brother—rather 'OUR (literally, 'the') brother'; one well known to the Corinthians, and perhaps a Corinthian; probably one of the two mentioned in 2 Corinthians 8:18; 2 Corinthians 8:22."
4. "same spirit—inwardly."
5. "steps—outwardly."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Did Titus make a gain of you - They knew that he did not. They had received him kindly, treated him with affection, and sent him away with every proof of confidence and respect."
2. "Walked we not in the same spirit? - Did not all his actions resemble mine? Was there not the same proof of honesty, sincerity, and love which I have ever manifested?"
3. "Paul’s course of life when with them they admitted was free from guile and from any attempt to get money by improper means. He charged him only with attempting it by means of others."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Did Titus take advantage of you? (μητ επλεονεκτησεν υμας Τιτοσ?). That puts the issue squarely."
2. "By the same Spirit (τω αυτω πνευματ). That translation refers to the Holy Spirit and makes the case instrumental."
3. "The locative case, 'in the same spirit,' makes it mean that Paul's attitude is the same as that of Titus and most likely is correct."

### John Gill:
1. "Did Titus make a gain of you? Did he greedily desire your substance? Did he show an avaricious temper, or a covetous inclination after your money?" - The commentary questions whether Titus had selfish motives or took advantage of the Corinthians for personal gain.

2. "Walked we not in the same Spirit? In the same Spirit of God, being directed and influenced by him; or in the same disposition of mind, being agreed and determined to preach the Gospel freely, and receive nothing for it." - The commentary highlights the shared commitment of the apostle and his companions to preach the Gospel without seeking personal gain.

3. "Walked we not in the same steps? Took the same methods, lived the same course of life, working with their own hands to supply their wants, rather than be burdensome to others." - The commentary emphasizes the apostle's example of self-sufficiency and not being a burden to others, demonstrating a rejection of covetousness and a reliance on God's provision.

### John Wesley:
1. "The desire expressed here by Paul is not merely a casual wish or preference, but a deep longing and earnest request. It shows his genuine concern for the well-being of the recipients of his letter."
2. "This desire of Paul to send Titus to the readers of his letter highlights the importance of personal connection and relational ministry. It emphasizes the value of having someone present who can provide encouragement, guidance, and support in the midst of challenges."
3. "The desire to send Titus also demonstrates Paul's understanding of the power of personal presence in ministry. It recognizes that sometimes, written words alone may not suffice, and that face-to-face interaction can bring about a deeper level of understanding, trust, and impact."
