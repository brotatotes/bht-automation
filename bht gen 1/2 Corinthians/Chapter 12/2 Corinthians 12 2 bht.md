# 2 Corinthians 12:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the writer, humbly referred to as "this man," experiences a remarkable spiritual encounter. Caught up into the third heaven, he was in a state of ecstatic rapture, so profound that he was uncertain whether he was in his physical body or his spirit was detached. This revelation of divine mysteries was a rare and exalting occurrence, inspiring gratitude rather than boasting. The apostle's humility and contentment with the fact of this extraordinary encounter serve as a model for all theologians and believers alike, reminding us to seek necessary knowledge and leave the rest to God.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "ἄνθρ . ἐν χρ . = ‘a Christian,’ ‘a man whose standing is in Christ:’"
2. "if in the body, the idea would be that he was taken up bodily: if out of the body, to which the alternative manifestly inclines, that his spirit was rapt from the body, and taken up disembodied."
3. "to understand a high degree of celestial exaltation."

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Such glory belonged not to him, but the weakness did."
2. "His spiritual self was his highest and truest self: the flesh with its infirmity merely his temporary self."
3. "The occurrence TWICE of 'whether in the body . . . I know not, God knoweth,' and of 'lest I should be exalted above measure,' marks two stages in the revelation."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Those who have been most favored with spiritual enjoyments will not be the most ready to proclaim it. They will cherish the remembrance in order to excite gratitude in their own hearts and support them in trial; they will not emblazon it abroad as if they were more the favorites of heaven than others are."

2. "God often gives to his people some clear and elevated spiritual comforts before they enter into trials as well as while in them; he prepares them for them before they come."

3. "How happy would it be if all theologians were as ready to be satisfied with the knowledge of a fact, and to leave the mode of explaining it with God, as this prince of theologians was. Many a man would have busied himself with a vain speculation about the way in which it was done; Paul was contented with the fact that it had occurred."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The verb suits the swift, resistless, impetuous seizure of spiritual ecstasy."
2. "It is quite useless to attempt to explain this expression according to any scheme of celestial gradation."
3. "Some think that Paul describes two stages of his rapture; the first to the third heaven, from which he was borne, as if from a halting-point, up into Paradise."

### John Calvin:
1. "I should have preferred to be silent, I should have preferred to keep the whole matter suppressed within my own mind, but those persons will not allow me."
2. "He means, that God dealt with him in such a way, that he did not himself understand the manner of it."
3. "Let us learn from this, that we must seek the knowledge of those things only that are necessary to be known, and leave other things to God."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The date here given is not the date of the apostle’s knowledge of the man (as the Authorised Version implies), but of the rapture into the third heaven about to be related."
2. "The obvious answer is, that he could not bear extolling himself so nakedly as the use of the first person would express."
3. "The idea conveyed by this strong word certainly goes beyond that of mere ‘trance’ or ‘ecstasy,’ in which all ordinary consciousness is in abeyance."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Paul singles out one incident of ecstasy in his own experience that he declines to describe."
2. "The date was probably while Paul was at Tarsus."
3. "He seems to mean the highest heaven where God is."

### John Gill:
1. "The reason why he here speaks in the third [person], is to show his modesty and humility, and how much he declined vain glory and popular applause."
2. "Moreover, the full and certain knowledge he had of this man, of the place he was caught up to, and of the things he there heard, best agrees with him."
3. "The phrase 'in Christ'... denotes his being in Christ, and that either... in an ecstasy; and so here this man was in the Spirit of Christ, and transported by him to see visions, and have revelations; or rather it intends a spiritual being in Christ, union to him, the effect of which is communion with him."

### John Wesley:
1. "Whether in the body or out of the body I know not — It is equally possible with God to present distant things to the imagination in the body, as if the soul were absent from it, and present with them."
2. "But since the apostle himself did not know whether his soul was in the body, or whether one or both were actually in heaven, it would be vain curiosity for us to attempt determining it."
3. "The third heaven — Where God is; far above the aerial and the starry heaven."
