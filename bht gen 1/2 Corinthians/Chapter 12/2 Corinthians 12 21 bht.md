# 2 Corinthians 12:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In these commentaries, we see a common theme of the Corinthians' struggle with sexual immorality, particularly within the context of marriage. The commentators emphasize Paul's concern that upon his return, he would be confronted with the distressing sight of a disorderly and sinful church. The sinful behavior described goes against nature and undermines the principles of purity and fidelity that God has established. Thus, Paul's grief and humiliation are rooted in his deep caring for the spiritual well-being of the Corinthians and his desire for them to live in accordance with God's design for relationships.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The sentence loses much in force and, indeed, becomes inconsistent with the context, if with Lachmann (and Lücke, Conjectanea exeget. i. De W.) it be made interrogative (which it may be grammatically with either reading, ταπεινώσει or - σῃ), in which case the answer would be negative."
2. "The fut. (ref.) indicates an assumption that the supposed case will really be. That this humbling, and not that of being obliged to punish, is intended, seems evident: the exercise of judicial authority being no humiliation, but the contrary, and humiliation being the natural result of want of success."
3. "I believe he uses πολλοὺς τῶν προημαρτηκότων as a mild expression for τοὺς πολλοὺς τοὺς προημαρτηκότας, and that we must not therefore press too closely the enquiry as to what the genus οἱ προημ. is, of which the πολλοί are the species."

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "The faithful pastor is 'humbled' at, and 'bewails' the falls of his people, as though they were his own."
2. "The indicative implies that the supposition will actually be so."
3. "Uncleanness, for example, of married persons; fornication, among the unmarried."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The infliction of punishment on members of the church is a sort of punishment to him who inflicts it as well as to him who is punished."
2. "Members of the church should walk uprightly, lest they overwhelm the ministry in shame."
3. "If they continued in their sin until he came, it would be to him a source of deep lamentation."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Shall bewail [πενθησω]. Lament with a true pastor's sorrow over the sin."
2. "Many [πολλους]. With special reference to the unchaste."
3. "The perfect tense denotes the continuance of the sin. Heretofore probably refers to the time before his second visit."

### John Calvin:
1. "He does not, indeed, charge them all with this crime, but only a few, who had impudently despised all his admonitions."
2. "The meaning, then, is this: 'They think contemptuously of me, because I appear contemptible. Let them, then, give me no occasion of abasement.'"
3. "He lets us know the disposition of a true and genuine Pastor, when he says that he will look upon the sins of others with grief."

These quotes highlight the commentary's emphasis on the Corinthians' disrespect towards Paul and the importance of pastors empathizing with the sins and sorrows of their congregation.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "So bound up was his comfort in this and all his churches with their spiritual prosperity, that the prospect of finding the church which of all others lay most at his heart in the deplorable condition here described, sickened him at the thought of it, and held out to him only humiliation, in place of delight, in visiting them."
2. "I should mourn for many of them that have sinned heretofore falling back into those pollutions from which they had been delivered."
3. "Missionaries who have been the happy instruments of rescuing sensual heathens from such vices as these, but find to their grief the same tendency, after a time, to return upon them, can best enter into the apostle’s feelings as here expressed, and will be the best expositors of them."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Paul assumes it as true." 
2. "He means a public humiliation as his fear." 
3. "The conduct of the church had been a real humiliation."

### John Gill:
1. "Another thing which he feared would be the case when he came again to them, that he himself should be afflicted and distressed, seeing them in a disorderly and dissolute course of life, be obliged to punish them, which would be an humiliation and matter of grief to him."
2. "Instead of rejoicing in the fruit of his labours, that they were not in vain, he signifies that he should have great sorrow of heart."
3. "Nothing was more grieving, and occasioned more sorrow and humiliation to the apostle, than the unbecoming walk of professors; and nothing more sensibly affects a faithful minister of the Gospel."

### John Wesley:
1. "The sin that had been committed before Paul's arrival in Corinth was likely related to sexual immorality, specifically the uncleanness of married persons. This suggests that there were individuals in the Corinthian church who were engaging in illicit sexual relationships within the context of marriage." 

2. "The term 'lasciviousness' refers to a behavior that goes against nature. It implies a complete disregard for the natural order and boundaries established by God. In this context, it likely refers to acts of sexual immorality that were not only sinful but also unnatural."

3. "These quotes highlight the prevalence of sexual sin in the Corinthian church and the need for Paul's corrective teaching. It underscores the importance of maintaining sexual purity and adhering to God's design for relationships, both within and outside of marriage."
