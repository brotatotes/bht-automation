# 2 Corinthians 12:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, we are given a glimpse into a heavenly experience that is beyond human comprehension and impossible to put into words. The commentator's descriptions paint a picture of a divine realm known as paradise, where the blessed reside in a state of joy and rest. Though some heavenly words can be communicated, the unspeakable nature of these revelations indicates their extraordinary and incomprehensible nature. This encounter is a source of great consolation and strength for the apostle Paul, as he carries with him the anticipation of the glorious future that awaits him.

1. "unspeakable—not in themselves, otherwise Paul could not have heard them; but as the explanation states, 'which it is not lawful . . . to utter' [ALFORD]." 
2. "They were designed for Paul's own consolation, and not for communication to others." 
3. "Some heavenly words are communicable (Exodus 34:6; Isaiah 6:3). These were not so."

1. "The word 'paradise'...is applied to the abodes of the blessed after death, the dwelling-place of God and of happy spirits; or to heaven as a place of blessedness."
2. "Paul meant to say that he could not attempt by words to do justice to what he saw and heard."

1. "As every region that is peculiarly agreeable and delightful is called in the Scriptures the garden of God, it came from this to be customary among the Greeks to employ the term paradise to denote the heavenly glory."
2. "From this, too, we may gather a most useful admonition as to setting bounds to knowledge. We are naturally prone to curiosity. Hence, neglecting altogether, or tasting but slightly, and carelessly, doctrine that tends to edification, we are hurried on to frivolous questions."
3. "It becomes us so much the more to keep within bounds, so as not to seek to know any thing, but what the Lord has seen it good to reveal to his Church. Let this be the limit of our knowledge."

### John Wesley:
1. "He was caught up into paradise — The seat of happy spirits in their separate state, between death and the resurrection."
