# 2 Corinthians 12:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This verse speaks of a personal affliction, a thorn in the flesh, that caused the apostle Paul pain and shame. Commentators speculate whether this affliction was physical or spiritual, with opinions divided. It serves as a humbling reminder that even an esteemed apostle like Paul can be vulnerable to temptations and pride. Despite the difficulty, Paul sees the purpose of his affliction, acknowledging that it keeps him grounded and dependent on God. The affliction is likened to a messenger of Satan, constantly buffeting Paul's spirit.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The expression used Gal 4:14 of this same affliction, τὸν πειρασμὸν ὑμῶν ἐν τῇ σαρκί μου, seems decisive for rendering the dative thus, and not as a dativus incommodi."
2. "Even if we read σατᾶν, it can only be the genitive. If taken as the nom., the expression would mean either, a hostile angel, which would be contrary to the universal usage of Satan, as a proper name: or, the angel Satan, which is equally inconsistent with N. T. usage."
3. "On the whole, putting together the figure here used, that of a thorn, occasioning pain, and the κολαφισμός, buffeting or putting to shame, it seems quite necessary to infer that the Apostle alludes to some painful and tedious bodily malady, which at the same time put him to shame before those among whom he exercised his ministry."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "How dangerous must self-exaltation be, when even the apostle required so much restraint!" 
2. "It certainly was something personal, affecting him individually, and not as an apostle: causing at once acute pain and shame."
3. "After experiencing the state of the blissful angels, he is now exposed to the influence of an evil angel. The chastisement from hell follows soon upon the revelation from heaven."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "There is no danger that more constantly besets Christians, and even eminent Christians, than pride. There is no sin that is more subtile, insinuating, deceptive; none that lurks more constantly around the heart and that finds a more ready entrance, than pride."
2. "Paul had so clear a view of the benefits which resulted from it that he regarded it as a favor, as Christians should every trial."
3. "The general truth taught in this verse is, that God will take care that his people shall not be unduly exalted by the manifestations of his favor, and by the spiritual privileges which he bestows on them. He will take measures to humble them; and a large part of his dealings with his people is designed to accomplish this."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The figure is that of the impaling stake...The verb seems, therefore, to have been used interchangeably with crucify." 
2. "Opinions are divided, generally, between mental or spiritual and bodily trials." 
3. "Messenger and Satan are not to be taken in apposition - a messenger who was Satan - because Satan is never called aggelov in the New Testament."

### John Calvin:
1. "There was given to me a goad that my flesh might be spurred up by it, for I am not yet so spiritual, as not to be exposed to temptations according to the flesh."
2. "At every apprehension of temptation, it becomes us to arouse ourselves, and arm ourselves with promptitude for repelling Satan’s assaults."
3. "Let us carefully consider, who it is that here speaks — He had overcome so many dangers, tortures, and other evils — had triumphed over all the enemies of Christ — had driven away the fear of death — had, in fine, renounced the world; and yet he had not altogether subdued pride."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "What this 'thorn in the flesh' was has exercised expositors sorely, and every solution must be conjectural." 
2. "Beyond all doubt it was something physical, and something involving acute pain."
3. "The one thing about it which is certain is its galling, humiliating effect, to express which he calls it 'a messenger of Satan to buffet him.'"

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "By reason of the exceeding greatness (τη υπερβολη). Instrumental case, 'by the excess.'" 

2. "A thorn in the flesh (σκολοπς τη σαρκ). This old word is used for splinter, stake, thorn. In the papyri and inscriptions examples occur both for splinter and thorn as the meaning."

3. "Each of us has some such splinter or thorn in the flesh, perhaps several at once."

### John Gill:
1. "Pride is naturally in every man's heart; converted persons are not without it; knowledge, gifts, and revelations are apt to puff up with spiritual pride, unless counterbalanced and over poised by the grace of God."
2. "This sore exercise befell the apostle for his good, to keep down the pride of his nature."
3. "God was 'willing to try him' with a wall of iron, (this great difficulty) to see if there was any dross left in him."

### John Wesley:
1. "A thorn in the flesh - A visitation more painful than any thorn sticking in the flesh."
2. "A messenger or angel of Satan to buffet me - Perhaps both visibly and invisibly."
3. "St. Paul seems to have had a fresh fear of these buffetings every moment, when he so frequently represses himself in his boasting, though it was extorted from him by the utmost necessity."
