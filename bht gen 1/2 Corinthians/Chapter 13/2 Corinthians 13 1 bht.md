## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The Apostle wishes to impress on them the certainty of this coming, and to prepare them for it by solemn self-examination."
2. "I will not now, as before, be with you ἐν πάσῃ ὑπομονῇ as regards the offenders: but will come to a regular process, and establish the truth in a legal manner."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "This is the third time I am coming to you—not merely preparing to come to you."
2. "In the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every word be established."
3. "The apostle in this case, where ordinary testimony was to be had, does not look for an immediate revelation, nor does he order the culprits to be cast out of the church before his arrival."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It is evident that Paul had been to Corinth but once before this, but he had resolved to go before a second time, but had been disappointed." 
2. "Some suppose that Paul refers to his own epistles which he had sent to them as the two or three witnesses by which his promise to them would be made certain."
3. "But the more probable opinion, it seems to me, is that of Doddridge, Macknight, and others, that he anticipated that there would be a necessity for the administration of discipline there, but that he would feel himself under obligation in administering it to adhere to the reasonable maxim of the Jewish Law."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The great mass of modern expositors hold that Paul made three visits to Corinth, of the second of which there is no record." This quote highlights the belief among scholars that Paul visited Corinth three times, even though the second visit is not mentioned in the biblical record.

### John Calvin:
1. "For his discourse did not apply to the entire body of the Church, but to certain diseased and half-rotten members of it."
2. "He quotes the law as to the authority of witnesses; not in the natural and literal sense, but by accommodation, or similitude, applying it to his particular purpose."
3. "For the threefold effort that was made for their welfare, and perseverance, as made trial of on three different occasions, might, with good reason, be held equivalent to three persons."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "It is surprising that in face of so explicit a statement, repeated at 2 Corinthians 13:2, and of the one at 2 Corinthians 12:14, Paley (Hor. Paul. iv. 11) and other excellent critics should maintain that the apostle paid only two visits to Corinth."
2. "A judicial investigation of every charge, in such cases as referred to in 2 Corinthians 12:20-21, was to be held under his superintendence."
3. "The Jewish law in judicial cases was very strict, requiring at least two witnesses for the condemnation of any one (Numbers 35:30; Deuteronomy 17:6; Deuteronomy 19:15)."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
