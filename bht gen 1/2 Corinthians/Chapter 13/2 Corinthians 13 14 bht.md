# 2 Corinthians 13:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this rich and comprehensive benediction, we find the grace of Christ as the starting point, leading us to the love of God the Father. It is through the fellowship of the Holy Ghost that believers experience this divine love and grace. The grace of Christ serves as the foundation for all that He has accomplished, while the love of God is the wellspring of blessings. The Holy Spirit guides believers into communion with the Father and the Son, securing their redemption. This powerful Trinitarian formula showcases the distinct roles and unity of the three persons of the Godhead.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The grace of Christ" comes first, for it is only by it we come to "the love of God" the Father.
2. The variety in the order of Persons proves that "in this Trinity none is afore or after other."
3. Whoever has "the fellowship of the Holy Ghost," has also "the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ," and "the love of God"; and vice versa.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The 'love of God' here referred to is the manifestation of his goodness and favor in the pardon of sin, in the communication of his grace, in the comforts and consolations which he imparts to his people, in all that constitutes an expression of love." 
2. "The Holy Spirit is a person, or has a distinct personality. He is not an attribute of God, nor a mere divine influence. How could prayer be addressed to an attribute, or an influence?" 
3. "The passage, therefore, furnishes a proof of the doctrine of the Trinity that has not yet been answered, and, it is believed, cannot be."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The grace, etc. The most complete benediction of the Pauline epistles."
2. "In most of the epistles the introductory benedictions are confined to grace and peace."
3. "In the closing benedictions uniformly grace."

### John Calvin:
1. "The term grace does not here mean unmerited favor, but is taken by metonymy, to denote the whole benefit of redemption."
2. "For God, viewed in himself, loved us before the creation of the world, and redeemed us for no other reason than this — because he loved us."
3. "The fellowship of the Holy Spirit is added, because it is only under his guidance, that we come to possess Christ, and all his benefits."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Remarkable it is that an Epistle written under a tempest of conflicting emotions...is the one that closes with the richest and most comprehensive of all the benedictions in the New Testament." 
2. "Observe the characteristic features in the agency of each of the Persons in the Godhead as here assigned them." 
3. "From this subjective character of the Spirit’s agency in the economy of grace, it probably arises that the objective departments in that economy, which are assigned by Divine arrangement to the Father and the Son, have almost exclusive prominence in the statements of the New Testament."

### John Gill:
1. "The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ... is the ground and foundation of all he has done and underwent for his people."
2. "The love of God to his people... is the source and spring of all the blessings both of grace and glory."
3. "The communion of the Holy Ghost... leads the saints into fellowship with the Father and the Son, and seals them up unto the day of redemption."
