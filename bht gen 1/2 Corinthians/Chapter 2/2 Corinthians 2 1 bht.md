### Philip Schaff:
1. "But I determined this for myself, that I would not come again to you with sorrow." - This verse shows Paul's intention to spare the Corinthians from any further sorrow or disappointment. It highlights his consideration for their emotional well-being and the importance of maintaining a positive relationship with them.

2. "This is so plainly a continuance of his explanation of the delay of his expected visit to Corinth." - The commentary points out that this verse is a continuation of Paul's explanation for the delay in his visit to Corinth. It emphasizes the context of the verse and the significance of understanding the broader narrative.

3. "It is a pity a new chapter should in the recognised division have begun here." - The commentary expresses regret that the division of chapters in the Bible separates this verse from its immediate context. This highlights the importance of considering the flow of thought and continuity in the biblical text.

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "What does Paul mean by 'again' (παλιν)? Had he paid another visit besides that described in 2 Corinthians 2:18 which was in sorrow (εν λυπη)? Or does he mean that having had one joyful visit (that in 2 Corinthians 2:18) he does not wish the second one to be in sorrow?"

2. "Either interpretation is possible as the Greek stands and scholars disagree."

3. "There is absolutely no way to tell clearly whether Paul had already made a second visit. If he had done so, it is a bit odd that he did not plainly say so in 2 Corinthians 1:15 when he is apologizing for not having made the proposed visit ('a second benefit')."

### John Gill:
1. "He determined with himself, he took up a resolution within his own breast some time ago, says he, that I would not come again to you in heaviness."
2. "He determined to wait their repentance and amendment before he came again."

1. "In grief" - The phrase "in grief" indicates that the speaker is experiencing deep sorrow or distress. This suggests that the offense being referred to is significant and has caused emotional pain.

2. "Either on account of the particular offender" - This quote suggests that the grief could be specifically directed towards an individual who has committed an offense. It implies that the speaker's sorrow is a result of the actions or behavior of this person.

3. "Or of the church in general" - This quote expands the scope of the grief to include the entire church community. It implies that the offense has had a broader impact and has caused collective sorrow among the members of the church.
