# 2 Corinthians 2:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we find the apostle Paul in Troas, where there was a great opportunity for preaching the Gospel and a door of Christian usefulness was opened. However, despite the favorable circumstances, Paul's heart was burdened with deep concern for the Corinthians. His attachment to them was so strong that even when presented with a chance for great success, he could not find rest until he learned about their welfare. Paul's primary focus was on the spiritual well-being and growth of the Corinthians, prioritizing their needs above his own comfort or personal success in ministry.
