1. "the one class, already 'dead in trespasses and sins,' sinking deeper, and approaching nearer, by every successive resistance of the truth, to 'the second death;'"

These preach up salvation by the death of Christ, and so are the sweet savour of the death of Christ; but this being despised and rejected by the sons of men, is 'unto the death', and issues in the eternal death of the despisers and rejecters of it."
2. "Likewise this doctrine preached by them, strikes with death all a man's wisdom, righteousness, and holiness, and declares that life and salvation are only by Christ and his righteousness; and besides, is attended with persecution and death, and therefore is foolishness to them that perish; and so becomes 'the savour of death unto death'."
3. "The Gospel preached by Christ's faithful ministers is the means of quickening souls, and giving them 'spiritual life'; and of supporting and maintaining that life, and of nourishing them up unto 'eternal life'; and so becomes 'the savour of life' spiritual, 'unto life' eternal."
