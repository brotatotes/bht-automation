# 2 Corinthians 2:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the author expresses his deep concern for the Corinthians.

His desire is for their sorrows to be lifted, so that he may also find comfort and delight in being among them. This passage illuminates the interconnectedness of emotions and the transformative power of addressing and resolving pain within a community.

2. "καί prefixed to a question denotes inconsequence on, or inconsistency with, the foregoing supposition or affirmation: so Eur. Med. 1388, ὦ τέκνα φίλτατα! 'μητρί γε, σοὶ δʼ οὔ.' κἄπειτʼ ἔκτας? see other examples in Hartung, Partikellehre, i. p. 147. It is best expressed in English by 'then:' who is he then, &c. as in E. V."
3. "The explanation of Chrys., who has been followed by Erasm., Bengel, Olsh., al., is curious, and certainly inconsistent with the context: εἰ καὶ λυπῶ ὑμᾶς, χάριν μοι παρέχετε κἀν τούτῳ μεγίστην, ὅτι δάκνεσθε ὑπὸ τῶν παρʼ ἐμοῦ λεγομένων. Hom. iv. p. 456."

### John Calvin:
1. "No one willingly occasions sorrow to himself... Paul says, that he has such a fellow-feeling with the Corinthians, that he cannot feel joyful, unless he sees them happy."
2. "If this disposition prevail in pastors, it will be the best restraint, to keep them back from alarming with terrors those minds, which they ought rather to have encouraged by means of a cheerful affability."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "For if I make you sorry 'as I knew my First Letter would,' who is he that maketh me glad 'by the happy effect which I hoped the sharpness of that Letter would produce, and now I find has produced,' but he that is made sorry by me?" - This quote highlights Paul's intention behind his previous letter to the Corinthians, which was to bring about repentance and ultimately joy for both him and the Corinthians.

2. "The use of the singular number 'he,' in place of 'they' here, is an evident allusion to the incestuous person, whom he had required the church at Corinth solemnly to excommunicate (1 Corinthians 5:1, etc.), but now it would appear thoroughly penitent." - This quote explains the significance of the singular pronoun "he" in referring to the individual who caused sorrow but has now repented. It suggests that the person Paul previously called for excommunication has now shown genuine remorse.

3. "Present active participle of old word from ευ, well, and φρην, mind, to make joyful, causative idea like λυπεω."

### John Gill:
1. "Should they be grieved, he should grieve also; they were the only persons he could take any delight in at Corinth."
