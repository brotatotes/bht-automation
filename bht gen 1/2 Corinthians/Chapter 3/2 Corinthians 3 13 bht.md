# 2 Corinthians 3:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse describes Moses placing a veil over his face after speaking with God, not because the Israelites were afraid to witness his radiant countenance, but to prevent them from seeing the fading glory. This veil symbolizes concealment and transitoriness, interrupting the revelation and pointing to the ultimate termination of Moses' ministry. The veil serves as an emblem of the Gospel being veiled under the law, highlighting the darkness and obscurity of the law in matters of salvation. The verse also emphasizes the blindness of the unbelieving Jews to the end of the law and the glory of the Gospel.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "He spoke to them without the vail, with his face shining and glorified: when he had done speaking, he placed the vail on his face: and that, not because they were afraid to look on him, but as here, that they might not look on the end, or the fading, of that transitory glory; that they might only see it as long as it was the credential of his ministry, and then it might be withdrawn from their eyes."
2. "The opposition is twofold: (1) between the vailed and the unvailed ministry, quoad the mere fact of concealment in the one case, and openness in the other: (2) between the ministry which was suspended by the vailing, that its τέλος might not be seen, and that which proceeds ἀπὸ δόξης εἰς δόξαν, having no termination."
3. "The vail was the symbol of concealment and transitoriness: the part revealed they might see: beyond that, they could not: the ministry was a broken, interrupted one; its end was wrapped in obscurity."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The veil was the symbol of concealment, put on directly after Moses' speaking; so that God's revelations by him were interrupted by intervals of concealment."
2. "Paul here passes from the literal fact to the truth symbolized by it, the blindness of Jews and Judaizers to the ultimate end of the law."
3. "The veil which has been taken off to the believer is left on to the unbelieving Jew, so that he should not see."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Our conduct is not like that of Moses. We make no attempt to conceal anything in regard to the nature, design, and duration of the gospel. We leave nothing designedly in mystery." 
2. "He put off this veil whenever he went to speak with God, but put on again when he delivered his commands to the people...Moses has not himself declared [the design of the veil]."
3. "There was a splendor and luster in the face of Moses, which they could not gaze upon, and therefore he put a veil over it to diminish its intense brightness. In like manner there was a glory and splendor in the ultimate design and scope of his institutions, in that to which they referred, which they were not then 'able,' that is, prepared to look on, and the exceeding brightness of which he of design concealed."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The true sense of the Hebrew is given by the Sept. : 'When he ceased speaking he put a veil on his face;' not because the Israelites could not endure the radiance, but that they should not see it fade away."
2. "The end of this, which the veil prevented the Israelites from seeing, was the disappearance of the glory - the type of the termination of Moses ' ministry."
3. "Paul 's comparison is between the ministry of Moses, interrupted by intervals of concealment, and the gospel ministry, which is marked by frank and full proclamation."

### John Calvin:
1. "Paul is not reasoning as to the intention of Moses... he did not intentionally involve his doctrine in obscurity, but that the fault was on the part of the people."
2. "Nothing, therefore, is said here to the dishonor of Moses, for he was not required to do more than the commission, that was assigned to him, called for."
3. "That bluntness, or that weak and obtuse vision, of which Paul is now speaking, is confined to unbelievers exclusively, because the law though wrapped up in figures, did nevertheless impart wisdom to babes."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Moses, seeing they were afraid to come near him on account of his radiant countenance, veiled it while speaking to them." 
2. "Bright as was the glory of Moses' economy, like that of his countenance when he came forth from having this disclosed to him from the excellent glory, and transitory as it was like the glory of his own countenance yet it was too bright for their gaze." 
3. "To them it behoved to be a veiled economy, like the veiled face of the lawgiver while giving it forth to them."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Put a veil upon his face" - This action of covering Moses' face with a veil is significant and carries deeper meaning. It symbolizes the temporary nature of the glory that shone from his face, as well as the veiling of God's full revelation to the people. 

2. "That the children of Israel should not look steadfastly" - The purpose of veiling Moses' face was to prevent the Israelites from gazing directly at the glory. This highlights the holiness and overwhelming nature of God's presence, which required a mediated and limited experience for the people.

3. "The Authorized Version had a wrong translation here" - This commentary points out an error in the translation of the verse. It emphasizes the importance of accurate interpretation and understanding of the biblical text to grasp its true meaning and implications.

### John Gill:
1. "The veil upon his face had a mystery in it; it was an emblem of the Gospel being veiled under the law, and of the darkness and obscurity of the law in the business of life and salvation."
2. "The future blindness of the Jews, when the glory of the Gospel should break forth in the times of Christ and his apostles."
3. "To him they could not look, nor could they see him to be the fulfilling end of the law for righteousness; which being fulfilled, is done away by him."

### John Wesley:
1. "We do not act as Moses did, who put a veil over his face." 
2. "The children of Israel could not look steadfastly to the end of that dispensation which is now abolished."
3. "The whole Mosaic dispensation tended to, and terminated in, him; but the Israelites had only a dim, wavering sight of him."
