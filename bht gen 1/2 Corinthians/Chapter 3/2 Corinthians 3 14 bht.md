# 2 Corinthians 3:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The commentators shed light on a Bible verse that speaks about a veil. The verse describes how the understanding of the Jews, who read the Old Testament, is veiled. Their hearts and minds are blinded, preventing them from perceiving the truth and glory of the Gospel. This veil remains unremoved, symbolizing their spiritual darkness and ignorance. However, in Christ, this veil is done away with, removing the blindness and allowing believers to comprehend the hidden truths within the Scriptures.
