# 2 Corinthians 3:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Bible verse being described speaks of the Lord as the Spirit and the embodiment of the Old Testament. Christ gives life and understanding to the Scriptures, freeing us from bondage and allowing us to serve God with the spirit of sonship. Through Christ, we have access to liberty and the opportunity to behold the glory of the Lord without fear or veils. This liberty is not an excuse for sin, but a freedom from its power.
