# 2 Corinthians 3:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, believers are compared to Moses who veiled his face after seeing the glory of God. Unlike Moses and the Jews with veiled hearts, believers can look upon the Gospel with unveiled faces. Through the Gospel, they can behold the glory of God and be transformed into the image of Christ. This transformation is a progression, a continuous process of becoming more like Christ in love and character. By beholding the glory of the Lord in the mirror of the gospel, believers are changed into the same image, reflecting His love to the world.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The gospel is this mirror, the εὐαγγέλιον  τῆς δόξης τοῦ χριστοῦ, and we, looking on it with unvailed face, are the contrast to the Jews, with vailed hearts reading their law."
2. "The change here spoken of is a spiritual one, not the bodily change at the Resurrection: it is going on here in the process of sanctification."
3. "The transformation is effected by the Spirit, the Author and Upholder of spiritual life, who ‘takes of the things of Christ, and shows them to us,’ John 16:14, see also Romans 8:10-11, who sanctifies us till we are holy as Christ is holy."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "with unveiled face" (the veil being removed at conversion): contrasted with "hid" (2 Corinthians 4:1- :).
2. "the image of Christ's glory, spiritually now (Romans 8:29; 1 John 3:3); an earnest of the bodily change hereafter (1 John 3:3- :)."
3. "from one degree of glory to another. As Moses' face caught a reflection of God's glory from being in His presence, so believers are changed into His image by beholding Him."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The gospel reflected the glory of the Lord; it was, so to speak, the mirror - the polished, burnished substance in which the glory of the Lord shone, and where that glory was irradiated and reflected so that it might be seen by Christians."
2. "Christians, by looking on the gospel, could see the glorious perfections and plans of God as bright, and clear, and brilliant as they could see a light reflected from the burnished surface of the mirror."
3. "By contemplating the resplendent face of the blessed Redeemer, we are changed into something of the same image."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "But He their aching gaze repress'd, Which sought behind the veil to see, For not without us fully bless'd Or perfect might they be."

2. "But we as in a glass espy The glory of His countenance, Not in a whirlwind hurrying by The too presumptuous glance, But with mild radiance every hour From our dear Savior's face benign Bent on us with transforming power, Till we, too faintly shine."

3. "When Moses beheld Jehovah's glory, his own face reflected that glory. The mirror is the Gospel, which is called the Gospel of the glory of Christ."

These quotes highlight the idea that the people's understanding of God's glory was limited until the unveiling of Christ. Through the Gospel, believers can now behold and reflect the glory of God, being transformed into His image by the Spirit of the Lord.

### John Calvin:
1. "We have no occasion to fear obscurity, when we approach the gospel, for God there clearly discovers to us His face."
2. "It is not befitting that our contemplation of the gospel should be dead, but that we should be transformed by it into the image of God."
3. "The design of the gospel is this — that the image of God, which had been effaced by sin, may be stamped anew upon us, and that the advancement of this restoration may be continually going forward in us during our whole life."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Moses’ face was veiled, but ours is unveiled. And as Moses was in this but the visible expression of the economy he represented, and of all under it, so the 'we' here are all who, believing, see this veil 'done away in Christ.'" 
2. "The allusion plainly is to Moses, whose face, beholding without a veil the glory of Jehovah, shone with such brightness that the people were afraid to come near him, and he had to veil himself when he spoke to them. He 'mirrored' the glory which he beheld; he was 'transformed' into it."
3. "We who believe, beholding with unveiled face the glory of Christ 'in whom it hath pleased the Father that all fulness should dwell, and in whom dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily' mirror forth that glory; we are transformed into His image, not, however, all at once: it proceeds from stage to stage; the assimilation is a progressive one, until the transformation is complete."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Unlike and like Moses." 
2. "The point that Paul is making is that we shall not lose the glory as Moses did."
3. "It is the word used for heathen mythological metamorphoses."

### John Gill:
1. "We are not like Moses, who had a veil on his face; nor like the Jews, who have one on their hearts: 'but we all'; not ministers and preachers of the Gospel only, but all believers, whether Jews or Gentiles, greater or lesser believers, who are enlightened by the Spirit of God, and are converted to Christ."
2. "The object beheld is the glory of the Lord; Jesus Christ: not the glory of his human nature, but rather the glory of his divine nature, which is essential and underived, the same with his Father's."
3. "Whilst this delightful object is beheld by them, they are changed into the same image; there was a divine image in man, in his first creation; this image was defaced by sin, and a different one took place; now in regeneration another distinct from them both is stamped, and this is the image of Christ."

### John Wesley:
1. "All we that believe in him, beholding as in a glass - In the mirror of the gospel."
2. "The glory of the Lord — His glorious love."
3. "Are transformed into the same image — Into the same love."
