# 2 Corinthians 3:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, Paul describes the Corinthians as a letter or epistle of Christ. Commentators emphasize that Christ is the author, recommender, and main subject of this letter. The significance of this letter lies in its clarity and undeniable connection to Christ. It is not written with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God, demonstrating the spiritual power behind its message. This contrasts with the old covenant, represented by the law written on stone tablets, as the new covenant is written on the hearts of believers, symbolizing the transformative work of God in their lives.
