# 2 Corinthians 3:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse being described is a powerful declaration about the new covenant found in the gospel. It contrasts the old law with the Spirit-filled ministry of the gospel. The commentators emphasize that ministers of the gospel are not sufficient in their own abilities, but rather their sufficiency is from God alone. The gospel is described as the new covenant, bringing spiritual life and salvation. It is the Spirit of the gospel that gives life, not the letter of the law.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The new Covenant, i.e. the gospel, as distinguished from the law."
2. "Ministers, not of letter, but of Spirit."
3. "The Spirit of the gospel, i.e. God’s Holy Spirit, giveth life."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Ministers not of the mere literal precept, in which the old law, as then understood, consisted; 'but of the Spirit,' that is, the spiritual holiness which lay under the old law, and which the new covenant brings to light."
2. "No piety of spirit could exempt a man from the yoke of the letter of each legal ordinance under the Old Testament; for God had appointed this as the way in which He chose a devout Jew to express his state of mind towards God. Christianity, on the other hand, makes the spirit of our outward observances everything, and the letter a secondary consideration."
3. "No literal precepts could fully comprehend the wide range of holiness which LOVE, the work of the Holy Spirit, under the Gospel, suggests to the believer's heart instinctively from the word understood in its deep spirituality."
4. "The spirit of the Gospel when brought home to the heart by the Holy Spirit, gives new spiritual life to a man. This 'spirit of life' is for us in Christ Jesus, who dwells in the believer as a 'quickening' or 'life-giving Spirit'."
5. "True spirituality rests on the whole written word, applied to the soul by the Holy Spirit as the only infallible interpreter of its far-reaching spirituality. The letter is nothing without the spirit, in a subject essentially spiritual. The spirit is nothing without the letter, in a record substantially historical."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "God had made him sufficient: not able, talented, learned, but sufficient... he has sufficienced us for this work."
2. "They were appointed to go forth and make the provisions of that new covenant known to a dying world."
3. "The spirit here seems to refer to the New Testament, or the new dispensation in contradistinction from the old... It comes not to condemn, but to save."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The correct sense is given by Rev., hath made us sufficient as ministers." 
2. "Of a new covenant, in contrast with the Mosaic." 
3. "Here used of the mere formal, written ordinance as contrasted with the Gospel, which is 'spirit and life.'"

### John Calvin:
1. "He had acknowledged himself to be altogether useless. Now he declares, that, by the grace of God, he has been qualified for an office, for which he was previously unqualified."
2. "There is, at the same time, no doubt, that he indirectly exposes the poverty of those, who boasted in lofty terms of their endowments, while they were not furnished with so much as a single drop of heavenly grace."
3. "For by the term letter he means outward preaching, of such a kind as does not reach the heart; and, on the other hand, by spirit he means living doctrine, of such a nature as worketh effectually on the minds of men, through the grace of the Spirit."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Our fitness is from God, who also fitted us to be ministers." 
2. "The expression 'able ministers' in the Authorised Version is now unsuitable from its ambiguity." 
3. "The Gospel is instinct with quickening power, 'is spirit and life,' for the letter killeth."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Late causative verb from ικανος (verse 2 Corinthians 3:5) first aorist active indicative, 'who (God) rendered us fit.'"
2. "For διαθηκη see on Matthew 26:28 and for διακονος on Matthew 20:26 and for καινης (fresh and effective) on Luke 5:38."
3. "Only God can make us that."

### John Gill:
1. "Our sufficiency is of God, he hath made us able, or sufficient ministers: such ministers as are not of men's, but God's making, are sufficient ones; and none are sufficient but whom God makes so."
2. "The Gospel, and the ministry of it, is nothing else but an exhibition of the covenant of grace, its blessings and promises; and the work and business of those who are ministers of it is not to insist upon the covenant of works, but to open and explain the nature, promises, and blessings of the covenant of grace."
3. "The law is 'the letter', not merely because written in letters, but because it is a mere letter, showing what is to be done or avoided, without any efficacy in it. The Gospel is 'the spirit'; it contains spiritual blessings and promises, penetrates into the spirit and soul of man, and comes from, and is attended with the Spirit of God."


### John Wesley:
1. "Not of the law, fitly called the letter, from God's literally writing it on the two tables."
2. "But of the Spirit — Of the gospel dispensation, which is written on the tables of our hearts by the Spirit."
3. "But the Spirit — The gospel, conveying the Spirit to those who receive it. Giveth life — Both spiritual and eternal."
