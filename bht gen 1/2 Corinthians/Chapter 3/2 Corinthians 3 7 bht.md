# 2 Corinthians 3:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse under discussion describes the contrast between the Mosaic law and the gospel. Commentators highlight the significance of the law, which was written and engraved on stones, as a symbol of God's righteous claims and commandments. However, they stress that the law, though glorious, ultimately leads to death and condemnation. The radiant appearance of Moses' face after receiving the law serves as a temporary sign of the law's fleeting nature. The commentary also suggests that those who reject the gospel and cling to the law as a means of salvation experience it as a "ministration of death."

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The ministration is the whole putting forth of the dispensation, the purport of which was summed up in the decalogue, written on stones."
2. "The face of Moses, on account of the glory of his face, which was transitory."
3. "The Spirit is the principle of life, whereas the Law only led to death."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The ministration of death, written and engraven in stones, alludes to the literal precepts of the law as only bringing us the knowledge of sin and 'death,' in contrast to 'the Spirit' in the Gospel bringing us 'life.'"
2. "The opposition between 'the letters' and 'the Spirit' confirms this."
3. "The 'glory of Moses' countenance' on Sinai passed away when the occasion was over: a type of the transitory character of the dispensation which he represented, as contrasted with the permanency of the Christian dispensation."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The phrase 'ministration of death' refers to the Mosaic institutions...The expression 'a ministration - written and engraved on stone,' is somewhat harsh; but the sense evidently is, the ministration of a covenant, or of laws written on stones." 
2. "The ministry of the gospel is more glorious than even the ministry of Moses...It is called the 'ministration of death,' because it tended to condemnation; it did not speak of pardon; it was suited only to deepen the sense of sin, and to produce alarm and dread."
3. "The splendor of that scene was transitory...Neither the wonderful scenes accompanying the giving of the Law on Sinai, nor the shining on the countenance of Moses, was designed to abide. The thunders of Sinai would cease to roll; the lightenings to play; the visible manifestations of the presence of God would all be gone."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The law meant death to the sinner."
2. "The ministration of death is that of Moses, and does not apply to his entire career as Israel's lawgiver, but to his particular ministry in receiving on Sinai and transmitting to the people the law of God."
3. "A glory passed from God to Moses, so that his face became shining."

### John Calvin:
1. "The law was rendered illustrious by many miracles. Paul, however, touches here upon one of them merely â€” that the face of Moses shone with such splendor as dazzled the eyes of all. That splendour was a token of the glory of the law." 

2. "The gospel, therefore, is a holy and inviolable covenant, because it was contracted by the Spirit of God, acting as security. From this, too, it follows, that the law was the ministry of condemnation and of death; for when men are instructed as to their duty, and hear it declared, that all who do not render satisfaction to the justice of God are cursed, they are convicted, as under sentence of sin and death."

3. "The office of the law is to show us the disease, in such a way as to show us, at the same time, no hope of cure: the office of the gospel is, to bring a remedy to those that were past hope."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The ministration of death that of the law, which by reason of our inability to keep it, becomes to us a ministration of death." 
2. "The glory of the law was expressive of the righteous claims of Jehovah on His reasonable creatures."
3. "The glory of Moses' face was passing away, expressive only of what was transitory."

### John Gill:
1. "The law, as delivered to Moses on Mount Sinai, is clear from its being said to be written and engraven in stones; as that was by the finger of God himself."
2. "The law was not only written, but 'engraved'; for so it is said, that the writing was graven upon the tables."
3. "This law, though thus written and engraven, and glorious, it was 'the ministration of death'; and is so called, because it threatened and punished the transgressors of it with a corporeal death."

### John Wesley:
