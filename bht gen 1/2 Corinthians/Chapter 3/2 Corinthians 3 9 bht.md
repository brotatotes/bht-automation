# 2 Corinthians 3:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse being described emphasizes the contrast between the ministration of condemnation found in the law and the ministration of righteousness brought by the Gospel. The law, as expressed in the Old Testament, reveals sin and brings about condemnation, unable to save or justify. In contrast, the Gospel offers the righteousness of Christ, which justifies and saves believers from sin and condemnation. By imparting righteousness, the Gospel surpasses the glory of the law, offering a means of reconciliation and hope for believers.
