2. "The lightness of affliction contrasts beautifully with the 'weight of the glory.'"
3. "The glory exceeds beyond all measure the affliction."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The trials which Paul endured, to many persons would have seemed to be anything else but light. Yet these trials, though continued through many years, and constituting, as it were, his very life, he speaks of as the lightest conceivable thing when compared with that eternal glory which awaited him."
2. "His object is to contrast this with the glory that awaited him, as being heavy, and as being also eternal."

2. "An expression after the form of Hebrew superlatives, in which the emphatic word is twice repeated."

### John Calvin:
1. "The afflictions and vexations of the pious have little or nothing of bitterness, if compared with the boundless blessings of everlasting glory."
2. "Paul, therefore, prescribes the best antidote against your sinking down under the pressure of afflictions, when he places in opposition to them that future blessedness which is laid up for thee in heaven."
3. "We do not deny that afflictions are the path by which the heavenly kingdom is arrived at, but we deny that by afflictions we merit the inheritance, which comes to us in no other way than through means of Godâ€™s gracious adoption."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Did we look upon our troubles in the light of 'things seen and temporal,' they would seem not 'light,' but heavy indeed."
2. "Looking on them, as we do, in the light of 'the things that are unseen and eternal,' their character is entirely changed, and instead of heavy, they seem to be 'light.'"
3. "But is not this the experience of every one who has been 'renewed in the spirit of his mind,' in whom 'old things have passed away, and all things have become new'?"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Our light affliction which is for the moment" - This phrase emphasizes the temporary nature of the affliction, suggesting that it is not permanent or enduring.

2. "More and more exceedingly" - This expression conveys the idea of an increasing intensity or magnitude of affliction, highlighting the overwhelming nature of the challenges faced.

3. "Eternal weight of glory" - This phrase juxtaposes the temporary and light affliction with the eternal and weighty glory that awaits, emphasizing the ultimate reward and significance of enduring through hardships.

### John Gill:
1. "The present state is a state of 'affliction'. Affliction is the common lot of the children of men, but more especially of the children of God."
2. "Their affliction is represented as 'light' which though it is not in itself, but often very grievous and heavy to be borne, especially when any soul trouble is added to it; yet is light, when the saint is supported by the arm of the Lord, indulged with his presence, and favoured with the discoveries of his love."
3. "Now afflictions may be said to work eternal glory for the saints, not by way of merit, for they are not worthy to be compared with the glory to be revealed; there is no proportion between them; besides, the heavenly kingdom and glory was prepared from the foundation of the world, and is a free grace gift of their heavenly Father; but they work as means of enjoying it, as the word and ordinances do."

### John Wesley:
1. "The beauty and sublimity of St. Paul's expressions here, as descriptive of heavenly glory, surpass all imagination."
2. "Opposed to temporal afflictions."
3. "Cannot be preserved in any translation or paraphrase, which after all must sink infinitely below the astonishing original."
