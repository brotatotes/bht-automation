3. "There is a class of people who may be called, even now, 'the lost.' They are lost to virtue, to piety, to happiness, to hope."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The word 'veiled' suggests that the true meaning of the verse is not immediately apparent, and requires deeper understanding and interpretation."

### John Calvin:
1. "The blindness of unbelievers detracts nothing from the clearness of his gospel; for the sun is not less resplendent, that the blind do not perceive his light."
2. "When Christ is included in the law, the sun shines forth through the midst of the clouds, so that men have light enough for their use; but when Christ is disjoined from it, there is nothing left but darkness, or a false appearance of light, that dazzles men’s eyes instead of assisting them."
3. "It is befitting, however, that all that would be looked upon as ministers of God’s word should be endued with the like confidence, that with a fearless confidence they may unhesitatingly summon all the adversaries of their doctrine to the judgment-seat of God, that they may bring thence a sure condemnation."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The verse suggests that the truth of the gospel is hidden from those who are perishing, implying that it requires a spiritual discernment to understand its message."
2. "The use of the word 'veiled' emphasizes the idea that the truth is obscured or concealed, indicating that it is not readily apparent to those who are perishing."
3. "The commentary highlights the importance of recognizing the spiritual condition of those who are perishing, as their lack of understanding is a result of their spiritual state."

### John Gill:
1. "If our Gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost." - The Gospel may be clear and perspicuous, but it can be hidden to those who are spiritually blind and lost in their sin.

2. "It was hid in God from the beginning of the world... but now God has made known the mystery of his will." - The Gospel was once hidden, but through Christ and the preaching of the Gospel, God has revealed His will to all.

3. "The Gospel is preached to Jews and Gentiles; so that it is hid to none, as to the outward ministration of it." - The Gospel is not hidden in terms of its outward proclamation, as it is preached to both Jews and Gentiles.

4. "They are such, who are left to the native blindness of their minds... and are under the influence of the prince of darkness." - Those who are lost and blinded by sin are unable to see and understand the Gospel, as they are under the influence of Satan.

5. "Such instances are no more an objection to the clearness and perspicuity of the Gospel... than men born blind... are to the bright and clear shining of the sun." - The fact that some do not understand the Gospel does not negate its clarity; it is like expecting a blind person to see the brightness of the sun.

### John Wesley:
