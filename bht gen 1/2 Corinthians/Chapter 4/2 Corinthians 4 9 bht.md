# 2 Corinthians 4:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the face of persecution and pursuit, Jesus suffered beyond measure, forsaken by both people and God. But in these trials, God's promise of never leaving nor forsaking His people was fulfilled. Though struck down and smitten by enemies, they were not destroyed or left to the powers of their oppressors. Surmounting every difficulty, their faith in God remained unshaken, for they knew they were kept by His power even in the midst of trials.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Jesus was forsaken by both; so much do His sufferings exceed those of His people."
2. "Not only 'persecuted,' but actually struck down as with a dart in the chase."
3. "The Greek 'always' in this verse means, 'throughout the whole time'; in 1 Samuel 26:20- : the Greek is different, and means, 'at every time,' 'in every case when the occasion occurs.'"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Though persecuted by people, yet they experienced the fulfillment of the divine promise that he would never leave nor forsake them."
2. "God always interposed to aid them; always saved them from the power of their enemies; always sustained them in the time of persecution."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Persecuted, pursued, the primary meaning of the verb, thus giving vividness to the figure."
2. "Forsaken, lit., left behind in (some evil plight). The figure is, pursued by enemies, but not left to their power: left in the lurch."
3. "Though the pursuers overtake and smite down, yet are we not killed. Rev., smitten down. In all these paradoxes the A. V. fails to bring out the metaphors."

3. "Destroyed (απολλυμενο). Perishing as in verse 2 Corinthians 4:3."
