# 2 Corinthians 5:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Bible verse being described is a passage about the transient nature of our physical bodies. The commentators emphasize that our bodies are like tents or tabernacles, temporary dwellings that are subject to decay and eventual dissolution. They contrast this with the promise of a heavenly building or house that believers will receive from God, an eternal and permanent dwelling that surpasses the limitations of our earthly existence. The verse encourages believers to set their minds on this future hope and to find comfort in the assurance that their true home is not of this world.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The whole passage is expressed through the double figure of a house or tent, and a garment. The explanation of this abrupt transition from one to the other may be found in the image which, both from his occupation and his birthplace, would naturally occur to the Apostle, the tent of Cilician hair-cloth, which might almost equally suggest the idea of a habitation and of a vesture." 
2. "The οἰκία which in this verse is said, at the time of dissolution, to be ἐν τοῖς οὐρανοῖς, is, when we put it on, in the next verse, our οἰκητήριον τὸ ἐξ οὐρανοῦ. Thus the intermediate state, though lightly passed over, as not belonging to the subject, is evidently in the mind of St. Paul."
3. "Some Commentators, Photius, Anselm, Thomas Aq. (in Estius), Wolf, Rosenm., al., understand these words themselves (οἰκ. ἀχειρ. αἰών. ἐν τ. οὐρ.) of the intermediate state of absence from the body; Usteri and Flatt, of an immediate glorified body in heaven, to be united with the body of the resurrection."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "If this daily delivering unto death should end in actual death."
2. "The Holy Spirit is enshrined in the believer's body as in a sanctuary."
3. "A solid building, not a temporary tabernacle or tent."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The reason was, that they knew that even if their body should die, they had an inheritance reserved for them in heaven."
2. "The body - the house of the soul - was not a permanent dwelling-place, but was of the same nature as a booth or tent, that was set up for a temporary purpose."
3. "The future body shall never be taken down or dissolved by death. It is eternal, of course, only in respect to the future, and not in respect to the past."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The phrase earthly house of the tabernacle expresses a single conception - the dwelling which is, or consists in the tabernacle, the tent - house. The transient character of the body is thus indicated."
2. "Tabernacle is so habitually associated with a house of worship, and is so often applied to durable structures, that the original sense of a tent is in danger of being lost. It would be better to translate here by tent."
3. "The building from God is an actual possession in virtue of the believer's union with Christ. It is just as we say of a minor, before he comes into possession of his property, that he has so much."

### John Calvin:
1. "For Paul has it in view, to correct in us impatience, dread, and dislike of the cross, contempt for what is mean, and in fine, pride, and effeminacy; and this can only be accomplished by raising up our minds as high as heaven, through contempt of the world."
2. "On the one hand, he shows the miserable condition of mankind in this life, and on the other hand, the supreme and perfect blessedness, which awaits believers in heaven after death."
3. "Believers alone can affirm this, to whom it has been testified of by the word and Spirit of God."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The earthly house of our tabernacle be dissolved" - This phrase refers to the physical body that we currently inhabit. It suggests that our earthly bodies are temporary and subject to decay and death.

2. "We have a building from God" - This phrase highlights the promise of a resurrected body that believers will receive from God. It signifies a permanent and eternal dwelling that is not made by human hands.

3. "A house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens" - This description emphasizes the heavenly nature of the resurrection body. It implies that our future dwelling will be beyond the limitations of this earthly realm and will last for eternity.

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The very word used (καταλυω) for striking down a tent."
2. "Faith is the title-deed (υποστασις) to things hoped for."
3. "This οικοδομη is more substantial than the σκηνος."

### John Gill:
1. "By this house is meant the body, so called from its being like a well-built house, a curious piece of architecture; as a house consists of a variety of parts fitly framed and put together in just symmetry and proportion, and with an entire usefulness in all, so is the body of man; which shows the power and wisdom of God the architect." 
2. "It is said to be an 'earthly' house because it is from the earth; is supported by earthly things; has its present abode on the earth, and will quickly return to it."
3. "Now it is the saints' comfort whilst they are in it, and in a view of the dissolution of it, that they have a building of God, an house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens."

### John Wesley:
1. "Our earthly house - Which is only a tabernacle, or tent." This quote highlights the temporary nature of our physical bodies, emphasizing that they are not meant to last forever.

2. "Not designed for a lasting habitation." This quote emphasizes that our earthly bodies are not meant to be permanent dwellings, but rather temporary vessels for our souls.

3. "Only a tabernacle, or tent." This quote draws a parallel between our physical bodies and a temporary shelter, further emphasizing the impermanence of our earthly existence.
