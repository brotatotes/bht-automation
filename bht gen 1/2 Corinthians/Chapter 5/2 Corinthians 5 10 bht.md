# 2 Corinthians 5:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we are reminded of our ultimate accountability as beings created for eternity. The judgment seat of Christ is described as a place where our true selves, both in action and character, will be made manifest to the assembled universe. It is a necessity for us to appear there, not to earn salvation but to give up our account and receive the appropriate reward for our actions in this life. This judgment will serve as a vindication of God's righteousness and will be seen as right and just by all creatures.
