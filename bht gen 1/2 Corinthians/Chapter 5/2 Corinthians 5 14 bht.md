# 2 Corinthians 5:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The love of Christ, demonstrated through His death for humanity, is an all-encompassing force that compels and limits believers to dedicate themselves to Him above all else. This love acts as a guiding and protective boundary, directing individuals towards a singular purpose and preventing them from straying. It dissolves old principles and becomes the driving force of life, leading believers to love Christ in return and to live for Him. Christ's death was necessary to redeem all humanity, as everyone, regardless of their standing, is in need of spiritual redemption.
