# 2 Corinthians 5:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we are called to have a transformed perspective, seeing others through spiritual eyes rather than through worldly standards. Our previous ways of judging and valuing people based on outward appearances and distinctions no longer hold true. Instead, we are to know and esteem others not according to worldly categories, but as new creations in Christ. This change in perspective extends even to our understanding of Christ Himself, as we no longer judge Him based on earthly aspects but embrace Him in His spiritual gifts.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Our knowledge of others must be altogether independent of that which they are κατὰ σάρκα, must not be regulated κατὰ σάρκα." 
2. "He who knows no man κατὰ σάρκα has, e.g. in the case of the Jew, entirely lost sight of his Jewish origin, in that of the rich man, of his riches, in that of the learned, of his learning, in that of the slave, of his servitude, &c."
3. "The fact alluded to in the concessive clause, is, not any personal knowledge of the Lord Jesus while He was on earth, but that view of Him which Paul took before his conversion, when he knew Him only according to His outward apparent standing in this world, only as Jesus of Nazareth."

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "For instance, the outward distinctions of Jew or Gentile, rich or poor, slave or free, learned or unlearned, are lost sight of in the higher life of those who are dead in Christ's death, and alive with Him in the new life of His resurrection."
2. "He had this advantage over the Twelve, that as one born out of due time he had never known Christ save in His heavenly life."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "He who knows no man after the flesh, has, for example, in the case of the Jew, entirely lost sight of his Jewish origin; in that of the rich man, of his riches; in that of the learned of his learning; in that of the slave, of his servitude" (Alford).
2. "We know no man henceforth after the flesh: even if we have known Christ after the flesh, yet now, etc." 
3. "Paul refers to his knowledge of Christ before his conversion, a hearsay knowledge, confined to reports of His personal appearance, His deeds, His relations to the Jews, His alleged crime and punishment."

1. "We do not judge according to external appearance, so as to reckon that man to be the most illustrious who seems so in appearance."
2. "Though Christ lived for a time in this world, and was known by mankind in those things that have to do with the condition of the present life, he must now be known in another way — spiritually, so that we may have no worldly thoughts respecting him."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Our old principles of judgment are at an end; we now look on persons and things alike in a quite new light."
2. "Men may boast that they saw, and heard, and talked with Him in the days of His flesh; but so far from that being any recommendation, so mean and unworthy were the views which the best of us then entertained of Him."
