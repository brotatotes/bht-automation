# 2 Corinthians 5:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, believers are described as being "in Christ," which signifies a close and tender union with Him and a reliance on His strength and support. Through this union, they become new creatures, experiencing a profound transformation in their nature, motives, and perspectives. The old things of selfishness and worldly views have passed away, replaced by new views of God, Jesus Christ, truth, and duty. In this dramatic shift, everything is seen in a new light and with new feelings, as if contemplating a rapidly changing scene.

3. "Let us, therefore, keep in view this admonition — that all that are not renewed by the Spirit of God, should be looked upon as nothing in the Church, by whatever ornaments they may in other respects be distinguished."

"The words 'all things'...are wanting in all the principal authorities...yet, since they are not required for anything in the sense, the authorities seem to demand their exclusion." - The exclusion of the words "all things" in some versions of the verse is supported by authoritative sources, as they are not necessary for the overall meaning of the verse.
