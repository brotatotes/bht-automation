# 2 Corinthians 5:19 Commentary Help Text

In this verse, it emphasizes how God, in Christ, was reconciling the world to Himself. It highlights that the reconciliation was for the whole world, with all that is in it, encompassing mankind and the entire created order. This reconciliation was accomplished by God's act of not imputing our trespasses to us but instead imputing them to Christ. Through Christ, God removed the barriers to peace and acceptance, demonstrating His willingness to pardon and forgive rather than punish with unmitigated severity.
