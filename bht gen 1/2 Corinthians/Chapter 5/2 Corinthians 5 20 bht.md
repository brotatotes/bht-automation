# 2 Corinthians 5:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Believers are appointed as ambassadors on behalf of Christ, carrying out His mission and delivering His message to the world. As representatives of a higher authority, they have a responsibility to accurately reflect God's character and values. Their purpose is to go into the world, sharing the good news of salvation and offering hope and reconciliation to all. Reconciliation extends beyond initial salvation to include ongoing forgiveness and embracing the act of God in Christ's death. God, through His ambassadors, extends His invitation with unparalleled condescension and tender mercies, urging all to accept His offer of peace and pardon.
