# 2 Corinthians 5:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, the commentators emphasize the incredible sacrifice of Jesus Christ on the cross and the purpose behind it. They affirm that Jesus, though sinless, willingly took on the representation of sin itself, bearing the sins of humanity. They emphasize that Jesus knew no personal sin but became the sin offering for us, providing the means for our reconciliation with God. Through Christ's sacrifice, we are offered the opportunity to be made righteous in God's sight, receiving both imputed and implanted righteousness.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The strongest argument, and that which is most adapted to melt the soul, is the fact that the Son of God has become incarnate for our sins, and has suffered and died in our stead."
2. "In all respects, and in all conceivable senses, the Lord Jesus was pure and holy. If he had not been, he would not have been qualified to make an atonement."
3. "The Christian has a permanent home in heaven. There is his home; that is his eternal dwelling. Here he is a stranger, among strangers, in a strange world. In heaven is his home."

3. "The righteousness of God is taken here to denote — not that which is given us by God, but that which is approved of by him."

These quotes highlight the importance of Christ's sacrifice for our forgiveness, the concept of imputation, and the distinction between human righteousness and the righteousness approved by God.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "So far from God requiring to be moved by the death of Christ to compassionate and provide salvation for a sinful world, it was God Himself who spontaneously sent His Son on this errand into our world."
2. "Sinlessness, in the most absolute sense applicable to a creature nature, is here ascribed to Christ."
3. "To be 'made sin' cannot mean to be made personally sinful, either in act or inclination."
4. "This settles beyond dispute the 'righteousness of God' which we become in Him. For if Christ, while personally righteous, was 'made sin' not personally, but by transference to Him of our guilt, with all its penal effects clearly 'we,' while personally guilty, are 'made the righteousness of God in Him' by transference of His righteousness to us."

3. "The end of his being made sin, though he himself had none, was, that we might be made the righteousness of God in him; not the essential righteousness of God, which can neither be imparted nor imputed; nor any righteousness of God wrought in us; for it is a righteousness 'in him', in Christ, and not in ourselves."

1. "He made him a sin offering, who knew no sin — A commendation peculiar to Christ."
