# 2 Corinthians 5:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, believers are assured that they will be clothed with a body, not disembodied spirits, in the future. The commentators emphasize the importance of being clothed with the spiritual body in heaven, as it symbolizes our eternal habitation and the righteousness of Christ. The concept of being clothed - naked portrays the contrast between believers, adorned with Christ's image, and disembodied spirits, emphasizing the desire for the glorious robe of immortality. The image of God serves as a covering, protecting us from being exposed and vulnerable in our spiritual journey.
