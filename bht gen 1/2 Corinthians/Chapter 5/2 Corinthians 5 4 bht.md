# 2 Corinthians 5:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Bible verse, described by various commentators, speaks of the longing of believers for the redemption of their mortal bodies. They groan, burdened by the trials of life and the mortality of their physical existence, not desiring to be left without a body but yearning to be clothed with an immortal, incorruptible, and glorious spiritual body. The natural reluctance towards death is overcome by the confidence and hope of being transformed into a new and enduring form. Ultimately, their desire is not to escape their bodies but to be renewed and absorbed by a life that transcends death.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "We who are in the tabernacle groan, being burdened... because we are not willing to divest ourselves (of it), but to put on (that other) over it." 
2. "Our mortal part may be swallowed up by life." 
3. "It was no terror of death as to its consequences but a natural reluctance to undergo the mere act of death as such."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Believers shrink from, not the consequences, but the mere act of dying especially as believing in the possibility of their being found alive at the Lord's coming."
2. "Faith does not divest us of all natural feeling, but subordinates it to higher feeling."
3. "Scripture gives no sanction to the contempt for the body expressed by philosophers."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Being borne down by the toils, and trials, and calamities of this life." 
2. "We desire to be in heaven, and to be clothed with immortality."
3. "Paul desired to pass away from the mortal state to one that shall be immortal, a world where there shall be no more death."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The oppression of soul (groan) is not from pains and afflictions of the body, nor from the fear of death, but from the natural shrinking from death, especially if death is to deprive him of the body (unclothe) only to leave him without a new and higher organism."
2. "Therefore he desires, instead of dying, to have the new being come down upon him while still alive, investing him with the new spiritual organism (clothed upon), as a new garment is thrown over an old one, and absorbing (swallowed up) the old, sensuous life."
3. "For who, to dumb forgetfulness a prey, This pleading anxious being e'er resigned, Left the warm precincts of the cheerful day, Nor cast one longing, lingering look behind?"

### John Calvin:
1. "The groaning of believers... arises from this — that they know, that they are here in a state of exile from their native land, and that they know, that they are here shut up in the body as in a prison."
2. "Believers do not desire death for the sake of losing anything, but as having regard to a better life."
3. "The natural horror of death is overcome by confidence, as an individual will, without any reluctance, throw away a coarse, dirty, threadbare garment, with the view of being arrayed in an elegant, handsome, new, and durable one."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "It is not that we are weary of a body, as if it were a mere cage from which it were bliss simply to make our escape; but we long that the mortality with which it is smitten, with all the ills which that carries with it, may pass away, and we may find ourselves wearing a form instinct with a life that cannot die."

2. "The sublime expression 'swallowed up' was doubtless suggested by Isaiah 25:8, quoted in the former Epistle (1 Corinthians 15:54), where the same word is used."

3. "We desire to be 'clothed upon' with a new and immortal body, to be transformed from mortal to immortal, from corruptible to incorruptible, from weakness to power, from dishonor to glory."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "For that (εφ' ω) we do not wish to put off the clothing, but to put it on" (αλλ' επενδυσασθα). The transposition of the negative ου weakens the sense. Paul does not wish to be a mere disembodied spirit without his spiritual garment."
2. "Only what is mortal perishes; the personality, consisting of soul and body, survives," (Plummer).
3. "See on 2 Corinthians 1:22 for 'the earnest of the spirit.'"

### John Gill:
1. "The saints who are in the tabernacle of the body, in an unsettled state, groan, being in the midst of tribulation, and not yet in the enjoyment of that happiness they are wishing for."
2. "The saints are mostly burdened with the body of sin and death they carry about with them; the filth of it is nauseous, grievous, and intolerable."
3. "The various afflictions of life, though comparatively 'light', are in themselves heavy, grievous burdens, and hard to be bore; the nature, number, and continuance of them often make them so."

### John Wesley:
1. "We groan being burdened — The apostle speaks with exact propriety. A burden naturally expresses groans."
2. "Not that we would be unclothed — Not that we desire to remain without a body. Faith does not understand that philosophical contempt of what the wise Creator has given."
3. "But clothed upon — With the glorious, immortal, incorruptible, spiritual body."
