# 2 Corinthians 5:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Faith guides our lives with unwavering belief in the promise of eternal hope beyond the fleeting appearances of the present world. It enables us to walk not by what our physical eyes perceive but by the unseen realities we firmly hold onto. By relying on faith rather than relying on mere appearances, we can confidently expect and live according to the deep truths and invisible workings of God, who is both the source and ultimate reward of our faith.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Our life is governed by faith in our immortal hope; not by the outward specious appearance of present things."
2. "God has appointed in this life faith for our great duty, and in the next, vision for our reward."
3. "Our walk as Christians is not determined by what we see with our physical eyes, but by our faith in the unseen."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "To walk by faith, is to live in the confident expectation of things that are to come; in the belief of the existence of unseen realities; and suffering them to influence us as if they were seen."
2. "The Christian lives, and thinks, and acts as if there were a God, and as if he saw him."
3. "The Christian lives, and acts as if there were such a Spirit, and as if his influences were needful to renew, and purify the soul."

(Note: The commentary is quite lengthy, so I have selected three quotes that capture the essence of the author's explanation.)

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The correct rendering is appearance."
2. "The word is not used actively in the sense of vision."
3. "Faith is contrasted with the actual appearance of heavenly things."

### John Calvin:
1. "The reason why he is not seen by us is, that we walk by faith... faith perceives those things that are hid from the view of men."
2. "For such is the condition of believers, that they resemble the dead rather than the living... they must necessarily hope against hope."
3. "Faith is the manifestation of things which do not appear... it assures us, not only that there are such things, but that, through the power and faithfulness of God, we shall enjoy them."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "By appearance" refers to judging based on outward appearances rather than true understanding or discernment.
2. This phrase reminds us not to make hasty judgments or assumptions about people or situations solely based on what we see on the surface.
3. It challenges us to look beyond the external and seek a deeper understanding of the truth.

### John Gill:
1. "Faith is the eye of the soul, by which it looks to Christ for righteousness, peace, pardon, life, and salvation."
2. "Faith is the hand by which it receives him, and the foot by which it goes to him, and walks in him."
3. "Faith is not a weak, but a strong steady faith of glory and happiness, and of interest in it."

### John Wesley:
1. "We cannot clearly see him in this life, wherein we walk by faith only." 
2. "An evidence, indeed, that necessarily implies a kind of 'seeing him who is invisible.'"
3. "As far beneath what we shall have in eternity, as it is above that of bare, unassisted reason."
