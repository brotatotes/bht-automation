## BHT:
In this verse, the commentators emphasize the role of ministers as co-workers with God, imploring the believers to not disregard the grace of God but to live a sanctified life. They stress that the work of the ministers goes beyond simply preaching; it involves exhorting and laboring together with God to ensure the effective reception of His message. The verse highlights the urgency for believers to heed the offer of salvation, lest they receive it in vain and fail to demonstrate a transformative response to God's grace.
