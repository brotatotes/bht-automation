# 2 Corinthians 6:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, the writer describes the paradoxical nature of the servant of Christ. Though they may experience sorrow and hardships, they always find reasons to rejoice in the Lord's faithfulness and the hope of future glory. While they may appear to have nothing in the eyes of the world, they possess all things in Christ, including peace, love, power, and a treasure of spiritual riches that enriches others. This paradoxical state defines the true nature of the servant of Christ, who finds joy even amidst sorrow and possesses an eternal inheritance.
