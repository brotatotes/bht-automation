# 2 Corinthians 6:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The commentator quotes shed light on a Bible verse discussing the expansive and unconditional love that should exist between the speaker and the audience. The tension or constraint in the relationship is not due to a lack of love on the speaker's part but rather a lack of reciprocation from the audience. The term "straitened" refers to a limitation or constricted affection. The verse calls for an examination of the readers' hearts, as the restriction of love is of their own doing.
