1. "The word which is used here (ἑτεροζυγέω heterozugeō) means properly, to bear a different yoke, to be yoked heterogeneously - Robinson (Lexicon). It is applied to the custom of yoking animals of different kinds together (Passow); and as used here means not to mingle together, or be united with unbelievers."
2. "The radical idea is, that they were to abstain from all connections with unbelievers - with infidels, and pagans, and those who were not Christians, which would identify them with them; or they were to have no connection with them in anything as unbelievers, pagans, or infidels; they were to partake with them in nothing that was special to them as such."
3. "There is no principle of Christianity that is more important than that which is here stated by the apostle; and none in which Christians are more in danger of erring, or in which they have more difficulty in determining the exact rule which they are to follow."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Unequally gives an ambiguous sense. It is not inequality, but difference in kind, as is shown by the succeeding words."

### John Calvin:
1. "He now reproves them more freely, because they associated with unbelievers, as partakers with them in outward idolatry."
2. "Paul inveighs here against outward idolatry, and exhorts Christians to stand aloof from it, and have no connection with it."
3. "He confirms his exhortation on the ground of its being an absurd, and, as it were, monstrous connecting together of things in themselves much at variance; for these things can no more coalesce than fire and water."
