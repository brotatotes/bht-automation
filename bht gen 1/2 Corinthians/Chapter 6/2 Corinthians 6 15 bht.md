# 2 Corinthians 6:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse under consideration contrasts the characters of Christ and Belial, emphasizing their stark opposition. Christ represents righteousness, holiness, and truth, while Belial embodies wickedness, deceit, and rebellion against God. The two are incompatible and cannot be united in purpose or agreement. Serving Christ means aligning with the principles and values of the Kingdom of God, while serving Belial involves embracing the values of the worldly system. Christians are called to discerningly choose to wholeheartedly serve Christ, rejecting any association with Belial and the ways of the world, and ensuring that their actions align with Christ's teachings.
