1. "They endeavored to act in a manner so as to commend the ministry and the gospel, whether they were in circumstances of honor or dishonor, whether lauded or despised by the world."
2. "It is difficult in such circumstances to 'commend themselves as the ministers of God.' Few are the people who are not injured by honor; few who are not corrupted by flattery."

It was by receiving all expressions of contempt with meekness; by not suffering them to interfere with the faithful discharge of his duties; by rising above them, and showing the power of religion to sustain him."

3. "But how cruel to despise the poverty of the man who supplies you from his abundance! He means spiritual riches, which ought to be much more esteemed than earthly." (599)

### Philip Schaff:
1. "As deceivers in the account of our enemies": This phrase highlights the perception of the Corinthians by their adversaries. It suggests that they were seen as deceitful or untrustworthy, possibly due to their commitment to their faith and the values they upheld.

2. "Yet true in reality": This statement emphasizes the contrast between the Corinthians' perceived reputation and their actual character. Despite being labeled as deceivers, they remained true to their beliefs and lived with integrity, demonstrating their authenticity and faithfulness.

3. "True in reality": This phrase underscores the importance of living a genuine and authentic life. It encourages believers to align their actions with their beliefs, even if they are misunderstood or falsely accused by others.

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "By glory and dishonour (δια δοξης κα ατιμιας). Here δια is no longer instrument, but state or condition. Δοξα here is glory."
