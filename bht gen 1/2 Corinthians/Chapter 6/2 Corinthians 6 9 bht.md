# 2 Corinthians 6:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The believers, though unrecognized and despised by the world, are fully known and approved by Jesus Christ. They face hardships and dangers as if they are dying, yet they hold onto the hope of God's intervention, bringing unexpected life and renewal. Their ministry, though not understood by the world, has a profound impact on those who receive it, as they are the seals of their work. In this paradoxical existence, the believers find solace in their relationship with God, who sees and values their service.
