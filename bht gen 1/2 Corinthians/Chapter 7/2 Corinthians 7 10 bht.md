# 2 Corinthians 7:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse being described here focuses on the distinction between worldly sorrow and godly sorrow. It highlights that sorrow according to God leads to repentance and salvation, without any regret or negative consequences. This godly sorrow is marked by a genuine change of heart and mind, resulting in a transformed life. In contrast, the sorrow of the world is characterized by mere regret for past actions without true repentance. It ultimately leads to spiritual death and despair. The verse calls believers to embrace the joy of godly sorrow, which brings about true life and transformation in the presence of God.

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Sorrow" is not repentance, but, where it is "godly," "worketh" it; that is, contributes or tends to it.
2. "Repentance" implies a coming to a right mind; "regret" implies merely uneasiness of feeling at the past or present.
3. "Repentance" removes the impediments in the way of "salvation" (to which "death," namely, of the soul, is opposed).

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Such sorrow as has respect to God, or is according to his will, or as leads the soul to him."
2. "It is a sorrow which his truth is suited to produce on the heart; such a sorrow as shall appropriately arise from viewing sin as God views it."
3. "Genuine sorrow for sin leads the soul to God, and conducts the sinner, through the Redeemer, to him to obtain the pardon and peace which he only can give to a wounded spirit."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Paul's words strike effectively at the popular identification of sorrow with repentance." 
2. "The oxymoron is in the A. V. rather than in the Greek." 
3. "Sorrow which is characteristic of the world; grief for the consequences rather than for the sin as sin."

### John Calvin:
1. "The joy of the world is, when men foolishly, and without the fear of the Lord, exult in vanity, that is, in the world, and, intoxicated with a transient felicity, look no higher than the earth."
2. "The sorrow of the world is, when men despond in consequence of earthly afflictions, and are overwhelmed with grief; while sorrow according to God is that which has an eye to God, while they reckon it the one misery — to have lost the favor of God; when, impressed with fear of His judgment, they mourn over their sins."
3. "On the other hand, it is impossible for a man to experience a sorrow of this kind, without its giving birth to a new heart. Hence repentance takes its rise in grief, for the reason that I have mentioned — because no one can return to the right way, but the man who hates sin; but where hatred of sin is, there is self-dissatisfaction and grief."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "For godly sorrow worketh repentance to salvation, a repentance bringing no regret." - The first word used here means a gracious change of mind, expressing true repentance. It is a repentance that leads to salvation and brings no regret.
2. "But the sorrow of the world worketh death mere regret for wrong done." - The sorrow of the world, on the other hand, only brings regret for past actions without any genuine change of heart. It leads to death, not salvation.
3. "In the case of many besides Judas, when the 'sorrow of the world' works despair, existence is felt to be intolerable, and self-destruction sends them to 'their own place'." - The remorse of conscience that comes from worldly sorrow can lead to despair and even self-destruction. It has a destructive and consuming effect, ultimately leading to eternal death.

### Archibald T Robertson:

2. "The sorrow according to God" (God's ideal) leads to repentance without regret. 
3. "In contrast, the kind of sorrow that the world has, grief 'for failure, not for sin'... Works out death in the end."

### John Gill:
1. "It was a sorrow for sin, because it was committed against a God of infinite holiness, justice, and truth, goodness, grace, and mercy."
2. "This sorrow is further described, from its salutary operation, it 'worketh repentance'; it is the beginning of it, a part of it, an essential part of it, without which there is no true repentance."
3. "This, or repentance, is such as is not to be repented of; or that is stable and immovable... salvation is not to be repented of; it is not repented of by God, who repents not, neither of the thing itself, nor of the way and manner in which it is effected, nor of the persons saved by it."

### John Wesley:
1. "The sorrow of the world" refers to the sorrow that arises from worldly considerations. It highlights the fleeting nature of worldly sorrows and their inability to bring true fulfillment or lasting joy.
2. This sorrow "worketh death," meaning it naturally tends to lead to death in various forms - temporal, spiritual, and eternal. It emphasizes the destructive nature of worldly sorrow and its potential to bring about negative consequences.
3. By contrasting the sorrow of the world with the joy of godly sorrow, the verse encourages believers to seek a deeper understanding of sorrow that is rooted in a relationship with God, leading to true life and transformation.
