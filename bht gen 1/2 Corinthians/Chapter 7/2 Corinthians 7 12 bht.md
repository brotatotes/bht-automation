### Philip Schaff:
1. "The only natural interpretation is, the father of the incestuous person supposed by most in that case to be still alive."
2. "But if that be thought not natural, since no other than the father can well be meant, we shall have to suppose that the incestuous act was done in the father’s lifetime, which, of course, would place it in a more monstrous light."

3. "The apostle in writing did not so much consult and regard the private good of any particular person, either the injurer or the injured, though these were not out of his view; but he wrote in the manner he did, chiefly that it might be manifest what a concern he had for the good and welfare of the whole church."
