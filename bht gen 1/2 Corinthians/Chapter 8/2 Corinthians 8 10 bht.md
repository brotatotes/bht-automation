# 2 Corinthians 8:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the Apostle Paul is expressing his opinion rather than issuing a command to the Corinthians. He believes that giving advice will be more beneficial, as it allows their offering to be freely given and not out of obligation. The Corinthians had already started the collection a year ago and were eager and willing from the beginning, even setting an example for other churches. Although commendable, it is mentioned that other churches who began later had already completed their contributions. This verse highlights the importance of voluntary and enthusiastic giving, which brings both temporal and spiritual blessings.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "My giving my opinion, rather than commanding, is expedient for you, who have already shown yourselves so willing. A command from me would be a lowering of you, and depreciation of your zeal."
2. "The Corinthians had begun not only the second, but even the first of these, before the Macedonians. Long employed as they had then been in the matter, it was more creditable to them to receive advice from the Apostle, than command."
3. "In saying 'from last year,' it seems probable that Paul would speak as a Jew, regarding the year as beginning in Tisri."

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Herein he does not (as some misinterpret the passage) disclaim inspiration for the advice he gives; but under the Spirit, states that it is his 'opinion' [ALFORD] or 'judgment' [ELLICOTT, and others], not a command, that so their offering might be free and spontaneous."
2. "There were three steps: (1) the forwardness, more literally, 'the will'; (2) the setting about it, literally, 'doing it'; (3) completion of it [ALFORD]. In the two former, not only the act, but the intention, the Corinthians preceded the Macedonians."
3. "Ye began already a year ago, not only to do, but also to be forward."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Advice will go much further than commands on the subject of charities."
2. "It became them; it was proper, and was demanded; and there would have been manifest disadvantages if it had not been done."
3. "They were voluntary in this, and they set about it with vigorous and determined zeal and courage."

### John Calvin:
1. "The Lord...would have us, not- withstanding, persevere in doing good."
2. "The advantage...is that 'He that giveth to the poor...lendeth to the Lord,' whose blessing...is to be regarded as a hundredfold more precious than all the treasures of the world."
3. "Such cheerfulness of anticipation is better than the actual performance of the deed."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "And herein I give my judgment or 'opinion;' for in 2 Corinthians 8:8 he had just disclaimed giving them a 'command' on the subject." 

2. "Not only to do, but to will a strange expression; but the meaning clearly is, 'Since ye not only began to make this collection last year, before ever the Macedonian churches were addressed upon the subject, but set yourselves to it with a will (as we should say), it would only be becoming in you not to fall behind the Macedonians in the completion of it.'"

3. "That this is the meaning, seems plain from the next verse."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Judgment (γνωμην). Deliberate opinion, but not a 'command' (επιταγη verse 2 Corinthians 8:8)."
2. "A year ago (απο περυσ) From last year."
3. "Not only to do, but also to will (ου μονον το ποιησαι, αλλα κα το θελειν). Articular infinitives the objects of προενηρξασθε on which verb see verse 2 Corinthians 8:6)."

### John Gill:
1. "The apostle did not choose to make use of his apostolical authority, or give orders, as he sometimes did in such cases; he did not think fit to speak by way of commandment, obliging them to what they ought to do willingly; looking upon this the most prudential step, and wisest method he could take in order to succeed." 

2. "Doing acts of beneficence is profitable to persons, as to things temporal, God usually blessing such with a greater affluence of the things of life, and which indeed is often promised; and is also profitable with respect to things spiritual, for if God does not make it up to them in temporal enjoyments, yet with his presence, the discoveries of his love, the joys of his salvation, and an increase of every grace."

3. "It was in their favour that they had begun before, even a year ago, and were willing and forward of themselves to this good work; yea, were the first that set it on foot, and so were an example to the Macedonian churches, and others; but then this was against them, that the other churches, which began later than they, had finished before them."
