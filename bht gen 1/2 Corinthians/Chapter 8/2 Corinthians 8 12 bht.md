# 2 Corinthians 8:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, it is made clear that our acceptability with God is not based on the quantity of our offerings, but on the willingness and readiness of our hearts. The emphasis is placed on having a willing mind and a generous spirit, rather than focusing solely on material wealth. God values the proportion of our giving in relation to our means, and even small acts of kindness and sincerity are accepted and rewarded by Him. As believers, our acceptance with God is determined by our acknowledgement of our sinfulness and our reliance on the merits of Christ for salvation.
