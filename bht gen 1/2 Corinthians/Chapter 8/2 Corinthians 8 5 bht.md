# 2 Corinthians 8:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse being described speaks of a generous and selfless act. The commentators agree that the people went beyond expectations, giving not only their worldly possessions but also giving themselves completely to God and His servants. They trusted in God's provision, willing to do whatever was necessary in obedience to His will. This act of devotion and surrender was not only an act of Christian principle but also a demonstration of their commitment to God's service.
