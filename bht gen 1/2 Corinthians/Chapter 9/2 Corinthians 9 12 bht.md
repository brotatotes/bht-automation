# 2 Corinthians 9:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse being described in the commentaries is about the act of providing for the needs of fellow believers in the church. This act, referred to as a "ministration of public service," goes beyond meeting physical needs and becomes a religious duty, a sacrifice offered to God. It not only fills up the deficiencies of the saints, but also generates gratitude and thanksgiving to God. This service is a means by which many souls are moved to give thanks and praise to God for His provision through the generosity of His people.

1. "Either of them will suit this passage well. For on the one hand, it is no unusual thing for alms to be termed sacrifices; and, on the other hand, as on occasion of offices being distributed among citizens, no one grudges to undertake the duty that has been assigned him, so in the Church, imparting to others ought to be looked upon as a necessary duty."
2. "The Corinthians, therefore, and others, by assisting the brethren at Jerusalem, presented a sacrifice to God, or they discharged a service that was proper, and one which they were bound to fulfill."
