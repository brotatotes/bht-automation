## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "He concludes with an ascription, in the spirit also of a thankful recipient, of unfeigned thanks to Him, who hath enriched us by the gift of His only Son, which brings with it that of all things else."
2. "And the ascription, as coming from Paul’s fervent spirit, is very natural in this connexion."
3. "It is impossible to apply such a term, so emphatically placed as here, to any gift short of THAT ONE."

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "His unspeakable gift—the gift of His own Son, which includes all other inferior gifts." 
2. "If we have received from God 'His unspeakable gift,' what great thing is it, if we give a few perishing gifts for His sake?" 
3. "The gift of His Son is the ultimate expression of God's love and grace towards humanity."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The reference is rather to the inexpressible gift which God had granted to them in bestowing his Son to die for them; and this is one of the most striking instances which occur in the New Testament, showing that the mind of Paul was full of this subject; and that wherever he began, he was sure to end with a reference to the Redeemer."
2. "The Saviour is a gift to mankind... Man had no claim on God. He could not compel him to provide a plan of salvation; and the whole arrangement - the selection of the Saviour, the sending him into the world, and all the benefits resulting from his work, are all an undeserved gift to man."
3. "Thanks should be rendered to God for this. We owe him our highest praises for this... All our peace and hope; all our comfort and joy in this life; all our prospect of pardon and salvation; all the offers of eternal glory are to be traced to him. Man has no prospect of being happy when he dies but in virtue of the 'unspeakable gift' of God."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "These abrupt thanksgivings are common in Paul's writings."
2. "Unspeakable [ανεκδιηγητω]. Lit., not to be told throughout. Only here in the New Testament."

"His ardour in the cause thus belongs to the same impassioned love for his country and people." - The commentary highlights the apostle's deep love and concern for his fellow Jews, which is reflected in his fervent efforts to gather the collection for the Jewish Christians.

### Archibald T Robertson:
