# 2 Corinthians 9:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, the speaker expresses the importance of the Corinthians being prepared and organized in their collection, emphasizing the specific group of people from Macedonia. Their previous track record of generosity and the speaker's assurance in the Corinthians' willingness to give have raised expectations. However, the character of both the Corinthians and the speaker is at stake if the collection falls short. Should their confidence and boasting come to nothing, it would bring about feelings of shame for all parties involved.
