## Choicest Commentary Quotes:

2. "He who defrauds the poor by stinting them πλεονεκτεῖ, in the literal sense."
3. "There is no need to alter the primitive meaning, or to make the word signify ‘tenacity,’ as Calv., De Wette, al.: he who defrauds the poor by stinting them πλεονεκτεῖ, in the literal sense."

1. "I have preferred, however, to render it literally, as the Greeks employed the term εὐλογίας to express the Hebrew word ברכה, (beracah,) which is used in the sense of a blessing, that is, an invoking of prosperity, as well as in the sense of beneficence."
2. "When it is from this transferred to men, it retains the same meaning, — improperly, indeed, inasmuch as men have not the same efficacy in blessing, but yet not unsuitably by transference."

### Archibald T Robertson:
