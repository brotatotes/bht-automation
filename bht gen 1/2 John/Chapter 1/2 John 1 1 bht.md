# choicest prompt v1 X bht prompt v3; ['Henry Alford', 'Jamieson Fausset Brown', 'Albert Barnes', 'Marvin Vincent', 'John Calvin', 'Philip Schaff', 'Archibald T Robertson', 'Adam Clarke']

## Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Being a person of influence, 'deceivers' were insinuating themselves into her family to seduce her and her children from the faith."
2. "A particular Church, probably that at Babylon, was intended."
3. "Christian love rests on the Christian truth."

## Albert Barnes:
1. "He addresses her as one chosen of God to salvation, in the use of a term often applied to Christians in the New Testament."
2. "The meaning here is, that he 'truly' or 'sincerely' loved them."
3. "The commendation of the apostle here shows that it is possible that a family shall be extensively known as one of order, peace, and religion, so that all who know it or hear of it shall regard it with interest, respect, and love."

## Marvin Vincent:
1. "The word is used originally of seniority in age... Afterward as a term of rank or office." 
2. "An expression which baffles all the commentators... It is impossible to settle the question satisfactorily." 
3. "May be taken either in a literal or in a spiritual sense... The explanation turns on the meaning of ejklekth kuria."

## Archibald T Robertson:
1. "For the spiritual sense in τεκνια see 1 John 2:1; 1 John 2:12." 
2. "embracing the mother and the children of both sexes" (Vincent).
3. "I pass at once after the Greek idiom to the first and there is also special emphasis here in the use of αγαπω with the addition of εν αληθεια (in truth, in the highest sphere, as in John 17:19; 3 John 1:1) and ουκ εγω μονος (not I only, 'not I alone')."

## Adam Clarke:
1. "The elder — John the apostle, who was now a very old man, generally supposed to be about ninety, and therefore he uses the term ο πρεσβυτερος, presbyter or elder, not as the name of an office, but as designating his advanced age." 
2. "The elect lady — εκλεκτη κυρια. As κυρια, kuria, may be the feminine of κυριος, kurios, lord, therefore it may signify lady; and so several, both ancients and moderns, have understood it."
3. "Whom I love in the truth — Whom I love as the Christian religion requires us to love one another."


# BHT:
In this verse, a person of influence is addressing a chosen individual and her family. Deceivers are trying to sway her and her children away from their faith. The writer expresses sincere love for them, emphasizing the bond between truth and love in the Christian faith. The mention of the term "elder" suggests that the author is an older figure, possibly John the apostle. The reference to the "elect lady" could be interpreted as a loving address to a respected woman. Through this message, the writer conveys both affection and a strong commitment to the Christian truth.
