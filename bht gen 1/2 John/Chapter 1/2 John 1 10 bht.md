# choicest prompt v1 X bht prompt v3; ['Henry Alford', 'Jamieson Fausset Brown', 'Albert Barnes', 'Marvin Vincent', 'John Calvin', 'Philip Schaff', 'Archibald T Robertson', 'Adam Clarke']

## Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "True love is combined with hearty renunciation and separation from all that is false, whether persons or doctrines."
2. "This is not said of those who were always aliens from the Church, but of those who wish to be esteemed brethren, and subvert the true doctrine."
3. "The greeting salutation forbidden in the case of such a one is that usual among Christian brethren in those days, not a mere formality, but a token of Christian brotherhood."

## Albert Barnes:
1. "There can be no doubt that she to whom this Epistle was written was accustomed to entertain such teachers."
2. "We are not to aid their instruction, we are not to receive them into our houses, or to entertain them as religious teachers."
3. "The command not to 'receive such an one into the house,' in such circumstances as those referred to by John, would be probably understood literally, as he doubtless designed that it should be."

(Note: The commentary does not provide a clear verse reference, so the quotes are numbered based on their order in the commentary.)

## Marvin Vincent:
1. "If anyone comes, as there are those that come."
2. "Cometh is used in an official sense as of a teacher."
3. "Now whoever cometh and teacheth you all these things, before spoken, receive him; but if the teacher himself turn aside and teach another teaching, so as to overthrow this, do not hear him."

## Archibald T Robertson:
1. "This teaching of Christ of verse 2 John 1:9, which is the standard by which to test Gnostic deceivers." 
2. "John does not refer to entertaining strangers, but to the deceiving propagandists who were carrying dissension and danger with them."
3. "The point turns on the stranger bringing into the house (or trying to do so) his heretical and harmful teaching which seems to be after the salutation is over."

## Adam Clarke:
1. "If there come any unto you... and bring not this doctrine, that Jesus is come in the flesh, and has died for the redemption of the world. Receive him not unto your house." 
2. "Let him not preach under your roof."
3. "Do not say, Health to him-do not salute him with Peace be to thee!"


# BHT:
In this verse, the commentators emphasize the importance of discernment and caution when dealing with false teachers. They bring attention to the need to separate from those who promote false doctrines and subvert the truth. The greeting salutation, normally exchanged among Christian brethren, should not be extended to such individuals. These deceiving propagandists were to be neither received into the house nor given any form of support or endorsement. The central point revolves around the rejection of those who bring heretical teachings, denying the fundamental truth that Jesus came in the flesh and died for the redemption of the world.
