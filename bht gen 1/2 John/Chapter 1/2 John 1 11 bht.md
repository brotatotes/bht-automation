# choicest prompt v1 X bht prompt v3; ['Henry Alford', 'Jamieson Fausset Brown', 'Albert Barnes', 'Marvin Vincent', 'John Calvin', 'Philip Schaff', 'Archibald T Robertson', 'Adam Clarke']

## Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "By wishing a false brother or teacher 'God (or 'good') speed,' you imply that he is capable as such of good speed and joy (the literal meaning of the Greek), and that you wish him it while opposing Christ; so you identify yourself with 'his evil deeds.'"
2. "The Greek of 'partaker' is 'having communion with.' We cannot have communion with saints and with Antichrist at the same time."
3. "Here we see John's naturally fiery zeal directed to a right end. Polycarp, the disciple of John, told contemporaries of Irenaeus, who narrates the story on their authority, that on one occasion when John was about to bathe, and heard that Cerinthus, the heretic, was within, he retired with abhorrence, exclaiming, Surely the house will fall in ruins since the enemy of the truth is there."

## Albert Barnes:
1. "For he that biddeth him God speed, is partaker of his evil deeds" - This verse highlights the importance of being cautious about who we associate with and support. It warns that by offering greetings or support to someone who promotes false teachings or evil deeds, we become complicit in their actions.

2. "Shows that he countenances and approves of the doctrine which is taught" - This quote emphasizes that by extending greetings or support, we are not only acknowledging the person but also endorsing their beliefs or teachings. It reminds us to be discerning and mindful of the ideologies we align ourselves with.

3. "Compare the notes at 1 Timothy 5:22" - This reference encourages readers to explore further insights on the topic by examining the commentary on 1 Timothy 5:22. It suggests that there may be additional guidance or context provided in that particular verse.

## Marvin Vincent:
1. "The verb occurs nowhere else in John's writings."
2. "The fact that the plant is no longer found is significant in connection with Isaiah's prophecy."
3. "Ink was prepared of soot or of vegetable or mineral substances."

## Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Partaketh in his evil works" - This phrase implies that by allowing false teachers to spread their doctrines in the churches' private homes, the believers would become partners in their evil deeds. It emphasizes the importance of not endorsing or supporting those who promote false teachings.

2. "Associative instrumental case with κοινωνε" - This grammatical explanation highlights the usage of the verb κοινωνε (partner) in the instrumental case, indicating a close association or participation. It further emphasizes the idea that allowing false teachers to spread their doctrines would result in a shared responsibility for the harm caused.

3. "It is not a case of mere hospitality to strangers" - This statement clarifies that the issue at hand is not simply about showing hospitality to strangers, but rather about the potential harm that false teachers can cause. It suggests that discernment is necessary in determining who should be welcomed and endorsed within the church community.

## Adam Clarke:
1. "He that acts towards him as if he considered him a Christian brother, and sound in the faith, puts it in his power to deceive others, by thus apparently accrediting his ministry." 
2. "No sound Christian should countenance any man as a Gospel minister, who holds and preaches erroneous doctrines; especially concerning the Lord Jesus."
3. "But what St. John says here does not mean that we should deny such the common offices of humanity, charity, and mercy. No. In these offices we are equally bound to all men."
