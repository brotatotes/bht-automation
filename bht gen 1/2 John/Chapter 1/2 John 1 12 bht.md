# BHT:
In this verse, the author expresses the desire for face-to-face communication rather than writing a letter. They have joyful Gospel truths to share that would be better delivered in person. The author emphasizes the personal connection and the increased comfort and understanding that comes from direct interaction. They acknowledge that there is more to say but choose not to put it down on paper, preferring the intimacy and fullness of communication that only comes through personal encounters.
