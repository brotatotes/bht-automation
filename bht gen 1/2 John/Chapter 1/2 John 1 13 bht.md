# choicest prompt v1 X bht prompt v3; ['Henry Alford', 'Jamieson Fausset Brown', 'Albert Barnes', 'Marvin Vincent', 'John Calvin', 'Philip Schaff', 'Archibald T Robertson', 'Adam Clarke']

## Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "The non-mention of the 'lady' herself here seems rather to favor the hypothesis that a Church is meant." 

2. "The use of the term 'elect lady' suggests that the writer is addressing a specific group of believers, possibly a church." 

3. "The mention of 'your children' in verse 4 implies that the writer is speaking to a community of believers who have spiritual offspring."

## Albert Barnes:
1. "It is desirable for a family to have a character for piety so consistent and well understood that all who know it shall perceive it and love it." 
2. "It is a matter of great rejoicing when any part of a family becomes truly religious."
3. "We may see that it is possible for us to lose a portion of the reward which we might enjoy in heaven."
4. "We may learn from this Epistle how to regard and treat the teachers of error."
5. "We are to have minds open to conviction. We are to love the truth, and always be ready to follow it."

## Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Thine elect sister" refers to the chosen ones, those who have been selected by God. This highlights the idea that being part of God's family is not based on blood relations, but on spiritual kinship.

2. The use of the word "elect" emphasizes the divine sovereignty in choosing and calling individuals to be part of His family. It reminds us that our inclusion in God's family is not based on our own merit, but on God's grace and purpose.

3. The mention of the deceased sister's children suggests the continuity of faith and the importance of passing down the knowledge and belief in God from one generation to the next. It underscores the significance of nurturing and guiding the younger members of the family in their spiritual journey.

## Adam Clarke:
1. "This epistle is more remarkable for the spirit of Christian love which it breathes than for anything else."
2. "The most remarkable part of it is the tenth and eleventh verses, 2 John 1:10; 2 John 1:11, relative to the orders concerning the heretical teacher."
3. "On this model, the conduct of all Christians should be formed, relative to the teachers of false doctrine in general."
