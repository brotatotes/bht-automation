# choicest prompt v1 X bht prompt v3; ['Henry Alford', 'Jamieson Fausset Brown', 'Albert Barnes', 'Marvin Vincent', 'John Calvin', 'Philip Schaff', 'Archibald T Robertson', 'Adam Clarke']

## Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Grace covers the sins of men; 'mercy,' their miseries. Grace must first do away with man's guilt before his misery can be relieved by mercy. Therefore grace stands before mercy." 
2. "Peace is the result of both, and therefore stands third in order. Casting all our care on the Lord, with thanksgiving, maintains this peace." 
3. "The element or sphere in which alone grace, mercy, and peace have place. He mentions truth in :-; love, in :-."

## Albert Barnes:
1. "The emphasis which is placed on the fact that the Lord Jesus Christ is 'the Son of the Father'...on the importance of recognizing that fact in order to the possession of true religion." 
2. "This phrase is...a prayer that they might be manifested to this family in promoting truth and love."
3. "He dwells much on the fact that the Lord Jesus is the Son of God."

These quotes highlight the significance of recognizing Jesus as the Son of God and the importance of truth and love in the Christian faith.

## Marvin Vincent:
1. "Grace is of rare occurrence in John's writings...and the kindred carizomai to favor, be kind, forgive, and carisma gift, are not found at all." 
2. "Mercy is kindness and goodwill toward the miserable and afflicted, joined with a desire to relieve them." 
3. "In the Divine mind, and in the order of our salvation as conceived therein, the mercy precedes the grace."

## Philip Schaff:
1. "Grace refers to the fountain of favour to undeserving man revealed in Christ; mercy to the individual application of that favour in the forgiveness of sins and the succour of all misery; peace to the result in the tranquillity of a soul one with God." 
2. "These blessings come from the Father through the Son of the Father; but the repetition of the ‘from’ makes emphatic the distinctness and equality of the Two Persons." 
3. "There is here an observable deviation from St. Paul’s formula; as also in the addition of ‘truth and love’ the two spheres or characteristics of the Christian life in which, though not on account of which, these blessings are imparted."

## Archibald T Robertson:
1. "The salutation is like that in the Pastoral Epistles: 'Χαρις, the wellspring in the heart of God; ελεος, its outpourings; ειρηνη, its blessed effect' (David Smith)."

2. "The repetition of παρα (with the ablative) is unique. 'It serves to bring out distinctly the twofold personal relation of man to the Father and to the Son' (Westcott)."

3. "'The Fatherhood of God, as revealed by one who being His Son can reveal the Father, and who as man (Ιησου) can make him known to men' (Brooke)."

2. "The Son of the Father" - The commentary highlights the apostle's focus on the miraculous conception of Christ, countering the denial of this doctrine by the Gnostics.
