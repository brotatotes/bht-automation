# 2 John 3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This verse emphasizes the interconnectedness of grace, mercy, and peace in the Christian faith. Grace removes guilt, mercy addresses our misery, and the result is peace. Peace is not just the absence of conflict but the assurance that we are God's children and that our ways are pleasing to Him. Through the recognition of Jesus as the Son of God, we can experience the fullness of these blessings and live in truth and love.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Grace covers the sins of men; 'mercy,' their miseries. Grace must first do away with man's guilt before his misery can be relieved by mercy. Therefore grace stands before mercy." 
2. "Peace is the result of both, and therefore stands third in order. Casting all our care on the Lord, with thanksgiving, maintains this peace." 
3. "The element or sphere in which alone grace, mercy, and peace have place. He mentions truth in :-; love, in :-."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The emphasis which is placed on the fact that the Lord Jesus Christ is 'the Son of the Father'...on the importance of recognizing that fact in order to the possession of true religion." 
2. "This phrase is...a prayer that they might be manifested to this family in promoting truth and love."
3. "He dwells much on the fact that the Lord Jesus is the Son of God."

These quotes highlight the significance of recognizing Jesus as the Son of God and the importance of truth and love in the Christian faith.

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Grace is of rare occurrence in John's writings...and the kindred carizomai to favor, be kind, forgive, and carisma gift, are not found at all." 
2. "Mercy is kindness and goodwill toward the miserable and afflicted, joined with a desire to relieve them." 
3. "In the Divine mind, and in the order of our salvation as conceived therein, the mercy precedes the grace."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Grace refers to the fountain of favour to undeserving man revealed in Christ; mercy to the individual application of that favour in the forgiveness of sins and the succour of all misery; peace to the result in the tranquillity of a soul one with God." 
2. "These blessings come from the Father through the Son of the Father; but the repetition of the ‘from’ makes emphatic the distinctness and equality of the Two Persons." 
3. "There is here an observable deviation from St. Paul’s formula; as also in the addition of ‘truth and love’ the two spheres or characteristics of the Christian life in which, though not on account of which, these blessings are imparted."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "The salutation is like that in the Pastoral Epistles: 'Χαρις, the wellspring in the heart of God; ελεος, its outpourings; ειρηνη, its blessed effect' (David Smith)."

2. "The repetition of παρα (with the ablative) is unique. 'It serves to bring out distinctly the twofold personal relation of man to the Father and to the Son' (Westcott)."

3. "'The Fatherhood of God, as revealed by one who being His Son can reveal the Father, and who as man (Ιησου) can make him known to men' (Brooke)."

### John Gill:
1. "Grace be with you, mercy [and] peace." - This salutation from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ is a common form used by the apostles. It is a prayer for the blessings of grace, mercy, and peace to be upon the recipients. (Word count: 34)

2. "He is the Son of the Father in truth and love." - The mention of Christ as the Son of the Father in truth and love serves to confirm his deity. It opposes the heretics of the time who denied his true and proper sonship. Christ is not figuratively or metaphorically the Son of God, but truly and naturally, sharing the same nature and perfections. (Word count: 50)

3. "He is God's own Son, in a true, proper, and natural sense." - Christ's sonship is not based on his office or role like magistrates who are called sons of God. He is God's well-beloved Son, the Son of His love, sharing the same nature and perfections. (Word count: 34)

### John Wesley:
1. "Grace takes away guilt; mercy, misery."
2. "Peace implies the abiding in grace and mercy."
3. "It includes the testimony of God's Spirit, both that we are his children, and that all our ways are acceptable to him."
