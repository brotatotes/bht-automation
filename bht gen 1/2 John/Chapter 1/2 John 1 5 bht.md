# choicest prompt v1 X bht prompt v3; ['Henry Alford', 'Jamieson Fausset Brown', 'Albert Barnes', 'Marvin Vincent', 'John Calvin', 'Philip Schaff', 'Archibald T Robertson', 'Adam Clarke']

## Henry Alford:
1. "This walking in truth is a walking after God’s commandments in love."
2. "ἐρωτῶ carries, as Schlichting, 'blandior quædam admonendi ratio:' with the assumed fact of a right thus to entreat."
3. "The expression of the commandment in the first person is a mark of gentleness and delicacy: a sign that he who wrote it kept the commandment himself."

## Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Love performs both tables of the law, and is the end of the law and the Gospel alike."
2. "This verse seems to me to decide that a Church, not an individual lady, is meant."
3. "For a man to urge a woman that he and she should love one another, is hardly like an apostolic precept, however pure may be the love enjoined; but all is clear if 'the lady' represent a Church."

## Albert Barnes:
1. "John presumed that the command to love one another was understood as far as the gospel was known; and he might well presume it, for true Christianity never prevails anywhere without prompting to the observance of this law."
2. "That we love one another - That is, that there be among the disciples of Christ mutual love; or that in all circumstances and relations they should love one another."
3. "This general command, addressed to all the disciples of the Saviour, John doubtless means to say was as applicable to him and to the pious female to whom he wrote as to any others, and ought to be exercised by them toward all true Christians."

## Marvin Vincent:
1. "New [καινην]. See on Matthew 26:29." 
2. "We had [ειχαμεν]. The apostle identifies himself with his readers." 
3. "The use of the word 'we' emphasizes the shared experience and unity between the apostle and his readers."

## Philip Schaff:
1. "The request has in it a tone of dignity as well as of courtesy." 
2. "The apostle urges his request, which is sheltered behind the evangelical law." 
3. "Let us all walk in love: this, as well as the whole strain, shows the same exquisite courtesy which pervades St. Paul’s letters to individuals."

## Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Beseech (ερωτω). For pray as in 1 John 5:16."
2. "Lady (κυρια). Vocative case and in the same sense as in 2 John 1:1."
3. "That we love one another (ινα αγαπωμεν αλληλους). Either a final clause after ερωτω as in John 17:15 or an object clause in apposition with εντολην, like 1 John 2:27; 1 John 3:23 and like verse 2 John 1:6."

## Adam Clarke:
1. "The commandment to love one another was what they had heard from the first publication of Christianity."
2. "He wishes this excellent woman to inculcate on all those under her care."
3. "The mode of address here shows that it was a person, not a Church, to which the apostle wrote."
