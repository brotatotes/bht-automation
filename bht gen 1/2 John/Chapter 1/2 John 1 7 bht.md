# choicest prompt v1 X bht prompt v3; ['Henry Alford', 'Jamieson Fausset Brown', 'Albert Barnes', 'Marvin Vincent', 'John Calvin', 'Philip Schaff', 'Archibald T Robertson', 'Adam Clarke']

## Henry Alford:
1. "The condition of Love is Truth."
2. "There are many deceivers gone forth, denying the Truth: of whom we are to beware, and not, by extending to them a spurious sympathy, to become partakers with them."
3. "He who denies the ἔρχεσθαι ἐν σαρκί, denies the possibility of the Incarnation: he who denies the ἐλθεῖν or ἐληλυθέναι, denies its actuality."
4. "This is the deceiver and the antichrist."

## Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Love and truth go hand in hand."
2. "He who denies Christ's coming in the flesh, denies the possibility of the incarnation."
3. "The denial of the reality of His manifestation in the flesh, at His first coming, and of His personal advent again, constitutes Antichrist."

## Albert Barnes:
1. "Because it is a truth that many deceivers have appeared, or since it has occurred that many such are abroad, look to yourselves lest you be betrayed and ruined."
2. "The fact that there were many such deceivers was a good reason for being constantly on their guard, lest they should be so far drawn away as not to receive a full reward."
3. "Everyone who maintains this is to be regarded as a deceiver."

## Marvin Vincent:
1. "Deceivers [πλανοι] . See on we deceive ourselves, 1 John 1:8."
2. "The article with the participle describes the character of this class of deceivers, and does not merely assert a definite fact concerning them."
3. "The verb is in the present participle, coming, which describes the manhood of Christ as still being manifested."

## Philip Schaff:
1. "There is no love which is not based on truth: the love which keeps the commandments keeps the doctrinal as well as the ethical commandments."
2. "As love is the strength of obedience, so it is the guardian of the truth."
3. "The supreme truth as truth is in Jesus is the incarnation."

These quotes highlight the connection between love, obedience, and truth. They emphasize that true love is rooted in truth and that love serves as both the strength of obedience and the protector of truth. Additionally, they highlight the significance of Jesus' incarnation as the ultimate truth.

## Archibald T Robertson:
1. "The articular participle describes the deceivers (πλανο)." 
2. "The Docetic Gnostics flatly denied [the Incarnation]." 
3. "The deceiver and the antichrist (ο πλανος κα ο αντιχριστος). Article with each word, as in Revelation 1:17, to bring out sharply each separate phrase, though one individual is referred to."

## Adam Clarke:
1. "For many deceivers...none could deny but a deceiver and an antichrist." 
2. "And these appear to have been Gnostics, for they denied that Jesus was come in the flesh." 
3. "The sense is nearly the same."


# BHT:
This verse warns about deceivers who deny the truth, particularly the incarnation of Jesus. These deceivers, described as antichrists, are to be guarded against, for they deny Jesus' fleshly manifestation. Denial of the incarnation is seen as a characteristic of these deceivers, whom none can deny are false and against Christ's teachings.
