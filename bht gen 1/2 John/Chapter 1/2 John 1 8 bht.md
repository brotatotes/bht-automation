# choicest prompt v1 X bht prompt v3; ['Henry Alford', 'Jamieson Fausset Brown', 'Albert Barnes', 'Marvin Vincent', 'John Calvin', 'Philip Schaff', 'Archibald T Robertson', 'Adam Clarke']

## Henry Alford:
1. "Look to yourselves, that ye lose not the things which we wrought." - The warning emphasizes the importance of preserving the Christian state of truth and love that the Apostles and Teachers had worked to establish in the believers.

2. "Receive reward in full." - The idea of receiving a reward is connected to the concept of the believers being the Apostles' reward in the day of the Lord. This suggests that the reward is the eternal life that will be completed and fulfilled on that day.

3. "The reward laid up for faithfulness, and for everything done in His name, must be understood, which is reckoned of grace, and not of debt." - The reward is not based on human merit or works, but on faithfulness and everything done in the name of Christ. It is a reward of grace, not something earned or owed.

## Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Look to yourselves — amidst the widespread prevalence of deception so many being led astray." 
2. "Look that ye lose not the believing state of 'truth and love,' which WE (as God’s workmen) were the instruments of working in you." 
3. "There are degrees of heavenly reward proportioned to the degrees of capability of receiving heavenly blessedness."

## Albert Barnes:
1. "When error abounds in the world, our first duty is not to attack it and make war upon it; it is to look to the citadel of our own souls, and see that all is well guarded there."
2. "The truth which is taught here is one of interest to all Christians - that it is possible for even genuine Christians, by suffering themselves to be led into error, or by failure in duty, to lose a part of the reward which they might have obtained."
3. "It is painful to think how many there are who begin the Christian career with burning zeal, as if they would strike for the highest rewards in heaven, but who soon waver in their course, and fall into some paralyzing error, until at last they receive, perhaps, not half the reward which they might have obtained."

## Marvin Vincent:
1. "Look to yourselves that [βλεπετε εαυτους ινα] . %Ina in order that, marks the intent of the caution." 
2. "We lose [απολεσωμεν] . The best texts read ajpoleshte, ye lose. So Rev, with destroy in margin. For the meanings of the verb see on Luke 9:25." 
3. "We receive [απολαβωμεν] . The best texts read ajpolabhte ye receive. The compounded preposition ajpo, has the force of back: receive back from God." 
4. "Reward [μισθον] . See on 2 Peter 2:13, and compare Matthew 5:12; John 4:36; 1 Corinthians 3:8; Revelation 11:18; Revelation 22:12."

## Philip Schaff:
1. "Look to yourselves: a rare expression, intimating the deep earnestness of the warning."
2. "The reward of Christian labour is a familiar idea in the New Testament."
3. "See that ye let not slip all the fruits of our teaching, and all the benefits of your Christian discipline, in the present world; see that hereafter ye be found worthy of the completed rewards of Christian fidelity."

## Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Look to yourselves" - The imperative form of the verb emphasizes the urgency and importance of self-examination. It is a call to be vigilant and attentive to one's own actions and attitudes.

2. "That ye lose not" - The negative purpose clause highlights the potential loss that could occur if one does not heed the call to self-examination. It implies that there is a danger of losing something valuable or significant.

3. "John does not wish his labour to be lost" - This statement reveals John's concern for the fruitfulness and impact of his work. It emphasizes the importance of preserving and safeguarding the results of one's efforts.

Overall, these quotes emphasize the need for self-reflection, the potential consequences of neglecting it, and the desire to protect and preserve the fruits of one's labor.

## Adam Clarke:
1. "Look to yourselves — Be on your guard against these seducers; watch, pray, love God and each other, and walk in newness of life." 
2. "That we lose not those things which we have wrought — That we apostles, who have been the means of your conversion, may not be deprived of you as our crown of rejoicing in the day of the Lord Jesus." 
3. "Take heed to yourselves that YE lose not the things which YE have wrought, but that YE receive a full reward."
