3. "The order in the text is the theological one, the Father being mentioned first, then the Son." - This quote clarifies the theological significance of mentioning the Father first and then the Son in the context of abiding in the doctrine of Christ.

## Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "The loss meant is here explained: the not having God, which results from abiding not in the doctrine of Christ." 

2. "Every one who takes the lead" - emphasizing the importance of following Christ's teachings and guidance. 

3. "He and He alone" - highlighting the exclusive role of Christ in providing access to God.

## Albert Barnes:
1. "The essential idea is, that the truth must be held respecting the precepts, the character, and the work of the Saviour."
2. "If anyone did not hold the true doctrine respecting the Saviour, he had no real knowledge of God."
3. "There is such an intimate union between the Father and the Son, that he who has just views of the one has also of the other."

## Marvin Vincent:
1. "The meaning is, whosoever advances beyond the limits of Christian doctrine."
2. "Such false progress is contrasted with abiding in the teaching."
3. "Not the teaching concerning Christ, but the teaching of Christ Himself and of His apostles."

## Philip Schaff:
1. "To abide in the doctrine of Christ is to remain content with His teaching or what He teaches; to go beyond it is to follow an imaginary development, and affect to be wiser than the Master Himself."
2. "The penalty is an awful one: one step beyond the commandment received in the beginning leads to the loss of God."
3. "But he that abideth in the doctrine, the same hath both the Father and the Son: the change is in St. John’s manner, from God generally to the Father and the Son."

## Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Every one who goes ahead. Προαγω literally means to go on before... but here the bad sense comes out by the parallel clause."
2. "Not the teaching about Christ, but that of Christ which is the standard of Christian teaching as the walk of Christ is the standard for the Christian's walk."
3. "Progress we all desire, but progress toward Christ, not away from him. Jesus Christ is still ahead of us all calling us to come on to him."

## Adam Clarke:
1. "He who passes over the sacred enclosure, or goes beyond the prescribed limits... hath not God for his Father, nor the love of God in his heart." 

2. "He who abideth in the doctrine of Christ, his body is a temple of the Holy Trinity, and he has communion with the Father as his Father, and with the Son as his Saviour and Redeemer." 

3. "Whosoever transgresseth... and abideth not in the doctrine... hath not God for his Father, nor the love of God in his heart."


# BHT:
Those who attempt to teach without abiding in the teachings of Christ lack a true understanding of God. However, those who remain faithful to the doctrine of Christ have a deep connection to both the Father and the Son. It is essential to recognize the significance of staying within the boundaries of the teachings of Christ rather than going beyond them. Through abiding in the true doctrine of Christ, one experiences the love of God and becomes a vessel for the Holy Trinity.
