## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "His mention of his original name accords with the design of this Second Epistle, which is to warn against the coming false teachers, by setting forth the true 'knowledge' of Christ on the testimony of the original apostolic eye-witnesses like himself."
2. "The divine election is as independent of man's control, as the lot which is cast forth."
3. "The degree of faith varies in different believers; but in respect to its objects, present justification, sanctification, and future glorification, it is common alike to all."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The name Simon, however, was his proper name - 'Peter,' or 'Cephas,' having been added to it by the Saviour." 
2. "The apostle addresses them all now, whatever was their origin, as heirs of the common faith, and as in all respects brethren."
3. "The Greek will undoubtedly bear the construction given in the margin; and if this be the true rendering, it furnishes an argument for the divinity of the Lord Jesus Christ."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The combined name, Simon Peter, is found Luke 5:8; John 13:6; John 20:2; John 21:15, and elsewhere, though in these instances it is given as Simon; Symeon occurring only in Acts 14:14."
2. "The word Christ never occurs in the second epistle without Jesus; and only in this instance without some predicate, such as Lord, Savior."
3. "Like precious [ισοτιμον]. Only here in New Testament. The word should be written like - precious. Compare precious in 1 Peter 1:7, 1 Peter 1:19; 1 Peter 2:4, 1 Peter 2:6, 1 Peter 2:7."

### John Calvin:
1. "Prayer takes the first place at the beginning of this Epistle, and then follows thanksgiving, by which he excites the Jews to gratitude, lest they should forget what great benefits they had already received from God’s hand."
2. "He intimates that he was not one from the rank of ministers, but was made by the Lord an apostle, and therefore superior to them."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The change in the personal designation of the author has been held by some to betray the spuriousness of the Epistle."

2. "The O.T. sense of δικαιοσυνη applied to God and here to Christ."
