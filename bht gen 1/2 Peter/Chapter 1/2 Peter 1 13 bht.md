# 2 Peter 1:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This verse emphasizes the role of admonition in reminding and stirring up believers to diligently perform their duties. The commentators stress the brevity of life and the frail nature of the body, which serves as a temporary dwelling for the soul. Admonition serves as a necessary means to combat spiritual apathy and complacency, urging believers to remember and actively engage in their faith. The urgency is heightened by the impending death of the apostle, who desires to leave a lasting impact through his teaching.
