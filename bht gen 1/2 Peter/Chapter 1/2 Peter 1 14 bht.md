# 2 Peter 1:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the author describes his impending death using metaphors of putting off a garment and removing from a tent to a palace. This imagery symbolizes the ease and lack of fear Peter has towards death, as well as the transition from the earthly realm to the heavenly realm. It is clear that Peter is aware of his approaching death, and he refers to Jesus' previous prophecy about it. The consistent theme throughout the commentaries is the understanding that death is not the end but a departure to a better place, and Peter's confidence in this truth.

1. "the putting off of my tabernacle, even as our Lord Jesus Christ declared to me" - This alludes to John 21:18, where Jesus predicts Peter's death. It signifies that Peter's death would be sudden and quick, not necessarily imminent.
2. "the putting off, whenever it did come, would be sudden and quick" - The sentence clarifies that the timing of Peter's death is uncertain, but when it does happen, it will be swift.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The idea of a ‘putting off’ (the word occurs only here and in 1 Peter 3:21), or denuding, which is applicable to a garment, takes the place of the striking or taking down which holds good of the ‘tent’ or ‘tabernacle.’" 
2. "The latter idea is favoured by the reference which immediately follows to what had been made known to Peter by Christ Himself." 
3. "It is entirely unnecessary to suppose, as is done by some, that Peter had received another special revelation, bearing on the time of his death."

3. "Signified unto me" - Peter is referring to the incident in which Jesus foretold Peter's death (John 21:18). This shows that Peter had personal knowledge of this prophecy before it was written down by John. It adds credibility to Peter's understanding of his impending death.

### John Gill:

2. "Saints are pilgrims here, they dwell in tents or tabernacles, at death they remove to their own country, and Father's house."
