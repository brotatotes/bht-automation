## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "They are, as Pott (in Huther), 'fabulæ ad decipiendos hominum animos artificiose excogitatæ atque exornatæ.'"
2. "Such cunningly-devised fables would be the mythologies of the heathen, the cabalistic stories of the Jews; and these may be alluded to, and perhaps also the fables of the Gnostics."
3. "The Writer of this Epistle, says De Wette, wishes to appear to stand in closer relation to his readers, than the writer of 1 Peter: cf. 1 Peter 1:12."
4. "The power...of our Lord Jesus Christ, but (in virtue of) having been admitted eye-witnesses of His majesty."
5. "It is indeed here that incident which marked, to the Apostle’s mind, most certainly the reality of Christ’s future glory: but it was not the only occasion when he had seen the exhibition of divine power by Him as a foretaste of His power at his return to judgment."

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "A precautionary protest of the Spirit against the rationalistic theory of the Gospel history being myth."
2. "A specimen of His power was given at the Transfiguration also of His 'coming' again, and its attendant glory."
3. "As initiated spectators of mysteries (so the Greek), we were admitted into His innermost secrets, namely, at the Transfiguration."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The doctrines which they held about the coming of the Saviour were not, like many of the opinions of the Greeks, defended by weak and sophistical reasoning, but were based on solid evidence - evidence furnished by the personal observation of competent witnesses."
2. "The apostles laid great stress on the second coming of the Saviour, and often dwelt upon it."
3. "The advent of the Saviour is commonly represented as connected with the exhibition of power... The 'power' evinced will be by raising the dead; summoning the world to judgment; determining the destiny of men, etc."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Cunningly devised...artfully framed by human cleverness." 
2. "The reference here may be to the Jewish myths, rabbinical embellishments of Old-Testament history; or to the heathen myths about the descent of the gods to earth, which might be suggested by his remembrance of the transfiguration; or to the Gnostic speculations about aeons or emanations."
3. "Eye-witnesses...Only here in New Testament."

### John Calvin:
1. "It gives us much courage, when we know that we labor in a matter that is certain."
2. "He denies that anything had been delivered by him but what was altogether true and indubitable."
3. "We now obtain certainty in another way; for though Christ has not risen before our eyes, yet we know by whom his resurrection has been handed down to us."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The 'follow' is expressed by a strong compound verb which occurs in no other book of the New Testament, and indeed only twice again (chap. 2 Peter 2:2; 2 Peter 2:15). It is supposed by some to convey the idea of following a false lead. But it expresses rather the closeness of the following." 
2. "The 'myths' are defined as 'cunningly devised,' or cleverly elaborated...Cranmer gives 'deceitful;' Tyndale and the Genevan 'deceivable.' There has been much dispute as to the particular myths which are in view...Probability lies, on the whole, on the side of this last view, particularly if the parallel statements in the Pastoral Epistles are found to suit best as warnings against the 'common Judaizing tendency, and an unspiritual, Pharisaic study of the Old Testament, disputatious cleaving to the letter, and losing itself in useless hair-splittings and rabbinical fables.'" 
3. "The term 'coming,' which means literally 'presence,' does not denote, as is supposed by some good interpreters, either Christ's earthly life or His Nativity...Here, as in chap. 2 Peter 3:4, Matthew 24:3; Matthew 24:27, 1 Corinthians 15:23, 1 Corinthians 15:1 Thess. 3:19, etc., it expresses His Second Advent, His return in judgment."

### John Gill:
1. "For we have not followed cunningly devised fables...." - The commentary highlights the caution against Jewish and Gentile fables, emphasizing the need to distinguish the truth from false teachings and myths.

2. "Now in order to set forth the nature, excellency, and certainty of the doctrine the apostle taught...he observes, that he and his fellow apostles did not proceed in their account of it on such a foundation, but upon an evidence which they had received, both with their eyes and ears..." - The commentary emphasizes the apostles' reliance on firsthand experience and evidence, highlighting the credibility of their teachings.
