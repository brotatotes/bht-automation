# choicest prompt v1 X bht prompt v3; ['Henry Alford', 'Jamieson Fausset Brown', 'Albert Barnes', 'Marvin Vincent', 'John Calvin', 'Philip Schaff', 'Archibald T Robertson', 'Adam Clarke']

## Henry Alford:
1. "we possess, more secure...the prophetic word, as now having in our own ears begun its fulfilment."
2. "the written word of God, inspired into and transmitted through men, as something firmer, more secure, than the uttered voice of God Himself"
3. "the testimony of the Transfiguration presented only the glory of Christ in the days of His flesh, whereas the prophetic word substantiates His future glory also."

## Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Prophecy assures us that Christ's sufferings, now past, are to be followed by Christ's glory, still future: the Transfiguration gives us a pledge to make our faith still stronger, that 'the day' of His glory will 'dawn' ere long."
2. "The word was the 'lamp (Greek for 'light') heeded' by Old Testament believers, until a gleam of the 'day dawn' was given at Christ's first coming, and especially in His Transfiguration."
3. "The day, when it dawns upon you, makes sure the fact that you saw correctly, though indistinctly, the objects revealed by the lamp."

## Albert Barnes:
1. "The prophecies are numerous, and by their number they furnish a stronger proof than could be afforded by a single manifestation, however clear and glorious."
2. "They were 'recorded,' and might be the subject of careful comparison with the events as they occurred."
3. "The prophecies resemble a candle, lamp, or torch, in a dark room, or in an obscure road at night. They make objects distinct which were before unseen; they enable us to behold many things which would be otherwise invisible."

## Marvin Vincent:
1. "We have the word of prophecy made more sure, i.e., we are better certified than before as to the prophetic word by reason of this voice." 
2. "Old - Testament testimony is more convincing than even the voice heard at the transfiguration." 
3. "Peter knew a sounder basis for faith than that of signs and wonders. He had seen our Lord Jesus Christ receive honor and glory from God the Father in the holy mount... but, nevertheless, even when his memory and heart are throbbing with recollections of that sublime scene, he says, 'we have something surer still in the prophetic word.'"

## John Calvin:
1. "The truth of the gospel is founded on the oracles of the prophets."
2. "The whole course of our life ought to be guided by God’s word."
3. "The Scripture has not been in vain called a light."

## Philip Schaff:
1. "The prophetic word...Old Testament Scripture itself as a whole, or the sum of Old Testament prophecy regarding Christ." 
2. "The comparison...between the exceptional testimony of the heavenly voice and the familiar testimony of Israel’s ancient Scriptures."
3. "The prophetic word to which believers are to give earnest heed is a lamp which is to go on shining until the Christ of whom it testifies appears."

## Archibald T Robertson:
1. "The Transfiguration scene confirmed the Messianic prophecies and made clear the deity of Jesus Christ as God's Beloved Son."
2. "Peter means that the word of prophecy is a surer confirmation of Christ's deity than the Transfiguration."
3. "Take heed to the prophetic word made more sure, as unto a lamp shining in a dark place, until the day dawn and the day-star arise."

## Adam Clarke:
1. "We have the prophetic doctrine more firm or more confirmed." 
2. "The voice, therefore, from heaven, and the miraculous transfiguration of his person, have confirmed the prophetic doctrine concerning him." 
3. "The prophecies concerning Jesus, which have been so signally confirmed to us on the holy mount, have always been as a light shining in a dark place."


# BHT:
The Bible verse being described is an affirmation of the credibility and importance of the prophetic word. The commentators emphasize that the written word of God, transmitted through men, is even more trustworthy than the audible voice of God Himself. They note that the prophecies provide a solid foundation for faith, serving as a lamp that illuminates unseen truths and confirms the glory of Christ. The Transfiguration event, although significant, is seen as a pledge and a confirmation of the prophetic word, which remains a constant light guiding us until the day of Christ's glory arises.
