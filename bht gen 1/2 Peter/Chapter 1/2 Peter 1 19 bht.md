# 2 Peter 1:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Bible verse describes the power and significance of the prophetic word. It emphasizes how the written word of God is even more secure and reliable than the voice of God Himself. The verse also contrasts the Transfiguration, which revealed Christ's glory in the present, with the prophetic word that substantiates His future glory as well. The prophecies in the Bible give us a clearer understanding of God's plan, like a lamp shining in a dark room, illuminating unseen truths and guiding our faith.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "we possess, more secure, the prophetic word, as now having in our own ears begun its fulfilment."
2. "the written word of God, inspired into and transmitted through men, as something firmer, more secure, than the uttered voice of God Himself?"
3. "the testimony of the Transfiguration presented only the glory of Christ in the days of His flesh, whereas the prophetic word substantiates His future glory also."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Prophecy assures us that Christ's sufferings, now past, are to be followed by Christ's glory, still future: the Transfiguration gives us a pledge to make our faith still stronger, that 'the day' of His glory will 'dawn' ere long."
2. "The word was the 'lamp (Greek for 'light') heeded' by Old Testament believers, until a gleam of the 'day dawn' was given at Christ's first coming, and especially in His Transfiguration."
3. "The day, when it dawns upon you, makes sure the fact that you saw correctly, though indistinctly, the objects revealed by the lamp."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The prophecies are numerous, and by their number they furnish a stronger proof than could be afforded by a single manifestation, however clear and glorious."
2. "They were 'recorded,' and might be the subject of careful comparison with the events as they occurred."
3. "The prophecies resemble a candle, lamp, or torch, in a dark room, or in an obscure road at night. They make objects distinct which were before unseen; they enable us to behold many things which would be otherwise invisible."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "We have the word of prophecy made more sure, i.e., we are better certified than before as to the prophetic word by reason of this voice." 
2. "Old - Testament testimony is more convincing than even the voice heard at the transfiguration."
3. "Peter knew a sounder basis for faith than that of signs and wonders. He had seen our Lord Jesus Christ receive honor and glory from God the Father in the holy mount; he had been dazzled and carried out of himself by visions and voices from heaven; but, nevertheless, even when his memory and heart are throbbing with recollections of that sublime scene, he says, 'we have something surer still in the prophetic word.'"

### John Calvin:
1. "The truth of the gospel is founded on the oracles of the prophets."
2. "The whole course of our life ought to be guided by God's word."
3. "The Scripture has not been in vain called a light."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "and we have the prophetic word made more sure." 
2. "we have something surer still, namely the prophetic word." 
3. "the prophetic word must be attended to until the present imperfect measure of grace and knowledge in the believer gives place to an immediate perception and clear assurance."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The Transfiguration scene confirmed the Messianic prophecies and made clear the deity of Jesus Christ as God's Beloved Son."
2. "Peter means that the word of prophecy is a surer confirmation of Christ's deity than the Transfiguration."
3. "Take heed to the prophetic word made more sure, holding your mind upon it as unto a lamp shining in a dark place until the day dawn and the day-star arise."

### John Gill:
1. "We have also a more sure word of prophecy... the comparison lies between this word of prophecy, and the testimony of the apostles, who were eye and ear witnesses of the majesty and glory of Christ."
2. "The word of prophecy, concerning Christ's second coming, is here intended... Christ's prophecy or prediction, that so it 'should' be, more strongly ascertained it."
3. "Prophecy holds out clearly that Christ will come again... prophecy is the surest evidence and best light the saints have concerning this matter."

These quotes highlight the comparison between the word of prophecy and the testimony of the apostles, the certainty of prophecy regarding Christ's second coming, and the importance of prophecy as the best evidence for believers.

### John Wesley:
1. "The words of Moses, Isaiah, and all the prophets, are one and the same word, every way consistent with itself."
2. "To which word ye do well that ye take heed, as to a lamp which shone in a dark place - Wherein there was neither light nor window."
3. "Till the full light of the gospel should break through the darkness. As is the difference between the light of a lamp and that of the day, such is that between the light of the Old Testament and of the New."
