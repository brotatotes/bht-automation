## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Not suffering your godliness to be moroseness, nor a sullen solitary habit of life, but kind and generous and courteous."
2. "Universal kindness of thought, word, and act towards all: a catholic large-heartedness, not confining the spirit of φιλαδελφία to ἀδελφοί only."
3. "So that these two last correspond to the ἀγάπη εἰς ἀλλήλους καὶ εἰς πάντας of 1 Thessalonians 3:12."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Your natural affection and brotherly kindness are to be sanctified by godliness."
2. "From brotherly kindness we are to go forward to love."
3. "In a retrograde order, he who has love will exercise brotherly kindness; he who has brotherly kindness will feel godliness needful; the godly will mix nothing stoical with his patience; to the patient, temperance is easy; the temperate weighs things well, and so has knowledge; knowledge guards against sudden impulse carrying away its virtue."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Love to Christians as such."
2. "There is to be a special affection for Christians as of the same family."
3. "There is to be a true and warm love, however, for all the race."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "In the former Epistle the grace of brotherly-love has a still more prominent place assigned to it... Here it is the complement to 'godliness,' keeping it in living connection with what is due to our brethren, and saving our regard for God and His claims from becoming an apology for neglecting His children and their interests."

2. "Our love, it is meant, strongly as it should beat within the Christian household, ought not to be confined to that, but should enlarge itself into a catholic interest in all men."

3. "It is enough to notice how these graces are made to blend into each other, each being in the other 'like adjoining colours of the rainbow, mingled with it, and exhibited along with it'."

### John Gill:
1. "Without brotherly kindness, godliness is a vain show; for it is both the evidence of regeneration and the beauty, comfort, and security of Christian society and worship." 
2. "Charity, or love, extends to all men, including enemies, and encompasses love towards God, Christ, and His house, worship, ordinances, people, and truths."
