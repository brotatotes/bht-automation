# 2 Peter 1:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Those who lack the virtues and graces described in this verse are blind and spiritually shortsighted. They fail to perceive the truth and requirements of religion. Their vision is limited to earthly and temporal things, unable to grasp the beauty and abundance that God offers. This forgetfulness of the cleansing and forgiveness of their sins leads to a lack of understanding and appreciation for the promises of God's love and the hope of eternal life.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The advantage of the presence is great, for the disadvantage of the absence indicates no less than spiritual blindness and oblivion."
2. "He to whom these are not present is blind, lacks discernment altogether of his own state as a member or Christ and inheritor of heaven."
3. "Having incurred forgetfulness of the purification of his former sins, i.e. of the fact of his ancient, pre-Christian, sins having been purged away in his baptism."

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Confirming the need of these graces by the fatal consequences of the want of them."
2. "He closes his eyes as unable to see distant objects (namely, heavenly things), and fixes his gaze on present and earthly things which alone he can see."
3. "The continually present sense of one's sins having been once for all forgiven, is the strongest stimulus to every grace."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He that lacketh these things is blind - He has no clear views of the nature and the requirements of religion."
2. "He is like one who has an indistinct vision; one who can see only the objects that are near him, but who has no correct apprehension of objects that are more remote."
3. "He does not remember the obligation which grows out of the fact that a system has been devised to purify the heart, and that he has been so far brought under the power of that system as to have his sins forgiven."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "He that lacketh these things... denotes them now as merely present with him." 
2. "Blind... short-sighted spiritually; seeing only things present and not heavenly things."
3. "And hath forgotten... marks the advanced years of the writer, since he adds to failure of sight the failure of memory."

Note: The commentary is about 2 Peter 1:9.

### John Calvin:
1. "They go astray like the blind in darkness, because they do not see the right way which is shewn to us by the light of the gospel."
2. "Those who do not strive for a pure and holy life do not understand even the first rudiments of faith."
3. "Though, then, we daily sin, and God daily forgives us, and the blood of Christ cleanses us from our sins, yet sin ought not to rule in us, but the sanctification of the Spirit ought to prevail in us."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "These graces are to be cultivated; for, if we have them not, we become blind, and ‘sink back into a want of power to perceive even the elementary truths of the kingdom of God’ (Plumptre)."
2. "He is ‘blind,’ not seeing when he thinks he sees, not seeing certain things as he ought to see them. And he is this not in the sense of being ‘blind’ to all things, but in the sense of being ‘nearsighted,’ seeing things in false magnitudes, having an eye for things present and at hand, but none for the distant realities of the eternal world."
3. "The ‘sins of old’ are said to have been purified in the sense of having had the uncleanness belonging to them cleansed away, or their guilt removed. The phrase carries us back to the Old Testament custom of sprinkling blood on objects which had become defiled, and so relieving them of the disadvantages of their ceremonial uncleanness."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Seeing only what is near (μυωπαζων). Present active participle of μυωπαζω, a rare verb from μυωπς (in Aristotle for a near-sighted man) and that from μυεω τους ωπας (to close the eyes in order to see, not to keep from seeing). The only other instance of μυωπαζω is given by Suicer from Ps. Dion. Eccl. Hier. ii. 3 (μυωπασουση κα αποστρεφομενη) used of a soul on which the light shines (blinking and turning away). Thus understood the word here limits τυφλος as a short-sighted man screwing up his eyes because of the light." 

2. "Having forgotten (ληθην λαβων). 'Having received forgetfulness.' Second aorist active participle of λαμβανω and accusative ληθην, old word, from ληθομα, to forget, here only in N.T. See 2 Timothy 1:5 for a like phrase υπομνησιν λαβων (having received remembrance)." 

3. "The cleansing (του καθαρισμου). See Hebrews 1:3 for this word for the expiatory sacrifice of Christ for our sins as in 1 Peter 1:18; 1 Peter 2:24; 1 Peter 3:18. In 1 Peter 3:21 Peter denied actual cleansing of sin by baptism (only symbolic). If there is a reference to baptism here, which is doubtful, it can only be in a symbolic sense."

### John Gill:
1. "He only professes to know him in words, while in works he denies him."
2. "He has no true sight of his beauty, suitableness, and fulness, and of him for himself."
3. "He sees nothing but outward things, the things of time and sense, worldly and earthly things, which are near him, and all around him, which he minds, on which his heart is set, and he pursues with rigour."

### John Wesley:
1. "He that wanteth these...is blind...He cannot see God, or his pardoning love."
2. "He has lost sight of the precious promises: perfect love and heaven are equally out of his sight."
3. "Having, as it were, forgot the purification from his former sins - Scarce knowing what he himself then felt, when his sins were forgiven."
