# 2 Peter 2:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
False teachers, with their deceptive tactics and hidden agendas, introduce destructive heresies that undermine the foundations of faith. They deny the authority of the Lord and spread divisive teachings, leading to the ruin of both themselves and those who follow them. These false prophets exist throughout history and their presence serves as a test of faith, examining whether believers truly love God. We must remain vigilant against their deceitful schemes and hold fast to the truth of Christ's redemption. (2 Peter 2:1)
