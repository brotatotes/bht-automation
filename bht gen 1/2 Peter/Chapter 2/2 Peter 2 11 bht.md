## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Angels, being greater in strength and might, bring not against them before the Lord a railing judgment." This highlights the superior nature of angels and emphasizes the unbecomingness of humans bringing accusations against them.

2. "The thought is not a lame one, but shows forcibly the unbecomingness of their irreverence, seeing that even angels who are so far above them yet do not bring railing accusations against δόξαι." This further emphasizes the contrast between the behavior of humans and angels, highlighting the inappropriate nature of human accusations.

3. "The vulg. rendering, ‘adversum se,’ is clearly wrong." This comment critiques a specific translation and suggests that it is incorrect, providing insight into the proper understanding of the verse.

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Judgment belongs to God, not the angels. How great is the dignity of the saints who, as Christ's assessors, shall hereafter judge angels!"
2. "If superior angels dare not, as being in the presence of God, the Judge, speak evil even of the bad angels, how awful the presumption of those who speak evil blasphemously of good 'dignities.'"
3. "The angels who sinned still retain the indelible impress of majesty. Satan is still 'a strong man': 'prince of this world'; and under him are 'principalities, powers, rulers of the darkness of this world.' We are to avoid irreverence in regard to them, not on their account, but on account of God."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The object, by the reference to angels here, is to show that they, even when manifesting the greatest zeal in a righteous cause, and even when opposing others, did not make use of reproachful terms, or of harsh and violent language."
2. "Whatever may have been the origin of this tradition, no one can doubt that what is here said of the angels accords with probability, and no one can prove that it is not true."
3. "They abhor all scurrility and violence of language; they simply state matters as they are."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The radical idea of ijscuv, might, is that of indwelling strength, especially as embodied: might which inheres in physical powers organized and working under individual direction, as an army."
2. "Dunamiv is rather ability, faculty: not necessarily manifest, as ijscuv: power residing in one by nature."
3. "Generally, then, it may be said that while both words include the idea of manifestation or of power in action, ijscuv emphasizes the outward, physical manifestations, and dunamiv the inward, spiritual or moral virtue."

### John Calvin:
1. "He hence shews their rash arrogance, because they dared to assume more liberty than even angels."
2. "For all the magistrates were then ungodly, and bloody enemies to the gospel. They must, therefore, have been hateful to angels, the guardians of the Church."
3. "While such moderation, he says, is shewn by angels, these men fearlessly give vent to impious and unbridled blasphemies."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The most reasonable explanation, however, seems to be that even angels, who so far excel men, do not presume themselves to speak in terms of railing judgment against even offenders like these ‘darers.’" 
2. "The reckless, impious audacity of the latter is thus presented in the darkest possible colours by being set over against the reverent regard for authority which in all circumstances characterizes the former." 
3. "From the Rabbinical writings and the Apocryphal books we can gather how large a mass of popular and traditional lore grew up from an early period around many points of Old Testament doctrine."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Loose use of οπου (in Xenophon) = 'wherein.'" 
2. "Concessive participle and comparative adjective." 
3. "'Blasphemous accusation.'"

### John Gill:
1. "Which is not to be understood of evil angels, or devils...but of good angels, who excel in strength, who are not only guardians to particular men, and encamp about the saints, but preside over provinces and kingdoms."
2. "And yet these bring not railing accusation against them before the Lord; either 'against themselves', against one another, or against civil magistrates, kings, and princes of this world."
3. "Since angels, who are so much above men, even above the most dignified among them, behave in this manner, it must be an aggravation of the sin of these persons, who are so much below them, to speak evil of them."

### John Wesley:
1. "Angels, when they appear before the Lord, give an account of what they have seen and done on the earth." 

2. "The presence of angels in the heavenly court signifies their role as messengers and servants of God, constantly observing and reporting back to Him."
