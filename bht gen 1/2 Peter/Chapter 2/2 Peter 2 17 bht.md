# 2 Peter 2:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
These Bible verses depict individuals who present themselves as trustworthy and knowledgeable, but their true nature is revealed through their lack of substance and deceitful behavior. They are likened to fountains without water and clouds that do not bring rain, promising refreshment and nourishment but failing to deliver. These false teachers exploit people's hopes and expectations, offering empty promises that leave them disappointed and ultimately leading them away from genuine spiritual nourishment. The dark fate that awaits these deceivers is described as a blackness of darkness, highlighting the seriousness and permanence of their judgment.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Nothing to an oriental mind would be more expressive than to say of professed religious teachers, that they were 'wells without water.' It was always a sad disappointment to a traveler in the hot sands of the desert to come to a well where it was expected that water might be found, and to find it dry." 

2. "The cloud, as it rises, promises rain. The expectation of the farmer is excited that the thirsty earth is to be refreshed with needful showers. Instead of this, however, the wind 'gets into' the cloud; it is driven about, and no rain falls, or it ends in a destructive tornado which sweeps everything before it. So of these religious teachers."

3. "The word rendered 'mist' here, (ζόφος zophos,) means properly muskiness, thick gloom, darkness, and the phrase 'mist of darkness' is designed to denote 'intense' darkness, or the thickest darkness. It refers undoubtedly to the place of future punishment, which is often represented as a place of intense darkness."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Without water. As so often in the East, where the verdure excites the traveler's hope of water." 
2. "The correct reading is oJmiclai, mists, found only here in New Testament. So Rev." 
3. "The word occurs only twice elsewhere - Mark 4:37; Luk 7:23 - in the parallel accounts of the storm on the lake, which Jesus calmed by his word."

### John Calvin:
1. "He shews by these two metaphors, that they had nothing within, though they made a great display."
2. "He says that they were like fountains, because they excelled in boasting, and displayed some acuteness in their thoughts and elegance in their words; but that yet they were dry and barren within."
3. "He thereby denotes that they brought nothing useful, and that often they were very hurtful."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "It is rather in respect simply of the pretence which they make, and the deception which they practise, that they are likened to waterless springs." 
2. "Like the drifting mist-clouds, presaging rain to refresh the earth and enrich the husbandman, which suddenly vanish and leave bitter disappointment to the expectant, when they are caught up by the tempest, so these teachers excite delusive hopes by lofty promises which leave nothing behind them." 
3. "It asserts the Divine certainty, the hopelessness, the perpetuity of the doom of these apostates."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Without water (ανυδρο). As in Matthew 12:43; Luke 11:24. Old word for common and disappointing experience of travellers in the orient."

2. "Driven by a storm (υπο λαιλαπος ελαυνομενα). Λαιλαπς is a squall (Mark 4:37; Luke 8:23, only other N.T. examples). See James 3:4 for another example of ελαυνω for driving power of wind and waves."

3. "The blackness (ο ζοφος). See verse 2 Peter 2:4 for this word."

### John Gill:
1. "These men looked like angels of light, transformed themselves as ministers of righteousness, had a form of godliness, and boasted of their great knowledge." 
2. "False teachers may be compared to clouds for their number, for many antichrists and false prophets soon came into the world; and for their sudden rise in the churches, into which they crept privily and unawares." 
3. "The nature of their punishment is expressed by 'darkness', the blackest darkness, the mist of darkness, and which Jude calls blackness of darkness, the same with utter darkness."

### John Wesley:
1. "Fountains and clouds promise water: so do these promise, but do not perform." This quote highlights the deceptive nature of empty promises, comparing them to fountains and clouds that appear to hold water but ultimately fail to deliver. 

2. "Just as fountains and clouds are meant to provide water, these empty promises are meant to fulfill a need or desire, but they ultimately leave us empty and disappointed." This quote emphasizes the purpose of promises, which is to fulfill a need or desire, but warns that empty promises only lead to disappointment.

3. "Like fountains and clouds, empty promises may give us hope and anticipation, but they lack substance and cannot quench our thirst or provide the sustenance we need." This quote draws a parallel between the temporary hope and anticipation created by empty promises and the inability of fountains and clouds to provide the sustenance we truly need.
