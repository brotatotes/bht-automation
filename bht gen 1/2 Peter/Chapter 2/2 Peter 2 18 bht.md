# 2 Peter 2:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse being described emphasizes the allure and danger of sin, as individuals are ensnared by their own fleshly desires and tempted to indulge in immoral behavior. These individuals, who were once free from the bondage of sin, have now been drawn back into its clutches. The verse sheds light on the deceptive tactics used by false teachers, who employ high-sounding words to entice and deceive others into following their erroneous teachings. Despite the perilous situation, there is a distinction between those who have barely escaped from error and those who remain firmly rooted in the truth.

### Marvin Vincent:

2. "Fqeggomenoi, uttering, is significantly applied alike to Balaam's beast and to these empty declaimers."

### John Calvin:
1. "They made words unheard of before, by the empty sound of which, the unlearned being smitten, they were ensnared by their reveries."
2. "For they treat all things jocosely and scoffingly; and though they are great simpletons, yet as they indulge in all vices, they find favor with their own people by a sort of drollery."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The verb used for ‘speaking’ is one which occurs in the New Testament only in Acts 4:18, and in these two verses (Acts 4:16; Acts 4:18) of the present chapter. It usually expresses loud utterance, e.g. the scream of the eagle, the neighing of the horse, the speech of orators, the battle-cry of warriors, the recitative of a chorus. Hence its fitness here in reference to men who indulge in high-sounding, empty, grandiloquent statements."
2. "The ‘lusts of the flesh’ are the sphere within which they live and act. The ‘wantonnesses,’ or ‘acts of lasciviousness,’ are the instruments which they use within that sphere. The action ascribed to them is that of enticing as with a bait."
3. "The guilt of those apostate teachers, therefore, is exhibited as aggravated by the fact that the persons whom they plied with the vile bait of sensual indulgence were those least fit to resist it, not men who were established in the new faith, but men who had but recently broken off from the ranks of heathenism, or who had as yet got but a few paces, as it were, in the process of separating themselves from their old pagan life."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Great swelling words (υπερογκα)...swelling above and beyond" - This quote highlights the compound adjective used in the verse, emphasizing the excessive and exaggerated nature of the words being spoken.

2. "By lasciviousness (ασελγειαις)...by lascivious acts" - This quote explains the instrumental plural form used in the verse, indicating that these empty words are accompanied by immoral and indulgent behavior.

3. "Those who are just escaping (τους ολιγως αποφευγοντας)...clean escaped" - This quote discusses the different readings of the Greek text, highlighting the idea that these individuals have only recently and narrowly escaped the influence of false teachings.

These quotes provide insights into the language used in the verse, the behavior associated with the empty words, and the precarious state of those who have recently turned away from error.

### John Gill:
1. "Marvellous things against the God of gods, great things and blasphemies against God, his name, his tabernacle, and his saints."
2. "Express the windiness of their doctrines, and the bombast style, and high flown strains of rhetoric in which they were delivered."
3. "By the carnal lusts and liberties, lasciviousness and wantonness, which these false teachers indulged, they were allured, ensnared, and drawn by them into their wicked principles and practices."

### John Wesley:
1. "They ensnare in the desires of the flesh" - This quote highlights how the individuals being referred to in the verse are trapped and controlled by their sinful desires. It emphasizes the power that these desires have over them and the negative consequences that result from giving in to them.

2. "Allowing them to gratify some unholy desire" - This quote further emphasizes the idea that those being discussed in the verse are indulging in sinful behavior. It suggests that they are actively seeking out opportunities to fulfill their unholy desires, regardless of the negative impact it may have on their lives.

3. "Those who were before entirely escaped from the spirit, custom, and company of them that live in error" - This quote highlights the contrast between the individuals who have fallen back into sinful behavior and those who have managed to escape it.
