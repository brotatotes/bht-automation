# 2 Peter 2:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
False teachers promise people freedom from the law, but they themselves are enslaved to their own corrupt desires. These deceivers offer a counterfeit liberty, appealing to the human desire for freedom while leading others into the bondage of sin. However, true freedom is found in Christ, who delivers us from the dominion of sin and offers a genuine liberty through the truth. It is important to discern between the false promises of sinful freedom and the genuine freedom found in Christ.
