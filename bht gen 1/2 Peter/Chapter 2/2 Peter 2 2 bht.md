# 2 Peter 2:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The way of truth, as described by commentators, is often marred by the presence of false teachings and immoral conduct within the Christian community. This is a cause of scandal and brings reproach upon the name of Christ. The challenge lies in distinguishing between true followers of Christ and those who only claim to be, as the mixture of true and false Christians can lead to confusion and negative perceptions. Discernment and careful judgment are needed to navigate the complexities of the Christian faith and uphold the integrity of the Gospel.
