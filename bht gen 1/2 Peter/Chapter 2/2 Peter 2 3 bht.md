# 2 Peter 2:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
False teachers motivated by greed will manipulate their followers for personal gain and use deceptive words to allure them. They face imminent destruction as the judgment against them has been ordained from long ago and will be executed without delay. These unprincipled individuals exploit their followers, treating them as commodities to be sold, while disregarding the impending condemnation that awaits them. Their wicked actions serve as a stark reminder that all sinners will ultimately face destruction, a testament to God's justice.

It advances still, strong and vigilant as when first it sprang from the bosom of God, and will not fail to reach the mark to which it was pointed from of old' (Salmond and Lillie)."
