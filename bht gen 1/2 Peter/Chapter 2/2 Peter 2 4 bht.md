# 2 Peter 2:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse being described talks about how God did not spare even the highest and most respected of beings, the angels. These angels, who were initially clothed in honor, were cast down to the depths of hell for their sin and rebellion. They were bound by chains of darkness, imprisoned in a place called Tartarus, awaiting the day of judgment. This punishment serves as a warning to false teachers who think they can escape God's justice. Even though these fallen angels are confined, they still attempt to wreak havoc and deceive humanity whenever they can.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "For their sin, God cast the apostate angels into hell, delivering them over to dens of darkness in custody unto judgment." 
2. "The word 'Tartarus' is used as equivalent to 'Gehenna' and the verb 'casting' is used with an implied idea of punishment." 
3. "The angels are kept in custody, being held until the time of judgment."

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "If God in past time has punished the ungodly and saved His people, He will be sure to do so also in our days."
2. "Angels—the highest of intelligent creatures, yet not spared when they sinned."
3. "Slaves of Tartarus may also come upon earth. Step by step they are given to Tartarus, until at last they shall be wholly bound to it."
4. "They are 'reserved' unto hell's 'mist of darkness' as their final 'judgment' or doom, and meanwhile their exclusion from the light of heaven is begun."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Neither their former rank, their dignity, nor their holiness, saved them from being thrust down to hell; and if God punished them so severely, then false teachers could not hope to escape."
2. "The word here used occurs nowhere else in the New Testament, though it is common in the Classical writers. It is a verb formed from Τάρταρος Tartaros, Tartarus, which in Greek mythology was the lower part, or abyss of Hades, ᾍδης Hadēs, where the shades of the wicked were supposed to be imprisoned and tormented."
3. "The representation here is taken from that fact. This representation that the mass of fallen angels are confined in 'Tartarus,' or in hell, is not inconsistent with the representations which elsewhere occur that their leader is permitted to roam the earth, and that even many of those spirits are allowed to tempt men."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "It is strange to find Peter using this Pagan term, which represents the Greek hell, though treated here not as equivalent to Gehenna, but as the place of detention until the judgment."
2. "Chains of darkness. Seira is a cord or band, sometimes of metal. The best texts, however, substitute pits or caverns."
3. "Originally of the gloom of the nether world, So Homer: 'These halls are full Of shadows hastening down to Erebus Amid the gloom [υπο ζοφον].' Odyssey, 20, 355."

### John Calvin:
1. "God is the judge of the whole world. It hence follows that the punishment he formerly inflicted on the ungodly and wicked, he will now also inflict on the like characters." 
2. "For he can never be unlike himself, nor does he show respect of persons, so as to forgive the same wickedness in one which he has punished in another; but he hates injustice and wrong equally, whenever it is found."
3. "The argument is from the greater to the less; for they [angels] were far more excellent than we are, and yet their dignity did not preserve them from the hand of God; much less then can mortal men escape, when they follow them in their impiety."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Even the class of angels as such were not spared when sin entered among them."
2. "Having cast them down into hell (bound) with chains of darkness, committed them as in reserve unto judgment."
3. "The term itself, in either form, occurs only this once in the N. T. The word here used for ‘darkness’ is found again only in 2 Peter 2:17 and in Jude 1:6; Jude 1:13."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Condition of the first class precisely like that in Romans 11:21 save that here the normal apodosis (υμων ου φεισετα) is not expressed as there, but is simply implied in verse 2 Peter 2:9 by οιδεν κυριος ρυεσθα (the Lord knows how to deliver) after the parenthesis in verse 2 Peter 2:8." 
2. "Ταρταρος occurs in Enoch 20:2 as the place of punishment of the fallen angels, while Gehenna is for apostate Jews." 
3. "Ζοφος (kin to γνοφοσ, νεφος) is an old word, blackness, gloom of the nether world in Homer, in N.T. only here, verse 2 Peter 2:17; Judges 1:13; Hebrews 12:18."

### John Gill:
1. "Their first sin was thought to be pride, affecting a likeness to, or an equality with God; since this was what man was tempted to by them, and by which he fell, as they are thought to do."
2. "The good angels that stand greatly love, value, esteem, and pry into the truths of the Gospel; particularly the scheme of man's salvation, by the incarnation, obedience, sufferings, and death of Christ."
3. "They were not merely bid to go away, or were 'drove' out, but 'cast down' with great power, indignation, wrath, and contempt, never to be raised and restored again."

### John Wesley:
1. "Cast them down to hell — The bottomless pit, a place of unknown misery."
2. "Delivered them — Like condemned criminals to safe custody, as if bound with the strongest chains in a dungeon of darkness, to be reserved unto the judgment of the great day."
3. "Though still those chains do not hinder their often walking up and down seeking whom they may devour."
