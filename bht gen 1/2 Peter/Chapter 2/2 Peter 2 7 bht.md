# 2 Peter 2:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, we see a contrast between the righteous and the wicked. The righteous, like Lot, faced great distress and turmoil by being surrounded by a society filled with lawlessness, immorality, and natural depravity. Lot, being a just man, lived a righteous life, yet was burdened by the sinful behavior of those around him. The corruption and filthy conversation of the wicked were open and shameless, causing great distress to the righteous soul of Lot.
