# 2 Peter 2:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, we witness the righteous soul of Lot, dwelling amidst the wickedness of Sodom. Day after day, he witnessed and heard the immoralities that pained his heart. Despite this, Lot remained steadfast, his righteous nature untouched by the influences surrounding him. His soul was tormented, as if on a constant test or torture, yet he persevered, not succumbing to the wickedness surrounding him. Lot's experience serves as a reminder of the inner struggle faced by those living among the wicked, urging us to remain vigilant and strive for righteousness in the face of evil.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "The word 'vexed' in this verse carries the meaning of being tormented. It implies a deep distress or anguish that one experiences. This suggests that the righteous soul of Lot was greatly troubled by the wickedness and immorality that surrounded him in Sodom."

2. "The use of the word 'vexed' emphasizes the internal struggle that Lot faced. It highlights the conflict between his righteous nature and the sinful environment he found himself in. This shows us that even the most righteous individuals can be deeply affected by the wickedness around them."

3. "The torment that Lot experienced serves as a reminder of the importance of being vigilant and discerning in our surroundings. It teaches us that we should not be complacent or indifferent towards sin, but rather be deeply troubled by it. Lot's vexation can be seen as a call to action, urging us to stand firm in our faith and strive for righteousness in a world filled with evil."

1. "The purport of what is said then is, that though the holy man was surrounded with every kind of monstrous wickedness, he yet never turned aside from his upright course."
2. "But Peter expresses more than before, that is, that just Lot underwent voluntary sorrows; as it is right that all the godly should feel no small grief when they see the world rushing into every kind of evil."
3. "And Peter expressly mentioned this, lest when impiety everywhere prevails, we should be captivated and inebriated by the allurements of vices, and perish together with others, but that we might prefer this grief, blessed by the Lord, to all the pleasures of the world."
