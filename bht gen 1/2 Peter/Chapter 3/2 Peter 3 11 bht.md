# 2 Peter 3:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The impending dissolution of all things should have a profound impact on our lives, prompting us to live in a manner that reflects holiness and godliness. This call for transformation sets us apart from scoffers and sinners, as believers eagerly await the coming of the Lord, maintaining a constant commitment to living out our faith in all aspects of our interactions with others. Our conduct should exemplify our devotion to God and our adherence to a holy way of life.
