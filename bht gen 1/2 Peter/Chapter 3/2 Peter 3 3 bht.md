# 2 Peter 3:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the author warns of scoffers who will arise in the end times, ridiculing and mocking the teachings of Christ. These scoffers, driven by their own lusts, walk in a lifestyle of mockery and make light of sin. They openly commit and defend sinful actions, causing the upright and those who strive to live according to God's commands to become targets of their ridicule. These scoffers even go as far as to mock and belittle the Scriptures themselves, viewing them as foolishness and burdensome.
