### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Presumptuous skepticism and lawless lust, setting nature and its so-called laws above the God of nature and revelation, and arguing from the past continuity of nature's phenomena that there can be no future interruption to them, was the sin of the antediluvians, and shall be that of the scoffers in the last days."
2. "Where—implying that it ought to have taken place before this, if ever it was to take place, but that it never will."
3. "What becomes of the promise which you talk so much of?"

2. "Those old men, said the seeing objector, have died like others; and, notwithstanding their confident predictions, things now move on as they did from the beginning."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "From the beginning of the creation [απ αρχης κτισεως]. Not a common phrase." 
2. "Fell asleep [εκοιμηθησαν]. A literal and correct translation of the word, which occurs frequently in the New Testament, but only here in Peter."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The question, put with triumphant scorn by these mockers, repeats the cherished terms used by believers...the very form in which they were accustomed to refer to Him who was so much the one object of their thoughts as to need no identification by name among them." 
2. "Their argument will be taken from the delay in the fulfilment of ‘that blessed hope’ of the Christian brotherhood, and from the unbroken uniformity of things...they will deride the event itself." 
3. "The phrase ‘fell asleep’...is found only this once in Peter...On the lips of scoffers here it may be...another instance of ‘ironical accommodation to the dialect of faith and of the hope of the resurrection.’"
