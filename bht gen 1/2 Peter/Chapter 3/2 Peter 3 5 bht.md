# 2 Peter 3:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Forgetting intentionally, scoffers choose to ignore the origins of the heavens and the earth, created by the powerful word of God. The earth once stood, distinct from the water and surrounded by it. This truth, evident in the past state of the earth, is intentionally overlooked by those who reject it, causing their ignorance to be a deliberate choice.
