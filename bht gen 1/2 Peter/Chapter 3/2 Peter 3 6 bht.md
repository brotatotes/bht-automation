# 2 Peter 3:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Bible verse being described tells of a significant event in history, the great flood. The flood, brought upon by the opening of the windows of heaven and the breaking up of the fountains of the great deep, was a cataclysmic event that impacted the heavens and earth themselves. The floodwaters covered the entire world, resulting in the destruction of everything on the dry land. This event serves to refute the false assertion that all things have continued unchanged since the beginning of creation, highlighting the potential for great changes and transformations in the world as we know it.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The interpretations of διʼ ὧν have been very various. Œc. understands ὧν to refer to the heavens and the earth...and so Bed (but giving a curious meaning to διʼ ὧν: not, as Huther states, ‘in quibus partibus,’ but grammatically, though strangely, ‘by means of which (its parts perishing), the world, which was made up of heaven and earth, perished’)"
2. "The Apostle’s argument is, as against the assertors of the world’s endurance for ever, that it has once been destroyed, so that their assertion is thereby invalidated."
3. "Only thus, as Huther observes, does the verse come in logically as a contradiction to the saying of the scoffers, πάντα οὕτως διαμένει ἀπʼ ἀρχῆς κτίσεως"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "By means of which heavens and earth... the then world perished." 
2. "The earth was deluged by that water out of which it had originally risen." 
3. "The flood... broke up the fountains of the great deep and opened the windows of heaven."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The fact seems to be that the apostle had the 'waters' mentioned in Genesis prominently in his eye, and meant to describe the effect produced 'by' those waters."
2. "The world was formed from that fluid mass; by these waters which existed when the earth was made, and out of which it arose, it was destroyed."
3. "All that his argument demanded was the fact that the world had been once destroyed, and that therefore there was no improbability in believing that it would be again."

### Marvin Vincent:

2. "Being overflowed [κατακλυσθεις] . Only here in New Testament."
3. "Cataclysm is derived from it."

### John Calvin:
1. "The heaven was then also submerged, that is, the region of the air, which stood open between the two waters."
2. "The earth subsisting from water and through water, that is, emerging from water and made firm and solid by means of water."
3. "By which (or by the means of which) the world at that time, being overflowed with water, was destroyed."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The term used for 'world' here is the one (cosmos) which describes it as a system of order and beauty, and presents it under the aspect of space."
2. "Here the phrase need not be restricted to the idea of the world of men, or of living creatures, but may cover the whole order of things, with the men occupying it, which existed prior to the Deluge."
3. "When it is said that the 'then world, perished, it is obvious that the meaning is not that it was annihilated, but that it was broken up, had its 'order' destroyed, and was reduced to another form."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "By which means (δι' ων). The two waters above or the water and the word of God."

### John Gill:
1. "The deluge was universal...all the hills that were under the whole heaven were covered with it, and everything that had life in the dry land died." 
2. "By this instance the apostle shows the falsehood of the above assertion, that all things continued as they were from the beginning of the creation."
3. "Though the heavens and the earth may continue for a long time...it does not follow from thence that they always will, for the contrary is evident."

### John Wesley:
1. "The windows of heaven being opened" - This phrase emphasizes the magnitude of the flood, as if the floodwaters were pouring down from the very heavens themselves.
2. "The fountains of the great deep broken up" - This description highlights the cataclysmic nature of the flood, with the deep waters bursting forth from the depths of the earth.
3. "The heavens and earth themselves, though they did not perish, yet underwent a great change" - This statement suggests that while the physical world did not completely perish, it was profoundly transformed by the flood, reinforcing the idea that the flood was a significant event in history.
