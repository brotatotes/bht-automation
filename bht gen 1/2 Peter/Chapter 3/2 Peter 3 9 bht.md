### Philip Schaff:
1. "The apparent delay in the performance of the Divine engagement is capable of a still more assuring explanation. It has a gracious purpose."
2. "When a human promise fails to be fulfilled according to expectation, those to whom it has been made are in the habit of attributing the delay to a slackness which betrays unwillingness or some personal end. But if the Lord seems to be slow in fulfilling His promise, that is not to be explained, Peter means, as men are tempted to explain such slowness on the part of their fellow-men, as due to forgetfulness, lack of interest, procrastination, or anything personal to Himself only. Its explanation lies in something which touches our interest, and illustrates His grace."
3. "This sentence has been dragged too generally into the controversy about the Augustinian view of predestination, and the Calvinistic doctrine of the limited extent, or rather the definite design, of the Atonement. On the one hand, theologians like Beza have interpreted it of the elect only. On the other hand, exegetes like Huther regard it as adverse to the Calvinistic theory. The passage, however, has little bearing on the question, the subject dealt with being not the elective purpose but the long-suffering of God, and the ‘willing’ referred to being not ‘will’ in the sense of the Divine decree or determining volition, but ‘will’ in the wider sense of disposition, desire, or, as the R. V. puts it, ‘wishing.’"

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "God is not impotent nor unwilling to execute his promise." 
2. "Some will perish, but that is not God's desire." 
3. "God wishes 'all' to come, to make room."

### John Gill:
1. "The delay of Christ's coming is not owing to any slackness in him, but to his longsuffering to his elect among the Jews, being unwilling that any of that number among them should perish, but that all of them repent of their sins, and believe in him."
2. "God's longsuffering towards [his elect] is their salvation."
3. "God is not willing that any of [his elect] should perish, and that everyone of them should come to repentance."

### John Wesley:
1. "The Lord is not slow — As if the time fixed for it were past." 
2. "Concerning his promise — Which shall surely be fulfilled in its season." 
3. "But is longsuffering towards us — Children of men. Not willing that any soul, which he hath made should perish."
