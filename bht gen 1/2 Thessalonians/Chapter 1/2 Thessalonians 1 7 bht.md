# 2 Thessalonians 1:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the commentator's descriptions reveal that believers will find rest and relief from their suffering and persecution. The rest that they will experience is not a lifeless rest, but a respite from the distress they have endured. It is a rest that comes as a result of sharing in Christ's sufferings and finding solace in the company of fellow believers. This rest will be accompanied by a revelation of Christ, a glorious unveiling, to bring recompense and justice to those who have persecuted the believers.
