This punishment is seen as a just penalty to be paid, highlighting the seriousness of rejecting the Gospel and the consequences of sin.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The presence of the Lord" is the source whence the sentence goes forth; "the glory of His power" is the instrument whereby the sentence is carried into execution.
2. But ALFORD better interprets the latter clause, driven "from the manifestation of His power in the glorification of His saints."
3. Cast out from the presence of the Lord is the idea at the root of eternal death, the law of evil left to its unrestricted working, without one counteracting influence of the presence of God.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The word ὄλεθρον olethron - 'olethron' - occurs only here and in 1Co 5:5; 1 Thessalonians 5:3; 1 Timothy 6:9; in each of which places it is rendered destruction. It does not denote annihilation, but is used in the same sense in which we use the word when we say that a thing is destroyed."
2. "The meaning then must be, that the soul is destroyed as to the great purposes of its being - its enjoyment, dignity, honor, holiness, happiness. It will not be annihilated, but will live and linger on in destruction."
3. "It seems difficult to conceive how anyone can profess to hold that this passage is a part of the Word of God, and yet deny the doctrine of future eternal punishment. It would not be possible to state that doctrine in clearer language than this."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Shall be punished [δικην τισουσιν] . The verb (N. T. o.) means to pay or render. Lit. shall pay penalty."
2. "It is to be carefully noted that eternal and everlasting are not synonymous."
3. "The power inhering in the magistrate, which is put forth in laws or judicial decisions, is ijscuv, and makes the edicts ijscura valid and hard to resist."

### John Calvin:
1. "He shews, by apposition, what is the nature of the punishment of which he had made mention — destruction without end, and an undying death."
2. "The perpetuity of the death is proved from the circumstance, that it has the glory of Christ as its opposite."
3. "Accordingly, the influence of that death will never cease."

These quotes emphasize the everlasting nature of the punishment mentioned in the verse and highlight the severity of the punishment in relation to the glory and majesty of Christ.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Eternal destruction. This is the penalty to be paid by those who reject the Gospel and will not know God...a testimony, this, to the eternity of future punishment that is not easy to be explained away." (Ellicott)
2. "The destruction is caused by the presence of the Lord; that very thing which is the hope and stay of all blessedness, becoming now the source of destruction...How are men to be reclaimed if the very presence on which all holy desire and life depend, becomes destruction to them?" 
3. "The doom of the cursed is, 'Depart from me'...so here to be driven from the Lord is complete destruction."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Shall suffer punishment (δικην τισουσιν). Future active of old verb τινω, to pay penalty (δικην, right, justice), here only in N.T., but αποτινω once also to repay Philemon 1:19."
2. "Eternal destruction (ολεθρον αιωνιον). Accusative case in apposition with δικην (penalty). This phrase does not appear elsewhere in the N.T., but is in IV Macc. 10:15 τον αιωνιον του τυραννου ολεθρον the eternal destruction of the tyrant (Antiochus Epiphanes)."
3. "Destruction (cf. 1 Thessalonians 5:3) does not mean here annihilation, but, as Paul proceeds to show, separation from the face of the Lord (απο προσωπου του κυριου) and from the glory of his might (κα απο της δοξης της ισχυος αυτου), an eternity of woe such as befell Antiochus Epiphanes."

### John Gill:
1. "Sin being committed against an infinite and eternal Being, will be infinite in its duration; nor will it cease to be in the persons punished, who will not be in the least reformed or purged from sin by punishment; which will make the continuance of it just and necessary."
2. "As soon as the Lord appears, they will perish at his presence like wax before the fire; and so awful will be his appearance, they will flee from it with the utmost terror, and call to the rocks and mountains to hide them from the face of the Lord, and to screen them from his wrath."
3. "For he has power, as to save, so to destroy, as to glorify the bodies and souls of his saints, so to destroy the wicked, both body and soul, in hell; and the glory of his power will be seen in the one, as well as in the other."

### John Wesley:
1. "Tremble, ye stout-hearted." 
2. "They must of necessity, therefore, be cut off from all good, and all possibility of it."
3. "What unspeakable punishment is implied even in falling short of this, supposing that nothing more were implied in his taking vengeance!"
