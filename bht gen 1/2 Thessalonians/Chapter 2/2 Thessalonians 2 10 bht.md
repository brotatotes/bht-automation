# 2 Thessalonians 2:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we see a vivid description of the deceptive nature of unrighteousness and its ability to mislead others. It emphasizes the superiority and skill of this deceit employed by unrighteousness. However, we also learn about the power of faith and the importance of embracing the truth with love. The rejection of the truth and contempt for it ultimately lead to the perishing of those who fall under the strong delusion and deceit propagated by unrighteousness.
