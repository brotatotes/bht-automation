2. "The joys of religion are not like other joys. They soon fade away - they always terminate at death - they cease when trouble comes... The comforts of religion depend upon no such contingencies. They live through all these changes - attend us in sickness, poverty, bereavement, losses, and age; they are with us in death, and they are perpetual and unchanging beyond the grave."
3. "And good hope through grace."

### Marvin Vincent:

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "It is uncertain whether the first article ο is genuine as it is absent in B D. Usually Paul has the Father before Christ except here, 2 Corinthians 13:13; Galatians 1:1."
2. "This singular articular participle refers to ο πατηρ, 'though it is difficult to see how St. Paul could otherwise have expressed his thought, if he had intended to refer to the Son, as well as to the Father. There is probably no instance in St. Paul of a plural adjective or verb, when the two Persons of the Godhead are mentioned' (Lightfoot)."
3. "Distinct feminine form of αιωνιος here instead of masculine as in Matthew 25:46."

### John Gill:
1. "And in each of their characters are reasons contained, encouraging to believe the petitions will be regarded; for it is 'our Lord Jesus Christ himself' who is prayed unto; who is our Lord, not by creation only, in which sense he is Lord of all, but by redemption, and through a marriage relation; and he is our Jesus, our Saviour, and Redeemer; and our Christ, the anointed prophet, priest, and King; even he himself, who stands in these relations and offices; and what may not be expected from him?"
2. "And Christ, he had loved them with the same love; and which he showed by undertaking their cause in the council of peace; by espousing their persons in the covenant of grace; by assuming their nature in the fulness of time; by dying in their room and stead; and by his continued intercession and mediation for them, and by many other instances."
3. "And the present spiritual joy of the saints is what no man can take away from them, and what will eventually issue in everlasting consolation, without any interruption in the world to come, when sorrow and sighing shall flee away, and all tears be wiped from their eyes."
