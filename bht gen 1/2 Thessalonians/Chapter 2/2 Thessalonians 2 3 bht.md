# 2 Thessalonians 2:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, commentators describe the emergence of a figure known as the "man of sin" or Antichrist. They warn of deception and the need to remain vigilant, as this individual embodies sin itself, claiming divine authority and drawing people away from the faith. The commentators emphasize the historical context, the scattering of the Church, and the foretelling of this apostasy. The description conveys the significance of this figure's rise, the spread of falsehoods, and the impending revelation of the Antichrist before Christ's second coming.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The man of sin, in whom sin is as it were personified, as righteousness in Christ."
2. "He that withstands CHRIST, the ἀντί χριστος."
3. "Shewing himself that he is God, designates the divine dignity which he predicates of himself."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Christ, in Matthew 24, gives the same warning in connection with the same event. He had indicated three ways in which they might be deceived."
2. "The articles, 'the apostasy,' and 'the man of sin,' may also refer to their being well known as foretold in Daniel 7:8, 'the little horn speaking great words against the Most High, and thinking to change times and laws.'"
3. "Antichrist is first in mystery, and afterwards shall be developed and revealed. As righteousness found its embodiment in Christ, 'the Lord our righteousness,' so 'sin' shall have its embodiment in 'the man of sin.'"

Note: The commentary is quite long and complex, making it difficult to extract concise quotes that stand alone. These quotes provide a glimpse into the commentary's discussion of the warning of deception, the connection to prophecies in Daniel, and the concept of Antichrist being revealed as the embodiment of sin.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The necessity for the caution here given has not ceased."
2. "The word rendered 'falling away' (ἀποστασία apostasia, apostasy), is of so general a character, that it may be applied to any departure from the faith as it was received in the time of the apostles."
3. "That his rise was preceded by a great apostasy, or departure from the purity of the simple gospel, as revealed in the New Testament, cannot reasonably be doubted by any one acquainted with the history of the church."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Deceive [εξαπατηση] . Better beguile; since the word means not only making a false impression, but actually leading astray." 
2. "Falling away [αποστασια] . Only here and Acts 21:21. Comp. LXX, Joshua 22:22; 2 Chronicles 29:19." 
3. "The man of sin - the son of perdition [ο ανθρωπος της ανομιας, ο υιος της απωλειας] . See on children of light, 1 Thessalonians 5:5."

### John Calvin:
1. "Paul, therefore, fortifies beforehand the minds, not merely of the Thessalonians, but of all the pious, that when the Church should come to be in a scattered condition, they might not be alarmed, as though it were a thing that was new and unlooked for."
2. "The weak, however, have something here on which to rest, when they learn that the unseemly state of matters which they behold in the Church was long since foretold."
3. "Paul, however, when he has given warning that there would be such a scattering, that the greater part would revolt from Christ, adds something more serious — that there would be such a confusion, that the vicar of Satan would hold supreme power in the Church, and would preside there in the place of God."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Let no man deceive you by any means, either by professing superior enlightenment as if a spirit spoke through him, or by interpreting my words as if I had meant what he affirms."
2. "This general ‘going out from us’ of those who ‘were not of us,’ this widespread falling away from faith in Christ, will apparently be produced by distressing outward circumstances, the perplexed and disturbed state of nations, and calamities of the kind most difficult to be borne."
3. "Before Christ is revealed, Antichrist must first be revealed. The same term is used of both; strengthening the supposition that Paul speaks of a personal, individual Antichrist."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "It is amazing how gullible some of the saints are when a new deceiver pulls off some stunts in religion." 
2. "The second coming not only is not 'imminent,' but will not take place before certain important things take place, a definite rebuff to the false enthusiasts."
3. "The use of this verb αποκαλυπτω, like αποκαλυψιν of the second coming in 2 Thessalonians 1:7, seems to note the superhuman character of the event."

### John Gill:
1. "Do not be imposed upon by them for the following reasons, for there were things to be done before the coming of Christ, which were not then done, and which required time."
2. "The falling away first; either in a political sense, of the nations from the Roman empire, which was divided into the eastern and western empire; or rather in a religious sense, of the falling of men from the faith of the Gospel."
3. "The man of sin be revealed; who was now hid, though secretly working; by whom is meant not only any particular person or individual; not the devil, for though he is the wicked one, a damned spirit, an opposer, an adversary of God and Christ, and his people, and who has affected deity, and sought to be worshipped, and even by Christ himself; yet the man of sin is here distinguished from Satan."

### John Wesley:
1. "He is, in an emphatical sense, the man of sin, as he increases all manner of sin above measure."
2. "He has caused the death of numberless multitudes, both of his opposers and followers, destroyed innumerable souls, and will himself perish everlastingly."
3. "Claiming the prerogatives which belong to God alone."
