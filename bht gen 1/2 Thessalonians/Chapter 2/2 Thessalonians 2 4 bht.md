## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The fourth and last world kingdom, under which we now live, shall have one final head, the concentrated embodiment of all the sin and lawless iniquity which have been in pagan and papal Rome."
2. "He not merely assumes Christ's character (as the 'false Christs'), but 'opposes' Christ. The Greek implies one situated on an opposite side."
3. "Antichrist shall exalt himself above every object of worship, whether on earth as the CÃ¦sar, or in heaven as God."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The assumptions of the papacy have related to the following things: (1) To authority above all the inferior orders of the priesthood - above all pastors, bishops, and primates. (2) Authority above all kings and emperors... (3) To authority over the conscience, in matters which can pertain only to God himself, and where he only can legislate."
2. "No one can doubt that the Pope has claimed higher honors, as the vicegerent of Christ, than was ever rendered in the ancient 'hero worship.'"
3. "He would claim divine attributes and homage. He would give laws and responses as God did there. He would be regarded as the head of all ecclesiastical power; the source from which all authority emanated; the same in the Christian church which God himself was in the temple."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "That is called God. Above the true God and the false gods."
2. "The opposer claims divine honors for himself."
3. "An object of adoration, including things as well as persons."

### John Calvin:
1. "Paul undoubtedly means that Antichrist would take to himself those things that belonged to God alone, so that he would exalt himself above every divine claim, that all religion and all worship of God might lie under his feet."
2. "True religion is that by which the true God alone is worshipped; that, the son of perdition will transfer to himself."
3. "There is not one of these things that the Pope does not affirm to be under his authority. He boasts that it is his to bind consciences with such laws as seem good to him, and subject them to everlasting punishment."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The phrase will best be understood by referring to Daniel 11:0."
2. "If in our own day we look for a type of Antichrist which may help us to understand what the final form may be, we see at least this characteristic fulfilled in the Positivist worship of humanity."
3. "The use of this image may have been suggested by the recent attempt of Caligula to place his statue in the Temple, as well as by the common practice of deifying the Roman Emperors."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "This one opposes Christ and exalts himself, but not Satan, but an agent of Satan." 
2. "Caius Caligula had made a desperate attempt to have his statue set up for worship in the Temple in Jerusalem. This incident may lie behind Paul's language here." 
3. "Caligula claimed to be God. Moffatt doubts if Paul is identifying this deception with the imperial cultus at this stage."

### John Gill:
1. "Antichrist opposes Christ in his kingly, priestly, and prophetic offices, introducing doctrines and practices that are diametrically opposite to Christ's teachings."
2. "Antichrist exalts himself above all gods and objects of worship, assuming all power in heaven, earth, and hell."
3. "Antichrist sits in the temple of God, usurping power and authority, and is worshipped as if he were a god on earth."
