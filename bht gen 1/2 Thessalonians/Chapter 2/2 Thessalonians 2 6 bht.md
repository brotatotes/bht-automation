## BHT:

Understanding the historical context and the importance of personal knowledge is key to grasping the full meaning of this verse.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "We must not for a moment think of the ungrammatical rendering of Whitby, Masker., Heydenr., Schrader, OlSh., B.-Crus., and Wieseler, 'that which at present hinders,' which must be τὸ νῦν κατέχον." 
2. "νῦν is a mere adverb of passage, and the stress is on τὸ κατέχον." 
3. "The aim of κατέχον (in God’s purposes) q. d. 'that which keeps him back, that he may not be revealed before his,' &c."

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "The power that has restrained the man of sin from his full and final development is the moral and conservative influence of political states."
2. "The historical fact from which Paul starts in his prediction was probably the emperor Claudius' expulsion of the Jews, the representative of the anti-Christian adversary in Paul's day, from Rome, thus 'withholding' them in some degree in their attacks on Christianity."
3. "The removal of the withholding power will be when the civil polity, derived from the Roman empire, which is to be, in its last form, divided into ten kingdoms, shall yield to the prevalent godless 'lawlessness' with 'the lawless one' as its embodiment."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "There were causes at work even then, which would ultimately lead to this; but there was also something which checked the tendency of things, so that the revelation or development of the 'man of sin' was put off to a future period."
2. "If there was a tendency toward the concentration of all power in an individual in the church, - if there was an assumption of authority by one class of ministers above another, - if there was a denial of the 'parity of the clergy,' the tendency would have been to that ultimate assumption of authority which is found in the Romish hierarchy."
3. "The most natural interpretation is that which refers it to civil power, meaning that there was something in the form of the existing administration which would prevent this development until that restraint should be removed."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "What withholdeth [το κατεχον] . Better restraineth. The verb means to hold fast, as Luke 8:15 : to hold back, as Luke 4:42." 

2. "He refers to some power which hinders the revelation of the man of sin or Antichrist." 

3. "In his time [εν τω αυτου καιρω] . Better, in his own season, Not before his appointed season."

### John Calvin:
1. "Chrysostom, who thinks that this can only be understood as referring to the Spirit, or to the Roman Empire, prefers to lean to the latter opinion."
2. "I am of opinion, however, that Paul’s intention was different from this — that the doctrine of the gospel would require to be spread hither and thither, until nearly the whole world were convicted of obstinacy and deliberate malice."
3. "Let my readers now consider which of the two is the more probable — either that Paul declared that the light of the gospel must be diffused through all parts of the earth before God would thus give loose reins to Satan, or that the power of the Roman Empire stood in the way of the rise of Antichrist, inasmuch as he could only break through into a vacant possession."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "If we turn to our Lord’s discourse, the only thing to which such power is ascribed is the purpose of God that the Gospel should first be preached for a witness unto all nations, before the end come." 
2. "By this interpretation, ‘he who withholdeth’ must be God Himself, and interpreters have generally refused to accept this reference, because the words ‘until he be taken out of the way’ could not be used of God."
3. "The interpretation which most modern writers agree in accepting is that which understands ‘that which withholdeth’ to be ‘the restraining power of well-ordered human rule, the principles of legality as opposed to those of lawlessness, of which the Roman Empire was the then embodiment and manifestation.’"

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "This impersonal principle or power is capable also of manifesting itself under a personal form."
2. "He is Satan's messiah, an infernal caricature of the true Messiah."
3. "God overrules all human history and his ultimate purpose is wrought out."

### John Gill:
1. "By that which withheld, let or hindered the open appearance of antichrist, were the Roman empire and emperors; these stood in his way, and while this empire lasted, and the emperors wore the imperial crown, and sat on the throne, and held the government in their hands, the popes could not come at the height of their ambition, dignity, and authority, nor shine in their glory." 

2. "The reason why the apostle expresses this not in plain words, but in an obscure manner, and with so much caution, was, that he might not offend the Roman emperors, and provoke them to a severe persecution of them as seditious persons, that sought the destruction of the empire."

3. "The word here used, which is rendered 'withholdeth', or 'letteth', as in the next verse, signifies a ruler or governor, and answers to the Hebrew word עצר, 'to keep back, or restrain'; and which is used of kings, who by their laws and government restrain and withhold people from doing what they would."

### John Wesley:
1. "And now ye know — By what I told you when I was with you." - This quote highlights the importance of personal instruction and knowledge in understanding the context of the verse.

2. "That which restraineth — The power of the Roman emperors." - This quote provides insight into the specific force that is holding back the revelation of the wicked one, giving historical context to the verse.

3. "In his time — His appointed season, and not before." - This quote emphasizes the idea that the wicked one will only be revealed at the appointed time, suggesting a divine plan and order in the unfolding of events.
