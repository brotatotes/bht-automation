# 2 Thessalonians 2:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, commentators describe a hidden and secret power of lawlessness that is already at work, although it has not fully revealed itself. It is compared to a mystery, enveloping and concealing the evil that is operating behind the scenes. The foundations of this evil are being laid by false teachers, leading to errors and heresies that go against the teachings of Christ. This mystery of iniquity is not limited to one specific group, but extends itself beyond the boundaries of any particular church.
