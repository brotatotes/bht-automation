# 2 Thessalonians 3:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, the message is clear: do not tire or hesitate when it comes to doing good. It is important to live diligently and uprightly, being bold and courageous in our actions of kindness and righteousness. We should not be disheartened by the improper conduct of others or discouraged by the frequency of requests for assistance. Instead, we should strive to continue doing good and not let the ingratitude or laziness of some hinder us from showing compassion and generosity to those truly deserving.
