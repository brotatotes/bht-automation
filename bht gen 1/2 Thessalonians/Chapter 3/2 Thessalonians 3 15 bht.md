# 2 Thessalonians 3:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When someone in the church goes astray, it is our duty to approach them with love and compassion, treating them as a brother or sister rather than an adversary. This requires gentle correction and instruction, reminding them of their responsibilities. We must strive to avoid hostility, instead using a loving and compassionate approach to help them understand the impact of their actions and guide them towards repentance and restoration. Admonishment should be done with gentleness, kindness, and a desire for reconciliation, making it clear that they are still cherished members of the community.
