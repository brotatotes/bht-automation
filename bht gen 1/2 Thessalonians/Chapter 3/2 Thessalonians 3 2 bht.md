## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "When of persons, it designates one who does or says that which is inappropriate under the circumstances." 
2. "It is obvious that the key to the answer will be found in Acts 18:0. They were the Jews at Corinth, who were at that time the especial adversaries of the Apostle and his preaching."
3. "For to all men the (Christian) faith does not belong, all men do not receive it, have no receptivity for it obviously pointing at Jews by this description."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "An undesigned coincidence with Acts 18:12-17: Paul was now at Corinth, where the Jews 'opposed themselves' to his preaching: in answer to his prayers and those of his converts at Thessalonica and elsewhere, 'the Lord, in vision,' assured him of exemption from 'the hurt,' and of success in bringing in 'much people.'" 
2. "On the unreasonable, out-of-the-way perversity of the Jews, as known to the Thessalonians, see 1 Thessalonians 2:15; 1 Thessalonians 2:16."
3. "The Thessalonians, from their ready acceptance of the Gospel, might think 'all' would similarly receive it; but the Jews were far from having such a readiness to believe the truth."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "They had a distorted vision of the value of objects, and in tenacious adherence to their own views, and prosecuting their own objects to the exclusion of all others, they presented a constant obstruction to the true gospel."
2. "People often have a hobby. They give more importance to some object than it deserves. They, therefore, undervalue other objects; press their own with improper zeal; denounce others who do not feel the same interest in them which they do; withdraw from those who will not go with them in their views; form separate parties, and thus throw themselves in the way of all who are endeavoring to do good in some other method."
3. "The state of mind in which the apostle was when he wrote this, seems to have been this: He recollected the readiness with which the Thessalonians had embraced the gospel, and the firmness with which they held it, and seems to suppose that they would imagine the same thing must be found true everywhere. But he says all people have not the same faith; all were not prepared cordially and fully to embrace the gospel."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Unreasonable [ατοπων]...in a moral sense, iniquitous." 
2. "The word originally means out of place."

2. "Faith is a gift of God that is too rare to be found in all."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "To find here a mere shrinking of the flesh on the part of the apostle from the dangers that awaited him, is to assign to the apostle a character that never belonged to him." 
2. "We need not scruple to ascribe to the apostle so much apprehension of danger as would prompt him to ask the Thessalonians to pray for his deliverance."
3. "Wherever the Gospel is preached, it meets with such opposition as Paul speaks of, for not all accept it. It always sifts a community, and marks off a remnant, large or small, who do not believe, the perverse and wicked men."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "First aorist passive subjunctive of ρυομα, old verb to rescue. Note change in tense from present to aorist (effective aorist)."
