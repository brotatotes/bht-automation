## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "In eum maligni homines improbitatis suæ aculeos dirigebant, in eum totus impetus irruebat: curam interea suam ad Thessalonicenses convertit, nequid hæc illis tentatio noceat." (Calvin)
2. "πιστός seems to be chosen in allusion to πίστις which has just preceded; but the allusion cannot be more than that of sound, as the things spoken of are wholly different."
3. "τοῦ πονηροῦ may mean ‘the evil one,’ as in Matthew 13:19; Ephesians 4:16, al.: and so Ellic. But here the assurance seems, as before said, to correspond to the wish ch. 2 Thessalonians 2:17; and thus στηρίξαι ἐν παντὶ ἔργῳ κ. λόγῳ ἀγαθῷ = στηρίξει κ. φυλάξει ἀπὸ τοῦ πονηροῦ: in which case τ. πον. is neuter."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Faith on the part of man answers to faithfulness on the part of God."
2. "He turns away from asking the Thessalonians' prayers for HIS deliverance, to express his assurance of THEIR establishment in the faith, and preservation from evil."
3. "He has before his mind the Lord's Prayer, 'Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil'; where, as here, the translation may be, 'from the evil one'; the great hinderer of 'every good word and work.'"

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "From evil [απο του πονηρου]. Possibly, from the evil one." 
2. "General N. T. usage favors the masculine, personal sense." 
3. "The masculine is favored by the Jewish formularies, of which traces appear in the Lord's prayer; by the unanimous tradition of Greek interpreters; by the interpretations of Tertullian and Cyprian, and by the evidence of the Syriac and Sahidic Versions."

### John Calvin:
1. "He now calls them back to God, and says that he is faithful, so as to confirm them against all contrivances of men, by which they will endeavor to shake them."
2. "He calls the Lord faithful, inasmuch as he adheres to his purpose to the end in maintaining the salvation of his people, seasonably aids them, and never forsakes them in dangers."
