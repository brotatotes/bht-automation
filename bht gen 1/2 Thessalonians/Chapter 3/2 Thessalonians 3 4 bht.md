## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "ἐν κυρίῳ, as the element in which his confidence is exercised, shews it to be one assuming that they will act consistently with their Christian profession: and so gives the expectation the force of an exhortation, but at the same time of a hopeful exhortation."
2. "ἐφʼ ὑμᾶς, with reference to you the direction of his confidence."
3. "καὶ ποιεῖτε κ. ποιήσετε is all the apodosis not ὅτι ἃ παραγγ. κ. ποιεῖτε, καὶ ποιήσετε, as Erasm."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Have confidence in no man when left to himself." - BENGEL
2. "He means the majority by 'ye,' not all of them." - Commentary
3. "Some of the oldest manuscripts insert a clause, 'that ye both have done' before, 'and are doing, and will do.'" - Commentary

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Not primarily in you, for you have hearts like others, but in the Lord."
2. "His reliance is not on anything in themselves, but wholly on the faithfulness of God."
3. "He must be a stranger to the human heart who puts much confidence in it even in its best state."

### John Calvin:
1. "The confidence which he says he has respecting them, made them much more ready to obey than if he had required obedience from them in a way of doubt or distrust."
2. "He meant to testify, that it is not his intention to enjoin anything but by the commandment of the Lord."
3. "For provided men’s hearts continue to be directed towards love to God, and patient waiting for Christ, other things will be in a desirable state, and Paul declares that he desires nothing else."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "This verse farther expresses the confidence which Paul felt that, by the faithfulness of the Lord, the Thessalonians would not be moved by persecution, but would boldly continue in the life to which he had introduced them, not fearing to carry out any of the commands he had laid upon them."
2. "We have confidence in the Lord. 'Here, as elsewhere, the apostle speaks of believing, hoping, doing all things in Christ. We lead an ordinary life, as well as a religious one; but with the apostle his ordinary life is his religious one, and hence he uses religious expressions in reference to all he says and does' (Jowett)."
3. "That ye both do and will do. Under this expression of confidence, an injunction to further diligence is insinuated. It has been noted as characteristic of Paul, that he admonishes under the form of praise."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "We are in a state of trust in the Lord touching you."

1. "The ground of confidence concerning them was not in themselves, in their grace, and strength, and wisdom, and conduct, and good behaviour; but in the Lord, in his grace and strength, and in the power of his might, without whom they could do nothing, but through him strengthening them, could do all things."
2. "That ye both do, and will do the things which we command you; referring both to the commandments, which they had already given them by Christ, and they had showed, and continued to show a proper regard unto."
3. "See 1 Thessalonians 4:1 and also to what would be observed to them, as in 2 Thessalonians 3:6."

### John Wesley:
1. "We trust in the Lord concerning you" - This statement emphasizes the importance of placing our trust in God rather than in any human being. It reminds us that our ultimate reliance should be on the Lord, who is faithful and trustworthy.

2. "Thus only should we trust in any man" - This quote highlights the limited nature of human trust. While it is natural to trust others to some extent, our complete and unwavering trust should be reserved for God alone. Human beings are fallible and can disappoint us, but God is steadfast and reliable.

3. "Trusting in the Lord brings peace and assurance" - This statement underscores the benefits of trusting in God. When we place our trust in Him, we can experience a sense of peace and assurance, knowing that He is in control and will guide us through any challenges or uncertainties we may face.
