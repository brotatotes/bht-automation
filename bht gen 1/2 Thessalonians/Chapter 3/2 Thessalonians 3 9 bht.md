1. "The laborer is worthy of his hire. The apostle argues from the common practice of mankind, that those who labor in the service of others are entitled to a just recompense for their labor. This principle is recognized and acted upon in all the common affairs of life; and it is equally applicable to the ministers of the gospel."
