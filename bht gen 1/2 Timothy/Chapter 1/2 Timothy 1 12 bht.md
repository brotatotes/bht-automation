### Albert Barnes:
1. "For I know whom I have believed - Margin, 'trusted.' The idea is, that he understood the character of that Redeemer to whom he had committed his eternal interests, and knew that he had no reason to be ashamed of confiding in him."
2. "And am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed unto him - That is, the soul, with all its immortal interests. A man has nothing of higher value to intrust to another than the interests of his soul, and there is no other act of confidence like that in which he intrusts the keeping of that soul to the Son of God."
3. "This act of committing the soul, with all its interests, to the Saviour, is the true source of peace in the trials of life. This is so because: (a)Having done this, we feel that our great interests are secure. If the soul is safe, why need we be disturbed by the loss of health, or property, or other temporal comforts? Those are secondary things."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "He assumes that the things of which he speaks are known to Timothy. They are at least sufficiently implied in the word ‘prisoner.’"
2. "He is not ashamed of his work. Why should Timothy be ashamed of him?"
3. "The Greek (τὴν παραθήκην μου); literally, ‘my deposit’) is ambiguous, and may be rendered either as in the English Version, or as a possessive genitive, ‘that which has been committed to me.’"
4. "God would guard His own work. The analogy of the word ‘keep,’ however, as applied to God, is in favour of the former construction; and then the ‘deposit’ may be thought of as including all that was most precious in the apostle’s eyes, his work, his own salvation, or, as an echo of the words spoken on the cross (Luke 23:46), the spirit which ne commended to his Father."
5. "As in 2 Timothy 1:18, 2 Timothy 4:8, 2 Thessalonians 1:10, the great day of the Lord, the final Advent of the Christ."
