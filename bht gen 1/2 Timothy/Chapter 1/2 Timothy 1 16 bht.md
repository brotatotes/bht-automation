2. "Chain [αλυσιν]. Once in Paul, Ephesians 6:20. Several times in Mark, Luke, and Acts. It may mean handcuffs or manacles (see Lightfoot, Philippians, ed. of 1896, page 8), but is not limited to that sense either in classical or later Greek."

1. "Grant mercy (δωιη ελεος). The phrase nowhere else in the N.T. Second aorist active optative of διδωμ, the usual form being δοιη. This is the usual construction in a wish about the future." 

2. "For he oft refreshed me (οτ πολλακις με ανεψυξεν). First aorist active indicative of αναψυχω, old verb, to cool again, in LXX and Koine often, here only in N.T., but αναψυξις in Acts 3:20. In the first imprisonment or the second. If he lost his life for coming to see Paul, it was probably recently during this imprisonment." 

3. "Was not ashamed of my chain (αλυσιν μου ουκ επαισχυνθη). Passive deponent again (first aorist indicative) with accusative as in 2 Timothy 1:8. For αλυσιν (chain) see Ephesians 6:20. Note absence of augment in επαισχυνθη."
