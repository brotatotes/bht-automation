## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Certainly there is throughout this Epistle an altered tone with regard to Timotheus more of mere love, and less of confidence, than in the former."
2. "The expression of feeling is different in kind, not comparable in degree: suiting an Epistle of warm affection and somewhat saddened reminding, rather than one of rising hope and confidence."
3. "Tender reproof, vigorous reassurance, and fervent affection are exquisitely intermingled."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The expression used is in the Greek, 'my genuine son.' ALFORD sees in the change of expression an intimation of an altered tone as to Timothy, more of mere love, and less of confidence, as though Paul saw in him a want of firmness."
2. "This seems to me not justified by the Greek word agapetos, which implies the attachment of reasoning and choice, on the ground of merit in the one 'beloved,' not of merely instinctive love."
3. "The use of the term 'beloved' suggests a deep and intentional love, based on the qualities and merits of the one being loved."

### John Calvin:
1. "By this designation he not only testifies his love of Timothy, but procures respect and submission to him; because he wishes to be acknowledged in him, as one who may justly be called his son." (137)
2. "The reason of the appellation is, that he had begotten him in Christ; for, although this honor belongs to God alone, yet it is also transferred to ministers, whose agency he employs for regenerating us." (137)
3. "The word mercy, which he employs here, is commonly left out by him in his ordinary salutations. I think that he introduced it, when he poured out his feelings with more than ordinary vehemence." (137)

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The change of epithet from the ‘true son’ of the First Epistle may be only a casual variation without any conscious purpose." 
2. "To the extent, however, in which we may trace in modern correspondence a variation of feeling in ‘yours faithfully’ and ‘yours affectionately, we may recognise a shade of difference here."
3. "There is the same warmhearted love. There is not, perhaps, the same entire confidence."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Beloved (αγαπητο). Instead of γνησιω (genuine) in 1 Timothy 1:2." 
2. "He had already called Timothy αγαπητον (verbal adjective of αγαπαω) in 1 Corinthians 4:17, an incidental and strong proof that it is Paul who is writing here."

### John Gill:
1. "Not in a natural, but in a spiritual sense." 
2. "He calls him so, because as a son, he, being young in years, served with him, and under him, as a father, in the Gospel of Christ."
3. "Grace, mercy, and peace, &c."
