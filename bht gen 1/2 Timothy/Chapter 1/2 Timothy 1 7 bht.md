## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:

2. "The spirit of correction, the admonition of others that they may become disciplined, must be retained, as necessary both on account of that usage of the verb, and on account of the context."

1. "Spirit of fear [πνευμα δειλιας]. Better, of cowardice. N. T. Comp. Romans 8:15, and see on the Spirit, Romans 8:4, Romans 8:5. Of power [δυναμεως]. Found in all the Pauline Epistles except Philemon. In Pastorals only here, verse 8, and chapter 2 Timothy 3:5. Not used by our writer in the sense of working miracles, which it sometimes has in Paul. Here, the power to overcome all obstacles and to face all dangers."

### John Gill:
1. "A pusillanimous, cowardly spirit, so as to be afraid of men or devils, of what they will say or do; and so as to be discouraged in, sink under, or be deterred from the work of the Lord, the preaching of the Gospel, opposing the errors of false teachers, and reproving men for their sins, and doing other parts of the ministerial function; such a spirit is not from God, and such a fear brings a snare."
2. "Such is the Spirit of God, who is called 'power from high'; by which the minds of Christ's servants are fortified against reproaches and persecutions for his sake, and are strengthened to resist Satan's temptations, to endure hardness as good soldiers of Christ, to quit themselves like men, in opposition to false teachers, and to do the will and work of God."
3. "And having such a spirit, and fired with such love, they are not easily intimidated by the adversary; and of a sound mind: in the principles and doctrines of the Gospel; and which shows itself in a prudent conduct and behaviour; in sobriety, moderation, temperance, purity, and honesty; all which may be signified by the word here used."
