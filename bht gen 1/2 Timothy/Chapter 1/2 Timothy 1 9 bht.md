## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "The having 'saved us' in His eternal purpose of 'grace, given us in Christ before the world began,' precedes his actual 'calling' of us in due time with a call made effective to us by the Holy Spirit; therefore, 'saved us' comes before 'called us'." (Galatians 1:6)

2. "The call comes wholly from God and claims us wholly for God. 'Holy' implies the separation of believers from the rest of the world unto God." (Galatians 1:6)

3. "The origination of salvation was of His own purpose, flowing from His own goodness, not for works of ours coming first, but wholly because of His own gratuitous, electing love." (Galatians 1:6)

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He has brought us into a state in which salvation is so certain, that Paul could speak of it as if it were already done."
2. "A calling which is in its own nature holy, and which leads to holiness."
3. "The idea is, that our own works have nothing to do in inducing God to call us. As, when we become Christians, he does not choose us because of our works, so the eternal purpose in regard to our salvation could not have been formed because he foresaw that we would perform such works as would be a reason why he should choose us."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Salvation is ascribed to God."
2. "Called, saved. With a holy calling."
3. "The gift planned and ordered in the eternal counsels is here treated as an actual bestowment."

### John Calvin:
1. "The salvation which he has bestowed on us easily swallows up all the evils that must be endured in this world."
2. "He places the sealing of salvation in the calling; for, as the salvation of men was completed in the death of Christ, so God, by the gospel, makes us partakers of it."
3. "He describes the source both of our calling and of the whole of our salvation. We had not works by which we could anticipate God; but the whole depends on his gracious purpose and election."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "God has done so much for us. Shall we not at least do something for Him, if only by exercising the gifts He has bestowed on us?"
2. "A holy calling, i.e. a calling, a summons, which implies holiness. This was not ‘according to our works,’ for they were by hypothesis, and in fact, unholy, but is referred to the purpose and the favour of God."
3. "And as no commencement in time could be ascribed to the Divine purpose, for that would imply change in the Unchangeable, this purpose, yes, and even the gift, must be thought of as belonging to periods beyond man’s power to measure; literally, ‘before the times of ages or ages’ before the years of eternity."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Called us with a holy calling" - This highlights the idea that God has invited us to a consecrated service, a higher calling that is set apart and dedicated to Him.
2. "The upward calling" - This phrase emphasizes the idea that our calling is not just an invitation, but a divine summons to a higher purpose and a closer relationship with God.
3. "Before times eternal" - This phrase suggests that God's plan and purpose for our lives existed even before the beginning of time, emphasizing the eternal nature of His calling and the depth of His grace.

### John Gill:
1. "There is a salvation previous to calling: there is a temporal salvation; a special providence attends the elect of God, as soon as born; God's visitation in a very special manner preserves their spirits; they are kept from many imminent dangers, and some of them from the grosser immoralities of life."
2. "Salvation was not only resolved upon, but the scheme of it was contrived from eternity, in a way agreeable to all the divine perfections, in which Satan is most mortified, the creature abased, and the elect effectually saved."
3. "Vocation is also according to both the purpose and grace of God: it is according to his purpose; the persons called are fixed upon by him; whom he predestinates he calls; none are called, but whom God purposed to call; and for their calling no other reason can be assigned but the sovereign will of God."

### John Wesley:
1. "The love of the Father, the grace of our Saviour, and the whole economy of salvation, are here admirably described."
2. "Having called us with an holy calling — Which is all from God, and claims us all for God."
3. "According to his own purpose and grace — That is, his own gracious purpose."
