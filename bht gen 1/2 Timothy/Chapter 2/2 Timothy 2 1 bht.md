# 2 Timothy 2:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In light of the previous chapter, we are called to rise above slothfulness and rely on the empowering influence of Christ's grace. This grace, found in Christ Jesus, strengthens and sustains us in our journey, keeping us rooted in God's love and firm in our faith. It is through the Gospel, which proclaims God's grace, that we are emboldened to boldly preach, defend, and oppose every falsehood. As believers, we continually seek and draw from the abundant wells of salvation found in Christ, finding our true source of strength in His boundless grace.
