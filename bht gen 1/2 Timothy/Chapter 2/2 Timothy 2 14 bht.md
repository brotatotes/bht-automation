# 2 Timothy 2:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the writer urges readers to avoid engaging in futile arguments and disputes. The commentator describes these disputes as "war of words" that are "useful for no purpose" and "to the ruin of them that hear." By reminding others of important truths and charging them in the presence of the Lord, we are encouraged to focus on edifying teachings and avoid becoming entangled in meaningless debates that do not promote growth or benefit.
