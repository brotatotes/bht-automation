# 2 Timothy 2:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The words spoken by certain individuals can be both empty and harmful. Like a gangrene, these words have a destructive and contagious impact, corrupting the thoughts and actions of others. They slowly erode and consume the well-being and unity of a community, leaving behind a lasting and pervasive negative effect. The consumption of these words is likened to the spread of a disease, eating away at the vital aspects of religion and destroying the very form of godliness.
