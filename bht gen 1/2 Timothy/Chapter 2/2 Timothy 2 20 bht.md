# 2 Timothy 2:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the context of a great house, the Church of God, we find a mixture of people - some righteous, departing from iniquity, while others unworthy and practicing wickedness. This arrangement, with vessels of different materials, is not a cause for distress, but rather a demonstration of the greatness and variety of the church. Some vessels are fit for honorable use, reflecting the beauty and value of their service, while others, though made with potential for honor, may be used in dishonorable ways that were not intended by their Maker.
