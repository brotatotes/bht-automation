# 2 Timothy 2:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Flee from the impetuous passions and lusts that are prone to young individuals, particularly young ministers of the Gospel, such as vanity and the desire for popularity and preeminence. Instead, pursue righteousness, integrity, and faithfulness in all aspects of life, especially in the ministry. Seek unity and peace with all true believers who call upon the Lord with sincerity, as these virtues are rooted in a pure heart and exemplify the pursuit of holiness and love.

2. "these last words belong to those who call upon the Lord, and serve to designate the earnest and single-minded, as contrasted with the false teachers."
3. "love and peace: ἀγαπᾶν μὲν γὰρ ἅπαντας δυνατόν, ἐπειδήπερ τοῦτο καὶ ὁ εὐαγγελικὸς παρακελεύεται νόμος, Ἀγαπᾶτε τοὺς ἐχθροὺς ὑμῶν; εἰρηνεύειν δὲ οὐ πρὸς ἅπαντας ἔνεστι."

3. "We are to love all men, but it is not possible to be at peace with all men, for this needs community of purpose and opinion; they alone who call on the Lord sincerely have this community."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Flee from youthful lusts; not to indulge for a moment in those corrupt passions to which youth are subject, but to cultivate the pure and sober virtues which become the ministerial office."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Follow [διωκε] . Pursue. Stronger than follow. A favorite word with Paul to denote the pursuit of moral and spiritual ends."
2. "Peace [ειρηνην] . Not a distinct virtue in the list, but a consequence of the pursuit of the virtues enumerated."

### John Calvin:
1. "By this term he does not mean either a propensity to uncleanness, or any of those licentious courses or sinful lusts in which young men frequently indulge, but any impetuous passions to which the excessive warmth of that age is prone."
2. "He recommends the opposite feelings, that they may restrain his mind from breaking out into any youthful excesses; as if he had said, 'These are the things to which thou oughtest to give thy whole attention, and thy whole exertions.'"
3. "But when he bids him seek 'peace with all that call upon the Lord,' it is doubtful whether, on the one hand, he holds out all believers as an example, as if he had said, that he ought to pursue this in common with all the true worshippers of God, or, on the other hand, he enjoins Timothy to cultivate peace with them."
