# 2 Timothy 2:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Bible verse being described speaks about the importance of avoiding foolish and unlearned questions that do not contribute to godliness. These questions are described as uninstructive, unprofitable, and even flat or insipid. They are likened to untrained, uneducated speculations that only lead to contentions and strife. The verse admonishes believers to be gentle, patient, and to decline from engaging in such arguments, knowing that they sow discord and hinder the edification of the church.
