# 2 Timothy 2:25 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, we are encouraged to instruct and correct those who engage in uninstructive and undisciplined questioning. We should patiently and calmly guide those who oppose themselves, even if they hold different opinions. Through meekness and gentle persuasion, we can lead them to repentance, helping them acknowledge the truth. Our labors may seem fruitless, but with the grace of God, they can have a transformative impact.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:

3. "Meekness and gentleness are the very best things, if you wish to convince another that he is wrong. With his heart first, and then modestly and kindly show him 'what the truth is,' in as few words, and with as unassuming a spirit, as possible, 'and you have him.'"
