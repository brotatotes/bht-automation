# 2 Timothy 3:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, we see that the breach between light and darkness only widens over time, as evil men and seducers grow worse and worse. Those who deceive others are themselves deceived, trapped in a dangerous cycle of deception. There is a continuous decline in behavior and intentions, as impostors and deceivers become more skilled at leading astray and embracing the errors of others. It is a tragic reality, as these seducers are able to both deceive and be deceived, perpetuating a cycle of falsehood and manipulation.

2. "He was to anticipate in them the operation of the general law in regard to bad men and seducers - that they would grow worse and worse. From this fact, he was to regard it as certain that he, as well as others, would be liable to be persecuted."

3. "The advocates of error are often themselves as really under deception, as those whom they impose upon.

1. "By 'evil men' are meant...wicked men under a form of godliness...who are full of wickedness and malice against truly godly persons."
2. "The word for 'seducers' signifies sorcerers, enchanters, a sort of jugglers; and as the other, it well suits with the ecclesiastics of the church of Rome, who pretend to miracles, and do lying wonders, and by their sorceries deceive all nations."
3. "The church of Rome is never to be expected to be better, but worse; at the time of the fall of Babylon she will be an habitation of devils, the hold of every foul spirit, and the cage of every unclean and hateful bird."

1. "Deceiving and being deceived" highlights the dangerous cycle of deception. Once someone starts deceiving others, they become more susceptible to being deceived themselves.
