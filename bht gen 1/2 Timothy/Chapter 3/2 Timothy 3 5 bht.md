# 2 Timothy 3:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, there is a warning against those who outwardly profess religion and godliness but reject its true power and deny its transformative influence. These individuals maintain a mere external show of piety, using a "mask and visor of godliness." While they may speak of religion, their actions betray their hypocrisy. The guidance given is to avoid such individuals and withdraw from their company as they lack the genuine substance of true piety.
