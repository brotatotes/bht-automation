# 2 Timothy 3:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In ancient times, opponents of the truth like Jannes and Jambres, the Egyptian magicians, resisted Moses and his miracles, seeking to rival his authority. These adversaries stood against Moses in the same way that some now oppose the gospel, trying to neutralize its claims and seduce weak-minded individuals. Like Jannes and Jambres, these opponents are men with corrupt minds, holding antichristian beliefs, lacking sound judgment and genuine faith.

2.
