# 2 Timothy 4:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse being described is about the departure of Demas and the movements of Crescens and Titus from Paul's ministry. Through the commentaries, we understand that Paul feels deserted by Demas, a former co-worker, and he expresses disappointment. Crescens, another preacher, has gone to Galatia for ministry work while Titus has left Crete and headed to Dalmatia. These departures highlight the ever-changing nature of relationships and the dedication of Paul and his fellow laborers to spreading the Gospel wherever they are called.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Demas—once a 'fellow laborer' of Paul, along with Mark and Luke." 
2. "His motive for forsaking Paul seems to have been love of worldly ease, safety, and comforts at home, and disinclination to brave danger with Paul."
3. "Titus—He must have therefore left Crete after 'setting in order' the affairs of the churches there."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Demas hath forsaken me...under the influence of a desire to live." 
2. "Having loved this present world...he desired to live...rather than to go to the other." 
3. "Paul was pained by his departure, and he felt lonely and sad, but I see no evidence that Demas was influenced by what are commonly called worldly feelings."

These quotes highlight the reasons behind Demas' departure from Paul and shed light on his motivations. They also emphasize Paul's emotional response to Demas' abandonment.

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "That no epithet is attached to his name in Colossians 4:14 may be a shadow of Demas's behavior mentioned here, in case Colossians was written later than 2nd Timothy."
2. "The compounded preposition ejn indicates a condition or circumstances in which one has been left, as the common phrase left in the lurch."
3. "Having loved. The participle is explanatory, because he loved. This present world."

### John Calvin:
1. "It was truly base in such a man to prefer the love of this world to Christ."
2. "He merely preferred his private convenience, or his safety, to the life of Paul."
3. "He resolved to consult his own interests...enjoyed a propitious gale from the world."

These quotes highlight the commentary's criticism of a man who prioritized his own comfort and safety over his commitment to Christ and the apostle Paul. It emphasizes the contrast between worldly desires and the selflessness required to follow Christ.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The religion of Christ would have interfered with his worldly prospects."
2. "Nothing is, or can be, known of him, and it is doubtful whether the Galatia is the province of that name in Asia Minor, or Gaul."
3. "Assuming this to be the latest of St. Paul’s Epistles, we must assume that Titus, after receiving the Epistle addressed to him, had started from Crete for Nicopolis, had then pressed on to join St. Paul at Rome, and had afterwards started to carry on his work as an evangelist at Dalmatia."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Forsook me (με εγκατελειπεν). Imperfect (MSS. also have aorist, εγκατελιπεν) active of the old double compound verb εγκαταλειπω, for which see Romans 9:29. Clearly in contrast to verse 2 Timothy 4:9 and in the sense of 1 Timothy 6:17, wilful desertion." 

2. "Only mentioned elsewhere in Colossians 4:14." 

3. "Titus to Dalmatia (Τιτος εις Δαλματιαν). Titus had been asked to rejoin Paul in Nicopolis where he was to winter, probably the winter previous to this one (Titus 3:12). He came and has been with Paul."

### John Gill:
1. "His faith might be right, though low, and his love sincere, though not fervent; and through a fear of persecution, and loss of life, he might be tempted to leave the apostle, and withdraw from Rome, for his own safety; which though it was far from being commendable in him, yet may be accounted for in this state of frailty and imperfection, consistent with the grace of God."

2. "Having loved this present world, not the sins and corruptions of the world, the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life; such a love is inconsistent with the love of the Father and the grace of God; nor an immoderate love of worldly substance, or of money, which is the root of all evil; but a love of life, or of a longer life in this present world; he was desirous of living longer in this world, and chose not to hazard his life by staying with the apostle, a prisoner at Rome; and therefore left him, and provided for his own safety and security."

3. "Here the apostle had doubtless been useful for the conversion of souls, and planting of churches, and therefore sent Titus thither, to assist them in their state and condition, and bring him an account of them."

### John Wesley:
1. "Demas, once my fellow laborer, has forsaken me." - This quote highlights the disappointment and sense of abandonment that Paul feels when Demas leaves him. It emphasizes the transient nature of human relationships and the challenges faced in ministry.

2. "Crescens, probably a preacher also, is gone, with my consent, to Galatia." - This quote suggests that Crescens, like Paul, was actively engaged in preaching and spreading the Gospel. It demonstrates the shared mission and dedication to ministry that Paul and his fellow laborers had.

3. "Titus to Dalmatia, having now left Crete." - This quote indicates that Titus, another companion of Paul, has moved on to a different location for ministry. It underscores the dynamic nature of Paul's team and their willingness to go wherever they are needed, even if it means leaving behind familiar places and people.
