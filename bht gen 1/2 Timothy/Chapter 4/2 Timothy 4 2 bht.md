## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The use of the imper. aor. seems often due, both in the N. T. and in classical authors, to the 'lubitus aut affectus loquentis.'" 
2. "There seems no need to confine the sense so narrowly. The quotations in De W. himself justify the meaning of 'press on,' 'be urgent,' generally: not perhaps in preaching only, but in the whole work of the ministry."
3. "The junction is harsh, but not therefore to be avoided. Of course, hendiadys (= ἐν πάσῃ μακροθυμίᾳ διδαχῆς , Grot., Rosenm.) is out of the question."

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Preach—literally, 'proclaim as a herald.' The term for the discourses in the synagogue was daraschoth; the corresponding Greek term (implying dialectial style, dialogue, and discussion) is applied in Acts to discourses in the Christian Church." 

2. "The bishops and presbyters had the right and duty to preach, but they sometimes called on deacons, and even laymen, to preach. In this, the Church imitated the synagogue." 

3. "Be instant—that is, urgent, earnest, in the whole work of the ministry. In season, out of season—that is, at all seasons; whether they regard your speaking as seasonable or unseasonable."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He was always to be at his post, and was to embrace every opportunity of making known the gospel."
2. "He is not to confine himself to the appointed times of worship, or to preach only when it will be perfectly convenient for himself, but he is to have such an interest and earnestness in the work, that it will lead him to do it in the face of embarrassments and discouragements, and whenever he can find an opportunity."
3. "The minister is not merely to reason about sin, and convince men that it is wrong, but he may solemnly admonish them not to do it, and warn them of the consequences."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Be instant [επιστηθι] . Better, be ready. Once in Paul, 1 Thessalonians 5:3. Frequent in Luke and Acts. Lit. stand by, be at hand, be present. To come suddenly upon, Luke 2:38. Hence, be ready."
2. "Instant signifies urgent, importunate, persevering. Lat. instant to press upon. Thus Latimer, 'I preached at the instant request of a curate.'"
3. "So N. T., Romans 12:12, 'Continuing instant in prayer.'"

### John Calvin:
1. "By these words he recommends not only constancy, but likewise earnestness, so as to overcome all hindrances and difficulties."
2. "The gospel will not long maintain its place, if pastors do not urge it earnestly."
3. "Reproofs are founded on doctrine, in order that they may not be justly despised as frivolous."
4. "Keenness is moderated by gentleness; for nothing is more difficult than to set a limit to our zeal, when we have once become warm."
5. "Let severity be therefore mingled with this seasoning of gentleness, that it may be known to proceed from a peaceful heart."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The entreaty or command connects itself with what had just been said as to the right use of Scripture. Not that ‘the word of God’ is identified with Scripture, but that the one gives the right training and the best appliances for the due utterance of the other."
2. "Be instant. In the old English sense, ‘press on,’ ‘be urgent,’ with special reference to the work of proclaiming the word of God."
3. "What is meant is ‘with or without what seems to men a special opportunity.’ We may, perhaps, trace a recollection of what had once happened in St. Paul’s experience, in the case of one who waited ‘for a more convenient season’ (Acts 24:25)."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Preach the word" - The imperative to proclaim and teach the message of the Gospel, emphasizing the importance of sharing the truth of God's Word with others.

2. "Be instant in season, out of season" - Encouragement to be ready and available at all times to share the Gospel, regardless of the circumstances or the response of others.

3. "Reprove, rebuke, exhort" - Instructions to confront and correct error, to challenge and warn against wrongdoing, and to encourage and comfort believers in their faith journey. These actions are necessary for the growth and maturity of the church.

### John Gill:
1. "Preach the word... openly, publicly, and with a loud voice, without adding to it, or taking from speaking out the whole, and keeping back no part of it."
2. "Be constant and assiduous in the work of the ministry; be always and wholly in it, either preparing for it, or performing it."
3. "Reprove errors, and men for their errors and heresies; make use of convincing arguments taken out of the Scriptures."
4. "Exhort to all the duties of religion respecting God and man; to show love, and to do good works; to hold fast the profession of faith, and walk as becomes the Gospel of Christ."
5. "The success of the Gospel ministry should be patiently waited for as husbandmen do for the fruits of the earth."

### John Wesley:
1. "Be instant — Insist on, urge these things in season, out of season - That is, continually, at all times and places."
2. "It might be translated, with and without opportunity - Not only when a fair occasion is given: even when there is none, one must be made."
3. "One must be made."
