2. "Trophimus he left behind at Miletus sick...there is a presumption that Timothy was not at Ephesus when Paul wrote."
3. "Paul had not the power of healing at will, but as the Lord allowed him."

### Albert Barnes:

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Erastus, sent by Paul with Timothy to Macedonia from Ephesus."
2. "Trophimus. See Acts 22:4; Acts 21:9."
3. "Sick [ασθενουντα]. By Paul mostly in a moral sense, as weak in the faith, Romans 4:19; the law was weak, Romans 8:3; the weak brother, 1 Corinthians 8:11."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Erastus, probably the same as the steward or chamberlain of Corinth mentioned in Romans 16:23." 
2. "Trophimus, one of St. Paul's companions on the last journey to Jerusalem, described as an Ephesian." 
3. "Miletum ought, of course, to be Miletus. This again indicates St. Paul's route, from Ephesus to Miletus, from Miletus to Troas, thence to Macedonia."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Erastus is mentioned in Acts 19:22 and Romans 16:23, indicating his close association with Paul. This suggests that he was a trusted companion and fellow worker in the ministry." 

2. "Trophimus, a native of Ephesus, is mentioned in Acts 20:4 and Acts 21:29. His presence with Paul in Jerusalem shows the strong bond and loyalty between them, despite the challenges they faced." 

3. "The mention of Paul's companion being sick in Miletus (Acts 20:4) highlights the physical and emotional toll that ministry can take on individuals. It serves as a reminder that even those who are dedicated to serving God can experience weakness and vulnerability."

### John Gill:
1. "Erastus abode at Corinth,.... He was chamberlain of that city, Romans 16:23 who being sent along with Timothy into Macedonia, Acts 19:22 very probably went from thence into Achaia, to Corinth, his native place, where he stayed." 

2. "But Trophimus have I left at Miletum sick. Trophimus was an Asian, of the city of Ephesus, the same that is spoken of in Acts 20:4. Some say he suffered martyrdom the same day the Apostle Paul did; but others say, that after that time he was bishop of Arles in France."

3. "This man went with the apostle into Asia, and from thence to Jerusalem, and came along with him in his voyage to Rome, but falling sick by the way, was left at Miletum."
