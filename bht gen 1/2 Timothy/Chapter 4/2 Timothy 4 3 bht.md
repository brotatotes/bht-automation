# 2 Timothy 4:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we are warned about a future time where people will reject the teachings of God and instead seek out teachers who satisfy their own desires and whims. These individuals have itching ears, always in search of novelty and variety, and are easily swayed by smooth and empty discourses. It is crucial for zealous and patient pastors to defend and preserve the pure gospel, especially during these times when people are more concerned with satisfying their own lusts than with heeding the will of God.
