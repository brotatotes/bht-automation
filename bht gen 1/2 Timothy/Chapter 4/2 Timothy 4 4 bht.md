# 2 Timothy 4:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, people actively choose to turn away from the truth and instead immerse themselves in fables and myths. The commentators highlight that this turning away is not accidental, but a deliberate decision made by individuals whose minds are filled with worthless and unprofitable things. The verse reflects the tendency of some to prefer sensationalism or false narratives that appeal to their desires, rather than seeking and embracing the solid truths of the Gospel.
