# 2 Timothy 4:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the commentator affirms that a crown of righteousness is prepared for believers. This crown is a reward given by God for their righteous endeavors, which are recognized and accepted by Him. The commentators emphasize that this reward is not in conflict with the doctrines of grace, as it is given freely through faith and is bestowed upon those who love the appearing of Christ. Ultimately, the verse assures believers of the certainty and joy they can find in the promise of a future day of resurrection and the righteous judgment of Christ.

1. "henceforth (perhaps this adverb expresses λοιπόν better than any other. It appears to be used in later Greek, from Polybius downwards, in this sense of ‘proinde,’ ‘itaque:’ cf. Polyb. ii. 68. 9; iv. 32. 5; x. 45. 2) there is laid up (reff.) for me the (not ‘a,’ as E. V.) crown (reff., and cf. Php 3:14) of righteousness"

1. "This certainty arises from turning his eyes to the day of the resurrection, and this is what we also ought to do; for all around we see nothing but death, and therefore we ought not to keep our eye fixed on the outward appearance of the world, but, on the contrary, to hold out to our minds the coming of Christ." 
2. "Justification by free grace, which is bestowed on us through faith, is not at variance within the rewarding of works, but, on the contrary, those two statements perfectly agree, that a man is justified freely through the grace of Christ, and yet that God will render to him the reward of works."
