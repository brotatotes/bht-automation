## Henry Alford:
1. "The elder...to Caius the beloved...whom I love in the truth." 
2. "The epithet τῷ ἀγαπητῷ seems to be used this first time in a general sense." 
3. "The Apostle declares that he personally joins in the affection for him."

## Jamieson Fausset Brown:

2. "Love in the truth" expresses a deep and genuine love that is rooted in the truth of God's Word.
3. The author's personal emphasis on Gaius or Caius suggests a close relationship and personal investment in his well-being.

## Albert Barnes:
1. "The writer then adverts to the fact that he had written upon this subject to the church, commending these strangers to their attention, but that Diotrephes would not acknowledge his authority, or receive those whom he introduced to them. This conduct, he said, demanded rebuke; and he says that when he himself came, he would take proper measures to assert his own authority, and show to him and to the church the duty of receiving Christian brethren commended to them from abroad." 

2. "He exhorts Gaius to persevere in that which was good - in a life of love and kindness, in an imitation of the benevolent God."

3. "After having returned to the writer of this Epistle, who had formerly commended them to the church, and having borne honorable testimony to the hospitality of Gaius, it would seem that they resolved to repeat their journey for the same purpose, and that the writer of the Epistle commended them now to the renewed hospitality of Gaius."

## Marvin Vincent:

2. "Gaius the beloved."
3. "In truth."

## Philip Schaff:
1. "Nothing is said as to his holding any office; he is beloved only, the ordinary term of Christian fellowship, though evidently used here in its strongest meaning, whom I love in truth." 
2. "Instead of the ordinary greeting we have an expression of goodwill, I wish, which however is really, as every Christian good wish must be, prayer to God." 
3. "The prosperity of the soul is the standard of all prosperity: even as thy soul prospereth, or makes good advancement."

## Archibald T Robertson:
1. "The beloved" is a term used to describe Gaius, emphasizing the deep affection and love that the author has for him.
2. The phrase "whom I love in truth" highlights the sincerity and genuineness of the author's love for Gaius.
3. The repetition of the term "beloved" throughout the letter underscores the special bond and relationship between the author and Gaius.

## Adam Clarke:
1. "It is scarcely to be supposed that so signal a display of the justice of God, and such a powerful argument in favour of Christianity and of the truth of Christ's predictions, could be passed unnoticed and unappealed to by any of the inspired persons who wrote after that event." 
2. "Hospitality to his Christian brethren was the leading feature in the character of this Caius to whom St. John wrote, and it is on this very account that he is commended by the apostle." 
3. "The voyage was too long and dangerous for a man at John's advanced age to think of taking."
