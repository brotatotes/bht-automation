## Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "I will bring to mind" - The commentary explains that this phrase means that the person speaking will remember and recall the actions of those who have wronged them. This suggests a sense of accountability and justice.

2. "The brethren" - This term refers to the missionaries who are traveling on their journey. It highlights the importance of hospitality and support for those who are spreading the message of the Bible.

3. "Diotrephes possibly stood at the head of this party" - This statement suggests that Diotrephes was a leader of a group within the church that had anti-Jewish tendencies. It provides insight into the internal dynamics and conflicts within the early Christian community.

## Albert Barnes:
1. "He would punish his arrogance and presumption; would take measures that he should be dealt with in a proper manner."
2. "If the feelings and the character of these brethren had been injured by being rudely thrust out of the church, then it was proper that their character should be vindicated."
3. "Diotrephes was constantly undermining his influence, and injuring his character."

## Marvin Vincent:
1. "Prating [φλυαρων] . From fluw to bubble up or boil over. Hence of talk which is both fluent and empty."
2. "Them that would. Those who were disposed to receive the strangers."
3. "Casteth them out. By excommunication, which, through his influence, he had power to bring about."

## Philip Schaff:
1. "We mark here the same tone of faithful sternness which pervades the two other Epistles: in these, however, as against those who assailed the truth, in this against one who invades the order of the church."
2. "It is more than probable that Diotrephes was of the Judaizing faction which strove to thwart the publication of the Gospel to the Gentiles; and this would account for the apostle’s severity."
3. "His actions, of more importance to the apostle than any words spoken against himself merely. He casteth them out who would receive the brethren."

## Archibald T Robertson:
1. "The aged apostle is not afraid of Diotrephes and here defies him." 
2. "Not simply foolish chatter, but malevolent words." 
3. "John knows that the conduct of Diotrephes will not stand the light."

## Adam Clarke:
1. "Diotrephes might have been a converted Jew, who was unwilling that the Gentiles should be received into the Church; or a Judaizing Christian, who wished to incorporate the law with the Gospel, and calumniated the apostles who taught otherwise."
2. "This haughty and unfeeling man would give no countenance to the converted Gentiles; so far from it, that he would not receive any of them himself, forbade others to do it, and excommunicated those who had been received into the Church by the apostles."
3. "He had the complete dog in the manger principle: he would neither do, nor let do; and when good was done that he did not approve, he endeavoured to undo it."


# BHT:
In this Bible verse, the commentator quotes reveal a situation that involves a person of authority, Diotrephes, who is causing division and conflict within the early Christian community. He is described as arrogant, presumptuous, and filled with empty talk. Diotrephes is accused of hindering the progress of the Gospel, opposing the inclusion of Gentiles, and even excommunicating those who welcomed the brethren. Despite his actions, the apostle and other commentators are resolute in standing against his harmful influence, highlighting the importance of accountability, justice, and the proper conduct within the church.
