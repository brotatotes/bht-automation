2. "And not content herewith; with prating against the Apostle John, and the ministers with him, in this wicked way: neither doth he himself receive the brethren; the meaning is not, that he did not receive them into the church, for they were there, since afterwards mention is made of his casting them out from thence; but he did not receive them into his house, and entertain them as he ought to have done."
