# choicest prompt v1 X bht prompt v3; ['Henry Alford', 'Jamieson Fausset Brown', 'Albert Barnes', 'Marvin Vincent', 'John Calvin', 'Philip Schaff', 'Archibald T Robertson', 'Adam Clarke']

## Henry Alford:
1. "Beloved, imitate not evil, but good." 
2. "He that doeth good, is from God." 
3. "He that doeth evil, hath not seen God."

## Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Not that which is evil, as manifested in Diotrephes, but good." 
2. "Good, as manifested in Demetrius, is of God." 
3. "He who is born of God, who is good, hath not seen God spiritually, not literally."

## Albert Barnes:
1. "Beloved, follow not that which is evil, but that which is good" - The writer is cautioning against imitating the negative example of Diotrephes, urging Gaius to choose the path of goodness instead. This serves as a reminder to not be influenced by those who do wrong, even if they hold positions of influence in the church.

2. "He that doeth good is of God" - By doing good, one reflects the character of God, who is constantly engaged in acts of goodness. This highlights the importance of imitating God's nature and demonstrating it through our actions.

3. "He that doeth evil hath not seen God" - Those who engage in evil actions are disconnected from God. This echoes the sentiment expressed in 1 John 3:8-10, emphasizing the contrast between those who follow the path of evil and those who have a genuine relationship with God.

## Marvin Vincent:
1. "Follow [μιμου] . More correctly, as Rev., imitate."
2. "Mimov means both an actor and a kind of prose drama, intended as a familiar representation of life and character, and without any distinct plot."
3. "That which is evil - that which is good [το κακον - το αγαθον] . Compare ta ajgaqa good, ta faula evil, John 5:29."

## Philip Schaff:
1. "The spirit and acts of Diotrephes, and those like him, are not of God, not fruits of regeneration: he that doeth evil hath not seen God, hath no spiritual knowledge of Him."
2. "The good to be imitated has its example in Demetrius, whose report had reached St. John concurrently with that of Diotrephes."
3. "These men stand here as individuals, to whom the apostle gave his testimony, not only from the evidence of their works, but also from his sure discernment of their character."

## Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Imitate not (μη μιμου). Present middle imperative in prohibition (do not have the habit of imitating) of μιμεομα (from μιμος, actor, mimic), old word, in N.T. only here, 2 Thessalonians 3:7; 2 Thessalonians 3:9; Hebrews 13:7."

2. "But that which is good (αλλα το αγαθον). 'But the good.' As in Romans 12:21 again. Probably by the contrast between Diotrephes and Demetrius."

3. "He that doeth good (ο αγαθοποιων). Articular present active participle of αγαθοποιεω, late and rare verb, in contrast with ο κακοποιων (old and common verb) as in Mark 3:4; Luke 6:9; 1 Peter 3:17."

## Adam Clarke:
1. "Do not imitate that wicked man, i.e., the conduct of Diotrephes; be merciful, loving, and kind."
2. "He who doeth good is of God - he alone is the person who uses rightly the grace received from God, and he alone shall enjoy the Divine approbation."
3. "He who is unfeeling, unmerciful, unkind, hath not seen God - has no proper knowledge of that God whose NAME is mercy, and whose NATURE is love."


# BHT:
Imitating goodness, not evil, is emphasized in this passage. The writer cautions against following the negative example of Diotrephes and encourages choosing the path of goodness instead. By doing good, one reflects the character of God and demonstrates a genuine relationship with Him. Those who engage in evil actions are disconnected from God and lack a proper understanding of His nature of mercy and love.
