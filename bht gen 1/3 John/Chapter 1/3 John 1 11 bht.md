# 3 John 11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Beloved, let us not be swayed by the negative examples set by others, but instead choose the path of goodness. By doing good, we reflect the nature of God and demonstrate our connection to Him. Those who engage in evil actions reveal their lack of knowledge and understanding of God's ways. Therefore, let us imitate that which is good and avoid being influenced by the actions of the wicked.
