# choicest prompt v1 X bht prompt v3; ['Henry Alford', 'Jamieson Fausset Brown', 'Albert Barnes', 'Marvin Vincent', 'John Calvin', 'Philip Schaff', 'Archibald T Robertson', 'Adam Clarke']

## Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Peace - peace inward of conscience, peace fraternal of friendship, peace supernal of glory."
2. "Still Christ recognizes the relation of friend also, based on the highest grounds, obedience to Him from love, and entailing the highest privileges, admission to the intimacy of the holy and glorious God, and sympathizing Savior."
3. "Here in a friendly letter, mention of 'friends' appropriately occurs."

## Albert Barnes:
1. "It is proper to desire for our friends all temporal good; to wish their happiness in every respect." 
2. "It is an unspeakable pleasure to a Christian to learn that his friends are living and acting as becomes sincere Christians."
3. "It is the duty and the privilege of those who love the cause of religion to go and preach the gospel to those who are destitute, expecting to receive nothing from them, and doing it as a work of pure benevolence."
4. "It is our duty to contribute to the support of those who thus go among the pagan, and to help them in every way in which we can promote the object which they have in view."
5. "For the same reason it is our duty to contribute to the support of missionaries in the destitute places of our own land."
6. "We may see from this Epistle that churches 'ought' to be united in promoting the cause of religion."
7. "We may see, from this Epistle, the evil of having one troublesome man in the church."
8. "There may be circumstances where it is proper - where it is a duty - to receive those who have been cast out of the church."
9. "Finally, let us learn from the examples commended in this brief Epistle, to do good."

## Marvin Vincent:
1. "The phrase 'face to face' implies a deep and personal connection, a level of intimacy that cannot be achieved through written correspondence alone." 

2. "In a world where communication is often impersonal and distant, the idea of meeting someone 'face to face' carries great significance. It speaks to the desire for genuine connection and the importance of personal interaction in building relationships." 

3. "When we meet someone face to face, we have the opportunity to truly see and understand them, to read their expressions and body language, and to engage in meaningful conversation. It is in these moments that true understanding and fellowship can occur."

## Archibald T Robertson:
1. "We shall speak (λαλησομεν). Literary plural really singular like ελπιζω." 
2. "Face to face (στομα προς στομα). As in 2 John 1:12." 
3. "Peace to thee (ειρηνη σο). Pax tibi like the Jewish greeting shalom (Luke 10:5; Luke 24:36; John 20:19; John 20:21)."

## Adam Clarke:
1. "Mayest thou possess every requisite good, both of a spiritual and temporal kind."
2. "Greet the friends by name - remember me to all those with whom I am acquainted, as if I had specified them by name."
3. "The epistle contains many excellent sentiments, which, if judiciously handled, might be very useful to the Church of God."
