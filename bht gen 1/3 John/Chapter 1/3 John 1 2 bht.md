# 3 John 2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This verse suggests that the well-being of the physical body should be desired just after the prosperity of one's soul. It is a prayer that encompasses both spiritual and physical prosperity, wishing for success in worldly matters and bodily health to be in alignment with the growth and righteousness of the soul. It reflects the understanding that physical well-being is important for the enjoyment of other blessings, and highlights the idea that true prosperity is dependent on the blessings and grace of God.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Of course, since his soul’s prosperity is presupposed, 'above all things' does not imply that John wishes Gaius’ bodily health above that of his soul, but as the first object to be desired next after spiritual health."
2. "I know you are prospering in the concerns of your soul. I wish you similar prosperity in your body."
3. "Perhaps John had heard from the brethren that Gaius was in bad health, and was tried in other ways, to which the wish refers."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "In every respect, I wish that it may go as well with you as it does with your soul; that in your worldly prosperity, your comfort, and your bodily health, you may be as prosperous as you are in your religion."
2. "It shows that it is right to wish that our friends may have success in the works of their hands and their plans of life."
3. "John had learned, it would seem, from the 'brethren' who had come to him, that Gaius was living as became a Christian; that he was advancing in the knowledge of the truth, and was exemplary in the duties of the Christian life; and he prays that in all other respects he might be prospered as much as he was in that."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Beloved. Compare the plural, 1 John 3:2, 1 John 3:21; 1 John 4:1, 1 John 4:7, 1 John 4:11."
2. "Mayst prosper [ευοδουσθαι] . Lit., have a prosperous journey. From ejn well, and oJdov a way."
3. "The soul [ψυχη] is the principle of individuality, the seat of personal impressions. It has a side in contact with both the material and the spiritual element of humanity, and is thus the mediating organ between body and spirit."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "In all things (περ παντων). To be taken with ευοδουσθα and like περ in 1 Corinthians 16:1, 'concerning all things.'"
2. "Thou mayest prosper (σε ευοδουσθα). Infinitive in indirect discourse (object infinitive) after ευχομα, with accusative of general reference σε (as to thee)."
3. "Even as thy soul prospereth (καθως ευοδουτα σου η ψυχη). A remarkable comparison which assumes the welfare (present middle indicative of ευοδοω) of his soul (ψυχη here as the principle of the higher life as in John 12:27, not of the natural life as in Matthew 6:25)."

### John Gill:
1. "Success of this sort depends upon the blessing of God, which maketh rich, it is to be wished and prayed for from him."
2. "Without [good health], there can be no comfortable enjoyment of either [riches, possessions, or friends]."
3. "The soul is diseased with sin, and may be said to be in good health when all its iniquities are forgiven; and may be said to prosper when it feeds upon the Gospel, is nourished by it, and grows thereby."
