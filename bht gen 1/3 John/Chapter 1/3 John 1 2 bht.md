# choicest prompt v1 X bht prompt v3; ['Henry Alford', 'Jamieson Fausset Brown', 'Albert Barnes', 'Marvin Vincent', 'John Calvin', 'Philip Schaff', 'Archibald T Robertson', 'Adam Clarke']

## Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Of course, since his soul’s prosperity is presupposed, 'above all things' does not imply that John wishes Gaius’ bodily health above that of his soul, but as the first object to be desired next after spiritual health."
2. "I know you are prospering in the concerns of your soul. I wish you similar prosperity in your body."
3. "Perhaps John had heard from the brethren that Gaius was in bad health, and was tried in other ways, to which the wish refers."

## Albert Barnes:
1. "In every respect, I wish that it may go as well with you as it does with your soul; that in your worldly prosperity, your comfort, and your bodily health, you may be as prosperous as you are in your religion."
2. "It shows that it is right to wish that our friends may have success in the works of their hands and their plans of life."
3. "John had learned, it would seem, from the 'brethren' who had come to him, that Gaius was living as became a Christian; that he was advancing in the knowledge of the truth, and was exemplary in the duties of the Christian life; and he prays that in all other respects he might be prospered as much as he was in that."

## Marvin Vincent:
1. "Beloved. Compare the plural, 1 John 3:2, 1 John 3:21; 1 John 4:1, 1 John 4:7, 1 John 4:11."
2. "Mayst prosper [ευοδουσθαι] . Lit., have a prosperous journey. From ejn well, and oJdov a way."
3. "The soul [ψυχη] is the principle of individuality, the seat of personal impressions. It has a side in contact with both the material and the spiritual element of humanity, and is thus the mediating organ between body and spirit."

## Archibald T Robertson:
1. "In all things (περ παντων). To be taken with ευοδουσθα and like περ in 1 Corinthians 16:1, 'concerning all things.'"
2. "Thou mayest prosper (σε ευοδουσθα). Infinitive in indirect discourse (object infinitive) after ευχομα, with accusative of general reference σε (as to thee)."
3. "Even as thy soul prospereth (καθως ευοδουτα σου η ψυχη). A remarkable comparison which assumes the welfare (present middle indicative of ευοδοω) of his soul (ψυχη here as the principle of the higher life as in John 12:27, not of the natural life as in Matthew 6:25)."

## Adam Clarke:
1. "Above all things I pray that thou mayest prosper, and be in health." 
2. "The prayer of St. John for Caius includes three particulars: 1. Health of body; 2. Health of soul; and 3. Prosperity in secular affairs." 
3. "These three things, so necessary to the comfort of life, every Christian may in a certain measure expect, and for them every Christian is authorized to pray."

In this passage, the commentator quotes express the wish for the well-being and success of the recipient in both their spiritual and physical lives. The commentators highlight the importance of spiritual health and prosperity while acknowledging the significance of bodily health and worldly success. This prayer encompasses three key aspects: the flourishing of the soul, physical well-being, and prosperity in secular matters. It is a reminder that Christians can pray for and expect these essential aspects of a fulfilling life.
