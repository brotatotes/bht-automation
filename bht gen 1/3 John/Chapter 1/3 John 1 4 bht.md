# choicest prompt v1 X bht prompt v3; ['Henry Alford', 'Jamieson Fausset Brown', 'Albert Barnes', 'Marvin Vincent', 'John Calvin', 'Philip Schaff', 'Archibald T Robertson', 'Adam Clarke']

## Henry Alford:
1. "I have no greater joy than this... that I hear of my children walking in the truth." 
2. "These comparatives of comparatives and superlatives are found both in classical and in N. T. Greek." 
3. "The expression 'my children' here seems to favor the idea that the 'kyria' of the 2nd Epistle is a Church."

## Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "The 'elect lady' mentioned in this verse is understood to be a metaphor for the Church, specifically the members of the Church who are referred to as 'my children' by the author."
2. "This interpretation reinforces the idea that the Church is not just an institution, but a family, with the author addressing the members as his own children."
3. "By referring to the Church as the 'elect lady,' the author emphasizes the special and chosen status of the believers, highlighting their role as part of God's chosen people."

## Albert Barnes:
1. "This is such language as would be used by an aged apostle when speaking of those who had been converted by his instrumentality, and who looked up to him as a father."
2. "The highest joy that a Christian parent can have is to know that his children, whether at home or abroad, adhere to the truths of religion, and live in accordance with the requirements of the gospel of Christ."
3. "There is no joy in a family like that when children are converted; there is no news that comes from abroad that diffuses so much happiness through the domestic circle as the intelligence that a child is truly converted to the Saviour."

## Marvin Vincent:
1. "Joy [χαραν] . The texts vary; some reading carin grace or favor from God, on which see 2 John 1:3."
2. "Note the Greek order: greater joy than this have I not."
3. "Walk [περιπατουντα] . Rev., rightly, walking. The participle expresses something habitual."

## Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Greater (μειζοτεραν). A double comparative with -τερος added to μειζων, like our 'lesser' and like μαλλον κρεισσον (more better) in Philippians 1:23."
2. "In Ephesians 3:8 we have ελαχιστοτερω, a comparative on a superlative. Like forms occur in the vernacular papyri and even in Homer (χειροτερος, more worse) as also in Shakespeare."
3. "Walking in truth (εν αληθεια περιπατουντα). As in 2 John 1:4, which see. By the use of τεκνα John may mean that Gaius is one of his converts (1 Timothy 1:1)."

## Adam Clarke:
1. "From this it has been inferred that Caius was one of St. John's converts, and consequently not the Corinthian Caius, who was converted, most probably, by St. Paul."
2. "But the apostle might use the term children here as implying those who were immediately under his pastoral care."
3. "There is much both of propriety and dignity in the appellation coming from such a person."
