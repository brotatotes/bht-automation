2. "Whatsoever thou doest...in all your conduct toward them."

1. "Thou doest faithfully." - The Rev. is best. There is no parallel to justify the third and fourth. 
2. "Thou doest [εργαση]." - 'Ergazomai, like prassein, contemplates the process rather than the end of action, carrying the ideas of continuity and repetition.
3. "And to strangers [και εις τους ξενους]." - The best texts read, instead of eijv touv to the (strangers), touto, that; so that the sentence is, literally, "to them that are brethren, and that strangers."
