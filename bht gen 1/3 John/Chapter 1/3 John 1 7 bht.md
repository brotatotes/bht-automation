## Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "taking nothing — refusing to receive aught by way of pay, or maintenance, though justly entitled to it"
2. "the Christians just gathered out by their labors from among the heathen"
3. "It would have been inexpedient to have taken aught from the infant churches among the heathen: the case was different in receiving hospitality from Gaius."

## Albert Barnes:
1. "They had undertaken this journey not on their own account, but in the cause of religion."
2. "They resolved to receive no part of their support from the Gentiles, but to depend upon the aid of their Christian brethren."
3. "It was doubtless from prudential considerations, lest it should hinder their success among them, and expose them to the charge of being actuated by a mercenary spirit."

## Marvin Vincent:
1. "For His Name's sake" - Rev., correctly, for the sake of the Name. The Name (Jesus Christ) is used thus absolutely in Acts 5:41; compare James 2:7.
2. "Taking nothing of" - For the phrase taking of, or from, see on 1 John 1:5.
3. "The Gentiles" - This word occurs elsewhere only in the Gospel of Matthew. The more common word is eqnh, which is the reading of the Tex. Rec. here: ejqnwn.

## Archibald T Robertson:
1. "This name is in essence the sum of the Christian creed" (Westcott) as in 1 Corinthians 12:3; Romans 10:9.
2. John is anxious that Christian missionaries receive nothing from the heathen, as our missionaries have to watch against the charge of being after money.
3. Paul in 3 John 1:1 defends the right of preachers to pay, but refuses himself to accept it from Corinth because it would be misunderstood.

## Adam Clarke:
1. "For his name's sake they went forth - For the sake of preaching the Gospel of the grace of God, and making known JESUS to the heathen."
2. "Taking nothing of the Gentiles - Receiving no emolument for their labour, but in every respect showing themselves to be truly disinterested."
3. "But some construe εξηλθον, they went out, with αποτωνεθνων, from the Gentiles, or rather by the Gentiles, and give the passage this sense: They went out, i.e., were driven out by the Gentiles, taking nothing with them, i.e., leaving all their property behind, so that they were in a state of great destitution."


# BHT:
For the sake of preaching the Gospel and making Jesus known to the heathen, the Christians went forth on their journey, refusing to accept any payment or support from the Gentiles. They did so to maintain their disinterestedness and prevent any accusations of being driven by a mercenary spirit. Their decision was based on prudential considerations and a concern for the success and reputation of their mission among the heathen. The Christians relied on the support of their fellow believers, emphasizing the significance and essence of the Name of Jesus in their creed.
