Present active infinitive (habit of welcoming) of υπολαμβανω, old word, to take up under, to carry off (Acts 1:9), to reply (Luke 10:30), to suppose (Acts 2:15), only here in N.T. in this sense of receiving hospitably or to take under one's protection like υποδεχομα (Luke 10:38)."

# BHT:
In this verse, the biblical message is urging believers to warmly embrace and support those who have been persecuted for their faith. These individuals, who have risked their lives and lost everything for the sake of righteousness, should be welcomed with open arms. By doing so, believers become active participants in spreading and upholding the truth, as well as providing assistance to those who proclaim it. This call to communal support encourages unity and reinforces the shared responsibility of all believers in advancing the Gospel.
