## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "That Epistle was not designed by the Spirit for the universal Church, or else it would have been preserved." 
2. "Loveth... pre-eminence — through ambition. Evidently occupying a high place in the Church where Gaius was."
3. "Receiveth us not — virtually, namely, by not receiving with love the brethren whom we recommended to be received."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The fair interpretation of this passage is, that these brethren had gone forth on some former occasion, commended by John to the church, and had been rejected by the influence of Diotrephes."
2. "The idea is, that he rejected his interference in the matter, and was not disposed to acknowledge him in any way."
3. "The case furnishes an illustration of the bad influence of one ambitious and arrogant man in a church."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The best texts insert ti somewhat, which indicates that the apostle did not regard the communication as specially important."
2. "Diotrephes [διοτρεφης] . The name is from Diov of Zeus (Jove), and trefw to nourish, and means Jove - nursed."
3. "Who loveth to have the pre-eminence [ο φιλοπρωτευων] . From the adjective filoprwtov fond of being first. The word occurs here only."

### Philip Schaff:

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Not epistolary aorist nor a reference to II John as Findlay holds, but an allusion to a brief letter of commendation."
2. "This ambitious leader and sympathizer with the Gnostics would probably prevent the letter referred to being read to the church."
3. "This ambition of Diotrephes does not prove that he was a bishop over elders, as was true in the second century (as Ignatius shows). He may have been an elder (bishop) or deacon, but clearly desired to rule the whole church."

### John Gill:
1. "The Alexandrian copy and one of Stephens's read, 'I wrote something to the church'; upon this head, concerning receiving and supporting ministers of the Gospel, and so prevents an objection that Gaius might make, why did he not write to the church about it?"
2. "This ambitious spirit prevailed and obtained among the false teachers, who set up themselves at the head of parties, and above the apostles of Christ, and paved the way for antichrist, who assumed the title of universal bishop, which has introduced all the errors and impieties of the Romish church."
3. "Now this man such an ambitious, lordly, and governing spirit, received not the Apostle John, and those that were with him; meaning not their persons, for as yet he and they were not in person where he was; but his letter, his orders, and instructions; these he paid no regard to, concealed them from the church, and would not admit them to be read."
