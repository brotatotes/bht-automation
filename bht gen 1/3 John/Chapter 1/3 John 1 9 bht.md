# choicest prompt v1 X bht prompt v3; ['Henry Alford', 'Jamieson Fausset Brown', 'Albert Barnes', 'Marvin Vincent', 'John Calvin', 'Philip Schaff', 'Archibald T Robertson', 'Adam Clarke']

## Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "That Epistle was not designed by the Spirit for the universal Church, or else it would have been preserved." 
2. "Loveth... pre-eminence — through ambition. Evidently occupying a high place in the Church where Gaius was."
3. "Receiveth us not — virtually, namely, by not receiving with love the brethren whom we recommended to be received."

## Albert Barnes:
1. "The fair interpretation of this passage is, that these brethren had gone forth on some former occasion, commended by John to the church, and had been rejected by the influence of Diotrephes."
2. "The idea is, that he rejected his interference in the matter, and was not disposed to acknowledge him in any way."
3. "The case furnishes an illustration of the bad influence of one ambitious and arrogant man in a church."

## Marvin Vincent:
1. "The best texts insert ti somewhat, which indicates that the apostle did not regard the communication as specially important."
2. "Diotrephes [διοτρεφης] . The name is from Diov of Zeus (Jove), and trefw to nourish, and means Jove - nursed."
3. "Who loveth to have the pre-eminence [ο φιλοπρωτευων] . From the adjective filoprwtov fond of being first. The word occurs here only."

## Philip Schaff:
1. "I wrote somewhat to the church: not meaning either important or unimportant, but touching the maintenance of the evangelists." 
2. "Diotrephes, who loveth to have the pre-eminence among them, the members of the church, receiveth us not." 
3. "We know nothing about this man but what is contained in this graphic sketch of him."

## Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Not epistolary aorist nor a reference to II John as Findlay holds, but an allusion to a brief letter of commendation."
2. "This ambitious leader and sympathizer with the Gnostics would probably prevent the letter referred to being read to the church."
3. "This ambition of Diotrephes does not prove that he was a bishop over elders, as was true in the second century (as Ignatius shows). He may have been an elder (bishop) or deacon, but clearly desired to rule the whole church."

## Adam Clarke:
1. "Diotrephes, who loveth to have the pre-eminence... magnified himself in his office; he loved such eminence, and behaved himself haughtily in it." 
2. "Does not acknowledge the apostolical authority... receiveth us not-would not acknowledge my authority to interfere with any of the matters of his Church." 
3. "I have written unto thee... that thou wouldst receive those strangers and persecuted followers of our common Lord."


# BHT:
In this passage, we find a cautionary tale about the negative influence of ambition and arrogance in the church. The verses allude to a figure named Diotrephes, who desired power and recognition within the church. He rejected the authority of the apostles and dismissed their recommendations. His self-centered actions and refusal to show hospitality to fellow believers were consequences of his ambition. This passage serves as a warning against the detrimental effects of seeking personal preeminence and disregarding the unity and love within the church.
