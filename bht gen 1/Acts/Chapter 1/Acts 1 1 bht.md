# Acts 1:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The second part of the Bible is a continuation of the first, focusing on the works and teachings of Jesus Christ. It provides a narrative of the significant developments in Christian practice and government during a critical period in the Church's history. This book serves as a bridge between Christ's earthly ministry and His continued work through His chosen apostles and servants. It not only records the extraordinary actions and miracles of Jesus but also captures His obedience, holy life, and profound teachings, including parables and sermons.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The author proceeds at once to his narration, binding this second history to the first by recapitulating and enlarging the account given in the conclusion of the Gospel." 
2. "Whatever latitude may be given to this word, it must at all events exclude the notion that Luke had at this time seen the Gospels of Matt. or Mark, in which many things which Jesus did and taught are contained, which he had not related in his πρῶτος λόγος."
3. "The Gospel contained the ἀρχάς, the outset, of all the doings and teachings of our Lord, as distinguished from this second treatise, which was to relate their sequel and results."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The one embracing His work on earth, the other His subsequent work from heaven."
2. "The one in His own Person, the other by His Spirit."
3. "The grand history of what Jesus did and taught does not conclude with His departure to the Father; but Luke now begins it in a higher strain."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Since these events pertained to the descent of the Spirit, to the spread of the gospel, to the organization of the church, to the kind of preaching by which the church was to be collected and organized, and as the facts in the case constituted a full proof of the truth of the Christian religion, and the conduct of the apostles would be a model for ministers and the church in all future times, it was of great importance that a fair and full narrative of these things should be preserved."

2. "Of all - That is, of the principal, or most important parts of the life and doctrines of Christ. It cannot mean that he recorded all that Jesus did, as he had omitted many things that have been preserved by the other evangelists. The word 'all' is frequently thus used to denote the most important or material facts."

3. "To do - This refers to his miracles and his acts of benevolence, including all that he did for man’s salvation. It probably includes, therefore, his sufferings, death, and resurrection, as a part of what he has done to save people."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The history of the Church was under the immediate control of the exalted Redeemer, and may justly be considered as the continuation in heaven of the work which he had begun on earth."
2. "Thus the history which follows is linked to, or (may I not rather say) welded with, the past; and the founding of the Church in the earth is presented as one continuous work, begun by the Lord in person, and perfected by the same Lord through the ministry of men."
3. "The following writings appear intended to give us, and do, in fact, profess to give us, that which Jesus continued to do and teach after the day in which he was taken up."

### John Calvin:
1. "The sum of the gospel consisteth of these two parts, namely, of the doctrine of Christ, and of his acts; forasmuch as he did not only bring unto men that embassage which was given him in charge of his Father, but also performed all things that could be required of the Messias."

2. "Here must we note, that those which have only the bare knowledge of the history have not the gospel; unless the knowledge of the doctrine which maketh manifest the fruits of the acts of Christ be adjoined thereunto."

3. "For this is a holy knot which no man may dissolve. Therefore, whensoever mention is made of the doctrine of Christ, let us learn to adjoin thereunto his works, as seals whereby the truth thereof is established and confirmed, and the effect declared."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The position this book occupied from the very early days of Christianity in the teaching of the Church, leads us to conclude that it must tell the story of some peculiar and critical period in the Church’s history, that it must relate some all-important and vital developments of Christian practice and government." 
2. "The ‘Acts’ is no mere memoirs of events to which St. Luke happened to be the witness, no mere history of the acts of a Peter or a Paul, except in so much as these distinguished apostolic leaders were the chosen instruments of Christian development and progress."
3. "The former treatise (St. Luke’s Gospel) relates all that Jesus began to do and to teach till He was taken up. What St. Luke was about to do in his second treatise was simply to take up the thread of his first, and to relate the continuation of the gospel story, to show how the now risen and ascended Lord still worked among men, how, though unseen, He still guided the footsteps of His chosen servants."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "The Acts of the Apostles" may be accepted as probably correct. (quote 1)
2. The use of the superlative "first treatise" emphasizes that it is the first in a series. (quote 2)
3. The Acts of the Apostles is a continuation of the doings and teachings of Jesus. (quote 3)

### John Gill:
1. "This is a summary of his former treatise, his Gospel, which gave an account of what Christ began to do, and did; not of the common and private actions of his life; or of what was done, either in public, or private, throughout the whole of his life; but of his extraordinary actions, of the miracles he wrought." 

2. "Particularly of all things he did relating to the salvation of his people; of the whole of his obedience; of his compliance with the ceremonial law; of his submission to baptism; of his holy life and conversation, and entire conformity to the law." 

3. "And not only Luke, in his Gospel, gave an account of these his actions, but also of many of his excellent discourses, his parables, and his sermons, whether delivered to the people in common, or to his own disciples."
