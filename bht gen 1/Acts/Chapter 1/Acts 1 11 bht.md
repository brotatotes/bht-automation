### Henry Alford:
1. "There is a propriety in the address, ἄνδρ . Γαλιλαῖοι . It served to remind them of their origin, their call to be His disciples, and the duty of obedience to Him resting on them in consequence."
2. "ὃν τρόπον ] in the same manner as; to be taken in all cases literally, not as implying mere certainty."
3. "ἐλεύσεται ] ‘Non ii, qui ascendentem viderunt, dicuntur venturum visuri. Inter ascensionem et inter adventum gloriosum nullus interponitur eventus eorum utrique par: ideo hi duo conjunguntur. Merito igitur Apostoli ante datam Apocalypsin diem Christi ut valde propinquum proposuerunt. Et congruit majestati Christi, ut toto inter ascensionem et inter adventum tempore sine intermissione expectetur.’ Bengel."

### John Calvin:
1. "Let us first learn out of this place that we must not seek Christ either in heaven, either upon earth, otherwise than by faith; and also, that we must not desire to have him present with us bodily in the world; for he that doth either of those two shall oftentimes go farther from him."
2. "The angels’ intent was to call back the apostles from desiring the carnal presence of Christ. For this purpose was it that they said that he should not come again until he came to judge the world."
3. "The only looking for Christ’s coming must both restrain the importunate desires of our flesh, and support our patience in all our adversities; and, lastly, it must refresh our weariness."
