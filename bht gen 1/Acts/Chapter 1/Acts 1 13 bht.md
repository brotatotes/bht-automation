# Acts 1:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we find the disciples gathered in an upper room, possibly the same room where they had celebrated the last Supper with Jesus. This upper room was not just a place to stay but a significant meeting place for the disciples, set apart for devotion and religious conversation. Despite their past failures, the disciples were now firm and steadfast in their faith, eagerly awaiting the pouring forth of the Holy Spirit. This choice of the upper room highlights the importance of prayer and seeking God's presence in their ministry.
