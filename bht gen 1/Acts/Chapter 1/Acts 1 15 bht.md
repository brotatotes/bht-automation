# Acts 1:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the days following the Ascension and leading up to Pentecost, there was an increase in the number of followers who gathered together in the upper room. The term "names" signifies that it was not just a small group, but a considerable gathering of disciples and believers. This assembly consisted of a diverse crowd, and though the hundred and twenty mentioned were present in the upper room, there were likely more followers of Jesus in other places. Additionally, there were even larger gatherings where more than five hundred people had witnessed the risen Lord.
