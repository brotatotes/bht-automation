This Scripture, filled with prophetic significance, reveals the treachery and betrayal that can arise from unexpected corners of our lives.

### John Calvin:

3. "Such manner of speeches bring greater reverence to the Scriptures, whilst we are taught by them that David and all the rest of the prophets did speak only as they were directed by the Holy Ghost."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Guided by the Holy Spirit, St. Peter finds in these words of the two Psalms this especially sad episode in the history of Christ plainly foreshadowed, and discovers in them an injunction to proceed to the election of another to make up the number of the Twelve."
2. "St. Peter’s words here give us the clue to the right understanding of the terrible imprecations found in some of the Psalms. They are no curses pronounced by David or any other king or prophet; they are never the expression of a longing for personal revenge, but are, as Chrysostom expresses it, a prophecy in the form of a curse pronounced upon some enemies of God and His Church, hereafter to arise."
3. "The Jewish nation had been trained in a sterner school, It had been steeled and hardened by the discipline which had pledged to a war of extermination with idolaters. ... It is conceivable how even a righteous man under it, feeling it to be his bounden duty to root out evil whenever he saw it, and identifying, as he did, his own enemies with the enemies of Jehovah, might use language which to us appears unnecessarily vindictive."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Brethren (ανδρες αδελφο). Literally, men, brethren or brother men. More dignified and respectful than just 'brethren.' Women are included in this address though ανδρες refers only to men."

3. "Peter here claims the Holy Spirit as speaking in the scriptures as he does in 2 Peter 1:21. His description of Judas as 'guide' (οδηγου) to those who seized (συλλαβουσιν) Jesus is that of the base traitor that he was."

### John Gill:
1. "This Scripture must needs have been fulfilled; or 'must needs be fulfilled': referring either to Psalms 41:9 or rather to the passages after cited out of Psalms 69:25. There was a necessity of the fulfilling of it, consistent with the prescience of God, his counsel, and decree, and the veracity of the Scripture."
2. "And the apostle might observe this also, to make the minds of the disciples easy, under this awful providence, since it was no other than what was predicted."
3. "Even many hundreds of years before the event; and which shows the omniscience, and so the deity of the Holy Ghost, and the divine authority of David's Psalms; as well as the honour that was put upon him to be the instrument by which the Holy Ghost speaks, and to be his amanuensis."

### John Wesley:
1. "This verse speaks to the betrayal and deception that can occur even among close friends. It reminds us that even those we trust the most can turn against us."

3. "The verse also serves as a reminder that Jesus himself experienced betrayal, as Judas Iscariot, one of his own disciples, betrayed him for thirty pieces of silver."
