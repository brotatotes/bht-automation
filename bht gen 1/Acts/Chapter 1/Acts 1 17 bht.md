# Acts 1:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Judas, one of the twelve apostles, was chosen by Jesus to be part of their esteemed number, filling the important role that was prophesied. Despite his ultimate betrayal, Judas held a significant place among the disciples, even being trusted with the task of managing the financial matters of their group. He participated in the ministry, preaching, baptizing, and performing miracles, but ultimately his actions would lead to his downfall, causing shock and amazement among those who had once esteemed him.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "ὅτι, not ‘although’ (Kuinoel), but because: it gives the reason of the previous assertion, viz. that Judas held, and had betrayed, that place of high trust of which the prophecy spoke."
2. "Thus the ὅτι has reference to the substance of the prophecy, already in Peter’s mind, and serves to explain ἡ ἔπαυλις αὐτοῦ and ἡ ἐπισκοπὴ αὐτοῦ."
3. "ἔλαχεν τὸν κλῆρον] not literally, but inasmuch as the lot of every man is regarded as being cast and appointed by God."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He was chosen as an apostle by the Lord Jesus... This does not mean that he was a true Christian, but that he was reckoned among the apostles."
2. "A most important object was gained in having such a man - a spy - among them... the testimony of such a man as Judas, if favorable, must be invaluable."
3. "Judas would have done it if he could. But he alleged no such charge; he did not even dare to lisp a word against the pure designs of the Lord Jesus."

These quotes highlight the significance of Judas being chosen as an apostle, the potential value of his testimony, and his ultimate failure to bring any charges against Jesus.
