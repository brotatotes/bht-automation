## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Luke could not have been acquainted with the Gospel of Matthew at this time, or surely this apparent discrepancy would not have been found."
2. "What then are we to decide respecting the two accounts? That there should have been a double account actually current of the death of Judas at this early period is in the highest degree improbable."
3. "An accurate acquaintance with the actual circumstances would account for the discrepancy, but nothing else."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

3. "The word here rendered 'headlong' - πρηνής prēnēs (Latin 'pronus,' whence our English word 'prone') - means properly 'bent forward, head-foremost'; and the idea is, that his position in hanging himself was such that when the cord broke he fell headlong, or fell forward on his face."

### Marvin Vincent:

### John Calvin:
1. "For to what end should Peter here reckon up unto the disciples those things which they already knew well enough?"
2. "But whereas some do answer, that Peter spoke this unto the Galileans, whose speech did disagree with the Jewish tongue, it is but vain and frivolous."
3. "He enjoyed not the money; he only possessed the field."

1. "With the covenant money for the betrayal, acquired it indirectly."

### John Gill:
1. "It is somewhat difficult, that Judas should be said to purchase it, when Matthew says the chief priests bought it... Judas having received his money of the chief priests two days ago, might not only intend to purchase, but might really strike a bargain with the potter for his field."
2. "The death of Arius, as related by Athanasius, from Macarius the presbyter, who was present, was much after the same manner; who reports, that having swore to the orthodox faith, and being about to be introduced into the church at Constantinople, after the prayer of Alexander, the bishop of it, he went out to the seat, to ease nature; when he, on a sudden, fell down headlong, and burst in the middle, and immediately expired."
3. "As to the seeming difference between the Evangelist Matthew and the Apostle Peter, it may be reconciled by either of the ways before mentioned; though it seems most likely, that Judas not being able to bear the torments of his mind, he hanged himself, as Achitophel did, and was not strangled by the devil, or by any disease."
