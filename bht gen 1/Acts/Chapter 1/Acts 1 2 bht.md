# Acts 1:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
After Jesus' resurrection, he gave commands to his chosen apostles through the power of the Holy Spirit. The Ascension marked the completion of our redemption, as Jesus was taken up to heaven. From that day on, the Acts of the Apostles began, as the disciples were directed by the Holy Spirit to preach the gospel, establish the church, and carry out Christ's commission. This special commandment, given with divine authority, empowered them to fulfill their mission by the guidance of the Spirit.
