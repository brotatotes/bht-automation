# Acts 1:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we find Peter urging the selection of a new apostle to replace Judas. The chosen individual must fulfill the condition of being a witness of Jesus' resurrection, as well as the preceding and subsequent events. The emphasis is on the need for firsthand testimony to validate the reality of the resurrection. Being a witness entails not only intellectual belief but also personal encounter and intimate knowledge of the risen Christ. The selection serves to maintain the symbolic significance of the twelve apostles, mirroring the twelve tribes of Israel and representing the foundation of the new Jerusalem.
