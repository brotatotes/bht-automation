## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "τὸν τόπον τὸν ἴδιον] With the reading τόπον before, I think these words may be interpreted two ways: 1. that Judas deserted this our τόπος, our office and ministry, to go to his own τόπος, that part which he had chosen for himself, viz. the office and character of a traitor and enemy of God."
2. "regarding the former word τόπος as being selected to correspond to the more proper and dreadful use of the word here, that Judas deserted his τόπος, his appointed place, here among us, that he might go to his own appointed τόπος elsewhere, viz. among the dead in the place of torment."
3. "At the same time, no absolute sentence is pronounced on the traitor, but that dark surmise expressed by the euphemism τὸν τόπον τ. ἴδ., which none can help feeling with regard to him."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "A euphemistic or softened expression of the awful future of the traitor."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The former part of the sentence contains this sentiment: 'Another must be appointed to this office which the death of Judas has made vacant.' If this expression, 'that he might go,' etc., refers to the successor of Judas, it expresses the same sentiment, but more obscurely."
2. "The obvious and natural meaning of the phrase is to refer it to Judas. But those who suppose that it refers to Judas differ greatly about its meaning."

2. "These strange words which close the traitor’s gloomy story can convey no other possible sense than that Judas had gone to a place of condemnation." 
3. "The phrase, 'to go to one’s own place,' was a known and received phrase in the Apostolic Age, and signified a man’s going presently after death into his proper place - a state either of happiness or misery, according to the life he had before lived while on earth."
