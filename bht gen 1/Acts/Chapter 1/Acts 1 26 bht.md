# Acts 1:26 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the early Christian church, the selection of Matthias as an apostle was not left to chance but was a thoughtful and deliberate process. The use of lots, a practice rooted in Jewish tradition, symbolized the importance of communal involvement and the significance of unity in decision-making within the Christian community. The casting of lots was not seen as gambling, but as a way to discern the will of God. This particular event of casting lots for Matthias demonstrates how God's providence can guide and shape the outcome, even when it may be contrary to initial expectations or general consensus.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "These lots were probably tablets, with the names of the persons written on them, and shaken in a vessel, or in the lap of a robe (Pro 16:33); he whose lot first leaped out being the person designated." 
2. "The lot being regarded as the divine choice, the suffrages of the assembly were unanimously given (not in form, but by cheerful acquiescence) to the candidate thus chosen." 
3. "We have the precedent, of all others most applicable, of the twelve tribes, to show that the number, though ever nominally kept, was really exceeded."

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "The act of numbering or voting in Matthias by general suffrage demonstrates the importance of community involvement and consensus in the early Christian church." 
2. "The addition of Matthias to the eleven apostles not only filled the void left by Judas Iscariot but also symbolized the restoration and completion of the Twelve, a significant number in Jewish tradition." 
3. "This event highlights the significance of unity and the collective decision-making process in the early Christian community, emphasizing the importance of working together to fulfill God's purposes."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The casting of a lot is determined by laws of nature as regularly as anything else. There is properly no chance in it. We do not know how a die may turn up; but this does not imply that it will turn up without any regard to rule, or at haphazard."
2. "Almost all cases of doubt can be determined more satisfactorily in some other way than by the lot. The habit of appealing to it engenders the love of hazards and of games; leads to heart-burnings, to jealousies, to envy, to strife, and to dishonesty."
3. "The election of Matthias, however, throws some light on the organization of the church. 1. He was chosen to fill the place vacated by Judas, and for a specific purpose, to be a witness of the resurrection of Christ. There is no mention of any other design."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "He was numbered [συγκατεψηφισθη]. Only here in New Testament." 
2. "See on counteth, Luke 14:28."

### John Calvin:
1. "There is nothing which men do not corrupt with their boldness and vanity, whereby it is come to pass that they have brought lots into great abuse and superstition."
2. "Whilst the Chaldeans go about, with the name of astrology, to cloak and color their wicked curiosity, they defame a science both profitable and praiseworthy."
3. "We must not glory if we be extolled unto the skies in the opinion of men, and if by their voices and consents we be judged to be most excellent men; but we must rather have regard of this, to approve ourselves unto God, who alone is the most lawful and just judge."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The lots alluded to here were probably tablets with the names of the persons written upon them, and shaken in a vessel or in the lap of a robe." (Alford, Com. on Acts)
2. "This asking God directly to interfere in the choice of an apostle by guiding the chance of a lot, was not unfrequent in the history of the chosen people." 
3. "The ‘Acts of the Apostles,’ a book to which in future ages the Church would often refer for guidance, contains no repetition of such an election, either in the Holy Land or in the Gentile countries."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "To the Jews the lot did not suggest gambling, but 'the O.T. method of learning the will of Jehovah'." 
2. "The two nominations made a decision necessary and they appealed to God in this way." 
3. "The ancients used pebbles (ψηφο) in voting, black for condemning, white in acquitting."

### John Gill:
1. "And they gave forth their lots,.... Or 'gave forth lots for them', as the Vulgate Latin and Ethiopic versions; for Joseph and Matthias; some for one, and some for another; and which were cast into a man's lap, or into a vessel, and was no other than balloting for them."
2. "The lot with Matthias's name on it, was taken out against that which had the name of apostle on it, upon which he was declared to be the apostle."
3. "The lot fell upon Matthias; that is, either he had the largest number for him, their minds being so disposed by the providence of God; and it may be, contrary to the first thoughts and general sense of the body; but God, who knows the hearts of men, and can turn them as he pleases, and to whom they sought for direction, inclined their minds to vote for the latter."
