# Acts 1:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the midst of their limited understanding and expectations, the disciples persistently inquire about the restoration of the Kingdom to Israel, emphasizing their desire for a tangible, earthly dominion. Though Jesus does not dismiss or condemn their longing, their misconceptions and lingering ignorance are evident. Despite being diligently instructed for three years, the disciples still struggle to grasp the true nature of Christ's kingdom, blinded by their own flawed interpretations and carnal desires. The question reflects their resistance to the greater spiritual reality unfolding before them, providing a glimpse into their persistent anticipation of an earthly reign.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:

2. "Their fault was, a too curious enquiry on a point reserved among the arcana of God."
3. "The pres. ἀποκαθιστάνεις, is that so often used in speaking with reference to matters of prophecy, importing fixed determination: as in ὁ ἐρχόμενος (ref. Mt.) and the like."

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Doubtless their carnal views of Messiah's kingdom had by this time been modified." 
2. "But, as they plainly looked for some restoration of the kingdom to Israel, so they are neither rebuked nor contradicted on this point."

2. "From these expectations of the apostles we may learn: (2)That such prejudice will survive the plainest proofs to the contrary."
3. "Erroneous opinions thus maintain a secret ascendency in a man’s mind, and are revived by the slightest circumstances, even long after it was supposed that they were overcome, and in the face of the plainest proofs of reason or of Scripture."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The imperfect, denoting the repetition and urging of the question."
2. "The use of the imperfect tense emphasizes the persistence of the questioner."

### John Calvin:
1. "Marvelous is their rudeness, that when as they had been diligently instructed by the space of three whole years, they betray no less ignorance than if they had heard never a word."
2. "They ask him as concerning a kingdom; but they dream of an earthly kingdom, which should flow with riches, with dainties, with external peace, and with such like good things."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "This is the last interview with the Risen One on the Mount of Olives, which was closed by the ascension."

2. "His resurrection from the dead, and his discoursing with them about the kingdom of God, and ordering them to wait at Jerusalem, revived their hopes."
3. "This general expectation of the Jews is expressed by them in the same language as here: 'the days of the Messiah will be the time when the kingdom shall return, or be restored to Israel'."

### John Wesley:
1. "They still seemed to dream of an outward, temporal kingdom, in which the Jews should have dominion over all nations."
2. "It seems they came in a body, having before concerted the design, to ask when this kingdom would come."
