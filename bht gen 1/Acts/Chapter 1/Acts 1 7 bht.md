# Acts 1:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we are reminded that there are aspects of God's plan and timing that we may not fully understand. The distinction between "times" and "seasons" implies longer and shorter periods, and it is within God's power to reveal or keep hidden certain details. As followers of Christ, our focus should be on faithfully carrying out our present work and mission, trusting in God's sovereign control over the future.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "This is a general reproof and assertion, spoken with reference to men, as forbidden to search curiously into a point which Omniscience has reserved the times and seasons of the future divine dealings."
2. "It may be observed however, that the same assertion is not made here: only the times and seasons said to be in the power of the Almighty Father, Who ordereth all things according to the counsel of His will."
3. "The knowledge of the Son is not here in question, only that of the disciples."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "It is not for you to know the times, &c." - This statement emphasizes that the disciples' focus should not be on trying to predict or understand the timing of future events. It reminds them that their primary concern should be their present work and mission.

2. "implying not only that this was not the time" - This quote suggests that the disciples were seeking information about the timing of certain events, but Jesus indicates that it is not the appropriate time for those events to occur.

3. "the question was irrelevant to their present business and future work" - This highlights that the disciples' question about the timing of future events was not relevant to their current responsibilities and the work they were called to do. It emphasizes the importance of staying focused on their mission rather than getting caught up in speculation about future events.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The times or the seasons - The difference between these words is, that the former denotes any time or period that is indefinite or uncertain; the later denotes a fixed, definite, or appropriate time. They seem to be used here to denote the periods that would mark or determine all future events."
2. "All prophecy is remarkably obscure in regard to the time of its fulfillment. The reasons why it is so are such as the following: (2) As they are to be brought about by human agency, they are so arranged as to call forth that agency."
3. "Promises sufficiently clear and full are therefore given us to encourage us, but not so full as to excite a vain and idle curiosity."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The former of these words, time absolutely, without regard to circumstances; the latter, definite periods, with the idea of fitness."
2. "His own. Stronger than the simple possessive pronoun. The adjective means private, personal."
3. "Often used adverbially in the phrase kat' ijdian, apart, privately."

Note: The commentary does not provide any specific Bible verse to reference.

### John Calvin:
1. "But forasmuch as there is naturally engendered in us a certain foolish and vain curiosity, and also a certain rash kind of boldness, we must diligently observe this admonition of Christ, whereby he correcteth both these vices."
2. "This is the true mean between the two extremes...we must be desirous to learn so far as our heavenly Master doth teach us; but as for such things as he will have us ignorant of, let mine be so bold as to inquire after them that we may be wise with sobriety."
3. "For unless we will burst in against his will and commandment, this shall have force and strength enough to restrain the outrageousness of our wits."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The Lord’s reply in the 7th and 8th verses tacitly sanctions their expectation of a great restoration, but gravely rebukes the self-seeking impatience of His Jewish followers." 
2. "The whole teaching of the Acts shows that in the sight of God all men were alike, and might share in the same blessings His witnesses were to carry the good news of salvation to the uttermost part of the earth."
3. "Surely these ever recurring mistakes should call men back to consider the last words of the Lord whenever these vain attempts are made to fix times and seasons for the great restoration of all things."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Periods" and "points" of time sometimes and probably so here, but such a distinction is not always maintained. See Acts 17:26 for καιρους in the same sense as χρονους for long periods of time."
2. "It is curious how eager people have always been to fix definite dates about the second coming of Christ as the apostles were about the political Messianic kingdom which they were expecting."
3. "Emphasizing the sovereignty of the Father in keeping all such matters to himself, a gentle hint to people today about the limits of curiosity."

### John Gill:
1. "It is not for you to know the times or the seasons." - This verse reminds us that there are certain things that are beyond our understanding and knowledge. We should not indulge in a curious inquiry into future events that are not revealed to us by God.

2. "Only those things should be looked into which God has revealed." - We should focus on studying and understanding what God has already revealed to us, rather than trying to uncover hidden knowledge that is not within our grasp.

3. "Flesh and blood, which knows not its times and moments, ought to add a void space to the blessed God, who knows the times and moments." - We should humbly acknowledge our limited understanding and trust in God's perfect knowledge and timing. It is not for us to question or try to comprehend everything, but to have faith in God's sovereignty.

### John Wesley:
1. "Times, in the language of the Scriptures, denote a longer; seasons, a shorter space."
2. "To be revealed when and to whom it pleaseth him."
3. "The Father hath put [the times and seasons] in his own power."
