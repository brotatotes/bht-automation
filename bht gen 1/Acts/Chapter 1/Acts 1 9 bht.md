# Acts 1:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the account of the ascension of Jesus is described. The commentators highlight the visible nature of this event, as Jesus is seen ascending and being received into a cloud. This visible ascent serves to prove the reality of Jesus' departure to heaven, establishing the certainty of his work. Additionally, the ascension directs the disciples' attention away from earthly matters and towards the glory of the kingdom of God. The cloud that surrounds Jesus serves as a reminder of the limits of human understanding, humbling the disciples and preventing them from fixating on his departure.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "This appears to be an account of the Ascension given to Luke subsequently to the publication of his Gospel, more particular in detail than that found in it."
2. "ἐπήρθη 'was taken up,' we may understand of the commencing ascent ... ὑπέλαβεν by a pregn. constr involves the idea of away as well as up, and hence takes after it ἀπό. This verb describes the close of the scene, as far as it was visible to the spectators."
3. "There was a manifest propriety in the last withdrawal of the Lord, while ascending, not consisting in a disappearance of His Body, as on former occasions since the Resurrection; for thus might His abiding Humanity have been called in question. As it was, He went up, past the visible boundary of Heaven, the cloud, in human form, and so we think of and pray to Him."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "While they beheld, he was taken up—See on Acts 1:2. Lest it should be thought He had disappeared when they were looking in some other direction, and so was only concluded to have gone up to heaven, it is here expressly said that 'while they were looking He was taken up, and a cloud received Him out of their sight.'" 

2. "So Elijah, 'If thou see me when I am taken from thee' (2 Kings 2:10); 'And Elisha saw it' (2 Kings 2:12)."

3. "The ascension of Christ was not a mere vanishing from sight, but a real and visible ascent, in the body in which He had been clothed on earth, to the right hand of the Majesty on high."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Had Jesus vanished secretly, or had he disappeared in the night, the apostles would have been amazed and confounded; perhaps they would even have doubted whether they had not been deceived. But when they saw him leave them in this manner, they could not doubt that he had ascended to heaven, and that God approved his work, and would carry it forward."
2. "It enabled the apostles to state distinctly where the Lord Jesus was, and at once directed their affections and their thoughts away from the earth, and opened their eyes on the glory of the scheme of religion they were to establish. If their Saviour was in heaven, it settled the question about the nature of his kingdom. It was clear that it was not designed to be a temporal kingdom."
3. "The Lord Jesus also ascended that he might assume and exercise the office of King in the immediate seat of power. All worlds were made subject to him for the welfare of the church; and it was needful that he should be solemnly invested with that power in the presence of God as the reward of his earthly toils."

### John Calvin:
1. "The Lord himself meant to put the same out of all doubt, when as he hath ascended so manifestly, and hath confirmed the certainty of the same by other circumstances."
2. "There is no cause why they should doubt whither he was gone. Furthermore, the angels are there also to bear witness of the same."
3. "And we are taught by them that our mind is not able to ascend so high as to take a full view of the glory of Christ; therefore, let this cloud be a mean to restrain our boldness."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "the disciples of Jesus saw their Master lifted up from the ground"
2. "a cloud passed under Him...the bright cloud of glory"
3. "the ascension of Christ is as it were a bridge between earth and heaven, laid down for all who are drawn to Him by His earthly existence"

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "The present participle accents the fact that they were looking directly at Jesus."
2. "He seemed to be supported by the cloud."
3. "From their eyes."

Note: The commentary is quite short, so only three quotes were extracted.

### John Gill:
1. "They should tarry at Jerusalem, and in a few days be baptized with the Holy Ghost, and receive such power, abilities, strength, and courage thereby, as to bear a noble testimony for Christ, not only there, but in all the world." 
2. "Christ... was visible to them in [the ascension]; hence they were eyewitnesses of it."
3. "This [cloud] was done partly for the same purpose, to add to the grandeur and magnificence of Christ's ascension; and partly to check the curiosity of the disciples, and prevent their gazing any more at him."
