# Acts 10:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In a renowned city called Caesarea, which was inhabited by both Gentiles and Jews, a Roman centurion named Cornelius resided. This centurion, who belonged to the esteemed Italian band, held a position of authority and distinction. Remarkably, despite his military profession, Cornelius was known for his devout nature, upright conduct, and exceptional sincerity in worshipping the one true God. This significant encounter in Caesarea marks the beginning of a revelation, where Gentiles were welcomed into the fold on equal terms with Jews, as part of a divine plan orchestrated by God himself.
