# Acts 10:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this particular passage, a person is described as falling into a trance or ecstasy, where they are taken out of their natural state and enter into a supernatural realm. This trance allows the individual to receive divine revelation and understand things that they might not grasp in their normal state. The symbols and visions experienced during this trance are adapted to the person's current physical and mental condition, making them more relatable and understandable. Additionally, this trance state can be contrasted with a vision, as the two serve different purposes and have different effects on the individual experiencing them.

### Henry Alford:
1. "The distinction of this appearance from the ὅραμα above (though the usage is not always strictly observed) is, that in this case that which was seen was a revelation shewn to the eye of the beholder when rapt into a supernatural state, having, as is the case in a dream, no objective reality."
2. "In this case, the thing seen actually happened, and was beheld by the person as an ordinary spectator, in the possession of his natural senses."
3. "ἐκείνων is more likely to have been a correction of αὐτῶν as applying better to the people of the house, than the converse."
