# Acts 10:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we find a vivid description of a visionary experience where heaven is symbolically opened and a great sheet descends from above. The corners of the sheet are securely tied, representing a connection between heaven and earth. The knots are spread out, suggesting a widespread and inclusive link to heaven. The fastenings reach up towards heaven, emphasizing the desire to connect with the divine. This powerful imagery points to the opening of the mystery of the calling of the Gentiles and represents the purity and holiness of the church.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "This meaning of ἀρχή justified by Diod. Sic. i. p. 104, who, speaking of harpooning the hippopotamus, says, εἶθ ʼ ἑνὶ τῶν ἐμπαγέντων ἐνάπτοντες ἀρχὰς στυπίνας ἀφίασι μέχρις ἂν παραλυθῇ. The ends of the ropes were attached to the sheet, and, in the vision, they only were seen."
2. "These four ἀρχαί (whether ends of ropes attached to the corners, or those corners themselves) are not without meaning, directed as they are to the four parts of heaven, and intimating that men from the North, South, East, and West, now were accounted clean before God, and were called to a share in his kingdom: see Luke 13:29."
3. "The four ἀρχαί are the four gospels, because the word ἀρχή occurs somewhere near the beginning of each, &c., &c. Who can wonder, after this, at the distrust of all Scripture symbolism by intelligent, but unspiritual minds?"

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "The housetop was a place of solitude and quiet, away from the hustle and bustle of daily life. It was a place where one could find peace and reflection." 

2. "The sixth hour, or noon, was a time of intense heat in the Middle East. It was a time when people sought shade and respite from the scorching sun." 

3. "By choosing to go up to the housetop at noon, the individual in this verse demonstrates a desire for solitude and communion with God, away from the distractions of the world."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "This language is derived from a common mode of speaking in the Hebrew Scriptures, as if the sky above us was a solid, vast expanse, and as if it were opened to present an opportunity for anything to descend."
2. "The sacred writer does not say that Peter literally saw such an object descending; but he uses this as an imperfect description of the vision."
3. "Knit at the four corners - Bound, united, or tied. The corners were collected, as would be natural in putting anything into a great sheet."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The word is used in this sense by Herodotus, describing the sacrifices of the Scythians. The victim's forefeet are bound with a cord, 'and the person who is about to offer, taking his station behind the victim, pulls the end [αρχην] of the rope, and thereby throws the animal down' (4, 60)."
2. "It was the technical expression in medical language for the ends of bandages."
3. "We have thus in this passage a technical medical phrase - the ends of a bandage - used for the ends of a sheet, which hardly any one except a medical man would think of employing."

### John Calvin:
1. "The opening of heaven signifieth, in my judgment, another thing in this place than in the seventh chapter."
2. "For it is said there that heaven was opened to Stephen, that he did behold the glory of Christ."
3. "In this place Peter saw our heaven which we see divided, so that a sheet came thence."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The verb in the original denotes that he gazed upon the opened heaven, and carefully surveyed it." 
2. "The impression conveyed is that the great sheet not only floated from heaven, but gradually approached St. Peter, so as to invite his close examination."
3. "The more literal translation would be, ‘fastened to the ends of four cords,’ the upper part of the cords being lost in the heavens."

### Archibald T Robertson:

2. "Opened (ανεωιγμενον, perfect passive participle with double reduplication, state of completion)."
3. "Descending (καταβαινον). Present active participle describing the process."

### John Gill:
1. "Not literally, as at the baptism of Christ, and the stoning of Stephen; but in a visionary way, and which was an emblem of the opening and revealing the mystery of the calling of the Gentiles."
2. "Which seems to represent the church of God, whose original is from heaven, and consists of persons born from above, who have their conversation in heaven, and were designed for it."
3. "And which may be compared to a linen sheet for its purity and holiness; through the blood and righteousness of Christ, and the grace of his Spirit, and with respect to its discipline and conversation."
