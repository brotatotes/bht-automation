# Acts 10:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Upon a rooftop in the Eastern heat, a man named Peter, reposing or praying, is addressed by heaven's voice. He is called by name, encouraged to obey divine commands. Through the voice, God abolishes the distinction between clean and unclean creatures, expanding Peter's mission to preach the Gospel to all people, regardless of their background. From this rooftop encounter, Peter learns that God rejects no one and removes barriers of the old law.
