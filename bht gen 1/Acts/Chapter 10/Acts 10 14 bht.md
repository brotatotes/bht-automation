# Acts 10:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, Peter is presented with a vision that challenges his understanding of the dietary laws. He hesitates, voicing his concerns and reminding the divine interlocutor of his lifelong commitment to following God's laws. The distinction between clean and unclean animals holds symbolic significance, representing the distinction between the Hebrew nation and other nations. As Peter grapples with this new revelation, his doubts and hesitations serve as a reminder of the gradual enlightenment and unfolding of God's will. The initial objections and delay ultimately lead to a clearer understanding of God's plan.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Peter rightly understands the command as giving him free choice of all the creatures shown to him." 
2. "We cannot infer hence that the sheet contained unclean animals only. It was a mixture of clean and unclean, the aggregate, therefore, being unclean."
3. "κύριε (Lord) is here addressed to the unknown heavenly speaker."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Not so, Lord—See Marginal reference."
2. "I have never eaten anything that is common—that is, not sanctified by divine permission to eat of it, and so 'unclean.'"
3. "The distinction of meats was a sacrament of national distinction, separation, and consecration."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Peter pled that he had never violated it, implying that he could not now violate it, as it was a law of God."
2. "One design of the vision was to show him that that Law was now to pass away."
3. "Here it means the same as 'profane,' or 'forbidden.'"

Note: The commentary provided is quite short, so I have included all the relevant quotes.

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "With that simple and audacious self-confidence which in his (Peter's) character was so singularly mingled with fits of timidity and depression, he boldly corrects the voice which orders him, and reminds the divine Interlocutor that he must, so to speak, have made an oversight."
2. "Compare Matthew 16:22."
3. "Common [κοινον]. Unholy."

### John Calvin:
1. "He is afraid, for good causes, to touch that which he knew was forbidden him in the law of God."
2. "Peter is not hasty, but desireth first to have his doubt dissolved before he depart from observing the law."
3. "Every small or light thing doth cause us to doubt unless the Lord do furnish us with counsel and constancy to overcome all fear."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Not so, Lord. This expostulation, so to speak, addressed by St. Peter to the Deity, is quite according to the analogy of Divine visions recorded in Scripture."
2. "No greater shock to this Hebrew apostle can be imagined than to be told to assuage his hunger by eating swine’s flesh or foul reptiles."
3. "And this distinction between clean and unclean beasts was correlative with, and representative of, the Jewish distinction between the Hebrew nation and all other nations."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Not so, Lord (Μηδαμωσ, κυριε). The negative μηδαμως calls for the optative ειη (may it not be) or the imperative εστω (let it be). It is not ουδαμως, a blunt refusal (I shall not do it). And yet it is more than a mild protest as Page and Furneaux argue. It is a polite refusal with a reason given."

2. "Peter recognizes the invitation to slay (θυσον) the unclean animals as from the Lord (κυριε) but declines it three times."

3. "Peter had been reared from childhood to make the distinction between clean and unclean food and this new proposal even from the Lord runs against all his previous training. He did not see that some of God's plans for the Jews could be temporary. This symbol of the sheet was to show Peter ultimately that Gentiles could be saved without becoming Jews. At this moment he is in spiritual and intellectual turmoil."

### John Gill:
1. "God forbid I should do this, so contrary to the law of God, and to my own practice, throughout the whole course of my life." 
2. "This shows that Peter as yet closely adhered to the ceremonial law, nor did he know that it was abolished by Christ." 
3. "The knowledge of every truth was not at once communicated to them, but gradually, as it pleased the Lord to enlighten their minds."

### John Wesley:
1. "When God commands a strange or seemingly improper thing, the first objection frequently finds pardon."
2. "This doubt and delay of St. Peter had several good effects."
3. "Hereby the will of God in this important point was made more evident and incontestable."
