# Acts 10:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, a person finds themselves in a state of confusion and perplexity, unsure of the true meaning of their experience. They reflect on what they have seen and heard, facing doubts and hesitations. However, through the providence of God, circumstances align and a key is provided, unlocking the clarity and understanding of the vision. The convergence of events serves as a divine indication, urging them to attentively recognize the significance of the signs that have appeared before them.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "ἐν ἑαυτῷ διηπόρει" - It is better not to force from its obvious meaning so natural a conjunction of words. 

2. "when he came to himself" - Valcknaer and Stier understand ἐν ἑαυτῷ as "when he came to himself," but without γενόμενος this is very harsh. 

3. "ἐν ἑαυτῷ" - The phrase ἐν ἑαυτῷ carries the sense of being in a state of confusion or perplexity.

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "The preparations here made—of Peter for his Gentile visitors, as of Cornelius for him—are devoutly to be noted."
2. "But besides this, at the same moment, 'the Spirit' expressly informs him that three men were inquiring for him, and bids him unhesitatingly go with them, as sent by Him."
3. "The Spirit's command to Peter to go with the men is a clear indication that God's plan of salvation is not limited to the Jewish people, but extends to the Gentiles as well."

2. "Every part of this transaction is made to harmonize with every other part."
3. "An event of divine Providence may be as clear an expression of his will, and may as certainly serve to indicate our duty, as the most manifest revelation would do."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Doubted [διηπορει] . See on Luke 9:7." - This quote highlights the connection between the doubt expressed in the verse and a similar instance in Luke 9:7, suggesting a recurring theme of doubt in the biblical narrative.

2. "In himself. On reflection, as compared with his ecstatic state." - This quote provides insight into the internal struggle of the protagonist, contrasting his current state of doubt with a previous state of ecstasy. It sheds light on the complexity of his emotions.

3. "Had made inquiry [διερωτησαντες] . 'Having inquired out;' having asked their way through [δια] streets and houses..." - This quote emphasizes the determination and effort put forth by the characters in their search, highlighting their perseverance in finding the obscure dwelling of the tanner. It adds depth to the narrative.

### John Calvin:
1. "Peter was taught not only by the vision, but also by the Word of God; and yet in seeing he saw not, until the Spirit is unto him an interpreter; a most excellent mirror of our slackness."
2. "Although we be yet far unlike to Peter; for we are so far from understanding by and by what God will, or to what end he speaketh to us, that many interpretations are scarce sufficient for us."
3. "But we must also note that which Luke addeth, that Peter did think earnestly upon the vision, to wit, after that he was come to himself again after his amazedness; for this was a token of godly reverence, that he did not carelessly suffer the vision to escape him."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Again we should give close attention to the coincidence of time. It is manifestly intended that we are to see here the marks of a providential pre-arrangement."
2. "The messengers who had been ‘drawing nigh to the city’ when the apostle’s trance began were now actually at the gate, having inquired their way to the house, where Peter, at the close of the vision, was in anxious perplexity concerning its meaning."
3. "Before the gate. This was the outside door or gate which led, according to the fashion of eastern dwellings in all ages, into the inner court of the house."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "When out of the ecstasy he was more puzzled than ever." 
2. "It took diligent inquiry to find the obscure house of Simon the tanner."

3. "Something providentially happened, which was a key unto, and opened the whole vision clearly to him."

Note: The provided commentary is quite lengthy, so I had to condense it into three quotes that capture the essence of the author's explanation.
