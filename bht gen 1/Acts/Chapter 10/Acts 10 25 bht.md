# Acts 10:25 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, a devout man named Cornelius shows great respect and honor for Peter, an ambassador of God. Falling down at Peter's feet, he worships him as one deserving of the highest respect, although not in a religious sense. This act of reverence reflects the Oriental custom of prostrating oneself before someone of superior status. However, Peter quickly rejects this excessive homage, recognizing that it is not due to any mortal but to God alone. The incident serves as an important reminder of the distinction between worshiping God and showing respect to fellow humans.

1. "May not the same reason have occasioned the omission of αὐτοῦ after πόδας? the one αὐτ. would almost require the other."
2. "It was natural for Cornelius to think that one so pointed out by an angel must be deserving of the highest respect."
3. "He must have witnessed the rise of the custom of paying divine honours first to those who were clothed with the delegated power of the senate, and then κατ ʼ ἐξοχήν to him in whom the imperial majesty centered."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Cornelius met him—a mark of the highest respect."
2. "Fell down at his feet, and worshipped him—In the East this way of showing respect was customary not only to kings, but to others occupying a superior station."
3. "Peter, therefore, declines it as due to no mortal."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Fell down at his feet - This was an act of profound regard for him as an ambassador of God."
2. "In Oriental countries it was usual for persons to prostrate themselves at length on the ground before men of rank and honor."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Worship is worthship, or honor paid to dignity or worth."
2. "This usage survives in the expressions worshipful and your worship."

### John Calvin:
1. "For we may gather that there was some divine thing in that worship, because he did ascribe unto mortal man the honor which is due to God alone."
2. "But forasmuch as he meant to give singular honor unto the prophet and apostle of Christ, he fell into an immoderate token of reverence, and so he offended in excess."
3. "For certain foolish men are deceived too far, who think that kneeling is in this place condemned simply and of itself. But this is that which I said, Cornelius doth not here salute his proconsul, or the emperor, after any civil sort; but being stricken with wondering when he saw Peter, he honoreth him as he would have honored God, if he had been present; so that he giveth man more than is meet, having, as it were, forgotten himself."

3. "Cornelius was not an idolator and would not have honoured Peter as a god" (Furneaux).

### John Gill:
1. "Cornelius met him, and fell down at his feet; to testify his great affection for him, and reverence of him." 
2. "Not with a religious adoration, or with worship due to God; for that would have been contrary to his character as a devout man, and one that feared God; but with civil worship and respect."
3. "Nor could he take him for an angel of God, or for one sent immediately from heaven to him; for he had been informed who he was, and what he was, and from whence he came, and what he was to do."
