# Acts 10:35 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This Bible verse highlights the inclusivity of God's grace and acceptance. It emphasizes that one's acceptance with God is not based on external factors like nationality or religious background. Instead, it is determined by the internal qualities of fearing God and working righteousness. The verse reveals that God's blessings are freely offered to all, regardless of cultural or religious distinctions. This idea marks a significant shift in perspective for Peter, as he comes to understand that Gentiles can be embraced by Christ without having to conform to Jewish customs or traditions.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "He saw, that in every nation, men who seek after God, who receive His witness of Himself without which He has left no man, and humbly follow His will as far as they know it, these have no extraneous hindrance, such as uncircumcision, placed in their way to Christ, but are capable of being admitted into God’s church though Gentiles, and as Gentiles."
2. "It is clearly unreasonable to suppose Peter to have meant, that each heathen’s natural light and moral purity would render him acceptable in the sight of God: for, if so, why should he have proceeded to preach Christ to Cornelius, or indeed any more at all?"
3. "And it is equally unreasonable to find any verbal or doctrinal difficulty in ἐργ. δικαιοσύνην, or to suppose that δικ. must be taken in its forensic sense, and therefore that he alludes to the state of men after becoming believers. He speaks popularly, and certainly not without reference to the character he had heard of Cornelius, which consisted of these very two parts, that he feared God, and abounded in good works."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "He that feareth him, and worketh righteousness—This being the well-known phraseology of the Old Testament in describing the truly godly man, within the pale of revealed religion, it cannot be alleged that Peter meant it to denote a merely virtuous character, in the heathen sense."
2. "Peter had learned enough... to convince him that the whole religious character of this Roman officer had been moulded in the Jewish faith."
3. "There can be no doubt that the apostle intended to describe exactly such saintship—in its internal spirituality and external fruitfulness—as God had already pronounced to be genuine and approved."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The favors of God were no longer to be confined to the Jewish people, but might be extended to all."
2. "Acceptance with God does not depend on the fact of being descended from Abraham, but on the state of the heart."
3. "He that feareth him...and worketh righteousness...comprehend the whole of religion."


### John Calvin:
1. "For the fear of God is nothing else but godliness and religion; and righteousness is that equity which men use among themselves, taking heed lest they hurt any man, and studying to do good to all men."
2. "Therefore the first accepting of God, whereby he receiveth us into favor, is altogether free; for there can as yet no respect of works be had, seeing all things are corrupt and wicked."
3. "God accepteth the faithful, because they live godly and justly. And we do not deny that God accepteth the good works of the saints; but this is another question, whether man prevent the grace of God with his merits or no, and insinuate himself into his love."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Nationality, even a divinely-appointed nationality, like the Jewish, constitutes, in the sight of God, no essential mark of difference between one man and another."
2. "The true distinction between one man and another, as before God, is moral."
3. "The meaning of this passage is, that all the blessings of Christianity are freely offered to every human hand that is stretched out to receive them."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "A Gentile would not have to become a Jew in order to become a Christian."
2. "Peter understood that they must first become Jews and then Christians."
3. "The new idea that now makes a revolution in Peter's outlook is precisely this that Christ can and will save Gentiles like this Cornelius group without their becoming Jews at all."

### John Gill:
1. "he that feareth him; God, not with a slavish fear, or with the fear of punishment to be inflicted by him, with a fear of hell and damnation, with which Cain, Pharaoh, Judas, and even the devils themselves have feared him; nor with an hypocritical fear; but with a godly filial fear; which is a new covenant blessing, springs from the love of God, is a grace implanted in the soul and regeneration, and includes all true religion, both external and internal"
2. "and worketh righteousness, is accepted with him; that is, he who from such principles, as the fear of the Lord; love to him, and faith in Christ, does works of righteousness, particularly alms, as Cornelius did, and which the Jews often call צדקה, 'righteousness'"
3. "such an one is acceptable, or well pleasing to God, let him be of what nation he will: it should be observed, that though God accepts of such who fear him, and work righteousness from a right principle, and to a right end, without any regard to their being circumcised, or not circumcised, or to their being of this or the other nation, yet their fear of him, and working righteousness, are not the ground of their acceptance; but are to be considered as descriptive of the persons, who are accepted by him in Christ"

### John Wesley:
1. "He that, first, reverences God, as great, wise, good, the cause, end, and governor of all things; and secondly, from this awful regard to him, not only avoids all known evil, but endeavors, according to the best light he has, to do all things well; is accepted of him." 

2. "Through Christ, though he knows him not. The assertion is express, and admits of no exception. He is in the favor of God, whether enjoying his written word and ordinances or not." 

3. "Nevertheless the addition of these is an unspeakable blessing to those who were before in some measure accepted. Otherwise God would never have sent an angel from heaven to direct Cornelius to St. Peter."
