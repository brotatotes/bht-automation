## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "the matter: not the thing, here or anywhere else: but the thing said, the 'materies' of the proclamation, in this case perhaps best 'the history.'" 
2. "which was spoken, 'published,' as E. V. See reff. This meaning, which ῥῆμα itself renders necessary, is further supported by καθʼ ὅλης τ. Ἰουδ., which can only be properly said, and is used by Luke (only, see reff.) of a publication, or spreading of a rumour, not of the happening of an event or series of events relating to one person."
3. "It was from Galilee first that the fame of Jesus went abroad, as Luke himself relates, Luke 4:14; Luke 4:37 (44 v. r.); Acts 7:17; Acts 9:6 (Act 23:5). Galilee also was the nearest to Cæsarea, and may have been for this reason expressly mentioned."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The facts, it seems, were too notorious and extraordinary to be unknown to those who mixed so much with Jews, and took so tender an interest in all Jewish matters as they did."

3. "The word [of Jesus] was published throughout all Judea, and began from Galilee."
