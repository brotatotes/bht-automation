# Acts 10:48 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, the apostle Peter, following the example of Jesus and the practice of the early Church, commands for individuals to be baptized in the name of the Lord. While Peter did not personally administer the baptism, he delegated this task to fellow believers to prevent any notions of superiority. The emphasis was placed on the ministry of the Word, with baptism serving as a subordinate act. This period of fellowship and teaching following baptism played a crucial role in the spiritual growth of those involved.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "As the Lord Himself when on earth did not baptize, so did not ordinarily the Apostles."
2. "Perhaps the same reason may have operated in both cases, lest those baptized by our Lord, or by the chief Apostles, should arrogate to themselves pre-eminence on that account."
3. "The ministry of the Word was esteemed by them their higher and paramount duty and office, whereas the subordinate ministration of the ordinances was committed to those who διηκόνουν τραπέζαις."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "He commanded them to be baptized—not doing it with his own hands, as neither did Paul, save on rare occasions." 
2. "Prayed . . . him to tarry certain days—"golden days" [BENGEL], spent, doubtless, in refreshing Christian fellowship."
3. "Imparting and receiving fuller teaching on the several topics of the apostle's discourse."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Why Peter did not himself baptize them is unknown."
2. "He chose to make use of the ministry of the brethren who were with him, to prevent the possibility of future cavil."
3. "It seems not to have been the practice of the apostles themselves to baptize very extensively."

### John Calvin:
1. "It was not of necessity that baptism should be ministered by Peter’s hand, as Paul doth likewise testify that he baptized few at Corinth, for other ministers might take this charge upon them."
2. "Whereas he saith, in the name of the Lord, it must not be restrained unto the form, as we have said in the third chapter; but because Christ is the proper scope of baptism, therefore are we said to be baptized in his name."
3. "They were, indeed, endued with the Holy Ghost; but they were not so come to the top, but that confirmation was as yet profitable for them."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "St. Peter did not administer the baptism himself. This was in harmony with the practice of St. Paul, who seems to have been very anxious lest baptism or any outward ordinance should be unduly elevated in comparison with the preaching of the Word."
2. "On such an occasion as that which is recorded in Acts 2:41, there must have been a large amount of subsidiary ministration."
3. "This residence of some days in the house of Cornelius is to be marked as a time of the utmost importance for St. Peter’s future life, and is to be compared with the remarkable ‘fifteen days’ which he and St. Paul spent together afterwards (Galatians 1:18)."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Peter himself abstained from baptizing on this occasion."
2. "The essential name in Christian baptism as in Acts 2:38; Acts 19:5."
3. "Golden days were these for the whole group."

### John Gill:
1. "And this he ordered to be done in the name of the Lord; that is, of the Lord Jesus Christ, though not to the exclusion of the Father, and of the Spirit."
2. "Perhaps the phrase, 'in the name of the Lord', may stand connected with the word commanded; and the sense be, that in the name of the Lord, and by authority from him, he ordered them to be baptized."
3. "Then prayed they him to tarry certain days; partly to express their gratitude to him for the favour they had received through him as an instrument, and partly that they might be more instructed and established by him."

### John Wesley:
1. "In the name of the Lord" implies the anointing of Jesus by the Father and the empowering of the Holy Spirit in his ministry.
2. The Gentiles, who already believed in God the Father, naturally believed in the Holy Spirit as well, so there was no need to explicitly mention the belief in the Trinity during baptism.
3. The apostle likely followed the form of baptism prescribed by Christ himself.
