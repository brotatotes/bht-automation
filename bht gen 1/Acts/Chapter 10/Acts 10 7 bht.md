### John Calvin:
1. "Angels come not flying to us from heaven that they may appoint us certain men, but that voice of Christ soundeth in all men’s cars. 'Seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you.' How is it that of an hundred scarce one or two will stir one foot, that some creep so little that they profit but a little, but because we do not indeed believe the promise?"

3. "It is meet that we call to mind here that which I touched before, that there is no kind of life which excuseth us but that we must worship God purely. For a soldier’s life was at that time most corrupt; for they were fallen unto filthy licentiousness, from the ancient discipline, and yet the Spirit of God beareth record in this place of the godliness of soldiers."
