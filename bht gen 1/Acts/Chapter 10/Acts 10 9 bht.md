# Acts 10:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, we find Peter seeking a quiet and elevated place for prayer. The flat roofs of houses in Judea were often used for such purposes, offering privacy and freedom from distractions. At the sixth hour, or around noon, Peter went up to the housetop to commune with God. This narrative showcases the providential guidance and divine plan at work, as it leads to the conversion of Cornelius and a blessing for the entire world.
