# Acts 11:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, we witness a significant event taking place in Jerusalem. The presence of God's hand in the transaction is an overpowering force that the apostles and elders cannot easily resist. The naming of the place carries particular importance, emphasizing the personal impact it had on the speaker. As the vision concludes, three men arrive at the speaker's house, further clarifying the preceding vision and serving as an explanation for the messenger's journey to Cornelius's house. The express order of the Spirit confirms the importance and divine nature of this journey.
