### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "No mention of Cornelius' name, much less of his high position, as if that affected the question."
2. "To the charge, 'Thou wentest in to men uncircumcised,' he simply speaks of the uncircumcised 'man' to whom he had been divinely sent."
3. "He had been divinely sent."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Nothing doubting [μηδεν διακρινομενον]. The Rev. renders making no distinction, taking the verb in its original sense, which is to separate or distinguish."
2. "The rendering seems rather strained, doubting being a common rendering in the New Testament and giving a perfectly good sense here."
3. "It was natural that Peter should hesitate."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "This second fact has extreme significance, and shows how deep an impression had been made by the recent events at Caesarea and Joppa, and how careful and deliberate was the course adopted by St. Peter, in order to bring conviction home to his brother apostles and the Christians at Jerusalem generally." 
2. "St. Peter simply terms Cornelius ‘the man.’ There would have been nothing persuasive in his dwelling on the military rank of Cornelius, or his position at Caesarea, or on the honourable character of the corps to which he belonged. These particulars would have been positively distasteful to his Jewish listeners."
3. "On the other hand, there was much point in his saying, however briefly, that he ‘entered into the man’s house.’ This was the very ground of the censure under which Peter had fallen."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Making no distinction" - This phrase highlights the importance of not discriminating or showing favoritism based on external factors such as race or social status. It emphasizes the equality and inclusivity that should be practiced among believers.

2. "The difference in voice shows the distinction in meaning" - This statement suggests that the choice of verb tense and voice in the original Greek text carries significant meaning. It implies that the use of the first aorist active participle instead of the present middle participle indicates a specific action taken by the individuals involved.

3. "He avoids mention of Cornelius's name and office" - This observation points out Peter's deliberate omission of Cornelius's name and position. It suggests that Peter's focus was not on the status or reputation of the person he was visiting but rather on the message he was about to deliver. This highlights the humility and obedience of Peter in following God's instructions.

### John Gill:
1. "Peter was aware that he should be called to an account for his conduct, when he should come to Jerusalem; and therefore brought these six brethren with him, to be witnesses for him, of what they had seen and heard, which was a very wise and prudential step."
2. "Entering into the man's house, the house of Cornelius, they were contending with him, and where he entered not alone, but the six brethren with him."
3. "Peter's decision to bring the six brethren as witnesses was a demonstration of his wisdom and prudence in anticipating the need for accountability and support in Jerusalem."
