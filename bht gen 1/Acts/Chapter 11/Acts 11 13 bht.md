## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The difference between the vision of Cornelius and that of Peter is here again strikingly marked: while the latter is merely ‘praying in the city of Joppa,’ no place nor circumstance being named, the former sees the angel ‘standing in his house.’"

2. "Notice also that Peter never names Cornelius in his speech because he, his character and person, was absorbed in the category to which he belonged, that of men uncircumcised."

3. "The art. almost looks as if the history of Cornelius’s vision were known to the hearers."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Seen an angel" - The mention of seeing an angel suggests a supernatural encounter, adding a sense of awe and wonder to the story.
2. "The angel" - The use of the definite article emphasizes the significance of the angelic visitation, indicating that it was not just any angel, but a specific and important one.
3. "Took that definite shape" - This phrase implies that the rumor about the angel became more concrete and specific, further fueling curiosity and speculation about the event.

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The presence of the definite article 'the' before 'angel' indicates that this angel is a specific and significant figure, possibly the same angel mentioned in chapter 10."

2. "The use of the term 'angel' in the Bible often refers to a messenger or representative of God, suggesting that this angel has an important message to deliver."

3. "The mention of this angel in chapter 10 implies a continuity of purpose and mission, suggesting that the events described in this verse are part of a larger narrative and divine plan."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The mention of this angel was a conspicuous part of the story as it reached the ears of the apostles at Jerusalem; and to their minds it must have appeared a very grave part of the whole subject."
2. "If an angel had appeared to 'this man,' this at least raised a serious question demanding very careful attention."
3. "If the angel, too, appeared in his very house, this rendered the case much stronger. Not only did it make the risk of illusion less probable, but it seemed to give a kind of sacredness to that house."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Stand and say" - This phrase emphasizes the punctiliar act of taking a stand and speaking, indicating a decisive and intentional action.
2. "Fetch Simon" - The use of the imperative form suggests a sense of urgency and importance in summoning Simon, highlighting the significance of his role in the events that follow.

### John Gill:
1. "The clause, 'in his house', is very appropriately put; for since an angel had entered into his house, it could not be criminal in Peter, and the six brethren, to follow him."
2. "He appeared in the form of a man, as it was usual for angels to do."
3. "He looked upon him as an extraordinary person, as sent to him from God, and therefore obeyed the heavenly vision."
