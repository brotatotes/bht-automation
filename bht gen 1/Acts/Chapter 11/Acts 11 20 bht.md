# Acts 11:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we see that a group of believers, including men from Cyprus and Cyrene, began to speak and preach the Lord Jesus to the Greeks in Antioch. These Greeks were Gentiles, some being pure heathens, who had not yet heard the Gospel. They were introduced to the dignity of Jesus' person, the power of His blood for peace and pardon, and the righteousness that brings justification. This was a significant event as it marked the first account of the Gospel being preached to idolatrous Gentiles.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The retaining and advocacy of the reading Ἑλληνιστάς has mainly arisen from a mistaken view that the baptism of Cornelius must necessarily have preceded the conversion of all other Gentiles."
2. "But that reading gives, in this place, no assignable sense whatever: for (1) the Hellenists were long ago a recognized part of the Christian church, (2) among these διασπαρέντες themselves in all probability there were many Hellenists, and (3) the term Ἰουδαῖοι includes the Hellenists, the distinctive appellation of pure Jews being not Ἰουδαῖοι, but Ἑβραῖοι."
3. "Nothing to my mind can be plainer, from what follows respecting Barnabas, than that these Ἕλληνες were GENTILES, uncircumcised; and that their conversion took place before any tidings had reached Jerusalem of the divine sanction given in the case of Cornelius."

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "The Gospel had, from the first, been preached to 'the Grecians' or Greek-speaking Jews."
2. "These 'men of Cyprus and Cyrene' were themselves 'Grecians.'"
3. "How, then, can we suppose that the historian would note, as something new and singular, that some of the dispersed Christians preached to them?"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "From this circumstance it might have happened that they were led more particularly to address the Grecians who were in Antioch."
2. "It is thus manifest that we are here required to understand the Gentiles as those who were addressed by the people of Cyprus and Cyrene."
3. "The connection would lead us to suppose that they had heard of what had been done by Peter, and that, imitating his example, they preached the gospel now to the Gentiles also."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The express object of the narrative has been to describe the admission of Gentiles into the church."
2. "There would have been nothing remarkable in these men preaching to Hellenists who had long before been received into the church."
3. "Note, also, the contrast with the statement in ver. 19, to the Jews only. There is no contrast between Jews and Hellenists, since Hellenists are included in the general term Jews."

### John Calvin:
1. "Luke’s meaning is, that a few did more freely preach the gospel because the calling of the Gentiles was not unknown to them."
2. "The constancy of them all deserveth no small praise; because, being delivered, as it were, out of the midst of death, they are not afraid to do their duty toward God even with danger."
3. "Whence we gather to what end, and how far forth Christians may fly persecution; to wit, that they may spend the residue of their life in spreading abroad the glory of God."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "We should have been sure, but for what follows, that Barnabas was one of them; and there is little doubt that he had influence in promoting the active missionary work of his fellow-Cypriotes." 
2. "The Jews were very numerous in Cyprus; and it is worth while to add, in reference to the mention of Cyrene which follows, that about this time Cyprus and Cyrene were united in one Roman Province." 
3. "We should observe how our thoughts are drawn to this place, as to a focus on which all our attention is presently to be concentrated."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Spake (ελαλουν). Inchoative imperfect active, began to speak. For them it was an experiment." 
2. "Hellenists were merely one kind of Jews in contrast with those who spoke Aramaic (Acts 11:6)." 
3. "These Greeks in Antioch were apparently in part pure heathen and not 'God-fearers' like Cornelius."

### John Gill:
1. "Preaching the Lord Jesus; the dignity of his person, as the Son of God; what he did and suffered to obtain salvation for lost sinners; his resurrection from the dead, ascension to heaven, and intercession." 
2. "The virtue of his blood for peace and pardon of his sacrifice for atonement of sin, and of his righteousness for justification."
3. "These ministers spoke the word of the Lord."

### John Wesley:
1. "Some of them were men of Cyprus and Cyrene — Who were more accustomed to converse with the Gentiles."
2. "Who coming into Antioch — Then the capital of Syria, and, next to Rome and Alexandria, the most considerable city of the empire."
3. "Here we have the first account of the preaching the Gospel to the idolatrous Gentiles."
