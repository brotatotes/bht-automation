## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The question will be determined by various persons according to the requirements of their chronological system."
2. "Speaking à priori, it seems very improbable that any considerable portion of time should have been spent by him before the great work of his ministry began."
3. "Even supposing him during this retirement to have preached in Syria and Cilicia, judging by the analogy of his subsequent journeys, a few months at the most would have sufficed for this."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Barnabas was the first to take the converted persecutor by the hand and procure his recognition as a disciple by the brethren at Jerusalem."
2. "Instead of returning to Jerusalem, finding that the mine in Antioch was rich in promise and required an additional and powerful hand to work, he leaves it for a time, takes a journey to Tarsus, 'finds Saul,' and returns with him to Antioch."
3. "As co-pastors, for the time being, of the Church there, they so labored that the Gospel, even in that great and many-sided community, achieved for itself a name which will live and be gloried in as long as this world lasts, as the symbol of all that is most precious to the fallen family of man: 'The disciples were called CHRISTIANS first in Antioch.'"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "There was a great revival of religion, and there was need of additional labor. In such times the ministers of the gospel need additional help, as men in harvest-time need the aid of others."
2. "Saul was in this vicinity... and he was eminently suited to assist in this work."
3. "With him Barnabas was well acquainted, and probably there was no other one in that vicinity whose help he could obtain."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "To seek [αναζητησαι]. Strictly, like our 'hunt up' [ανα]." This quote highlights the idea that seeking in this context is not just a casual search, but a diligent and intentional pursuit. It implies that the search should be thorough and persistent, akin to hunting for something valuable.

2. "The word implies a careful and diligent search, such as men make when they are seeking for gold, or hunters when they are in quest of game." This quote further emphasizes the intensity and focus required in seeking. It compares the search to seeking for precious treasure or hunting for game, illustrating the seriousness and determination needed in the pursuit.

3. "The idea is that of seeking with care, with diligence, with earnestness, until it is found." This quote reinforces the notion that seeking is not a passive or half-hearted endeavor. It stresses the need for carefulness, diligence, and earnestness in the search, suggesting that the desired outcome will only be achieved through persistent effort.

### John Calvin:
1. "Barnabas’ simplicity is commended to us now the second time, that whereas he might have borne the chiefest swing at Antioch, yet went he into Cilicia that he might fetch Paul thence, who he knew should be preferred before him."
2. "Therefore we see how, forgetting himself, he respecteth nothing but that Christ may be chief; how he setteth before his eyes the edifying of the Church alone."
3. "Barnabas is no whit afraid lest Paul do any whit debase him by his coming, so he glorify Christ."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "We feel sure also that this time of exile, like the time of retirement in Arabia (Galatians 1:17), was made use of for the deepening of his religious life and his further Divine illumination."
2. "The character of Barnabas is at this point set before us in a most attractive light, in that he brought out of retirement one whose eminence was sure to supersede and eclipse his own."
3. "Gagner cette grande âme . . . se faire son inferieur, preparer le champ le plus favorable au deploiement de son activite en oubliant soi-meme, c’est la certes le comble de ce qu’a jamais pu faire la vertu; c’est la ce que Barnabe fit pour Saint Paul." (Translation: "To win this great soul... to make oneself inferior, to prepare the most favorable field for the deployment of his activity by forgetting oneself, is certainly the height of what virtue has ever been able to do; this is what Barnabas did for Saint Paul.")
