# Acts 11:26 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the city of Antioch, a new fact emerged - a self-existent, self-conscious Church of Christ, independent of Judaism. The disciples, originally called Nazarenes and Galileans, received a new name - "Christians" - which marked a significant moment in their identity as followers of Jesus. This term, of Latin origin, emphasized their devotion to Christ and distinguished them from other groups. The city of Antioch, a cosmopolitan hub, served as the birthplace of this honored name, which became a distinctive appellation for those devoted to Christ throughout the world.

1. "The former of these two words, rendered were called, meant, originally, to transact business, to have dealings with; thence, in the course of business, to give audience to, to answer, from which comes its use to denote the responses of an oracle; a divine advice or warning." 

2. "The disciples were called. They did not assume the name themselves. The name was evidently not given by the Jews of Antioch, to whom Christ was the interpretation of Messiah, and who would not have bestowed that name on those whom they despised as apostates."

3. "The name may have been given simply as a distinctive title, naturally chosen from the recognized and avowed devotion of the disciples to Christ as their leader."

### John Calvin:

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The name ‘CHRISTIAN’ marked the arrival of a new fact in the world. This new fact was the formation of a self-existent, self-conscious Church of Christ, independent of Judaism."
2. "Its form, too, seems to show that it had a Latin origin. We are familiar in history with such terms as Pompeians and Vitellians; and the New Testament itself (Matthew 22:16) supplies us with a similar term in the word Herodians."
3. "Antioch, the most important city of all Roman Asia, and the third in rank among the cities of the whole Roman world, had a character peculiarly cosmopolitan. It was almost an Oriental Rome, in which all the forms of the civilised life of the Empire found a representative."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Barnabas met together 'in the church'... This peculiar phrase accents the leadership and co-operation of Barnabas and Saul in teaching much people." 

2. "And that the disciples were called Christians first in Antioch... This word is made after the pattern of Hεροδιανυς, Χαεσαριανυς... It is made thus like a Latin adjective, though it is a Greek word, and it refers to the Hebrew belief in a Messiah." 

3. "The name was evidently given to the followers of Christ by the Gentiles to distinguish them from the Jews since they were Greeks, not Grecian Jews. The Jews would not call them Christians because of their own use of Χριστος the Messiah."

It suggests that this name arose in Antioch and replaced other designations previously used for the believers.
