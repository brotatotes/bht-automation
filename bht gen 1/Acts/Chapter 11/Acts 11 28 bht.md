## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "From the form of his announcement there, we may infer the manner in which he ἐσήμανεν διὰ τοῦ πνεύματος here." 
2. "The fem. usage of λιμός prevailed among the Dorians and later Greeks."
3. "The expression is a hyperbolical one in ordinary use, and not to be pressed as strictly implying that to which its literal meaning would extend."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Named Agabus - This man is mentioned but in one other place in the New Testament. In Acts 21:10-11, he is referred to as having foretold that Paul would be delivered into the hands of the Gentiles. It is not expressly said that he was a Christian, but the connection seems to imply that he was."
2. "And signified - See John 12:33. The word usually denotes 'to indicate by signs, or with a degree of obscurity and uncertainty, not to declare in explicit language.' But here it seems to denote simply 'to foretell, to predict.'"
3. "Which came to pass ... - This is one of the few instances in which the sacred writers in the New Testament affirm the fulfillment of a prophecy. The history having been written after the event, it was natural to give a passing notice of the fulfillment."

It highlights the brokenness and sinfulness of the world that Jesus came to redeem and restore. This reinforces the central message of the Gospel and the purpose of Jesus' mission on earth.

### John Calvin:
1. "Luke doth plainly express that the Spirit of God was the author of this prophecy, that we may know that it was not a conjecture taken by the stars, or some other natural causes."
2. "But it seemeth that the foretelling of the famine was unlucky, [of evil omen,] and not to be wished for; for to what end was it for men to be made miserable before their time, by having the unhappy event foretold? I answer, that there be many causes for which it is expedient that men should be warned before in time when the judgments of God hang over their heads, and punishments [are] due to their sins."
3. "The profit of this present prophecy appeareth by the text, because the men of Antioch were thereby pricked forward to relieve their brethren which were in misery."
