# Acts 11:30 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Commented upon by various biblical scholars and theologians, this verse describes the early Christian community's organizational structure and its approach to caring for its members. The elders, resembling the leaders in Jewish synagogues, were chosen to ensure the proper distribution of resources to those in need. The deacons, working alongside the elders, assisted in carrying out this responsibility. This cooperative effort reflected an egalitarian spirit, as resources were distributed based on individual needs. The verse underscores the importance of wise leadership, communal support, and fairness in the early Christian community.

3. "By entrusting the gift to Barnabas and Saul, the church demonstrated their trust in these leaders and their recognition of their authority. This highlights the importance of leadership and delegation within the early Christian community."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The word [elders] literally denotes 'aged men,' but in the Jewish synagogue it was merely a name of office."
2. "It is clear...that the elders of the Jewish synagogue here are not included...it is not probable that a charity like this would have been entrusted to the hands of Jewish elders."

3. "Let us mark these places, which teach that we must not only deal uprightly and faithfully, but that there is also an order and wisdom required as well in making choice as in all our administration."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The Christian people were, in fact, at first not sharply distinguished from the Jews, who were organised into many synagogues... With the synagogue itself they would naturally, if not necessarily, adopt the normal government of a synagogue; and a body of elders or presbyters would be chosen to direct the religious worship, and partly also to watch over the temporal well-being of the society."
2. "The adoption of the presbyterate, like the establishment of the diaconate, arose out of special circumstances."
3. "It ought to be observed that, because the path of wisdom and prudence was followed in this matter, this does not detract from the belief that there was Divine guidance, but very much the contrary."
