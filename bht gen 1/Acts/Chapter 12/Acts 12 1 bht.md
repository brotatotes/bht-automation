# Acts 12:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
During the time of the visit of Barnabas and Saul to Jerusalem, there was a short truce for the Church to regain their strength, only to face the greatest danger in the form of Herod Agrippa I, a king who sought to oppress and afflict the Christians. Despite the secret power of God restraining his cruelty, it was a period of intense persecution, with the rulers in Jerusalem unable to organize a general persecution after Herod's death. However, the relations between the Romans and Jews continued to grow more hostile.

3. "Undoubtedly the cruelty of this mad man was restrained and bridled by the secret power of God.
