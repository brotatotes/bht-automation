# Acts 12:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Amidst the darkness of the midnight hour, a group of believers assembled in fervent prayer, faced with a critical situation. With careful consideration, Peter sought refuge in the spacious and welcoming home of a godly woman named Mary. There, in the midst of danger and persecution, they sought divine intervention, their prayers fervent and unwavering. This moment encapsulates the power of intentional decision-making, the urgency of communal gathering, and the unwavering faith that propels us to seek God's guidance even in the darkest of times.
