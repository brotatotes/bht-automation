# Acts 12:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, commentators highlight the belief in guardian angels and the surprise and disbelief that often accompanies answered prayers. The idea of having a guardian angel was prevalent in ancient Jewish belief, with the angel occasionally appearing in the likeness of the person. Christians, though amazed when their prayers are answered, should persevere in prayer and be attentive to signs that God has heard them. The presence of guardian angels and their role as ministers of God's goodness and protection is seen as a testament to His infinite goodness and care.
