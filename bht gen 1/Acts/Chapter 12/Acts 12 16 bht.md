# Acts 12:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we see the powerful lesson of persistence in prayer and trust in God's timing. Peter's unwavering determination to keep knocking on the door of heaven serves as an example for us to continue seeking God's intervention, even in the face of delays. The astonishment of those who opened the door and saw Peter reinforces the notion that God's ways are often beyond our understanding. Despite their amazement at Peter's unexpected deliverance, they realized the miraculous power of God at work in his life.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Peter's persistence in knocking is a powerful reminder of the importance of perseverance in our prayers. Just as Peter did not give up despite the delay, we too should continue knocking on the doors of heaven, trusting that God hears and will answer in His perfect timing."

2. "The danger of delay is highlighted in this verse. When we allow delays to discourage us or cause us to doubt, we risk missing out on the blessings and breakthroughs that God has in store for us. We must remember that God's timing is always perfect, and His delays are not denials."

3. "This verse serves as a reminder that sometimes our prayers are not answered immediately, but that does not mean God is ignoring us. Rather, He may be using the delay to refine our faith, deepen our trust in Him, or align our desires with His perfect will. We must trust that God knows what is best for us and continue knocking on the door of His presence."
