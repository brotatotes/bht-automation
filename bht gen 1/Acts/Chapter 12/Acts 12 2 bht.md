# Acts 12:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Among the disciples, James, the brother of John, shared a close and unique bond with his brother and was counted among the favored few who witnessed key events in Jesus' life. His martyrdom, being the first among the apostles, demonstrated his steadfast commitment to following Christ and the ultimate sacrifice he made for his faith. In contrast, John, the last of the apostles, lived a long and impactful life, serving as a witness to the crucifixion and spreading the message of Christ even into old age. Together, their lives exemplify devotion, courage, and the enduring impact of their discipleship.
