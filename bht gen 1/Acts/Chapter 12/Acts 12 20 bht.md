# Acts 12:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we see a portrayal of the conflict between King Herod and the people of Tyre and Sidon. The quarrel between them, whether through commercial regulation or rivalry, led Herod to be highly displeased and even contemplate war. The people of Tyre and Sidon, fearing the consequences of his anger, sought reconciliation and peace with him. This incident not only demonstrates the repercussions of pride and the dangers of being puffed up without cause, but also highlights God's intervention and provision, protecting the Christians from scarcity and ensuring their nourishment through the king's country.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The quarrel, however it originated, appears to have been carried out on Herod’s part by some commercial regulation opposed to their interest, dependent as they were on supplies from his territory, ἦν θυμ. is therefore best rendered as in E. V., was highly displeased." 
2. "εἰρήνην] not (see above) peace, in its strict sense, but reconciliation." 
3. "We learn from 1Ki 5:11 that Solomon made presents of wheat and oil to Hiram in return for the cedar and fir-trees for the Lord’s house: and from Ezekiel 27:17, that Judah and Israel exported wheat, honey, oil, and balm (or resin) to Tyre."

2. "What was the cause of this hostility to the people of Tyre and Sidon is not mentioned, and conjecture is useless. It is not at all inconsistent, however, with the well known character of Herod."

1. "A worthy history, which doth not only show, as it were in a glass, what end is prepared for the enemies of the Church, but also how greatly God hateth pride."
2. "And if God did so sharply punish pride in a king whom prosperity did puff up, what shall become of those of the common sort who are ridiculously puffed up without cause?"

2. "He occupied the confidential position of principal chamberlain to the king. It must be remembered that Herod had resided much in Rome; hence the probability of his having Romans about him in the principal positions of his court."
