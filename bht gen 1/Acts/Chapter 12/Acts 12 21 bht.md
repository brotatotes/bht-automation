# Acts 12:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this passage, a king named Herod appears before a crowd in Caesarea, dressed in a magnificent silver garment that shines brightly in the morning sunlight. The people are filled with awe and excitement, proclaiming that he is no mere man, but a god. However, this lavish display of power and adulation only serves to highlight the foolishness and sinfulness of human pride. Though the crowd's flattery may seem common, it does not diminish the gravity of their error.
