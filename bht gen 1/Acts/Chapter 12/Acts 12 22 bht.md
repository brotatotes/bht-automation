# Acts 12:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, we see a wretched man's demise being witnessed by the people, resulting in their applause and adoration. Interestingly, these reactions were not solely from the Jewish community, but rather from the idolatrous Gentiles as well. The wretched man's intention to humiliate someone else ironically leads to his own downfall, a poetic justice that the people seemed aware of. The crowd's flattery and adulation were primarily driven by a desire to please and gain favor with Herod, rather than a genuine belief in his divinity.
