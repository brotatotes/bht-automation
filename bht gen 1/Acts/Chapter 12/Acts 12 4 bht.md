## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "In military arrangements, Herod seems to have retained the Roman habits, according to which the night was divided into four watches, and each committed to four soldiers."

1. "Delivered him to four quaternions of soldiers" - This shows the level of security and control that was placed on Jesus during his arrest and trial. It highlights the seriousness with which the Roman authorities regarded him as a potential threat.

2. "After the Passover" - This clarifies the timing of Jesus' crucifixion, indicating that it took place after the entire festival was completed. It helps to understand the context and significance of his sacrifice in relation to the Jewish religious calendar.

3. "During the days of unleavened bread...the Jews had a prejudice against trying or putting anyone to death" - This explains why the Jewish leaders handed Jesus over to the Roman authorities for execution.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "During the solemnities of this religious festival, it would have been deemed improper to have engaged in the trial of a supposed criminal."

1. "Luke doth, in this place, declare by circumstances that Peter was, as it were, shut up in his grave, so that it might seem that he was quite past hope."
2. "He showeth the cause why he was not forthwith put to death, because it had been an heinous offense to put him to death in the Easter holidays."
3. "Herod doth not delay the time as doubtful what to do, but doth only wait for opportunity; yea, he maketh choice of a time, when as his gift may be more plausible, because there came a great multitude together from all parts unto the holy day."

2. "These perhaps might take their turns to watch him by four at a time, two to whom he was chained, and two others to keep the doors."
