# Acts 12:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the midst of impending trial, the events of that fateful night unfolded. The prisoner, guarded by watchful officials in anticipation of his impending fate, found composure and rest. The chained prisoner, safeguarded by the Roman custom of binding him to two soldiers, lay in peaceful sleep, undisturbed by the severity of his circumstances. In the face of danger and imminent death, his tranquility spoke volumes about his unwavering faith and the providential power of God.
