# Acts 12:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, the subject, initially unaware of the true nature of the situation, departs from a specific location, signifying a deliberate and intentional action with a purpose or objective in mind. The mention of their lack of expectation and disbelief conveys their surprise and inability to comprehend the reality of what they are witnessing. As they follow and obey the divine command, their initial ignorance and skepticism gradually give way to a realization that this is not merely a vision or symbolic representation, but an extraordinary, objective, and astonishing event.
