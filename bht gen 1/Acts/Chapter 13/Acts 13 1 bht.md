# Acts 13:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, a group of prophets and teachers are mentioned, entrusted by the Holy Spirit with a weighty commission. They were responsible for teaching the Word and had the ability to foretell future events. Among them were Barnabas, a devoted disciple of the Lord, and Saul, an apostle who left behind a significant impact on the New Testament and the world. This diverse group also included individuals of different backgrounds, such as Simeon Niger, possibly named for his black complexion, and Manaen, who had a unique connection to Herod the tetrarch.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The enumeration is probably inserted on account of the solemnity of the incident about to be related, that it might be known who they were, to whom the Holy Spirit entrusted so weighty a commission." 
2. "Those who had the χάρισμα διδασκαλίας, they were probably less immediately the organs of the Holy Spirit than the προφῆται, but under His continual guidance in the gradual and progressive work of teaching the Word." 
3. "The Herod here meant was Antipas, who with his brother Archelaus... Both were at this time exiles, Antipas at Lyons, Archelaus at Vienne."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Those here mentioned were in the Church at Antioch as prophets and teachers."
2. "How differently did these two foster brothers turn out—the one, abandoned to a licentious life and stained with the blood of the most distinguished of God's prophets, though not without his fits of reformation and seasons of remorse; the other, a devoted disciple of the Lord Jesus and prophet of the Church at Antioch!"
3. "Henceforward this book is almost exclusively occupied with him [Saul]; and his impress on the New Testament, on Christendom, and on the world is paramount."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Teachers are several times mentioned in the New Testament as an order of ministers... Their precise rank and duty are not known." 
2. "Barnabas was a preacher... and it is not improbable that the names 'prophets and teachers' here simply designate the preachers of the gospel."
3. "Saul was an apostle; and yet he is mentioned here among the 'prophets and teachers,' showing that these words denote 'ministers of the gospel' in general, without reference to any particular order or rank."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The mention of the evangelist's name here is not in accord with his usual practice, since he nowhere mentions his own name, either in the Gospel or in the Acts." 
2. "Of the five here named, four are known to be Jews; and therefore, probably, Lucius was also a Jew from Cyrene, where Jews are known to have abounded."
3. "Nothing certain can be inferred from Romans 16:21, where Lucius is enumerated by Paul among his kinsmen."

### John Calvin:
1. "Paul's calling ought to be of no less weight amongst us, than if God should cry from heaven in the hearing of all men, that the salvation, promised in times past to Abraham, and to the seed of Abraham, doth no less appertain unto us at this day, than if we had come out of the loins of Abraham."
2. "And such had the office to teach and exhort, as Paul doth testify in the fourteenth of the First to the Corinthians."
3. "He might, indeed, have been a principal courtier if he had been ruled by ambition; but that he may wholly addict himself to Christ, he refuseth not to change those smokes of honor with [for] reproach and ignominy."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Conscious of this feeling of non-approval with which so many Jewish Christians would view the Gentile mission work of Antioch, the writer of the ‘Acts’ is very careful to record how blessed was this innovating church of Antioch, how strong in inspired men."
2. "The exercise of these powers by a few gifted persons is mentioned in the writings of the apostles as a matter of ordinary occurrence. But when the apostles and the first generation of believers had passed away, and the foundations of the Church of Jesus had been surely laid, these powers, given for a certain time and a special purpose, seem to have ceased."
3. "No one in the early Church exercised a more noble influence than the Cypriote Barnabas; no one laboured more earnestly or more successfully to carry out his Risen Master’s plans."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Luke here begins the second part of Acts with Antioch as the centre of operations, no longer Jerusalem. Paul is now the central figure instead of Peter."
2. "The double use of τε here makes three prophets (Barnabas, Symeon, Lucius) and two teachers (Manaen and Saul)."
3. "Symeon Niger may be the Simon of Cyrene who carried the Saviour's cross. Lucius of Cyrene was probably one of the original evangelists."

Note: The provided commentary is quite short, so there are only three quotes that meet the requirements.

### John Gill:
1. "These prophets and teachers had both a gift of foretelling things to come and of explaining the prophecies of the Old Testament, and of teaching the people evangelic truths."
2. "Simeon that was called Niger was likely named so because of the blackness of his complexion."
3. "Manaen, who had been brought up with Herod the tetrarch, may have been the son of Menahem, a wise man and prophet who had delivered prophecies to Herod and foretold his reign."
