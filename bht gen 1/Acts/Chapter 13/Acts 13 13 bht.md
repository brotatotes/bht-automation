# Acts 13:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When Paul and his companions departed from Paphos and arrived in Antioch of Pisidia, John Mark withdrew from them and returned. This act of separation by John suggests a shift in the prominence of Paul, who now emerges as the main figure, while Barnabas takes a backseat. It is unclear why John departed, but potential reasons include weariness from their journey, concern for his safety, or a disagreement that led to contention. Nonetheless, this departure underscores the challenges and choices faced by these early missionaries as they ventured into unknown territories, navigating both physical and spiritual obstacles along the way.
