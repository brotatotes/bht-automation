# Acts 13:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the synagogues, the law and the prophets were read regularly, with the law taking precedence. The rulers of the synagogue had the power to excommunicate and were responsible for selecting readers and speakers. If someone had a word of exhortation or comfort, they were given the opportunity to speak after the Scripture reading. Paul and Barnabas, being Jews, were likely expected to address their brethren and likely communicated their desire to do so before the service began.
