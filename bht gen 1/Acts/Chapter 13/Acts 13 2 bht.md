## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Ministering is therefore the only word adequate to render it, as E.V. after the Vulg. 'ministrantibus Domino:' more closely to define it is not only impracticable, but is narrowing an expression purposely left general."
2. "The announcement being to the church, and several persons being mentioned, we can hardly, with Meyer, suppose it to have been an inner command merely to some one person, as in the case of Philip, ch. Acts 8:29."
3. "The apostolic office terminated with the apostolic times, and by its very nature, admitted not of continuance: the episcopal office, in its ordinary sense, sprung up after the apostolic times and the two are entirely distinct."

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "The word denotes the performance of official duties of any kind, and was used to express the priestly functions under the Old Testament. Here it signifies the corresponding ministrations of the Christian Church."
2. "As this was done in other cases on special occasions, it is not improbable that they had been led to expect some such prophetic announcement at this time."
3. "While the personality of the Holy Ghost is manifest from this language, His supreme divinity will appear equally so by comparing it with Hebrews 5:4."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The expression 'ministered to the Lord' means as they were engaged in prayer to the Lord, or as they were engaged in divine service."
2. "The Holy Ghost said - Evidently by direct revelation."
3. "The 'work' to which they were now set apart was that of preaching the gospel in the regions round about Antioch."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Ministered [λειτουργουντων]... This noun has passed through the following meanings: 1. A civil service, especially in the technical language of Athenian law. 2. A function or office of any kind, as of the bodily organs. 3. Sacerdotal ministration, both among the Jews and the heathen. 4. The eucharistic services. 5. Set forms of divine worship." 

2. "Here, of the performance of Christian worship. Our word liturgy is derived from it."

3. "Separate. The Greek adds dh, now, which is not rendered by A. V. or Rev. It gives precision and emphasis to the command, implying that it is for a special purpose, and to be obeyed at the time."

### John Calvin:
1. "The Papists feign that the office of priesthood is enjoined them, to sacrifice Christ and by sacrificing him to redeem peace with God. There is so little mention made hereof in Scripture, that the Son of God doth rather challenge this honor to himself alone."
2. "Christ’s Church hath another priesthood, to wit that every man may offer himself and his to God; and that the public ministers may sacrifice to God, souls, with the spiritual sword of the gospel."
3. "The Spirit challengeth this right when he commandeth that Paul and Barnabas be separated to him, and testifieth that they were called by his beck. Assuredly we must needs confess that the body of the Church is lame and without a head, unless we confess that it is God who ordereth the same at his pleasure, who setteth teachers over it, who governeth the proceedings and order thereof."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The word translated ‘as they ministered’ was the general word used in the Old Testament for ‘priestly service.’ The writer of the ‘Acts’ here uses it to express generally the Christian divine service, including prayer, the singing of hymns and psalms, the office of preaching, the whole crowned by the solemn partaking of the Lord’s Supper."
2. "It is not certain if this was the ordinary service of the Antioch church which the Christians were in the habit of attending the first day of the week, or if it was a special solemn gathering, called together in consequence of some intimation of the Holy Ghost to one of the inspired prophets, that a voice would come from God to the congregation."
3. "The Holy Ghost said, Separate me Barnabas and Saul for the work whereunto I have called them. Chrysostom writes on these words: ‘Here we may see a proof of the divinity of the Holy Ghost. The prophets were ministering to the Lord. He does not say, Separate Barnabas and Saul to the Lord, but to Me for the ministry to which ‘have called them, showing that He is coequal with God.’"

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "The word liturgy grows out of this use." 
2. "Fasting was not obligatory on the Christians, but they were facing a great emergency in giving the gospel to the Gentile world."
3. "Both had been called to ministry long ago, but now this call is to the special campaign among the Gentiles."

### John Gill:
1. "Their ministry lay in preaching the Gospel, teaching the people the doctrines of it, and expounding prophecies, and also in prayer." 
2. "The phrase seems to be more extensive: 'and fasted'; which the Jews were much used to, and the believing ones had not yet left it off." 
3. "This shows the Spirit to be a person, since speaking and commanding in an authoritative way, and calling to a work, are ascribed unto him; and that he is a divine person, and truly God, and equal with God."

### John Wesley:
1. "Separate me Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them" - This verse does not imply ordination, but rather the recognition and appointment of Barnabas and Saul to a specific task assigned by God.

2. "It was only inducting him to the province for which our Lord had appointed him from the beginning" - The calling of Barnabas and Saul was not a new revelation, but rather a confirmation of the purpose that God had already set for them.

3. "In consequence of this they fasted, prayed, and laid their hands on them" - The act of fasting, praying, and laying hands on Barnabas and Saul was not solely for ordination, but a customary practice used for blessing and commissioning individuals in various contexts.
