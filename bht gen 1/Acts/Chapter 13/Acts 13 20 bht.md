# Acts 13:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
During a period of about four hundred and fifty years, God's people were led and governed by judges who were raised up in an extraordinary manner to defend them from enemies. The unpredictability of the people's obedience to God's laws during this time is evident from their repeated backslidings. However, despite their unworthiness, God's infinite goodness and constancy in electing them as His people are evident, as He continually forgave them and raised up leaders to guide them. This period of judges marked the transition from the time of the Jewish fathers to the division of the land of Canaan.
