"Assuredly he had deserved, by one wicked fact, eternal destruction for him and his, and, so much as in him lay, the way of the blessing of God was shut up, that there might nothing but vipers’ seed come of Bathsheba. But that so filthy a fact, in the death of Uriah, turneth to a contrary end by the wonderful counsel of God."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "It was not until Saul had perished that David became king, although he had been anointed during the lifetime of Saul."
2. "In our estimate of the character of this king 'after God's own heart,' we must ever remember his nobility of aim and purpose, his unwearied labour for the welfare of the peoples committed to his charge, his devotion to God, his longing after a purer and better life, his bitter remorse whenever he fell."
