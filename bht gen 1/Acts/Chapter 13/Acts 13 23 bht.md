## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The promise in reference to Zechariah is not the only promise that speaks of bringing salvation, but it is significant because it uses the word 'ἄγω' (to bring), which is also used in this verse." 

2. "The reading of 'σωτηρίαν' (salvation) is likely a result of the contracted way of writing 'Ἰησοῦν' (Jesus), where 'σωτηραῑν' was mistakenly written and then later replaced with 'σωτηρίαν' based on Acts 13:26." 

3. "The use of the word 'ἤγαγεν' (brought) emphasizes the fulfillment of the promise, indicating that Jesus has indeed brought salvation."

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "The emphasis on this statement lies: (1) in the seed from which Christ sprang—David's—and the promise to that effect, which was thus fulfilled."
2. "On the character in which this promised Christ was given of God—'a SAVIOUR.'"
3. "His personal name 'JESUS' is emphatically added, as designed to express that very character."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Of this man's seed - Of his posterity." This quote highlights the connection between the promise made to David and the future generations that would come from him.

2. "According to his promise - See the notes on Acts 2:30." This quote suggests that the fulfillment of the promise made to David is being referenced here, indicating the faithfulness of God to His word.

3. "A Saviour, Jesus - See the notes on Matthew 1:21." This quote emphasizes that Jesus is not only the descendant of David but also the Savior, fulfilling the role of delivering humanity from sin and bringing salvation.

### John Calvin:
1. "In sending Christ, the Lord had respect only unto his own faithfulness and goodness; for he sent him because he had promised so to do."
2. "The promise doth testify that salvation was free, so it doth also purchase no small credit to the gospel."
3. "Christ came not at a sudden, of whom there was never anything spoken; but that he who was promised from the beginning was now given in his time."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Of this man's seed. This was the first requisite, for unless He were descended from David, Jesus could not be the Messiah foretold by the prophets." (Acts 13:23)
2. "God, according to his promise, raised unto Israel a Saviour, Jesus." (Acts 13:23)
3. "Instead of the word translated 'raised' (unto Israel), the word contained in the older Mss. here signifies 'brought' (unto Israel). It is the very word used in the Messianic prophecy of Zechariah 3:8: 'Behold, I will bring forth my servant the Branch.'"

### John Gill:
1. "God had promised that the Messiah should spring out of David's loins, so in the fulness of time he had sent him, or caused him to come by the assumption of human nature, or by taking flesh of a virgin, who was of the house and lineage of David." 

2. "He was raised up for the mystical Israel of God, all the elect, whether Jews or Gentiles; and that to be the Saviour of them, from sin, Satan, and the law, and every enemy, with a spiritual and eternal salvation, and that both of body and soul." 

3. "This Saviour, Jehovah, in his infinite wisdom, found, and in his purposes appointed him to be his salvation, and in his covenant provided and settled him as such; and in the prophecies of the Old Testament spoke of him as the Saviour and Redeemer of his people."
