# Acts 13:27 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the commentators shed light on the rejection of Christ in Jerusalem by the Jewish rulers and people. With wisdom and tenderness, Paul speaks of their guilt while mitigating their crime. Their ignorance and misunderstanding of the prophecies concerning the Messiah led them to reject Him. While their condemnation fulfilled the words of the prophets, it also revealed their lack of understanding and unbelief. The apostle urges the hearers to be awakened and not fall into the same unthankfulness and rejection of Christ.
