### John Gill:
1. "The natural descendants of them, as Paul and Barnabas, and the Jews in the synagogue, were:in that he hath raised up Jesus again; which may not be understood of his resurrection from the dead, since the promise made, and now fulfilled, has not a single respect to that; but of his being raised up, and sent forth into the world, to be a Saviour and Redeemer, and to sit upon the throne of David."
2. "And that this psalm belongs to the Messiah, is evident from the mention made of him in Psalms 2:2 from the mad counsel, and vain attempts of the kings of the earth against him, Psalms 2:1. God's decree and resolution to make and declare him King of Zion, notwithstanding all their efforts upon him, Psalms 2:4 from his asking and having the Gentiles, and uttermost parts of the earth for his inheritance, which is true of no other, Psalms 2:8 and especially from that reverence, worship, and adoration, which are to be given to him, and that trust and confidence to be placed in him, Psalms 2:10 which can by no means agree with David, nor with any mere creature whatever."
3. "The words cited by the apostle are, 'thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee'; in Beza's ancient copy, the verse following these words is added, 'ask of me', c.
