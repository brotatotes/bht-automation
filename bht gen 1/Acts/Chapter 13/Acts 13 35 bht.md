1. "The word 'suffer' in this verse can also be translated as 'give.' This suggests that suffering is not just something that happens to us, but something that we actively participate in or give ourselves to."

2. "By using the word 'give,' the verse implies that suffering can be seen as a gift or an offering. It challenges us to view suffering not just as a burden, but as an opportunity for growth and transformation."

3. "This alternative translation of 'suffer' as 'give' reminds us that suffering is not meaningless or random. It is something that we can choose to give or offer up to God, trusting that He can use it for His purposes and bring good out of it."

### John Calvin:
1. "David putteth two Hebrew words for the grave, as he useth repetitions commonly; the former whereof is derived of desiring or lusting, because the grave devoureth all things as an insatiable gulf; and the other of corruption." 

2. "According to this etymology David’s meaning is faithfully expressed in Greek; for the quality of the grave is noted, when as it receiveth the corpse, and doth, as it were, swallow it up, that it may rot there, and may at length perish when it is consumed." 

3. "Paul affirmeth that that belongeth to Christ alone, that he was free and saved from corruption; for though his body was laid in the grave, corruption had, notwithstanding, no title to it, seeing that it lay there whole, as in a bed, until the day of the resurrection."

2. "The apostle cites that which he intended to reason upon, as he afterwards does, and by it makes it manifestly appear that the words do not belong to David, but the Messiah, and are a clear and pertinent proof of his resurrection from the dead."
3. "The word [שחת] in its first proper, and literal sense, signifies 'corruption'; and a pit or grave is only called by this name, because dead bodies, or carcasses, are therein corrupted."
