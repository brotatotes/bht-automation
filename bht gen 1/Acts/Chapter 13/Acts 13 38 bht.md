# Acts 13:38 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Through this verse, Paul speaks of the justification of sinners, emphasizing the negative aspect of forgiveness as the remission of sins. The forgiveness of sins is a transformative experience, lifting the burden of guilt and reconciling the sinner with God. It is through the death of Jesus, the fulfillment of the prophecies, that forgiveness and justification are proclaimed. This forgiveness, obtained through the blood of Christ and preached through Him, is a pure doctrine of the Gospel, an act of free grace and mercy accomplished by the power of God.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Paul speaks here of justification only in its lowest sense, as negative, and synonymous with remission of sins."
2. "He does not unfold here that higher sense of δικαιόω, the accounting righteous, which those who have from God are δίκαιοι ἐκ πίστεως."
3. "It is the first office of the Spirit by which he spoke, ἐλέγχειν περὶ ἁμαρτίας, before He ἐλέγχει περὶ δικαιοσύνης."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The forgiveness of sins—the first necessity of the sinner, and so the first experienced blessing of the Gospel." 
2. "The forgiveness of sins is not only a divine act of mercy but also a transformative experience for the sinner." 
3. "Through the forgiveness of sins, the burden of guilt is lifted, and the sinner is reconciled with God, experiencing a newfound freedom and peace."

### Albert Barnes:

### John Calvin:
1. "By this word, 'Be it known unto you,' Paul meaneth that nothing should hinder them from knowing such an excellent and plain matter, save only sloth; and that, therefore, it was an absurd thing that those benefits of God should be hidden from the faithful which were offered by Christ."
2. "We must first mark that we be all enemies to God through sin... until God receive us to favor by the free forgiveness of sins."
3. "The ceremonial law ought indeed to have been a schoolmaster to lead them by the hand unto Christ; all rites commanded by God were helps to help and further their faith; but as men use preposterously to corrupt the holy ordinances of God, they stop the way before themselves by their ceremonies, and they shut the gate of faith, that they could not come to Christ."

### Philip Schaff:

### John Gill:
1. "Forgiveness of sins, which is sometimes expressed by a non-imputation of them, a non-remembrance of them, a covering and putting them away, and a blotting them out, is an act of free grace and mercy, and yet is through the blood of Christ."
2. "The doctrine of forgiveness is a pure doctrine of the Gospel; and when it is preached aright, it is preached through Christ, not through the works of the law, not through repentance, nor through faith, nor through the absolute mercy of God, but through Christ, through the blood of Christ, which was shed to obtain it in a way consistent with the justice of God; and through his hands it is given."
3. "It is because he is God, truly and properly God, that there is a virtue in his blood to take away sin, and cleanse from it."
