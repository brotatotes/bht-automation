# Acts 13:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Being guided by the Holy Spirit, the apostles embarked on a purposeful journey to spread the Gospel. Starting in the fortified city of Seleucia, built upon Mount Pierius, they set sail towards Cyprus, known for its abundance of crops and historical significance. This choice was not arbitrary, as Barnabas, a native of Cyprus, anticipated a favorable reception among his own connections and family. Through their active participation and trust in the Holy Spirit, the apostles undertook a perilous mission, faithfully following the divine calling placed upon them.

### Albert Barnes:

2. "The Church did only receive those who were offered them by the hand of God." - This statement underscores the sovereignty of God in the selection and sending of individuals for ministry.
