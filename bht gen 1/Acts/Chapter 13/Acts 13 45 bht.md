# Acts 13:45 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we see a vivid portrayal of the Jewish opposition to the preaching of Paul. The commentators highlight the contradictious and blasphemous spirit of the Jews, filled with envying the Gentiles receiving the same message. Their rage and fury were so intense that they resorted to public opposition, speaking evil of Paul and his teachings. This opposition stemmed from their exclusive pride, the fear of losing their privileged position, and their resistance to accepting the Gentiles as partakers in the promised glories of the Messiah's kingdom.
