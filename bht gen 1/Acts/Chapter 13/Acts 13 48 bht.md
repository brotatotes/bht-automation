# Acts 13:48 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, the Gentiles rejoiced as they heard the Gospel preached by Paul, recognizing it as a message from God and embracing it with faith. Their joy and gratitude stemmed from understanding that the salvation offered through Messiah included all people, even those who were not part of the chosen people. These Gentiles gladly accepted what the Jews had rejected and glorified the word of God, as it was not their own doing but a divine ordination to eternal life that enabled them to believe.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "We know, that it is GOD who worketh in us the will to believe, and that the preparation of the heart is of Him: but to find in this text pre-ordination to life asserted, is to force both the word and the context to a meaning which they do not contain."
2. "The principal interpretations are: (1) Calvin, &c., who find here predestination in the strongest sense: 'orainatio ista nonnisi ad æternum Dei consilium potest referri' ... 'ridiculum autem cavillum est referre hoc ad credentium affectum, quasi Evangelium receperint qui animis rite dispositi erant.'"
3. "Wordsworth well observes that it would be interesting to enquire what influence such renderings as this of præordinati in the Vulgate version had on the minds of men like St. Augustine and his followers in the Western Church in treating the great questions of free will, election, reprobation, and final perseverance."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "They were glad—to perceive that their accession to Christ was a matter of divine arrangement as well as apostolic effort."
2. "And glorified the word of the Lord—by a cordial reception of it."
3. "A divine ordination to eternal life is the cause, not the effect, of any man's believing."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The Gentiles rejoiced that from the mouths of Jews themselves they now heard a different doctrine." 
2. "They honored it as a message from God; they recognized and received it as the Word of God." 
3. "It was, in fact, that doctrine expressed in an act. It was nothing but God’s disposing them to embrace eternal life."

### John Calvin:
1. "To glorify the word of God may be expounded two manner of ways, either that they did confess that it was true which was prophesied by Isaiah, or that they embraced the doctrine which was set before them with faith."
2. "And here we must note the restraint, [reservation,] when he saith that they believed, (but) not all in general, but those who were ordained unto life."
3. "For though God’s election be unknown to us until we perceive it by faith, yet is it not doubtful or in suspense in his secret counsel; because he commendeth all those whom he counteth his to the safeguard and tuition of his Son, who will continue a faithful keeper even unto the end."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "These Heathens openly expressed their joy and gratitude when they found from Paul that even in the sacred and jealously guarded oracles of the Hebrew race, they too, who had no connection with the Land of Promise, and who could claim no kinship to the chosen people, were all included in the grand scheme of salvation by Messiah."
2. "Preserving then rigidly the rendering of the English Version, we have to determine what meaning should be attached to the words 'ordained to eternal life.' Those 'ordained' are they of whom Holy Scripture so often speaks as 'The Chosen,' 'The Called of God' all spiritual life, be it remembered, in its origin, progress, and completion, being from Him and His eternal counsel alone."
3. "But, on the other hand, this and similar clear declarations of God’s sovereignty in no wise exclude man’s perfect freewill. We have equally plain authoritative statements that God willeth all to be saved; and He teaches us none shall perish except by wilful rejection of the truth."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "The joy of the Gentiles increased the fury of the Jews."
2. "It was the gospel of grace and liberty from legalism that Paul had proclaimed."
3. "The Jews here had voluntarily rejected the word of God. On the other side were those Gentiles who gladly accepted what the Jews had rejected."

### John Gill:
1. "They were glad; not that the Jews were likely to have the Gospel taken away from them, and be utterly deprived of it, but that it was to be preached to them."
2. "They spake well of the Gospel, and gave glory to God, or the Lord, who had sent it among them."
3. "Faith is not the cause, or condition of the decree of eternal life, but a means fixed in it, and is a fruit and effect of it, and what certainly follows upon it, as in these persons."

### John Wesley:
1. "He is not speaking of what was done from eternity, but of what was then done, through the preaching of the Gospel."
2. "During this sermon those believed, says the apostle, to whom God then gave power to believe."
3. "The expression properly implies, a present operation of Divine grace working faith in the hearers."
