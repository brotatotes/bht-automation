# Acts 13:50 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In a city where Jewish influence was limited but substantial, the influential and devout women of honorable estate played a crucial role in shaping religious opinions. They may have been proselytes or connected to prominent Jewish figures. Despite facing opposition, the apostles fervently resisted discouragement and vigorously withstood the obstacles posed by those who sought to hinder the spreading of the gospel. Through their valiant efforts, they triumphed over persecution and continued to shine a light on the glory of Christ in the face of adversity.
