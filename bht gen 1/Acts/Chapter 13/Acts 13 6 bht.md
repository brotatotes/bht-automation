# Acts 13:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In a journey that takes them from darkness to light, from Paphos to Salamis, the apostles encounter the influence of sorcerers and false prophets. These impostors, prevalent in the Roman capital, symbolize the spiritual emptiness and unbelief of the time. The battle between truth and deception, light and darkness, continues to rage in our hearts and minds today. The Gospel message offers freedom from deception and the power to overcome darkness, reaching all people in diverse locations and backgrounds.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The Roman aristocracy were peculiarly under the influence of astrologers and magicians, some of whom were Jews."
2. "We read of such in connexion with Marius, Pompey, Crassus, Cæsar, and later with Tiberius: and the complaints of Horace and Juvenal shew how completely, and for how long a time, Rome was inundated with Oriental impostors of every description."
3. "He had given himself the Arabic title of Elymas, ‘the wise man’ (from the same root as the Turkish ‘Ulemah’), interpreted ὁ μάγος in our text."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The journey to Paphos was not just a physical journey, but also a spiritual one. It was a journey from darkness to light, from deception to truth. In Paphos, they encountered a sorcerer, a symbol of the spiritual darkness that had enveloped the island. This encounter would serve as a catalyst for the proclamation of the gospel, as the power of God would be displayed in contrast to the power of the sorcerer." 

2. "The presence of sorcerers in the Roman capital reflects the prevalent unbelief and spiritual emptiness of the time. It is a reminder that even in the midst of a sophisticated and cultured society, people were still searching for something more, something beyond themselves. The gospel message would offer them the true power and fulfillment they were seeking." 

3. "The encounter with the sorcerer in Paphos serves as a reminder that the battle between light and darkness, truth and deception, is not limited to physical locations or specific time periods. It is a battle that continues to rage in the hearts and minds of individuals today. The gospel message is the answer to this battle, offering freedom from deception and the power to overcome darkness."

2. "Cyprus was fabled to be the place of the birth of this goddess."
3. "A certain sorcerer - Greek: magus, or magician. See the notes on Acts 8:9."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Sorcerer [μαγον]. That the man was an impostor is told us in the next word, but not in this term. It is the word used of the wise men who came to the Savior's cradle." 
2. "Elymas was a magian; of what kind is shown by false prophet." 
3. "Bar - Jesus. Son of Jesus or Joshua."

### John Calvin:
1. "For which cause the goodness of God is more wonderful, in that he would have the light of his gospel to pierce into such a filthy and cruel [dire] den."
2. "Seeing that religion was quite corrupt among the Jews, it is no marvel if they fell away unto many wicked superstitions."
3. "And assuredly where the truth of God doth not appear, the more men seem to be wise, the more filthily foolish are they."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The faith of educated Romans was utterly gone. We can hardly wonder when the East was thrown open the land of mystery, the cradle of the earliest religions that the imagination both of the populace and the aristocracy of Rome became fanatically excited, and that they greedily welcomed the most absurd and degrading superstitions." 
2. "Every part of the East contributed its share to the general superstition... To these ... we must add one more Asiatic nation, the nation of the Israelites." 
3. "Not only were the women of Rome drawn aside into this varied fanaticism, but the eminent men of the declining republic and the absolute sovereigns of the early empire were tainted and enslaved by the same superstitions."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "The word μαγον does not necessarily mean 'sorcerer,' but only a μαγυς (Matthew 2:1; Matthew 2:7; Matthew 2:10 which see). The bad sense occurs in Acts 8:9; Acts 8:11 (Simon Magus) and is made plain here by 'false prophet.'"
2. "These Jewish mountebanks were numerous and had great influence with the uneducated."
3. "If one is surprised that a man like Sergius Paulus should fall under the influence of this fraud, he should recall what Juvenal says of the Emperor Tiberius 'sitting on the rock of Capri with his flock of Chaldaeans around him.'"

### John Gill:
1. "The Alexandrian copy, and the Vulgate Latin and Syriac versions read, 'the whole isle'; for through the midst of the whole island they must go, to go from Salarnis to Paphos." 
2. "It had its name from the Phoenician word, 'peathpaoth', 'the corner of corners'; because both old and new Paphos were situated in the extreme part of the island."
3. "Concerning this place Jerom says, 'Paphus, a city on the sea coast, in the island of Cyprus, formerly famous for the sacred rites of Venus, and the verses of the poets; which fell by frequent earthquakes, and now only shows, by its ruins, what it formerly was.'"

### John Wesley:
1. "Paphos and Salamis, representing the western and eastern parts of the island respectively, symbolize the breadth and diversity of human experiences and perspectives."
2. "The geographical contrast between Paphos and Salamis serves as a reminder that the message of the Gospel is meant to reach all people, regardless of their location or background."
3. "Just as Paphos and Salamis were connected by a common faith, believers today are called to bridge divides and share the transformative power of the Gospel with those around them."
