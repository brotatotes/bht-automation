# Acts 13:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, a sorcerer named Elymas opposes the teachings of Saul and Barnabas, seeking to turn the proconsul away from the faith. Elymas is determined not to lose his position of influence and fearlessly opposes the spreading of the gospel. His opposition is driven by self-interest, as he sees his chances of further gain in Cyprus diminishing if the proconsul embraces the message of Saul and Barnabas. With his deceptive tactics, Elymas tries to hinder the truth and distort the gospel message.
