# Acts 13:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, the Evangelist transitions from describing events he researched to using the memoirs of himself and the Apostle. It is uncertain when and why this transition occurred, but Paul, formerly known as Saul, emerges as the Apostle to the Gentiles. Filled with the Holy Spirit, he confronts a sorcerer, discerning his sin with a penetrating gaze. The transition from Saul to Paul may have been influenced by his interaction with Gentiles and his ministry among them.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Hitherto, our Evangelist has been describing events, the truth of which he had ascertained by research and from the narratives of others. But henceforward there is reason to think that the joint memoirs of himself and the great Apostle furnish the material of the book."
2. "The καί must not be understood as having any reference to Sergius Paulus, ‘who also (as well as Sergius) was called Paul.’"
3. "It seems probable that Paul never entirely recovered his sight as before, after the δόξα τοῦ φωτὸς ἐκείνου."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Paul—and henceforward Paul only; a softening of his former name, in accommodation to Roman ears, and (as the word signifies 'little') probably with allusion as elsewhere to his insignificance of stature and appearance."
2. "filled with the Holy Ghost—the Spirit coming mightily upon him."
3. "The whole soul of his great colleague, now drawn out, as never before, shoots, by the lightning gaze of his eye, through the dark and tortuous spirit of the sorcerer. What a picture!"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "When, or why, this change occurred in the name, has been a subject on which commentators are not agreed."
2. "The name is of Roman origin. In the Latin language the name Paulus signifies little, dwarfish."
3. "Paul suffered himself to be called by this name, as he was employed chiefly among the Gentiles."
4. "Filled with the Holy Ghost - Inspired to detect his sin; to denounce divine judgment; and to inflict punishment on him."
5. "Set his eyes on him - Looked at him intently."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Various explanations are given of the change of name. The most satisfactory seems to be that it was customary for Hellenistic Jews to have two names, the one Hebrew and the other Greek or Latin."
2. "As Paul now comes prominently forward as the apostle to the Gentiles, Luke now retains his Gentile name, as he did his Jewish name during his ministry among the Jews."
3. "It was most unlike Paul to assume the name of another man, converted by his instrumentality, out of respect to him or as a memorial of his conversion."

### John Calvin:
1. "For seeing that he was too much addicted to the magician, he could not embrace true doctrine as one that was free and at liberty."
2. "The devil keepeth those minds (which he hath entangled) in his slavery after a wonderful and incredible manner, that they cannot see even the most plain truth."
3. "The faith is overthrown when the word of God is resisted. Whence we may gather that faith is so grounded in the word, that without this shore it fainteth at every assault; yea, that it is nothing else but the spiritual building of the word of God."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Before the visit to the coast of the governor of Cyprus he is always called Saul; after the visit to Cyprus he is ever spoken of as Paul." 
2. "Saul possessed the Gentile name of Paul even before he was a Christian. This adoption of a Gentile name in addition to the original Hebrew name was a practice well known among the Jews."
3. "The disputes turned, no doubt, on the meaning of the words of the old prophets of Israel respecting the coming of Messiah, His kingdom here, and His future sitting in judgment."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "By this remarkably brief phrase Luke presents this epoch in the life of Saul Paul."
2. "Here was a cultured heathen, typical of the best in Roman life, who called forth all the powers of Paul plus the special help of the Holy Spirit to expose the wickedness of Elymas Barjesus."
3. "If one wonders why the Holy Spirit filled Paul for this emergency rather than Barnabas, when Barnabas was named first in Acts 13:2, he can recall the sovereignty of the Holy Spirit in his choice of agents and also the special call of Paul by Christ."

### John Gill:
1. "It was usual with the Jews to be called after this manner, that is, to have one name among themselves, and another among the Gentiles."
2. "Though some think his name was changed upon his conversion, as it was usual with Jewish penitents to do."
3. "This name is by Jerom, or Origen, interpreted 'wonderful', as if it came from the Hebrew word 'pala'; and others derive it from 'paul', which signifies to work."

### John Wesley:
1. "It is not improbable, that coming now among the Romans, they would naturally adapt his name to their own language, and so called him Paul instead of Saul."
2. "Perhaps the family of the proconsul might be the first who addressed to or spoke of him by this name."
3. "And from this time, being the apostle of the Gentiles, he himself used the name which was more familiar to them."
