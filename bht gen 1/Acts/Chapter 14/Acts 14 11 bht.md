# Acts 14:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This verse shows the awe and confusion that arise when divine power is manifested in human form. The people, influenced by their pagan beliefs, mistakenly perceive Paul and Barnabas as gods and seek to worship them. It emphasizes the stark contrast between the blindness of those who refuse to recognize Christ's divinity despite witnessing miracles and the eagerness of the pagans to deify mere men based on a single miraculous act. It serves as a reminder of the deceptive power of darkness and the need for discernment in recognizing the true nature of God's works.
