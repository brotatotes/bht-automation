# Acts 14:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, there are two distinct characters: one is Barnabas, who is compared to Jupiter because of his commanding presence and stature. The other is Paul, who is associated with Mercury due to his eloquence and skill in speaking. While Barnabas is seen as a figure of authority and power, Paul's strength lies in his ability to effectively convey messages and interpret the will of God. Both individuals are recognized for their unique qualities that make them stand out in different ways.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Jupiter was the most powerful of all the gods of the ancients... His common appellation was, The Father of gods and men." 
2. "Mercury, called by the Greeks Hermes, was a celebrated god of antiquity... He was the messenger of the gods, and of Jupiter in particular."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Mercury is the God of skill in the use of speech and of eloquence in general, for the heralds are the public speakers in the assemblies and on other occasions."
2. "As the God of ready and artful speech, his office naturally extended to business negotiations. He was the God of prudence and skill in all the relations of social intercourse, and the patron of business and gain."
3. "In the limitation of his faculties and powers, in the low standard of his moral habits, in the abundant activity of his appetites, in his indifference, his ease, his good nature, in the full-blown exhibition of what Christian theology would call conformity to the world, he is, as strictly as the nature of the case admits, a product of the invention of man."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Barnabas they imagined to be Jupiter (Zeus), most likely from his older and more venerable appearance."

### John Gill:

3. "The Jews had a doctor in their schools, whom they called 'the chief of the speakers'."
