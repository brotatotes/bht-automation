# Acts 14:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This verse captures the contrast between the living God and the vain idols worshiped by the people. The commentators emphasize the insignificance of these idols and the true nature of God as the creator of heaven, earth, and all that is in it. They highlight the futility of paying religious homage to creatures and stress the importance of turning away from such vanities to worship the one true God. The apostles, as men of like nature, exposed the emptiness of idolatry and preached the need for a sacrifice better than those offered to the false gods.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The contrast between the vain idols and the living God is clear in this verse." 
2. "Paul often uses the phrase 'the living God' to emphasize the true nature of God." 
3. "The use of 'the living God' in other biblical passages further highlights its significance."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "How unlike either imposture or enthusiasm is this, and how high above all self-seeking do these men of Christ show themselves to be!"
2. "This is the most glorious and distinctive of all the names of God. It is the familiar phraseology of the Old Testament, which, in such contrast with all that is to be found within the literature of heathenism, is shown to be, with its sequel, the New Testament, the one Book of the true religion."
3. "This idea of creation, utterly unknown alike to rude and to cultivated heathenism, would not only define what was meant by 'the living God,' but open up a new world to the more thoughtful part of the audience."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The abhorrence which they evinced at this may throw strong light on the rank and character of the Lord Jesus Christ."
2. "How can this difference be accounted for except on the supposition that the Lord Jesus was divine?"
3. "Such a Being only is to be worshipped; and the apostles remonstrated strongly with them on the folly of paying religious homage to beings like themselves."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Of like passions [ομοιοπαθεις]. Only here and James 5:17, on which see note. Better, of like nature."

3. "Better, of like nature."

Note: The commentary provides explanations of the Greek words used in the verse and compares them to other instances in the Bible.

### John Calvin:
1. "The perfect and whole worship of godliness is due to God alone, and therefore it is profaned, so soon as it is in any point given to creatures, whether they be angels, or men, or stars."
2. "All religion is vain which departeth and degenerateth from the pure and simple Word of God."
3. "The apostles did not only employ themselves to overthrow idolatry which had long time reigned in former ages, but did also take great heed that pure religion might reign afterward, having put all corruptions to flight."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "There is indeed a God whom you and your fathers have neglected, a God who made heaven and earth and sea, who though He has not given to you any direct written revelation concerning Himself, still those blessings, those recurring and ever-recurring life-giving powers of nature, seed-time and harvest-time, rain and sunshine, the thousand gifts of a bountiful Providence which serve to make glad the heart of man, these blessings have spoken in times past with sufficient clearness to awaken the slumbering thoughts of men, and to direct their attention to the adoration of the one true God." 

2. "The thousand gifts of nature above alluded to seem every instant to call men to adore the loving all-Father who cares so tenderly for His children."

3. "We also are men of like passions with you. In other words, 'We are men like you, subject like yourselves to suffering and to death.' The gods were regarded as blessed immortals, incapable of suffering and want, dwelling in their own serene atmosphere far removed from men, exempt from all pain and peril."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "We also are men of like passions with you... It means 'of like nature' more exactly and affected by like sensations, not 'gods' at all." 
2. "He boldly calls the worship of Jupiter and Mercury and all idols 'vain' or empty things, pointing to the statues and the temple." 
3. "Our God is a live God, not a dead statue."

1. "We also are men of like passions with you; men, and not gods; of the same human nature, and that as corrupted, alike sinful men, and need a sacrifice better than these."
2. "And preach unto you that ye should turn from these vanities; from these deities, Jupiter and Mercury, and the rest of them; which were vain, useless, and unprofitable, and could do their votaries no manner of service."
3. "But the living God is he, which hath made heaven and earth, and the sea, and all things that are therein; which comprehends all created beings, the whole universe, and all that is in it, angels, men, beasts, fowls, fish, and whatever exists; and therefore is only deserving of religious worship."

### John Wesley:
1. "To turn from these vanities — From worshipping any but the true God."
2. "He does not deign to call them gods; unto the living God - Not like these dead idols."
3. "Who made the heaven and the earth, the sea - Each of which they supposed to have its own gods."
