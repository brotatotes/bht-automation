# Acts 14:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, the commentators highlight the evidence of God's existence and goodness that is available to all people. The mention of rain from heaven symbolizes the abundant provision of God and His care for His creation. This provision is not limited to physical needs, but extends to the joy and gladness that fills our hearts. The witness of God's existence through both punishments and benefits should lead us to repentance and gratitude for His continual presence in our lives.
