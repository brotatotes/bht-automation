# Acts 14:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the early days of the Christian Church, idolatrous tendencies quickly emerged, despite the clear rejection of such practices by Peter and other believers. The zeal of the people to honor false gods was so strong that it bordered on an untamed madness. The arguments presented against idol worship, along with the arduous efforts to dissuade the people, demonstrated the fervent struggle to prevent them from engaging in sacrificial offerings. It was a harrowing ordeal, but ultimately, their dedication to the one true living God prevailed.
