# Acts 14:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the midst of persecution and violence, Paul's life was preserved through a miraculous recovery. Left for dead, his disciples surrounded him and witnessed his ability to rise up and enter the city, astonishing them with his renewed strength. The wounds he endured from the stoning would normally have been fatal, but his revival can only be described as an extraordinary act of divine intervention. This event served as a powerful testament to the unwavering dedication of Paul's followers and the transformative power of the gospel message.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The prima facie, and I think the right impression is, that this recovery was supernatural."
2. "From Derbe not being enumerated, 2 Timothy 3:11, with Antioch, Iconium, and Lystra, as the scene of any of Paul’s sufferings, we may perhaps infer that none befell him there."
3. "They may have fled to Derbe, as being in a different jurisdiction from Lystra; the latter being comprised in the Roman province of Galatia, whereas Derbe seems to have belonged at this time to Antiochus, king of Commagene."

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Disciples" had been gathered, who now rallied around the bleeding body.
2. And one appears to have been gained on this occasion, of far more importance than all the rest—TIMOTHEUS.
3. It is possible that this recovery was natural; the insensibility occasioned by such treatment as he had received sometimes passing away of itself, and leaving the patient less hurt than appeared. But certainly the impression naturally left on the mind by the words is that the restoration was miraculous; and so the best interpreters understand the words.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He rose up ... - Most commentators have supposed that this was the effect of a miracle. They have maintained that he could not have risen so soon, and entered into the city, without the interposition of miraculous power... But the commentators have asserted what is not intimated by the sacred penman."
2. "The probability is that he was stunned by a blow - perhaps a single blow and after a short time recovered from it. Nothing is more common than thus by a violent blow on the head to be rendered apparently lifeless, the effect of which soon is over, and the person restored to strength."
3. "And came into the city - It is remarkable that he should have returned again into the same city. But probably it was only among the new converts that he showed himself. The Jews supposed that he was dead; and it does not appear that he again exposed himself to their rage."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The brevity of the journey to Derbe highlights the urgency and determination of Paul and his companions to spread the message of the gospel. It serves as a reminder that the disciples were willing to go to great lengths, even for short distances, in order to fulfill their mission."

2. "The short journey to Derbe also emphasizes the importance of reaching out to even the smallest and most remote communities with the message of salvation. It demonstrates that no place is too insignificant to be touched by the transformative power of the gospel."

3. "The brevity of the journey to Derbe serves as a reminder that our obedience to God's call may not always require long and arduous journeys. Sometimes, it is in the seemingly small and simple acts of faithfulness that we can have a profound impact on others and bring glory to God."

### John Calvin:
1. "We must always mark what the Lord hath brought to our hand." 
2. "If there be any hope to help him, then must I endanger myself." 
3. "Paul was miraculously saved, seeing that, on the morrow, after he was cast out for dead, he taketh his journey, being fresh and sound."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Different to the awful night in Gethsemane when all forsook the arrested Master and fled, the disciples of Paul, undismayed by their master’s arrest and execution, gathered round the poor scarred body of him they judged dead."
2. "As they sorrowfully gazed on the pale disfigured features, the martyr rose up and walked among living men once more."
3. "That this recovery of Paul after the cruel stoning was miraculous, is the natural, indeed the only inference."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "The would-be murderers left and a group of disciples gathered round to see if Paul was dead or alive and, if dead, to bury him." 
2. "Timothy, a lad of about fifteen, would not soon forget that solemn scene (2 Timothy 3:11)." 
3. "But Paul suddenly (apparently a miraculous recovery) rose up (αναστας) and entered the city to the surprise and joy of the disciples who were willing to brave persecution with Paul."

### John Gill:
1. "These were the young converts at Lystra, who, under the ministry of the apostles, were now brought to the faith of Christ; unless it can be thought, that they were such who followed them from other places, and attended them in their travels; but the former seems most probable, and which shows their affection to their spiritual Father, and their constancy in the faith of Christ, notwithstanding this ill treatment of his servant."

2. "He rose up and came into the city; which was no less than a miracle, and was no doubt the effect of the mighty power of God, put forth upon him; for though he was not really dead, yet he was left as such, and thought to be so by both friends and foes."

3. "And when it is considered what wounds and bruises he must receive by stoning, and his being dragged through the streets of the city, and left in such a miserable condition without it, that he should at once rise up in the midst of the disciples, and walk into the city as one in perfect health and strength, has something extraordinary and miraculous in it."

### John Wesley:
1. "That he should be able to do this, just after he had been left for dead, was a miracle little less than a resurrection from the dead."
2. "The witnesses first threw as large a stone as they could lift, with all possible violence upon his head, which alone was sufficient to dash the skull in pieces."
3. "All the people then joined, as long as any motion or token of life remained."
