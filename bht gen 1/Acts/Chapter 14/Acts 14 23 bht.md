# Acts 14:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When Paul and Barnabas were establishing new churches, they appointed elders through a process of election and guidance. These elders were chosen from among the newly converted believers and charged with the responsibility of overseeing the spiritual interests of the brethren. Though these elders were not ordained in the ecclesiastical sense, they were commended to the Lord for His guidance and blessing. The apostles' care for the churches extended not only to the selection of elders but also to their ongoing support and prayer for the growth of these young congregations in the faith.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The word will not bear Jerome’s and Chrys.’s sense of ‘laying on of hands,’ adopted by Roman Catholic expositors."
2. "Nor is there any reason here for departing from the usual meaning of electing by show of hands."
3. "The Apostles may have admitted by ordination those presbyters whom the churches elected."

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "As there is no evidence in the New Testament that the word had then lost its proper meaning, as this is beyond doubt its meaning in Acts 14:23, and as there is indisputable evidence that the concurrence of the people was required in all elections to sacred office in the earliest ages of the Church, it is perhaps better to understand the words to mean, 'when they had made a choice of elders,' that is, superintended such choice on the part of the disciples."
2. "This last clause confirms our interpretation of the former. For if 'ordination' was by prayer and fasting (see Acts 13:3), why should it be said they first 'ordained elders,' and after that 'prayed with fasting?' Whereas if the first clause refer to the choice and the second to the ordination, all is natural."
3. "They commended—'committed' them—that is, all these churches. To the Lord—Jesus."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The word 'ordain' we now use in an ecclesiastical sense, to denote 'a setting apart to an office by the imposition of hands.' But it is evident that the word here is not employed in that sense."
2. "The word properly denotes 'to stretch out the hand'; and as it was customary to elect to office, or to vote, by stretching out or elevating the hand, so the word simply means 'to elect, appoint, or designate to any office.'"
3. "The apostles were about to leave them. They were just organized into churches: they were inexperienced; they needed counsel and direction; they were exposed to dangers; and it was necessary, therefore, that persons should be designated to watch over the spiritual interests of the brethren."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The meaning ordain is later." 
2. "Elders...for the general superintendence of the church."
3. "Those who are called elders...are called bishops, in speaking of Gentile communities."

### John Calvin:
1. "Christ did not only send his apostles to preach the gospel, but he commanded also that there should be pastors appointed, that the preaching of the gospel might be perpetual and in daily use." 
2. "The Church cannot want an ordinary ministry, neither can any be counted Christians before God but those who, during their whole life, are willing to learn."
3. "The people had their free election, but lest there should any tumult arise, Paul and Barnabas sit as chief moderators."
4. "They had a double end and reason of their prayer; the first, that God would direct them with the spirit of wisdom and discretion to choose the best and most meet men...the second end of their prayer was, that God would furnish with necessary gifts those pastors which were chosen."
5. "We gather hereby, first, what great care Paul and Barnabas had for the salvation of those who, by their industry, were turned unto the Lord; for they testify, that in this infirmity of the flesh men be subject to more dangers, than that their faith can continue steadfast through his [its] own strength."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "There is some doubt here as to whether the Greek word translated 'ordained,' or, more accurately, 'appointed' signified that Paul and Barnabas simply conducted and guided the elections of the churches."
2. "The latter is the more probable, as in these new-formed communities, presbyters or elders chosen by Paul and Barnabas acting under the light of the Divine Spirit, would be more likely to command respect when the apostles were far away."
3. "Presbyters chosen by popular voice may not have carried the same weight of authority as those appointed by the apostles themselves."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "They needed also some form of organization, though already churches."
2. "It is most likely that this plan was the one pursued by Paul and Barnabas with these churches. They selected the elders in each instance and Paul and Barnabas 'ordained' them as we say."
3. "The use of the plural here implies what was true at Philippi and Ephesus that each church 'had its college of elders' as in Jerusalem."

(Note: The provided commentary is quite lengthy, so I have selected three quotes that provide a concise and meaningful understanding of the verse.)

### John Gill:
1. "As soon as ever any number of disciples were made, or souls were converted to Christ in any place, they were at once formed, by the apostles, into a church state."
2. "The apostles directed the churches to look out from among themselves...and the apostles presiding in this affair, they were installed into the office of bishops, elders, or pastors over them."
3. "They commended them to the Lord; both the elders and the churches, to be blessed by him with fresh supplies of grace, to be kept by his power, and to be preserved by him safe to his kingdom and glory."

### John Wesley:
1. "So soon can God enable even a babe in Christ to build up others in the common faith."
2. "They commended them to the Lord - An expression implying faith in Christ, as well as love to the brethren."
3. "Out of those who were themselves but newly converted."
