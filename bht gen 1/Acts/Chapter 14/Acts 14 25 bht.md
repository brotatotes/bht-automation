# Acts 14:25 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the commentators shed light on the significance of Perga and Attalia in the biblical narrative. Perga, a city in Pamphylia, held historical and cultural importance, while Attalia, a seaport, commanded trade from Egypt and Syria. Though the apostles preached in Perga, they found little success and moved on. Revisiting places without immediate results teaches us about faithfully proclaiming the message and leaving the outcome to God. This passage emphasizes the strategic locations visited by the apostles and their commitment to spreading Christianity.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Attaleia, a maritime town at the mouth of the river Catarrhactes, in Pamphylia, built by Attalus Philadelphus, king of Pergamus, in a convenient position to command the trade of Syria or Egypt."
2. "It is still an important place, called Satalia."
3. "To reach it they had to cross the plain from Perga."

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Preaching the word is not enough; it must be preached in faith, and with a view to the glory of God, and the good of souls. They preached in Perga, but it does not appear that they had any success there; therefore they went to another place." 

2. "Sometimes, God leads us to revisit places where we have previously preached the word, even if we did not see any visible fruit. It is a reminder that our job is to faithfully proclaim the message, leaving the results in God's hands."

3. "Attalia was a strategic seaport that attracted trade from Egypt and Syria. This shows that the disciples were intentional in reaching out to places where they could have a greater impact and influence for the spread of the gospel."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Attalia had something of the same relation to Perga which Cadiz has to Seville."
2. "Attalus Philadelphus, king of Pergamus, had built this city in a convenient position for commanding the trade of Syria or Egypt."
3. "Its ancient site is not now certainly known."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The history of the 'Acts' says nothing of success, recounts no opposition. We conclude, therefore, that few converts were the result of the missionaries' labours."
2. "Apathy seems to have been the characteristic feature of the citizens; perhaps 'they cared for none of these things.'"
3. "Attalia was famous in the story of the Crusades, under the name of Sataleia, as the port whence King Louis of France, after his disastrous march through Anatolia, embarked with his knights and nobles for Antioch, leaving the plebeian crowd of infantry to perish at the foot of the Pamphylian hills, A.D. 1148."

### John Gill:
1. "They went down into 'Attalia'; not Italia or Italy, as some Latin copies, and as the Syriac, Arabic, and Ethiopic versions read; but a city in Pamphylia, bordering on the sea."
2. "Attalia is a city of Pamphylia, on the sea coast; it was formerly the metropolis of it: it is now in the hands of the Turks, and is called Sattalia."
3. "It is famous for tapestry, which is made in it: it had its name from Attalus, king of Pergamus, the first founder of it."

### John Wesley:
1. "Perga and Attalia, as cities of Pamphylia, were significant in terms of their historical and cultural context, providing a backdrop for understanding the events that unfolded in the biblical narrative."

2. "The mention of these cities highlights the geographical setting of the verse, emphasizing the physical journey and the locations visited by the apostles."

3. "By mentioning Perga and Attalia, the author of the commentary draws attention to the importance of these cities in the spread of Christianity, as they served as key points of entry and departure for the apostles during their missionary journeys."
