# Acts 14:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In a city of Oriental Greeks, divisions arose as Paul and Barnabas preached, with some approving their teachings and others condemning them. The enemies of truth formed parties, spreading opposition to the Gospel. These divisions were not caused by Christianity itself, but by the corrupt nature of humanity. Despite the turmoil, Paul claimed his apostolic authority alongside the Twelve. Such divisions and conflicts are not uncommon, as the forwardness and depravity of men can lead to tumults even amidst the spread of the Gospel.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Such a split into two factions was a common occurrence, on far less important occasions, in these cities of Oriental Greeks."
2. "This is the first place where Paul and Barnabas are so called. St. Paul constantly vindicates the title in his Epistles."
3. "So that there were, widening the word beyond the Twelve, fifteen Apostles, usually so called."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "A revival of religion often produces excitement by the bad passions of opposers."
2. "The enemies of the truth form parties, and organize opposition."
3. "It is no uncommon thing even now for such parties to be formed; but the fault is not in Christianity."

### John Calvin:
1. "The forwardness of men causeth that the gospel, which ought to be the bond of unity, is (so soon as it cometh abroad) the occasion of tumults."
2. "We hear here that one city was divided, whereby some were brought unto Christ. The Spirit of God pronounceth this to the praise, and not the shame, of Paul and Barnabas."
3. "It is assuredly a miserable matter to see division among men. But as the unity is accursed which doth separate us all from God, so it were better that a few should depart an hundred times from all the whole world, and, in the mean season, come in favor again with God, than that disagreeing with him continually, they should have peace with the world."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "This division was within the Gentile populace."
2. "The Jewish leaders made some impression on the Gentiles."
3. "Paul claimed to be an apostle on a par with the twelve."

### John Gill:
1. "The multitude of the city was divided...some approving them, others condemning their doctrines as false, and their miracles as delusions." 

2. "These divisions in families, towns, and cities...are not owing to any fault in [the Gospel], but to the depravity and corruption of human nature." 

3. "Divisions...are what our Lord declared was, and foretold would be the case."
