# Acts 14:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, there is a description of a hostile movement and impetuous excitement towards the apostles, fueled by both Jews and Gentiles. It is mentioned that the apostles were aware of this potential assault and decided to avoid violence by escaping the situation. Through their unwavering commitment to preaching the gospel, they faced danger without fear, displaying remarkable constancy. The intent behind the assault was to bring harm upon the apostles, involving the possibility of stoning, a punishment commonly inflicted by the Jews for blasphemy.

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Assault [ορμη] . Too strong, as is also the Rev., onset. In case an actual assault had been made, it would have been absurd for Luke to tell us that 'they were ware of it.' It is rather the purpose and intention of assault beginning to assume the character of a movement."
2. "To stone. Paul says he was stoned once (2 Corinthians 11:25). This took place at Lystra (see ver. 19)."
3. "This took place at Lystra (see ver. 19)."

2. "The apostles avoided violence and stoning by a timely flight."
3. "Truth is necessarily consistent, but it is scarcely possible that independent accounts not having truth to guide them should thus advance to the very brink of contradiction without falling into it."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "It probably denotes not an actual attack so much as the open start, the co-operation of both Jews and Gentiles (the disaffected portion), 'with their rulers'." 
2. "The city officials would hardly join in a mob like this, though Hackett and Rackham think that the city magistrates were also involved."
3. "The plan to stone them shows that the Jews were in the lead and followed by the Gentile rabble."

### John Gill:
