# Acts 14:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Paul and Barnabas, after being persecuted and stoned in one city, fled to the cities of Lystra and Derbe in Lycaonia. The exact locations of these cities are uncertain, but they were believed to be near the Black Mountains and the roots of Mount Taurus. Despite the danger they faced, they remained vigilant and aware of the spiritual battles surrounding them. Their purpose was to spread the Gospel and stand firm in their faith, trusting in God's strength to overcome.
