# Acts 14:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In a public place or forum, a man who had never walked, and was impotent in his feet sat, emphasizing his severe condition and highlighting the impossibility of any human remedy. The man's physical disability isolated him socially, yet his ability to hear Paul speak allowed him to listen to the message of hope and salvation. This miracle of healing, performed by the voice of Paul alone, was remarkable and accessible to all who witnessed it, demonstrating the power and universal reach of God.
