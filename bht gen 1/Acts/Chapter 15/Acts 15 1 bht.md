# Acts 15:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the midst of the early church, a conflict arose between certain individuals who held strong Judaizing beliefs and the apostles and elders. These Judaizers sought to enforce adherence to the Mosaic law, including circumcision, upon all Gentile believers. The dispute became so significant that it required the involvement of the apostles and elders in Jerusalem to settle the matter. This disagreement not only exposed the deep-rooted prejudices and divisions within the church but also showcased the importance of faith in Christ as the sole condition for salvation, challenging the narrow-minded beliefs of the Judaizers.
