# Acts 15:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the early days of the Church, there arose a question of controversy regarding the observance of Jewish laws and customs. Facing disagreement and differing opinions, Paul and Barnabas, recognized leaders of the Antioch Church, were determined to establish the truth and organization of the Church. Recognizing the significance of the matter, the Antioch Church decided to send Paul and Barnabas to Jerusalem for counsel and direction from the apostles and elders. This consultation was deemed necessary to address the Jewish impositions and ensure unity among converts.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "In this expression I cannot see it necessarily implied that the revelation was made to himself, but that there was some intimation of the Holy Ghost, similar perhaps to that in ch. Acts 13:2, in accordance with which the church at Antioch sent him and Barnabas; there being προφῆται there, by whom the Spirit spoke His will."
2. "Titus was one, Galatians 2:1; Galatians 2:3, and that, in all probability, in order to give an example of a Gentile convert of the uncircumcision endowed with gifts of the Holy Spirit."
3. "Titus is not mentioned in the Acts: but only in 2 Cor., Gal., 2 Tim., and the epistle addressed to him."

### Marvin Vincent:
