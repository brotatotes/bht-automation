# Acts 15:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the early Church addresses the Gentile converts, advising them to abstain from the pollution of idolatry, fornication, and the consumption of things offered to idols and strangled. The goal is to avoid offense and maintain spiritual purity, as these actions are contrary to the faith and associated with false beliefs. By living according to God's commandments and rejecting cultural norms, believers demonstrate their commitment to the one true God and His moral standards.

### Henry Alford:
1. "The Gentile converts needed no command to abstain from the pollution of idolatry."
2. "The ἀλ . τ . εἰδ . are the things polluted by being offered to idols, about which there was much doubt and contention in the early church."
3. "The solution will best be found in the fact, that πορνεία was universally in the Gentile world regarded on the same footing with the other things mentioned, as an ἀδιάφορον."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "From such food James would enjoin the Gentile converts to abstain, lest it should seem to the Jews that they were not entirely weaned from idolatry."
2. "The indulgence of [fornication] on the part of the Gentile converts would to Jews, whose Scriptures branded it as an abomination of the heathen, proclaim them to be yet joined to their old idols."
3. "The eating of [blood], therefore, on the part of the Gentile converts, would shock their prejudices."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "That flesh, after being offered in sacrifice, was often exposed for sale in the markets, or was served up at feasts... it would give occasion for scandal and offence; and, therefore, as a matter of expediency, it was advised that they should abstain from it." 
2. "This vice prevailed everywhere among the Gentiles, and was that to which all were particularly exposed... it was important for the early Christians to frown upon and to oppose it, and to set a special guard against it in all the churches."
3. "The reason why these [animals or birds that were killed without shedding their blood] were considered by the Jews unlawful to be eaten was, that thus they would be under a necessity of eating blood, which was positively forbidden by the Law."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The kindred noun ejpistolh, whence our epistle, means, originally, anything sent by a messenger. Letter is a secondary meaning."
2. "Here the word is defined by things sacrificed to idols (ver. 29); the flesh of idol sacrifices, of which whatever was not eaten by the worshippers at the feasts in the temples, or given to the priests, was sold in the markets and eaten at home."
3. "The association of fornication with three things in themselves indifferent is to be explained from the then moral corruption of heathenism, by which fornication, regarded from of old with indulgence, and even with favor, nay, practiced without shame even by philosophers, and surrounded by poets with all the tinsel of lasciviousness, had become in public opinion a thing really indifferent."

### John Calvin:
1. "We know how straitly the Lord commandeth to eschew those things which are contrary to the external profession of faith, and wherein there is any appearance or suspicion of idolatry."
2. "No marvel if, to avoid offense, they be commanded to abstain from things offered to idols."

1. "The injunction to abstain from the pollutions of idols was not merely a matter of avoiding physical contact with idols, but also a call to reject the false beliefs and practices associated with idol worship." 

2. "The decree of the Council highlights the importance of maintaining spiritual purity and integrity, recognizing that our actions and associations can have a profound impact on our faith and witness." 

3. "By abstaining from the pollutions of idols, believers are called to live in a way that reflects their commitment to the one true God and His commandments, rather than being swayed by the cultural norms and practices of the surrounding society."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "James agrees with Peter in his support of Paul and Barnabas in their contention for Gentile freedom from the Mosaic ceremonial law."
2. "The restrictions named by James affect the moral code that applies to all (idolatry, fornication, murder)."
3. "The problem is whether the words were added because 'blood' was understood as not 'murder,' but a reference to the Mosaic regulation or whether it was omitted to remove the ceremonial aspect and make it all moral and ethical."

### John Gill:
1. "The reason why this is put among things indifferent is, not that it was so in itself, but because it was not thought to be criminal by the Gentiles, and was commonly used by them, and which must be offensive to the believing Jews, who were better acquainted with the will of God."
2. "The law against eating blood was very strictly enjoined the Jews, and severely punished; whoever ate of blood, but the quantity of an olive, if he ate it wilfully, was guilty of cutting off; if ignorantly, he was to bring a sin offering."
3. "God forbids his people from eating the blood of any animal. Blood carries both infections and toxins that might circulate in the animal's body. Therefore, by eating an animal's blood, one exposes himself needlessly to potential toxins and infections."

### John Wesley:
1. "To abstain from fornication — Which even the philosophers among the heathens did not account any fault."
2. "And from things strangled — That is, from whatever had been killed, without pouring out the blood."
3. "It was to be poured upon the ground as water: doubtless in honour of that blood which was in due time poured out for the sin of the world."
