# Acts 15:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, a letter is written by the apostles, elders, and brethren from the Church in Jerusalem. The mention of churches in Cilicia suggests that Paul had preached the gospel there. The letter includes a greeting, expressing their desire for the well-being of the recipients. It is notable that the letter was not written by the Apostle Peter, but rather reflects the direction of the Apostle James. This decision made by the Council was intended for Gentile Christians everywhere, showing the widespread impact of Paul's preaching in those early days.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The omission of καὶ οἱ before ἀδελφοί...can...hardly have been occasioned by hierarchical considerations." 
2. "It seems very much more probable to me that the words καὶ οἱ were inserted to bring the decree into exact harmony with the beginning of Acts 15:22."
3. "This mention of churches in Cilicia, coupled with the fact of Paul’s stay at Tarsus, makes it probable that Paul preached the gospel there, and to Gentiles."

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "This is the first mention in the New Testament history of writing as an element in its development."
2. "But whereas there it is the deep difference between Israel and the Gentiles which is proclaimed, here it is the obliteration of that difference through faith in the Lord Jesus."
3. "Showing that churches then existed in Cilicia as well as Syria, which owed their existence, in all likelihood, to Paul's labors during the interval between his return to Tarsus and his departure in company with Barnabas for Antioch."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "And wrote letters - Greek: 'Having written.' It does not mean that they wrote more than one epistle." 

2. "Send greeting - A word of salutation, expressing their desire of the happiness (χαίρειν chairein) of the persons addressed. Compare Matthew 26:49; Matthew 27:29; Luke 1:28; John 19:3." 

3. "In Antioch - Where the difficulty first arose. And Syria - Antioch was the capital of Syria, and it is probable that the dispute was not confined to the capital. And Cilicia - See the notes on Acts 6:9. Cilicia was adjacent to Syria. Paul and Barnabas had traveled through it, and it is probable that the same difficulty would exist there which had disturbed the churches in Syria."

### Archibald T Robertson:
