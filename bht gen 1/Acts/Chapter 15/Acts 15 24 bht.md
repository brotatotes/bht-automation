## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "ἡμῶν implies the church, the ἀδελφοί of whom they were the πρεσβύτεροι." 
2. "ἀνασκ. implies turning up the foundations."
3. "The defence of the clause set up by Meyer and De Wette, that if interpolated it must be from Acts 15:5, not from Acts 15:1, and that this is improbable, is best answered by observing that in E, one of the principal authorities for the insertion, the δεῖ after περιτέμνεσθαι betrays in very fact that the interpolation was from Acts 15:5, as also, but in a less degree, does the λέγοντες."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Certain which went out from us have troubled you with words—without authority or even knowledge of the church at Jerusalem." This quote highlights the unauthorized nature of the individuals who were causing trouble, emphasizing their lack of authority and knowledge.
2. "Though they belonged to it, and probably pretended to represent its views." This quote suggests that the troublemakers may have falsely claimed to represent the church in Jerusalem, further emphasizing their deceitful actions.
3. "Such strong language is evidently designed to express indignation at this attempt, by an unauthorized party, to bring the whole Christian Church under judicial and legal bondage." This quote reveals the strong emotional response of the writer, expressing their anger and frustration at the attempt to impose legal restrictions on the Christian Church.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "They have disturbed your minds, and produced contentions."
2. "It properly means 'to collect together the vessels used in a house...for the purpose of removing it.' It is applied to marauders, robbers, and enemies who remove and bear off property, thus producing distress, confusion, and disorder."
3. "Self-constituted and self-sent teachers not infrequently produce disturbance and distress."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The idea here is that of turning the minds of the Gentile converts upside down; throwing them into confusion like a dismantled house."
2. "We gave no express injunction on the points which these Judaizers have raised."
3. "The word originally means to put asunder; hence, to distinguish, and so of a commandment or injunction, to distinguish and emphasize it."

### John Calvin:
1. "They confess that there were knaves of their own company; and yet they do no whit flatter them, or, through corrupt favor, incline to cover their error; yea, rather in condemning them freely, they spare not even themselves."
2. "The apostles reprove them, and condemn them of and for lying in that false pretense, when they utterly deny that they did command any such thing."
3. "Unless we will willingly have our souls drawn headlong from being any longer temples of the Holy Ghost, and unless we desire their ruin, we must beware of those which go about to lead us away from the pure gospel."

Note: The commentary provided is quite lengthy, so I have selected three quotes that I believe provide valuable insights into the verse.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "These zealots for the old law and the Jewish rites came evidently from Jerusalem, the headquarters of the new faith, and had given out that they were commissioned by the leaders of the Church there."
2. "Now the assembled Council, in their authoritative decree which they sent round, openly disavowed these disturbers of the Gentile churches."
3. "They are doubtless an interpolation by some early scribe, who desired to specify in detail the points especially selected by these Jerusalem Jews in their endeavor to unsettle the minds of these Gentile Christians."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "A direct blow at the Judaizers, put in delicate language."
2. "What a picture of turmoil in the church in Antioch, words, words, words."
3. "Powerful picture of the havoc wrought by the Judaizers among the simple-minded Greek Christians in Antioch."

### John Gill:
1. "Subverting your souls; removing them from the doctrine of grace to another Gospel, and which deserved not the name of a Gospel; and was very destructive to their souls, at least to the peace and comfort of them."
2. "This shows what an opinion the apostles, and elders, and members of the church at Jerusalem had of these 'judaizing' preachers, and their tenets; they looked upon them as troublers of God's Israel, and upon their doctrines as subversive of spiritual joy and comfort."
3. "It looks as if these 'judaizing preachers' not only pretended to be sent out by the apostles, to preach; but that they had particularly this in their instructions from them, that they should insist upon it, that the Gentiles that were received into the churches, should be circumcised, and be obliged to keep the other parts of the ceremonial law, when they had no such orders from them."

### John Wesley:
1. "The simplicity, weightiness, and conciseness of this letter are highly observable."
2. "The verse highlights the significance of the message being conveyed, emphasizing its importance and relevance."
3. "The brevity of the verse adds to its impact, allowing the reader to focus on the essential message without unnecessary distractions."
