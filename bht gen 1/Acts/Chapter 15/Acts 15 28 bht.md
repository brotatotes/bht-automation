# Acts 15:28 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, the decision of the Holy Spirit is laid down as the primary determination, guiding the church leaders and expressing His will and command. The apostles and elders recognized themselves as instruments of the Holy Ghost, faithfully delivering the decrees that were divinely ordained. These necessary decrees were not burdensome requirements, but rather measures to maintain peace and unity in the early Church. Through the guidance of the Holy Spirit, the church ensured that these regulations were not cumbersome or long-lasting, but rather appropriate for the specific time and context.
