# Acts 15:29 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This verse advises believers to abstain from consuming foods that have been offered to idols, as well as from consuming blood and things that have been strangled. The prohibition against eating blood is seen as consistent throughout biblical history, from the time of Adam to Noah, through Moses, and beyond. The instruction remains unchanged, except for when the bishop of Rome allowed it to be repealed in the eighth century. This teaching has been honored by many churches that do not recognize the authority of the bishop of Rome.
