# Acts 15:32 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, there are two prophets named Judas and Silas. These prophets not only had the ability to foretell future events, but also possessed an impressive knowledge of Scripture and the ability to explain and apply it for the edification of others. They were not just messengers, but skilled interpreters of God's word. With their supernatural insights and impassioned preaching, they exerted a weighty and confirmatory influence on the believers, strengthening them in the teachings of the Gospel and reinforcing their freedom from the law of Moses.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The reason for their superadding to the appointed business of their mission the work of exhorting and edifying."
2. "On προφ ., see ch. Acts 11:27 ; Acts 13:1 ; Ephesians 2:20 , and notes."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Judas and Silas, being prophets themselves—that is, inspired teachers."
2. "exhorted the brethren with many words—"much discourse.""
3. "and confirmed them—opening up, no doubt, the great principle involved in the controversy now settled, of gratuitous salvation, or the purification of the heart by faith alone."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Being prophets - This evidently implies that they had been preachers before they went to Antioch."
2. "Possibly it may imply that they were teachers of unusual or remarkable ability."
3. "Confirmed them - Strengthened them; that is, by their instructions and exhortations."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Many words. Or, lit., much discourse; adding the spoken to the written consolation."
2. "Exhorted. Or comforted. See on ver. 31. The latter agrees better with consolation there."
3. "Confirmed. See on ch. Acts 14:22."

### John Calvin:
1. "These two brethren were sent for this cause, that they might also testify the same thing by word which was contained in the letters, and more also."
2. "They did not only do their duty faithfully in the cause which was now in hand, but they did also take good and profitable pains in teaching and exhorting the Church."
3. "Luke’s meaning is, that Judas and Silas were endued with excellent knowledge and understanding of the mysteries of God, that they might be good interpreters of God; as Paul...speaketh not of foretelling of things to come; but he commandeth it for this fruit, because it doth edify the Church by doctrine, exhortation, and consolation."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "In the Church of the first days existed a certain number of men known as ‘prophets.’ We hear of them, by chance it seems, but still frequently, in the varied writings of the New Testament."
2. "The chief characteristic feature of these prophets of early Christianity was that the prophets possessed a strange, winning power of words, which had a weighty effect on their hearers."
3. "They were, then, earnest, impassioned preachers, who possessed a supernatural insight into the hearts of men; they seemed to know what was in their minds, they read their most secret thoughts."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Being themselves also prophets (κα αυτο προφητα οντες). As well as Paul and Barnabas and like Agabus (Acts 11:27-30), for-speakers for Christ who justify the commendation in the letter (verse Acts 15:27) 'with many words' (δια λογου πολλου), 'with much talk'..." 

2. "Confirmed (επεστηριξαν). See on Acts 14:22. It was a glorious time with no Judaizers to disturb their fellowship as in Acts 15:1-3."

### John Gill:
1. "By prophets are meant, not only such who had the gift of foretelling things to come; though such there were, and these might have that gift; but such who were able to explain the prophecies of the Old Testament, give the true sense of the Scriptures, and open them to the edification of others."
2. "They made use of their gifts, being 'full of the Holy Ghost,' to exhort the brethren with many words."
3. "They confirmed the brethren in the doctrines of the Gospel, and particularly in their Christian liberty, and freedom from the law of Moses, in which the false teachers had endeavored to stagger them."
