### Henry Alford:
1. "The αὐτοῦ is αὐ τούς in C and D, and αὐτοῖς and αὐτόθι in some cursives; and D and the Vulg. add μόνος δὲ Ἰούδ . ἐπορεύθη ; the former shewing the copying of an indistinct marginal gloss which was not understood, and the latter betraying the secret of the whole, viz. that the notice was interpolated to account for Silas being found again at Antioch in Acts 15:40." 

2. "Internally considered, the insertion is very improbable: coming after ἀπελύθησαν unexplained (which from its voice and tense implies that the dismissal actually took place and they departed) and followed by Παῦλος  δέ after ἔδοξε δὲ τῷ Σίλᾳ."

3. "We learn from Galatians 2:10, that  a condition was attached to the cordiality with which the Gentile mission of Paul and Barnabas was recognized by the chief Apostles: that they should  remember the poor, i.e. the poor  at Jerusalem: that the wants of the mother church should not be forgotten by those converts, whose Judaical bond to her was thus cast loose."
