# Acts 15:39 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In a sharp contention between Paul and Barnabas, Paul sought justice while Barnabas sought compassion. The separation between them seemed to have been based on reason, with Barnabas going with his cousin without much approval, while Paul was commended by the church. This disagreement, though unfortunate, ultimately led to the furtherance of the Gospel. Both sides had their faults and disagreements, but they eventually moved past their bitter dispute.
