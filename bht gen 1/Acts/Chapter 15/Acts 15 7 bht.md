## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Partly on account of the universal deference paid to him, but principally because of his peculiar fitness to open the apostolic decisions on the subject, from having been made the instrument of the first public and approved reception of the Gentiles."
2. "Such notices are important, as showing that these reports are not only according to the sense of what was said, but the words spoken, verbatim."
3. "The length of time elapsed is placed by Peter in the strongest light, to show that the question had in fact been settled by divine interference long since."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "This is the last mention of him in the Acts, and one worthy of his standing, as formally pronouncing, from the divine decision of the matter already in his own case, in favor of the views which all of Paul's labors were devoted to establishing."

2. "A good while ago—probably about fifteen years before this."

3. "Made choice... that the Gentiles by my mouth."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "With our word disputing we commonly connect the idea of heat and anger. This is not necessarily implied in the word used here. It might have been calm, solemn, deliberate inquiry..." 

2. "Peter was probably the most aged, and was most accustomed to speak... Besides, there was a particular reason for his speaking here, as he had been engaged in similar scenes, and understood the case..."

3. The use of the word "gospel" in this verse underscores the transformative power of the message being proclaimed, as it brings salvation and hope to those who hear it.

### John Calvin:
1. "Whereby appeareth how the Lord did exercise his Church, even then, by the infirmity of men, that it might learn to be wise with humility."
2. "And so soon as the authority of God is brought forth, all doubting is taken away, because this is all our wisdom, to stay ourselves upon the authority, government, and commandment of God."
3. "For, seeing that the Gentiles are ingrafted into the people of God without circumcision and ceremonies, Peter gathereth that it was not well done to lay upon them any necessity to keep the law."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The older apostles, Peter and John, supported by the powerful influence of James, well known and honoured by the most rigorous Hebrew Christians, with great moderation and wisdom arranged a common platform, on which the extreme men of both parties might act in unison, and together carry on the weighty work of their Divine Master."
2. "Peter’s words, of course, were exceedingly weighty, as the deliberate expression of opinion of one who had ever stood high in the Master’s friendship and confidence, and who, from the very first, had occupied a leading position among the brethren."

3. "His sense is, that some years ago it pleased God, in his providence, to single him out from the rest of the apostles, and in a very extraordinary manner to call him to go to Caesarea, and preach the gospel to Cornelius, and those that were in his house, that hearing they might believe in Christ."
