# Acts 16:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the author subtly reveals his presence alongside the apostle Paul. He remains humble throughout the account, never mentioning his own name or personal contributions to the spread of Christianity. This modesty is not unique to the author, as other biblical historians also demonstrate similar humility and self-effacement in their writings.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "While we safely conclude from it that the writer was in company with Paul when he thus speaks, we cannot with like safety infer that he was not, where the third person is used."
2. "For it is conceivable that a narrative, even where it concerns all present, might be, in its earlier parts, written as of others in the third person, but might, when more intimacy had been established, or even by preference only, be at any point changed to the first."
3. "One objection raised by De Wette to the common view, that Luke accompanied Paul from this time (except as above), is, that several times Paul’s companions are mentioned, but Luke is never among them."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The 'we,' here first introduced, is a modest intimation that the historian himself had now joined the missionary party."
2. "Whether Paul's broken health had anything to do with this arrangement for having 'the beloved physician' with him, can never be known with certainty."
3. "That he would deem himself honored in taking care of so precious a life, there can be no doubt."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "We endeavored - This is the first instance in which Luke refers to himself as being in company with Paul."
2. "It is hence probable that he joined Paul and Silas about this time."
3. "Assuredly gathering - Being certainly convinced."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "We sought. Note the introduction, for the first time here, of the first person, intimating the presence of the author with Paul."
2. "Assuredly gathering [συμβιβαζοντες]. See on proving, ch. 9 22."

These quotes highlight the presence of the author with Paul and the importance of gathering and proving in understanding the verse.

### John Calvin:
1. "Hence we gather, that is was not bare vision, but that it was also confirmed by the testimony of the Spirit."
2. "A wicked spirit appeared to Brutus, inviting him to enter that unhappy combat and battle which he had at Philippi, even in the very same place whereunto Paul was afterwards called."
3. "The termination of the participle which is here used is active; and though it have divers significations, I do not doubt but that Luke’s meaning is, that Paul and the rest, after that they had conferred [compared] this vision with the former oracles, were fully persuaded that the Lord had called them into Macedonia."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "In this verse the ‘writer of the “Acts”’ adopts the style of an eye-witness, and the apostolic memoirs for a time are written in the first person."
2. "From this it appears that Luke, the presumed author of these records, joined the missionary band first at Troas."
3. "After the direct intimation given by the appearance of the ‘man of Macedonia,’ Paul seems to have had no hesitation in coming to the conclusion that his life-work lay for a time, at least, in Europe."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "This sudden use of the plural, dropped in Acts 17:1 when Paul leaves Philippi, and resumed in Acts 20:5 when Paul rejoins Luke in Philippi, argues conclusively that Luke, the author, is in the party ("we" portions of Acts) and shows in a writer of such literary skill as Luke that he is not copying a document in a blundering sort of way."
2. "Concluding (συνβιβαζοντες). A very striking word, present active participle of συνβιβαζω, old verb to make go together, to coalesce or knit together, to make this and that agree and so to conclude."
3. "Already in Acts 9:22 of Paul's preaching. This word here gives a good illustration of the proper use of the reason in connection with revelation, to decide whether it is a revelation from God, to find out what it means for us, and to see that we obey the revelation when understood."

### John Gill:
1. "And when they had well weighed it, and the circumstances of it" - This quote emphasizes the careful consideration and analysis the companions gave to the vision, indicating their seriousness and commitment to following God's guidance.

2. "Immediately we endeavored to go into Macedonia" - This quote highlights the prompt and decisive action taken by the companions in response to the vision, demonstrating their obedience and eagerness to fulfill their mission.

3. "They concluded from the vision with great certainty, that they had a manifest call from God" - This quote underscores the companions' strong conviction and assurance that the vision was a clear indication of God's calling for them to preach the Gospel in Macedonia.

### John Wesley:
1. "This is the first place in which St. Luke intimates his attendance on the apostle."
