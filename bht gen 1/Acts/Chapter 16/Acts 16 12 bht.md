# Acts 16:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As Paul and his companions embarked on their mission, they crossed the gateway of Neapolis, symbolizing the beginning of their journey and the anticipation of what lies ahead. The river Strymon served as a natural boundary, reminding them of the importance of crossing over and reaching out to those on the other side. In Philippi, a Roman colony infused with Roman influence, they faced not only the challenges of spreading the Gospel but also the clash of cultures and values. Nonetheless, they persevered, exercising their faith and teaching the word with success.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The first Macedonian city of the district. It was the first Macedonian city to which Paul and his companions came in that district, Neapolis properly belonging to Thrace."
2. "The other explanations are, (1) 'chief city,' as E. V. But this it was not: Thessalonica being the chief city of the whole province, and Amphipolis of the division (if it then subsisted) of Macedonia prima."
3. "Philippi was made a colonia by Augustus, as a memorial of his victory over Brutus and Cassius, and as a frontier garrison against Thrace."

2. "It has been proposed, therefore, to alter the Greek text in accordance with this, since it is known that Amphipolis was made the chief city by Paulus Aemilius.

3. "The word denotes 'a city or province' which was planted or occupied by Roman citizens. It is a strong confirmation of the fact here stated by Luke, that Philippi had the rank and dignity of a Roman colony, as coins are still extant, in which Philippi is distinctly referred to as a colony."
