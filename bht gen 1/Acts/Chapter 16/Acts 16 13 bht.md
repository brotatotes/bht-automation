# Acts 16:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In a distant and secluded place, near the river side, a group of women and men, perhaps both Jews and gentiles, gathered for prayer outside the bustling city gates. In this humble enclosure, open to the sky, they sought a connection with God, prioritizing their worship over personal comfort. The absence of a synagogue did not deter Paul and his companions from seizing the opportunity to share the gospel and embrace the first-fruits of Europe's faith in Christ, demonstrating the significance of their public profession and dedication to God's work.
