# Acts 16:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we see the continuity of the covenant of grace between Jews and Christians, where the sign of admission, baptism, is emphasized. The mention of baptism in connection with Paul's labors indicates its special importance. It is believed that this might be an instance of household or infant baptism, as was common in the early church. Lydia's hospitality towards Paul and her profession of faith through baptism reflect the genuine and fruitful nature of her newfound faith. The presence of Lydia's household members suggests that they too may have believed and been baptized.
