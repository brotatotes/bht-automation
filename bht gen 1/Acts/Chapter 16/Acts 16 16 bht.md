# Acts 16:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, a slave girl with the ability to prophesy through a demonic spirit encounters Paul and his companions. This spirit of divination, associated with the Greek god Apollo, had led the girl to predict the future. Luke, a Greek physician, describes the events from his own observation, emphasizing the real presence of this prophetic spirit. As Paul recognized this case of demoniacal possession, he commands the spirit to come out of her, highlighting the power of the gospel to free people from spiritual afflictions.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "In that case (besides other objections), if they had gone back from the house of Lydia to the place of prayer, the word would certainly have been ἐξελθόντων, and not πορευομένων."
2. "It may be remarked that the E. V. of πορευομένων εἰς (τὴν) προσευχήν, 'as we went to prayer,' has given rise to a curious abuse of the expression 'going to prayer,' in the sense of 'beginning to pray,' among the lower classes in England."
3. "All attempt to explain away such a narrative as this by the subterfuges of rationalism...is more than ever futile."

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "The reality of this demoniacal possession is as undeniable as that of any in the Gospel history."
2. "The words imply that it was on their way to the usual place of public prayer, by the river-side, that this took place; therefore not on the same day with what had just occurred."
3. "A female servant, and in this case a slave."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Possessed with a spirit of divination - Greek: Python. See the margin. Python, or Pythios, was one of the names of Apollo, the Grecian god of the fine arts, of music, poetry, medicine, and eloquence."
2. "The name Python is said to have been given him because, as soon as he was born, he destroyed with arrows a serpent of that name, that had been sent by Juno to persecute Latona; hence, his common name was the Pythian Apollo."
3. "It is plain that Paul regarded this as a case of demoniacal possession, and treated it accordingly."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The name Python was subsequently used to denote a prophetic demon, and was also used of soothsayers who practiced ventriloquism, or speaking from the belly." 
2. "Luke, in recording this case, which came under his own observation, uses the term which would naturally suggest itself to a Greek physician, a Python - spirit, presenting phenomena identical with the convulsive movements and wild cries of the Pythian priestess at Delphi." 
3. "Akin to mainomai, to rave, in allusion to the temporary madness which possessed the priestess or sibyl while under the influence of the God."

### John Calvin:
1. "Luke prosecuteth the increase of the Church; for though he do not straightway in a word express that thing, yet is it easily gathered out of the text, that many were brought into the faith, or at least that the Church was somewhat augmented, and Paul did not frequent the assemblies in time of prayer in vain."
2. "Seeing that Satan hath a double way to resist the gospel, to wit, because he doth sometimes rage openly, and sometimes he creepeth in craftily under lies, he hath also two kinds of lying and deceiving, either when he overthroweth the Word of God with false doctrines and gross superstitions, or else when he doth craftily feign that he is a friend of the Word, and so doth insinuate himself subtilely."
3. "Now, if God so sharply punish the contempt of his light in the profane Gentiles, who have no other teachers but the heaven and earth, how much more sharp punishment do those deserve who wittingly and willingly choke the pure doctrine of salvation, revealed to them in the law and the gospel?"

### Philip Schaff:
1. "To be possessed by the spirit of Pythoness was, in other words, to be possessed by a prophetic spirit or demon."
2. "She was the slave of several joint-owners, who used her unhappy powers as a source of gain for themselves."
3. "Paul, when he met her, and had had several opportunities of observing her, recognised that she was one of those many unhappy beings who, in the first days of Christianity, were afflicted with grievous soul maladies."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Certainly Luke does not mean to credit Apollo with a real existence."
2. "In the LXX those with familiar spirits are called by this word ventriloquists."
3. "This slave girl had this gift of prophecy 'by soothsaying'."

Note: The commentary is quite long, so I had to condense it significantly to fit within the word limit.

### John Gill:
1. "The phrase of 'going to prayer', as used by us, for the act or duty of prayer, is a mere Anglicism, and unknown to the eastern writers."
2. "The spirit in her pretended to divine and foretell things to come."
3. "The spirit that was in this maid was a real spirit that possessed her, though some think it was no other than a deluding, devilish, imposture."
