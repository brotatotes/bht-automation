# Acts 16:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In a tumultuous scene, without any proper trial or regard for the law, the accused were forcefully stripped of their clothing. The popular rage and desire to suppress the truth led to this unjust and shameful punishment. This act of brutality was not only carried out by the officials, but also fueled by the crowd's prejudice and the manipulations of those who opposed the gospel. Despite the hardships and mistreatment, the faithful triumphed, finding solace in their victory before God and His angels.
