# Acts 16:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the midst of their imprisonment, the prisoners endured physical abuse, with many stripes laid upon them, as if their suffering was not enough to satisfy their captors. Their Roman citizenship seemed to be disregarded or overlooked in the chaos, further highlighting the injustices they faced. It is suggested that the charging of the jailer may have been more driven by a need to appease the crowd rather than a genuine belief in the guilt of the prisoners, raising doubts about the true motives behind their treatment.

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The bleeding wounds from which they were not washed till it was done by the converted jailer." 
2. "Pestilential cells, damp and cold, from which the light was excluded, and where the chains rusted on the prisoners."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The Jews were by law prohibited from inflicting more than 40 stripes, and usually inflicted but 39." 
2. "But there was no such law among the Romans. They were unrestricted in regard to the number of lashes, and probably inflicted many more." 
3. "Perhaps Paul refers to this when he says, 'In stripes above measure,' that is, beyond the usual measure among the Jews, or beyond moderation."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The term 'prison' in this verse refers to a state of captivity or bondage, rather than a physical jail. It represents the condition of being held captive by sin and the consequences of our actions."
2. "The 'prison' mentioned here is not just a place of confinement, but also a state of spiritual darkness and separation from God. It symbolizes the consequences of our rebellion against Him."
3. "The verse reminds us that we are all prisoners in need of liberation. It highlights the universal human condition of being trapped in sin and in need of a Savior to set us free."

### John Calvin:
1. "Even when they lay bound with fetters, he saith that in prayer they lauded God, whereby it appeareth that neither the reproach with they suffered, nor the stripes which made their flesh smarter, nor the stink of the deep dungeon, nor the danger of death, which was hard at hand, could hinder them from giving thanks to the Lord joyfully and with glad hearts."
2. "We must note this general rule, that we cannot pray as we ought, but we must also praise God. For though the desire to pray arise of the feeling of our want and miseries, and therefore it is, for the most part, joined with sorrow and carefulness; yet the faithful must so bridle their affections, that they murmur not against God."
3. "We must know that Paul and Silas prayed aloud, that they might make the boldness of a good conscience known to others who were shut up in the same prison; for they might have made their prayer with secret groaning and sighing of heart as they were wont, or they might have prayed unto the Lord quietly and softly. Why do they then exalt their voice? Assuredly, they do not that for any ambition; but that they may profess, that, trusting to the goodness of their cause, they fly without fear unto God."

### Philip Schaff:
