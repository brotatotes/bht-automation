# Acts 16:26 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this powerful account, the Bible verse describes a miraculous intervention from God in response to the prayers and praises of His faithful servants. The earthquake was not a natural occurrence, but a divine sign of God's presence and protection. The chains of the prisoners were not merely loosened by the earthquake but supernaturally released, demonstrating God's extraordinary power. This event serves as a reminder that God is always near, ready to intervene and set free those who faithfully serve Him, even in the midst of persecution and imprisonment.
