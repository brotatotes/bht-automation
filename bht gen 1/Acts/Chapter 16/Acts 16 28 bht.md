# Acts 16:28 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we witness a remarkable scene of divine intervention and humanity. Moved by the supernatural events they had just witnessed, the prisoners were captivated by the Hebrew hymns of Paul and Silas. Their captivation prevented them from escaping. At this moment, the jailer, overwhelmed by a sense of wonder and awe, was about to take his own life. However, Paul's words stopped him from proceeding. It is a powerful testament to the power of God and the profound impact the Christian faith has on preserving and valuing human life.
