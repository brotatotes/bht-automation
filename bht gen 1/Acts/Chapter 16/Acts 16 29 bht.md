# Acts 16:29 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the emphasis is placed on the transformative power of light. The use of the plural form for "lights" signifies the multitude and diversity of sources that illuminate the world. Just as believers should join together to collectively shine the light of Christ, it is worth noting that when the prison governor was delivered from darkness, he immediately called for light. This change in attitude highlights the impact of being freed from the influence of evil and the need to embrace the illumination of God's truth.
