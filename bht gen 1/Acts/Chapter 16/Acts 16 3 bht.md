# Acts 16:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, a young and talented man named Timothy is mentioned. He had a unique background, being both Jewish and Greek. The apostle Paul, despite his understanding that circumcision was no longer necessary for salvation, chose to have Timothy circumcised due to the influence of Jewish unbelievers. This decision was made to remove any stumbling block that could hinder Timothy's ministry and to ensure unity and effectiveness in spreading the Gospel message. It highlights the Apostle Paul's willing adaptation to different circumstances for the sake of reaching and saving others.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Every Israelite might perform the rite."
2. "That he might not at once, wherever he preached, throw a stumbling-block before the Jews."
3. "There was here no concession in doctrine at all, and no reference whatever to the duty of Timotheus himself in the matter."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "He had no relative ties which were of service to him in his work; his companions were few and changing; and though Silas would supply the place of Barnabas, it was no weakness to yearn for the society of one who might become, what Mark once appeared to be, a son in the Gospel."
2. "His double connection, with the Jews by the mother's side and the Gentiles by the father's, would strike the apostle as a peculiar qualification for his own sphere of labor."
3. "Had Timothy not been circumcised, a storm would have gathered round the apostle in his farther progress. His fixed line of procedure was to act on the cities through the synagogues; and to preach the Gospel to the Jew first and then to the Gentile."

### Albert Barnes:
1) "It shows: (1) That he was disposed to look up and call forth the talent in the church that might be usefully employed."
2) "That Paul sought proper qualifications, and valued them."
3) "It was an act of expediency for the sake of peace, and was in accordance with Paul’s uniform and avowed principle of conduct."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "To go forth [εξελθειν] . The word is used of going forth as a missionary in Luke 9:6; 3 John 1:7."

2. "The use of the word 'go forth' implies a sense of purpose and mission, suggesting that the act of going out is not aimless, but rather intentional and directed towards a specific goal."

3. "This verse reminds us that as believers, we are called to actively engage with the world around us, to step out of our comfort zones, and to share the message of the Gospel with others."

4. "By using the word 'go forth,' the verse highlights the importance of taking action and not remaining stagnant in our faith. It encourages us to be proactive in spreading the good news and making a difference in the lives of those around us."

### John Calvin:
1. "The circumcising of Timothy was no sacrament, as was that which was given to Abraham and his posterity, but an indifferent ceremony which served only for nourishing of love, and not for any exercise of godliness."
2. "Circumcision did so cease at the coming of Christ, that, notwithstanding the use thereof was not quite abolished by and by; but it continued free, until all men might know that Christ was the end of the law, by the more manifest revelation of the light of the gospel."
3. "Because the calling of the Gentiles was not as yet generally known, it was meet that the Jews should have some prerogative granted them. Therefore, until it might be better known that the adoption was deducted from the lineage and kindred of Abraham unto all the Gentiles, it was lawful, so far as edification did require, to retain the sign of difference."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Paul longed for the society and comfort of one who might in time become what he once hoped Mark was a son in the faith." 
2. "In this act Paul was influenced entirely by considerations connected with the unconverted Jews in that and in other countries, who would quickly learn the particulars concerning the missionary apostle’s trusted companion." 
3. "Paul recognised this great truth fully, as we see in his steady refusal to circumcise Titus (Galatians 2:3). In the case of Titus, had he complied with the requirement to circumcise his companion, he would have given his assent to their doctrine that circumcision was necessary to salvation."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Here was a gifted young man who was both Jew and Greek."
2. "Paul voluntarily removed this stumbling-block to the ministry of Timothy."
3. "Timothy was circumcised because of Jewish unbelievers, not because of Jewish believers."

### John Gill:
1. "Perceiving that he was a young man, that not only had the grace of God, but very considerable gifts, and abilities for ministerial service."
2. "The apostle used circumcision not as a duty of the law, as what that required, and in obedience to it, which he knew was abrogated; much less as necessary to salvation, which the judaizing preachers urged; but as an indifferent thing, and in order to gain a point, and secure some valuable end."
3. "Thus the apostle to the Jews became a Jew, that he might gain and save some."
