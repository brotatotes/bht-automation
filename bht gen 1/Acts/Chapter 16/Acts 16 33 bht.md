# Acts 16:33 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we witness a powerful transformation through faith. The jailer not only cleanses the wounds of Paul and Silas, but he himself is cleansed from his sins. We see how the love and tenderness of the jailer, bathing them in their hour of need, is a testament to the effect of religion in producing humanity and kindness. The exchange from fear to boldness, as demonstrated by the jailer's resolute behavior, exemplifies the way faith can embolden believers to face their fears and find strength in God's care.
