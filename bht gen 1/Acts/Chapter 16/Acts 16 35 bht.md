# Acts 16:35 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In a dramatic turn of events, the Roman pretors, possibly influenced by the earthquake and reflections on their previous actions, made a sudden decision to release Paul and Silas. This change of heart was a stark contrast to their earlier order to detain the men. The impact of this decision was not only significant for the prisoners, but also brought a sense of relief and ease to the jailer.
