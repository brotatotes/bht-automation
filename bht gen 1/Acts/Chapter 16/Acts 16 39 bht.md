# Acts 16:39 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, the preachers find themselves in a precarious situation. The city's officials, who just recently mistreated them, are now begging them not to make a legal complaint. The fear of a change in the crowd's temper and their desire to save face also motivate these officials to request the preachers to leave the city. Ultimately, this opposition leads to the founding of a church and the spread of the gospel to neighboring regions.
