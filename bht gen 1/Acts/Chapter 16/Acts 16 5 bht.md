# Acts 16:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The passage being described is a transition into a new section, marked by the phrase "μὲν οὖν," which signifies a change in narrative or focus. In this section, the believers were not just established, but truly strengthened, emphasizing growth and fortification in their faith. The focus shifted to the kingdom of God and the doctrine of the gospel, with religion and godliness superseding external order and human laws. As a result of the apostolic labor, the acceptance of the gospel among the Gentiles increased, removing barriers to faith and allowing for a firm and continuous revival in the churches.
