## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The Apostle’s route must remain very uncertain. It is probable that he may have followed the great road (according to his usual practice and the natural course of a missionary journey) from Iconium to Philomelium and perhaps as far as Synnada, and thence struck off to the N.E. towards Pessinus in Galatia." 
2. "The midland district, known as Galatia, or Gallo-græcia, was inhabited by the descendants of those Gauls who invaded Greece and Asia in the third century B.C., and after various incursions and wars, settled and became mixed with the Greeks in the centre of Asia Minor."
3. "Galatia, after his murder, A.D. 26, became a Roman province. The principal cities were Ancyra, which was made the metropolis of the province by Augustus, Tavium, and Pessinus: in all, or some of which, the Apostle certainly preached."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "At this time must have been formed 'the churches of Galatia' (Galatians 1:2; 1 Corinthians 16:1); founded, as we learn from the Epistle to the Galatians, by the apostle Paul, and which were already in existence when he was on his third missionary journey."
2. "Why these proceedings, so interesting as we should suppose, are not here detailed, it is not easy to say; for the various reasons suggested are not very satisfactory."
3. "They were forbidden of the Holy Ghost—speaking by some prophet, to preach the word in Asia—not the great Asiatic continent, nor even the rich peninsula now called Asia Minor, but only so much of its western coast as constituted the Roman province of Asia."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The reason of this was, doubtless, that it was the intention of God to extend the gospel further into the regions of Greece than would have been done if they had remained in Asia Minor."
2. "This prohibition was the means of the first introduction of the gospel into Europe."
3. "In all this region the gospel was afterward preached with great success. But now a more important and a wider field was opened before Paul and Barnabas in the extensive country of Macedonia."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The mention of Asia in this verse refers to the Roman province of Asia, which encompassed the western part of modern-day Turkey. This region was known for its thriving trade routes and diverse cultures, making it a strategic location for the spread of the gospel."

2. "The inclusion of Asia in the list of places where the gospel had not yet been preached highlights the urgency and importance of Paul's mission to take the message of Christ to new territories. It reminds us that there are always new frontiers to reach with the good news."

3. "The fact that the Holy Spirit prevented Paul and his companions from preaching in Asia at that particular time shows us that God's timing and guidance are crucial in the work of spreading the gospel. It reminds us that we need to be sensitive to the leading of the Holy Spirit in our own lives and ministries."

### John Calvin:
1. "He [Paul] was not made the apostle of one particular place, or of a few cities, but he had received commandment to preach the gospel through Asia and Europe; which was to sail in a most wide sea."
2. "Therefore, it is certain that some are not preferred before other some by their merit, seeing that all men are naturally like backward and wayward from faith."
3. "And yet God doth not want a just reason, why he offereth his gospel to some, and passeth over other some. But I say that that reason lieth hid in his secret counsel."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "The question arises why Luke here and in Acts 18:23 adds the term 'of Galatia' though not in Acts 13:14 (Pisidian Antioch) nor in Acts 14:6 (cities of Lycaonia). Does Luke mean to use 'of Galatia' in the same ethnographic sense as 'of Phrygia' or does he here add the province (Galatia) to the name of the Region (Phrygia)?" 

2. "But the Greek participle κωλυθεντες ('having been forbidden') plays a part in the argument that cannot be overlooked whether Luke means to say that Paul went north or not. This aorist passive participle of κωλυω, to hinder, can only express simultaneous or antecedent action, not subsequent action as Ramsay argues."

3. "The only natural meaning of κωλυθεντες is that Paul with Silas and Timothy 'passed through the region of Phrygia and Galatia' because they were hindered by the Holy Spirit from speaking the word in Asia."

### John Gill:
1. "This country had its name either from the river Phryx, as Pliny observes, or from the word Phrygios, which signifies 'dry'; this being a very dry and sandy country." 
2. "The inhabitants of Galatia were originally Gauls, who invaded Italy, came to Rome, and settled in this part of Asia, which was first called Gallo Graecia, and in process of time Galatia." 
3. "The reasons why it was prohibited to preach the word in Asia at this time cannot be said, and must be referred to the sovereign will of God."

### John Wesley:
1. "Being forbid by the Spirit (probably by an inward dictate) to speak as yet in the proconsular Asia" - This suggests that the Apostle Paul was guided by the Holy Spirit in his missionary journeys, being directed where to go and when to speak. 

2. "The time for it not being come" - This implies that there is a divine timing for everything, and that Paul had to wait for the right moment to bring the message of the Gospel to the proconsular Asia. 

3. "Having gone through Phrygia...and spoken there what was sufficient, as well as in the region of Galatia" - This highlights Paul's dedication and diligence in spreading the message of Christ, ensuring that he covered the necessary areas and shared the Gospel to the best of his ability.
