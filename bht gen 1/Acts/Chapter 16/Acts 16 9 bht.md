# Acts 16:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This vision, similar to one seen by Peter before, was not a dream but a supernatural encounter. It signifies the deep need and unconscious readiness of the Macedonian people to receive the Gospel. The cry for help from the Macedonians echoes in heathendom, urging the Christian Church to world missions. The will of God is made known through various means, and openings for the spread of the gospel can be found in all lands.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The vision seems to have appeared in the same way as that sent to Peter in ch. 10. It was an unreal apparition, designed to convey a practical meaning."
2. "The context precludes our understanding it as a dream."
3. "Μακεδών known probably by the affecting words spoken by him. There would hardly be any peculiarity of dress by which a Macedonian could be recognized."

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "This visional Macedonian discovered himself by what he said. But it was a cry not of conscious desire for the Gospel, but of deep need of it and unconscious preparedness to receive it."
2. "God had left the Gentile peoples to walk in their own ways. They had sought to gain salvation for themselves; but those who had carried it farthest along the paths of natural development were now pervaded by the feeling that all had indeed been vanity."
3. "This voice cries from heathendom still to the Christian Church, and never does the Church undertake the work of missions, nor any missionary go forth from it, in the right spirit, save in obedience to this cry."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The will of God was at different times made known in both these ways." 
2. "Their conduct was thus an example to the church." 
3. "Openings of a similar character for the introduction of the gospel are presented in all lands."

### John Calvin:
1. "The Lord did not always observe the same manner of revelation, because divers kinds are more convenient for confirmation."
2. "The gospel is the power of God to salvation...those which are the ministers of God are said to help those who perish."
3. "All people unto whom the gospel is brought are taught reverently to embrace the ministers thereof as deliverers, unless they will maliciously reject the grace of God."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Paul's frequent visions always came at real crises in his life."
2. "Some hold that Luke lived at Antioch in Syria and came on with Paul and Silas, others that he joined them later in Galatia, others that he appeared now either as Paul's physician or new convert."
3. "But, whatever is true about Luke, the narrative must not be robbed of its supernatural aspect."

### John Gill:
1. "Macedonia was a very large country in Europe; which formerly consisted, as Pliny says, of a hundred and fifty people, or nations, and was called Emathia."
2. "Troas, where the apostle now was, when he had this vision, was just by the Hellespont, over which he must go to Macedonia."
3. "This shows what a miserable condition this country was in; and that God had some chosen people among them to gather in, whose time was now come."

### John Wesley:
1. "A vision appeared to Paul by night — It was not a dream, though it was by night."
2. "No other dream is mentioned in the New Testament than that of Joseph and of Pilate's wife."
3. "Help us — Against Satan, ignorance, and sin."
