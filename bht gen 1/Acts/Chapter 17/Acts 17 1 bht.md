# Acts 17:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this passage, we encounter the journey of Paul and Silas as they traveled through various cities in Macedonia. They passed through Amphipolis, a crucial position at the end of Lake Cercinitis, commanding the only easy pass from the coast into Macedonia. Continuing on the renowned Egnatian Way, they arrived in Thessalonica, the principal city of Macedonia, inhabited by Greeks, Romans, and Jews, and a significant center for commerce. While they briefly journeyed through Amphipolis and Thessalonica, it is in Thessalonica where they established a church, to which Paul later addressed his epistles.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Here (or rather perhaps at ἐξῆλθον, in the preceding verse) we have the first person again dropped, implying apparently that the narrator did not accompany Paul and Silas." 
2. "The ὁδός, on which they travelled from Philippi to Thessalonica, was the Via Egnatia, the Macedoman continuation of the Via Appia, and so named from Egnatia." 
3. "Ἀμφίπολιν, lying in a most important position, at the end of the lake Cercinitis, formed by the Strymon, commanding the only easy pass from the coast of the Strymonic gulf into Macedonia."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "We see at once how appropriate a place it was for one of the starting-points of the Gospel in Europe, and can appreciate the force of what Paul said to the Thessalonians within a few months of his departure from them: 'From you, the word of the Lord sounded forth like a trumpet, not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but in every place.'" 
2. "Where was a synagogue of the Jews—implying that (as at Philippi) there was none at Amphipolis and Apollonia."
3. "Thessalonica—the principal and most populous city in Macedonia."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The position of Amphipolis is one of the most important in Greece. It stands in a pass which traverses the mountains bordering the Strymonic Gulf, and it commands the only easy communication from the coast of that gulf into the great Macedonian plains." 
2. "Thessalonica...was made the capital of the second division of Macedonia...It was inhabited by Greeks, Romans, and Jews. It is now called Saloniki, and, from its situation, must always be a place of commercial importance."
3. "In this place a church was collected, to which Paul afterward addressed the two epistles to the Thessalonians."

### John Calvin:
1. "This so invincible fortitude of mind, and such patient enduring of the cross, do sufficiently declare, that Paul labored not after the manner of men, but that he was furnished with the heavenly power of the Spirit."
2. "But because he knew that Christ was given to the Jews for salvation, and that he himself was made an apostle upon this condition, that he should preach repentance and faith, first to the Jews and then to the Gentiles, committing the success of his labor to the Lord, he obeyeth his commandment."
3. "And toward the nation itself Paul ceaseth not to do his embassage; by which example we are taught, that we ought to make so great account of the calling of God, that no unthankfulness of men may be able to hinder us, but that we proceed to be careful for their salvation, so long as the Lord appointeth us to be their ministers."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Amphipolis was an important military station in the days of Paul; its former name was ‘The Nine Ways,’ from the number of roads which met at this point." 
2. "Thessalonica is thirty-seven miles from Apollonia. From very early times this city was famed as a commercial centre." 
3. "Before the building of Constantinople, it was really the capital of Greece and Illyricum, and even now Saloniki is the second city of European Turkey."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "They took the Egnatian Way, one of the great Roman roads from Byzantium to Dyrrachium." 
2. "Paul and Silas may have spent only a night here or longer." 
3. "It was a strategic centre for the spread of the gospel as Paul later said for it sounded (echoed) forth from Thessalonica throughout Macedonia and Achaia."

### John Gill:
1. "The apostle only passed through this place; it does not appear that he at all preached in it, or at any other time." 
2. "Here also the apostle did not stay to preach the Gospel, nor is there any mention made of it elsewhere in the Acts of the Apostles." 
3. "It seems as if there was none, neither in Philippi, nor in Amphipolis, nor in Apollonia."
