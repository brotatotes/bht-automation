# Acts 17:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Sent away from Berea towards the sea, Paul, accompanied by Silas and Timothy, departed hastily to secure his safety from the hostile Jews who sought to harm him. Though his stay in Berea was cut short, he had already planted the seeds of the gospel, which Timothy and Silas would continue to nurture. With the direction of God's providence, Paul embarked on a journey, leaving behind the fervent believers in Berea, who remained steadfast in their commitment to the faith.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "ὡς ἐπὶ τ. θ." is believed to simply indicate the direction in which the Berœan brethren sent him forth, implying that all that was known at Berœa of his intended route was that it was in the direction of the sea.
2. The use of ὡς before participles and prepositions does not always have a subjective reference, as it can also indicate a thought or direction without a specific reference to what one has in mind.
3. The expression "ὡς ἐπὶ θάλασσαν" is found in other ancient texts, such as Pausanias and Diodorus Siculus, with the same meaning of going towards the sea.

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "How long he stayed at Berea we know not; but as we know that he longed and expected soon to return to the Thessalonians, it is probable he remained some weeks at least."
2. "Probably he delayed fixing his next destination till he should reach the coast, and the providence of God should guide him to a vessel bound for the destined spot."
3. "Silas and Timotheus abode there still—to build it up in its holy faith, to be a comfort and support in its trials and persecutions, and to give it such organization as might be necessary."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Sent away Paul - In order to secure his safety."
2. "The tumult was great; and there was no doubt, such was the hostility of the Jews, that the life of Paul would be endangered."
3. "They took him to the seacoast, not far from Berea, and from that place he probably went by sea to Athens."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The accurate translation of the Greek ω ̔ ς ε ̓ πι ̀ κ . τ . λ is simply ‘as far as to the sea;’ the English Version would seem to suggest a feint on the part of Paul and his friends." 
2. "Silas appears up to this time never to have left his great fellow-missionary, but Timothy was left behind at Philippi."
3. "It has been suggested that Timothy joined Paul again at Thessalonica, bringing with him the contributions and help from the Philippian Christians."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "They acted swiftly as in Thessalonica." 
2. "Paul was grieved to cut short his work in Macedonia, probably not over six months in all, which had been so fruitful in Philippi, Thessalonica, and Beroea."
3. "Silas and Timothy in Beroea would also serve to screen his flight for the Jews wanted his blood, not theirs."

### John Gill:
1. "The brethren at Berea sent away Paul, whom they knew the Jews mostly sought after, and were offended with." 
2. "This seems to have been done, in order to make the people conclude that he intended to take shipping, and go into some other parts of the world."
3. "Silas and Timotheus abode there still, at Berea, to confirm and strengthen the young converts there made."
