# Acts 17:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, the apostle Paul sends Timothy to the Thessalonians while he remains in Athens, a renowned city of Greece known for its learning, military prowess, and cultural achievements. Despite its former glory, Athens in Paul's time had become a city of memories and magnificent buildings, but was spiritually empty. Paul eagerly awaits Timothy's arrival in Athens, desiring his company and aid in addressing the new and great sphere of this once-distinguished city.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The course of Timotheus appears to have been, as far as we can follow it from the slight notices given, as follows: when Paul departed from Berœa, not having been able to revisit Thessalonica as he wished (1Th 2:18), he sent Timotheus (from Berœa, not from Athens) to exhort and confirm the Thessalonians, and determined to be left at Athens alone (1Th 3:1), Silas meanwhile remaining to carry on the work at Berœa."
2. "Paul, on his arrival at Athens, sends (by his conductors, who returned) this message to both, to come to him as soon as possible. They did so, and found him (ch. Act 18:5) at Corinth."
3. "Ἀθηνῶν] See a long and interesting description of the then state of Athens, its buildings, &c., in C. and H. chap. 10 vol. i. pp. 407 ff.; and Lewin, i. pp. 268 ff. It was a free city."

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "He probably wished their company and aid in addressing himself to so new and great a sphere as Athens."
2. "He 'waited for them' there, as if unwilling to do anything till they came."
3. "He had indeed sent for him to Athens; but, probably, when it appeared that little fruit was to be reaped there, while Thessalonica was in too interesting a state to be left uncherished, he seems to have thought it better to send him back again."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Athens was the most celebrated city of Greece, and was distinguished for the military talents, the learning, the eloquence, and the politeness of its inhabitants."
2. "No city of Greece, or of the ancient world, was so much distinguished for philosophy, learning, and the arts."
3. "In the revolutions of ages it has been ordered that people should bear the torch of learning to Athens from a land unknown to its ancient philosophers, and convey the blessings of civilization to them by that gospel which in the time of Paul they rejected and despised."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Athens, in the days of Paul, preserved nothing but her undying memories and the stately buildings almost, it would seem, imperishable which she had erected in the days of her splendour."
2. "In this quiet still city of memories, wherever he turned he beheld statues of deified heroes, and temples, and sanctuaries of gods."
3. "Never, in the long and eventful story of the City of the Violet Crown, as Aristophanes termed it, was Athens so empty of all life as it was at that particular juncture."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "To Athens (εως Αθηνων). To make sure of his safe arrival."
2. "That they should come to him with all speed (ινα ως ταχιστα ελθωσιν προς αυτον). Note the neat Greek idiom ως ταχιστα as quickly as possible (good Attic idiom)."
3. "Departed (εξηιεσαν). Imperfect active of εξειμ, old Greek word, but rare in N.T. All in Acts (Acts 13:42; Acts 17:15; Acts 20:7; Acts 27:43)."

### John Gill:
1. "Athens, a city in Achaia, dedicated to the studies of philosophy, which though but one, is always used to be called in the plural number; its haven, called the Piraeum, is described as fortified with seven walls." 
2. "The city itself stood about two miles from the sea; it had its name either from the Greek word ηθονοη, which signifies the mind of God, as boasting of its divine knowledge; or rather from the word אתין, 'Athen', which may be interpreted 'strangers', it being originally inhabited by the Pelasgi, who were a set of people that moved from place to place." 
3. "This city has gone through different fates: it was burnt by Xerxes, about 480 years before Christ; some years after that it was taken by Lysander; and after that restored to its ancient liberty by Demetrius; after this the Romans were possessed of it; and now it is in the hands of the Turks, and goes by the name of Setines."
