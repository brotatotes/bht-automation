# Acts 17:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the bustling city of Athens, the apostle Paul found himself amidst a multitude of statues and temples, an overwhelming display of man's devotion to false gods. His spirit was profoundly stirred, filled with a mix of grief, exasperation, and zeal. The city teemed with idols, making it easier to find a god than a man. Yet, driven by his unwavering commitment to God's glory, Paul boldly ventured forward, seizing opportunities and spreading the message of Christ, even in unexpected places like Athens, where he had not initially intended to preach.

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The first impression which the masterpieces of man's taste for art left on the mind of St. Paul was a revolting one, since all this majesty and beauty had placed itself between man and his Creator, and bound him the faster to his gods, who were not God."
2. "Upon the first contact, therefore, which the Spirit of Christ came into with the sublimest creations of human art, the judgment of the Holy Ghost—through which they have all to pass—is set up as 'the strait gate,' and this must remain the correct standard for ever."
3. "The city [Athens] was 'covered with idols,' making it easier to find a god than a man. This stirred the spirit of the apostle."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "His spirit was stirred in him - His mind was greatly excited."

2. "Of this number the great majority were statues of gods, demi-gods, or heroes."
3. "Every street, every square, nay, every purlieu, had its sanctuaries, and a Roman poet bitterly remarked that it was easier in Athens to find gods than men."

### John Calvin:
1. "The city of Athens...did exceed all others in blindness and madness...the men of Athens, being drunk with their own pride, did err more filthily than the rest."
2. "Paul was wroth when he saw the name of God wickedly profaned, and his pure worship corrupted...nothing was to him more precious than the glory of God."
3. "He was not so grieved, that being cast down through despair, he was quite discouraged...he is pricked forward with a more sharp prick to maintain godliness."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The whole aspect of Athens was strangely repugnant to Paul...here idolatry was closely bound up with all the pleasures and the occupations of the citizen, was linked indissolubly with those memories of the past of which the people of Athens were so proud."

2. "Ah belles et chastes images, vrais dieux et vraies Déesses, tremblez, voici celui qui lèvera contre vous le Marteau. Le mot fatal est prononcé, vous êtes des idoles, l’erreur de ce laid petit Juif sera votre arrêt de mort." (Translation: "Ah beautiful and chaste images, true gods and true Goddesses, tremble, here comes the one who will raise the Hammer against you. The fatal word is spoken, you are idols, the error of this ugly little Jew will be your death sentence.")

3. "The Greek word rendered 'wholly given up to idolatry' (κατει ́δωλον) only occurs in this passage, but is formed after the analogy of other similar compounded words, such as κατάδενδρος, a place full of trees so as to be overgrown by them; κατύμπελος, a place full of vines. The word here would be translated more accurately, 'full of idols.'"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Paul, like any stranger was looking at the sights as he walked around. This adjective κατειδωλον (perfective use of κατα and ειδωλον is found nowhere else, but it is formed after the analogy of καταμπελοσ, καταδενδρον), full of idols."
2. "These statues were beautiful, but Paul was not deceived by the mere art for art's sake. The idolatry and sensualism of it all glared at him (Romans 1:18-32)."
3. "The superstition of this centre of Greek culture was depressing to Paul. One has only to recall how superstitious cults today flourish in the atmosphere of Boston and Los Angeles to understand conditions in Athens."

### John Gill:
1. "His spirit was stirred in him; not only his soul was troubled and his heart was grieved, but he was exasperated and provoked to the last degree." 
2. "He had a burning fire in his bones, and was weary with forbearing, and could not stay; his zeal wanted vent, and he gave it."
3. "They had so many [idols], that one jestingly said to them, our country is so full of deities, that one may more easily find a god than a man."
