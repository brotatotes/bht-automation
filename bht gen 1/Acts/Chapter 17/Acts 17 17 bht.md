# Acts 17:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the apostle Paul finds himself in Athens, a city consumed by idolatry. He embarks on his customary routine by first addressing the Jews in the synagogue, engaging in discussions about the Son of God and proving that Jesus is the Messiah. However, he doesn't stop there. Paul continues his mission in the market, where he converses with the Gentiles who are interested in learning about the teachings of the God of Israel. Despite the overwhelming idolatry, Paul's spirit is stirred, and he diligently shares the Gospel with all who crossed his path in Athens.
