## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The summum bonum of the real Epicureans, far from being a degraded and sensual pleasure, was ἀταοαξία of mind, based upon φρόνησις, perhaps the best estimate of the highest good formed in the heathen world." 
2. "By these tenets they would obviously be placed in antagonism to the doctrines of a Saviour of the world and the resurrection, and to placing the summum bonum of man in abundance of that grace which ἐν ἀσθενείᾳ τελεῖται." 
3. "δαιμόνια is not plural for singular, as Kuin.: nor merely, though this is somewhat more probable, marks the category, as Meyer: nor can it refer (Chrys., Theophyl., Œcum., Hammond, Heinrichs) to Jesus and the ἀνάστασις, mistaken for a goddess: but alludes to the true God, the God of the Jews, and Jesus Christ His Son."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The two enemies it has ever had to contend with are the two ruling principles of the Epicureans and Stoics—Pleasure and Pride."
2. "What will this babbler say?—The word, which means 'a picker-up of seeds,' bird-like, is applied to a gatherer and retailer of scraps of knowledge, a prater; a general term of contempt for any pretended teacher."
3. "Because he preached Jesus and the resurrection—Not as if they thought he made these to be two divinities: the strange gods were Jehovah and the Risen Saviour, ordained to judge the world."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Athens was distinguished, among all the cities of Greece and the world, for the cultivation of a subtle and refined philosophy."
2. "The Epicureans...devoted themselves to a life of gaiety and sensuality, and sought happiness only in indolence, effeminacy, and voluptuousness."
3. "The Stoics...prided themselves on their own righteousness...They supposed that matter was eternal, and that God was either the animating principle or soul of the world, or that all things were a part of God."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Epicureans...acknowledged God in words, but denied his providence and superintendence over the world."
2. "Stoics...denied the universal and perpetual immortality of the soul."
3. "Babbler [σπερμολογος]...one who picks up and retails scraps of news."

These quotes highlight the beliefs and characteristics of the Epicureans, Stoics, and the term "babbler," providing insight into the different philosophical and cultural contexts surrounding the verse.

### John Calvin:
1. "For it is not always in our choice to make choice of those with whom we will deal; but the Lord doth often suffer stubborn and importunate men to arise to exercise us, that by their gainsaying the truth may more plainly appear."
2. "And thus must we do, that by refuting meekly and modestly vain cavillings, we may utter that which is sound and true; and we must always avoid this danger, that ambition or desire to show our wit do not unwrap us in superfluous and vain contentions."
3. "Therefore there was in Paul wonderful force of the Spirit, who standing amidst such beasts, which sought to pull him to and fro, stood firm in the sound sincerity of the gospel, and did valiantly withstand and endure, as well the dogged malapertness [petulance] of the former sect, as the pride and crafty cavillings of the other."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The Epicurean, while admitting the existence of gods, regarded them as paying no attention to men and the affairs of this world. They believed in no Providence, in no accountability, in neither reward nor retribution in the life to come. They were virtually Atheists." 
2. "The Stoics condemned the worship of images and the use of temples, but they in some degree accepted popular mythology by considering the various gods as developments of the universal world-God. These were then Pantheists. They denied any overruling Providence, or, in fact, any interference on the part of Deity in the affairs of the world." 
3. "The ideal life, however, proposed to the disciples of Zeno was a far higher one than the Epicurean ideal, a proud self-denial, an austere apathy ( άταραξία ), untouched by human passion, unmoved alike by joy or sorrow, was aimed at by the true Stoic."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Both sects were eager for argument and both had disdain for Paul, but they were the two rival practical philosophies of the day, succeeding the more abstruse theories of Plato and Aristotle."
2. "In Epicureanism, it was man's sensual nature which arrayed itself against the claims of the gospel; in Stoicism it was his self-righteousness and pride of intellect."
3. "Paul had the only true philosophy of the universe and life with Jesus Christ as the centre, the greatest of all philosophers."

### John Gill:
1. "The principal tenets of which were, that the world was not made by any deity, or with any design, but came into its being and form, through a fortuitous concourse of atoms, of various sizes and magnitude, which met, and jumbled, and cemented together, and so formed the world; and that the world is not governed by the providence of God."
2. "Their chief tenets were, that there is but one God, and that the world was made by him, and is governed by fate that happiness lies in virtue, and virtue has its own reward in itself; that all virtues are linked together, and all vices are equal; that a wise and good man is destitute of all passion, and uneasiness of mind, is always the same, and always joyful, and ever happy in the greatest torture, pain being no real evil; that the soul lives after the body, and that the world will be destroyed by fire."
3. "The reason why they thought the apostle was for bringing in other gods, than which nothing was more foreign from him, was because he preached unto them Jesus, and the resurrection."

### John Wesley:
1. "The apostle levels his discourse at some of the most important errors of each, while, without expressly attacking either, he gives a plain summary of his own religious principles."
2. "Such is the language of natural reason, full of, and satisfied with itself. Yet even here St. Paul had some fruit; though nowhere less than at Athens."
3. "And as stupid as this mistake was, it is the less to be wondered at, since the Athenians might as well count the resurrection a deity, as shame, famine, and many others."
