# Acts 17:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the midst of a diverse assembly filled with judges, philosophers, and religious individuals, Paul confidently stood his ground. Instead of denouncing his listeners, he carefully addressed their religious devotion and propensity for reverence. With wisdom and eloquence, he embarked on a discourse that spanned from natural divinity to the mysteries of the future. It was a momentous occasion, where Paul fearlessly proclaimed the Gospel to the dying religion of the past in the face of intellectual skeptics and cultural traditions.

2. "It was given to the Apostle in this hour, what he should speak; this is plainly to be seen in the following discourse, which we might weary ourselves with praising and admiring in various ways; but far better than all so-called praise from our poor tongues is the humble recognition, that the Holy Ghost, the spirit of Jesus, has here spoken by the Apostle, and therefore it is that we have in his discourse a masterpiece of apostolic wisdom." - Stier, Reden der Apostel, ii. 131
