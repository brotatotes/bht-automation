# Acts 17:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In Athens, there was an altar dedicated to an unknown god, which served as evidence of the Athenians' lack of true understanding of religion. This altar was erected out of fear of overlooking any gods and was seen as an act of devotion to the one true God by some. The apostle Paul used this altar as a starting point to proclaim the true nature of the living God, who had been unknown to the idolatrous Gentiles, and to guide the Athenians towards a deeper understanding of divine revelation.
