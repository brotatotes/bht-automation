In this verse, we are reminded of our constant and vital dependence on God. Through various commentators, we learn that God is not only the source of our life, but he sustains our every movement and is intricately involved in every aspect of our existence.

Paul used familiar references to establish common ground and emphasize the truth that we are indeed the offspring of God.
