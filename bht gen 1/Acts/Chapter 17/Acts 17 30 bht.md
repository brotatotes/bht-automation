# Acts 17:30 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we are reminded of the times when people were ignorant of the true God, worshiping idols and sinking into degradation. God, in His forbearance, overlooked this ignorance without punishing it, allowing them to follow their own ways. However, with the coming of Jesus Christ, the time of God's silence and overlooking has ended. Now, God commands all people to repent and turn to Him, proclaiming a message of redemption and the need for a change of heart and mind.

Note: The commentary is quite lengthy, so I had to condense it significantly to fit within the word limit.

1. "He despised this, and them for it, and was displeased and angry with them; and as an evidence of such contempt and indignation, he overlooked them, and took no notice of them, and gave them no revelation to direct them, nor prophets to instruct them, and left them to their stupidity and ignorance."
2. "He hath given orders, that the doctrine of repentance, as well as remission of sins, should be preached to all nations, to Gentiles as well as Jews; and that it becomes them to repent of their idolatries, and turn from their idols, and worship the one, only, living and true God."

3. "Now he commandeth all men every where to repent - There is a dignity and grandeur in this expression, becoming an ambassador from the King of heaven."
