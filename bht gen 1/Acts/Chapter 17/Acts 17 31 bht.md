It is described as a solemn judicial assize, held upon the whole world and conducted by Jesus Christ, whom God has ordained as the Judge. The day of judgment, appointed by God, serves as a reminder for repentance and the need for conviction in the face of the evidence provided by Jesus' resurrection. This judgment is regarded as a fulfillment of God's eternal purposes, according to the strict rules of justice and equity.
