# Acts 17:32 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the face of diverse reactions, Paul spoke of a doctrine that philosophers ridiculed and rejected - the resurrection. Some mocked and interrupted, while others were open to further discussion or unsure of how to respond. Those who mocked were offended by the central motive of faith, driven by a pride of reason, leading them to reject not only the specific doctrine but the entirety of the message. Amidst these different responses, Paul's presentation revealed prudence, wisdom, and a recognition of points of agreement, as he sought to navigate the challenges of conveying new ideas to a diverse audience.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "When they heard of a resurrection of dead men, they inferred the general possibility of the resurrection of the dead, as a tenet of Paul's, from the one case which he mentioned."
2. "We must not allot these two parties as some have done, the former to the Epicureans, the latter to the Stoics: the description is general."
3. "The hearing not having taken place is no proof that it was not intended at the time: and the distinction between these and the mockers seems to imply that they were in earnest."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The Resurrection, which presupposes the vanity of the present life, and is nothing but life out of the death of all that sin has blighted, could have no charm for the true Greek."
2. "It gave the death blow to his fundamental and most cherished ideas; nor until these were seen to be false and fatal could the Resurrection, and the Gospel of which it was a primary doctrine, seem otherwise than ridiculous."
3. "They probably, like Felix, feared to hear more, lest they should be constrained to believe unwelcome truths."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It has nor been uncommon for even professed philosophers to mock at the doctrines of religion, and to meet the arguments of Christianity with a sneer."
2. "The Epicureans particularly would be likely to deride this, as they denied altogether any future state."
3. "People who defer inquiry on the subject of religion seldom find the favorable period arrive. Those who propose to examine its doctrines at a future time often do it to avoid the inconvenience of becoming Christians now, and as a plausible and easy way of rejecting the gospel altogether."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "His prudence and tact in not needlessly offending his hearers."
2. "His wisdom and readiness in the use of the inscription 'to the unknown God,' and in citing their own poets."
3. "His meeting the radical errors of every class of his hearers, while seeming to dwell only on points of agreement."

### John Calvin:
1. "We have said that this is a most sharp prick, wherewith men’s minds are pricked forward to fear God, when his judgment is set before their eyes."
2. "Though the wicked do laugh and mock, yet this doctrine, which they go about to make of none effect, shall so gird them, that they shall at length perceive that they have striven in vain with their snare."
3. "And no marvel if this point of Paul’s doctrine were derided at Athens; for it is a mystery hid from men’s minds, whereon the chiefest philosophers did never think, neither can we otherwise comprehend it, than when we lift up the eyes of faith unto the infinite power of God."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Some mocked, and others said, We will hear thee again of this matter." - This verse highlights the different reactions to Paul's teaching on the resurrection of the dead. While some mocked, others were open to further discussion and wanted to hear more about it. It shows the diversity of responses to the message of the Gospel.

2. "The Areo-pagites seem to have been divided, some openly mocking Paul and his doctrines; some in doubt seemingly wishing to hear him again." - This quote emphasizes the division among the Areopagites, with some openly mocking Paul's teachings while others were unsure and wanted to give it further consideration.

2. "In contempt at Paul's statement they declined to listen further to 'this babbler' who had now lost what he had gained with this group of hearers."
3. "It is a sad story--the noblest of ancient cities and the noblest man of history--and he never cared to look on it again."

### John Gill:
1. "The doctrine of the resurrection was denied by every sect of the philosophers: it is a doctrine of pure revelation, and what the light of nature never taught men, and by which men being only guided, have declared against, and have treated it with the utmost ridicule and contempt."
2. "Pliny reckons it, among childish fancies, and calls it vanity, and downright madness to believe it; as does also Caecilius in Minutius Felix, and who even calls it a lie, and places it among old wives' fables; and Celsus in Origen represents it as exceeding detestable, abominable, and impossible."
3. "However, these thought there might be something in what the apostle said; they could not receive it readily, and yet could not deny it; they were willing to take time to consider of it; and were desirous of hearing him again upon that subject."

### John Wesley:
