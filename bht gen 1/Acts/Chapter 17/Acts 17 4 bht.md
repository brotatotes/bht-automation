# Acts 17:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, certain women in Thessalonica believed in Jesus as the true Messiah and joined Paul and Silas. These women, along with other converts, formed the foundation of a Gospel church. The Thessalonian converts consisted of both Jews and Gentiles, with some being devout Greeks and God-fearing Gentiles. The women's conversion to the Gospel demonstrated their strong faith and the empowering work of the Holy Spirit in overcoming their natural fears and weaknesses. Their inclusion in the early church exemplified the prominent role of women in Macedonia and their ability to hold property and engage in religious affairs.
