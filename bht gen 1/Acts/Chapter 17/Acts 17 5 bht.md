# Acts 17:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, we witness the conflicts and opposition faced by Paul in his mission to establish the kingdom of Christ. The unbelieving Jews, motivated by envy and a misguided zeal, incite a crowd of market-loungers and rabble to create chaos and disruption. Paul's success in converting many sparks jealousy among the Jewish preachers, who gather these idle individuals to create a clamor that disturbs the peace and inhabitants. However, amidst the persecutions and uproar, Paul perseveres, setting an example for all servants of Christ that despite the conflicts they may encounter, their labor will bear fruit.
