## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The inscription found on an arch at Thessalonica confirms the accuracy of our narrative, as it uses the same title 'πολιτάρχας' to refer to the Thessalonian magistrates." 
2. "Interestingly, three of the names mentioned in the inscription or in the Epistles are companions of Paul: Sosipater, Secundus, and Gaius." 
3. "The words 'τὴν οἰκ  .   ἀναστ  .' suggest that there was already some knowledge or rumor about Christianity and its spread among the inhabitants of Thessalonica."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The accuracy of this history is demonstrated by the specific mention of the magistrates of Thessalonica as 'the politarchs,' a name found on an arch in the city."
2. "The phrase 'turned the world upside down' highlights the impact and influence of the early Christians, who were seen as disruptors of the established order."
3. "This verse reminds us of the transformative power of the Gospel, which has the ability to challenge and reshape societal norms."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "These that have turned the world upside down" - This phrase highlights the transformative power of the gospel, which disrupts the status quo and challenges societal norms.
2. "That have excited commotion and disturbance in other places" - The gospel's message of love and truth can provoke opposition and resistance, as it challenges deeply ingrained beliefs and practices.
3. "The charge has been often brought against the gospel that it has been the occasion of confusion and disorder" - This acknowledges the criticism faced by the gospel, but also suggests that the perceived chaos is a result of resistance to change rather than inherent flaws in the message itself.

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Another illustration of Luke's accuracy."
2. "Thessalonica was not a colony, but a free city."
3. "The word occurs only here and verse 8, and has been found in an inscription on an arch at Thessalonica."

### John Calvin:
1. "Assuredly, the gospel is not preached to this end that it may set men together by the ears; but rather that it may keep them in peace, being reconciled to God."
2. "And the Lord meant by their example to teach us, that we must not give place to slanders and false reports; but we must stand stoutly in maintaining the truth, being ready to hear evil for things done well."
3. "Wherefore, away with the perverse wisdom of some, who, to the end they may escape false slanders, cease [hesitate] not to betray Christ and his gospel through their treacherous moderation, as though their good name were more precious than Paul’s and such like, yea, than the sacred name of God, which is not free from blasphemies."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "A ‘free city’ was self-governed. The provincial governor possessed within its walls and circuit no authority."
2. "No Roman garrison, no Roman ensigns, were seen in the streets."
3. "These strange words, Alford remarks, presuppose some rumour of Christianity and its spread having before reached the inhabitants of Thessalonica."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "They dragged (εσυρον). Imperfect active, vivid picture, they were dragging (literally)."
2. "This title for city officers in Thessalonica, a free city, is correct. They were burgomasters or 'rulers of the city.'"
3. "The use of οικουμενην (supply γεν or χωραν, the inhabited earth, present passive participle of οικεω) means the Roman Empire, since it is a political charge, a natural hyperbole in their excitement."

Note: The commentary provided is quite lengthy and does not contain any particularly insightful or enriching quotes.

### John Gill:
1. "The apostles, according to the cry of these men, had thrown the whole world into disorder, and had made disturbances in kingdoms and cities, wherever they came."
2. "They had made innovations in religion, and turned men from their old way of worship to another."
3. "These; say they, are come hither also; to make the like disorders and disturbances, as elsewhere."
