# Acts 17:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse under consideration involves the authorities taking security from the believers, which can be understood as a guarantee of their good behavior. The use of this practice suggests a concern for maintaining public order, and the requirement of a money pledge underscores the seriousness of the situation. The purpose of this security was to ensure that the believers would not disrupt the peace and that they would comply with the decrees of the authorities. With the security taken, the authorities allowed them to continue their daily lives without further punishment.
