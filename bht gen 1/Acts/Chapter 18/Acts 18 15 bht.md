# Acts 18:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, the apostle Paul stands before Gallio, a Roman proconsul. The exchange revolves around disputes over words, names, and the Jewish law. Paul acknowledges the limitations of Gallio's role as a judge, focusing instead on the spiritual aspects of the Gospel and prioritizing matters of faith over legalistic disputes. Gallio perceives the matter as a trivial dispute, unrelated to Roman law or his jurisdiction. The conversation highlights the contrast between the deep significance of the Gospel message and the superficial nature of the disputes being brought before the Roman court.
