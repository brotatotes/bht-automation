## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The other gloss, οἱ Ἰουδαῖοι, has sprung from the notion that this Sosthenes was the same person with the Sosthenes of 1 Corinthians 1:1, a Christian and a companion of Paul."
2. "The carelessness of Gallio about the matter clearly seems to be a further instance of his contempt for the Jews, and indisposition to favour them or their persecution of Paul."
3. "‘So little did the information against Paul prosper, that the informers themselves were beaten without interference of the judge.’ Meyer."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "It is very improbable that this was the same Sosthenes as the apostle afterwards calls 'his brother'." 
2. "And beat him before the judgment-seat—under the very eye of the judge." 
3. "And Gallio cared for none of those things—nothing loath, perhaps, to see these turbulent Jews, for whom probably he felt contempt, themselves getting what they hoped to inflict on another."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The Greeks would feel no small measure of indignation at these disturbers of the public peace, and they took this opportunity to express their rage." 
2. "It is probable that this Sosthenes afterward became a convert to the Christian faith, and a preacher of the gospel."
3. "All that this passage implies is: (1) That he did not deem it to be his duty, or a part of his office, to settle questions of a theological nature that were started among the Jews."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Cared for none of these things." - This phrase does not imply a lack of interest in religion, but rather a deliberate decision not to intervene in the situation at hand.

2. "Not said to indicate his indifference to religion." - The verse should not be interpreted as a reflection of the individual's apathy towards matters of faith.

3. "Simply that he did not choose to interfere in this case." - The individual's decision to not get involved was specific to this particular circumstance, rather than a general disregard for spiritual matters.

### John Calvin:
1. "It is allotted to all the children of God to have the world set against them, and offended with them and their cause, though unknown."
2. "The frowardness of man's nature is depainted out unto us as in a table."
3. "The Romans could have wished that the remembrance of the true God had been buried."

These quotes highlight the idea that believers will face opposition and persecution, and that human nature tends towards evil. They also emphasize the hostility towards the Jewish religion and the indifference of those in power towards injustice.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The Greeks was a later interpolation."
2. "There is little doubt that 'all' refers here to the Gentile or Greek populace."
3. "The utter indifference of these great Roman officials to all religion is well painted in these few words."

### Archibald T. Robertson:

2. "The beating did Sosthenes good for he too finally is a Christian."
3. "Gallio looked the other way with a blind eye while Sosthenes got the beating which he richly deserved."

### John Gill:
1. "These were not the Greeks or Gentiles that were devout persons, or converted to Christianity, and were on the side of Paul, and fell foul on Sosthenes, as being his chief accuser; for this is not agreeably to the spirit and character of such persons."
2. "Gallio cared for none of these things; which might not be owing to any sluggishness in him, but to an ill opinion he had of the Jews, as being a turbulent and uneasy people."
3. "It did not become him, as a magistrate, to act such a part, whose business it was to keep the public peace, to quell disorders, to protect men's persons, and property, and prevent abuse and mischief, and to correct and punish for it."

### John Wesley:
1. "Then they all took Sosthenes...and beat him" - This incident reveals the frustration and anger of the crowd towards Sosthenes, who had caused them trouble before the judgment seat. It highlights the intense emotions and the potential for violence in the midst of religious and legal disputes.

2. "One can hardly think in the sight of Gallio, though at no great distance from him" - The mention of Gallio, the Roman proconsul, suggests that this violent act took place in close proximity to the seat of power. It underscores the boldness and audacity of the crowd, willing to take matters into their own hands even in the presence of authority.

3. "For Sosthenes himself was afterward a Christian" - This surprising twist reveals the transformative power of the Christian faith. Despite being the target of violence, Sosthenes later became a follower of Christ. It demonstrates the potential for redemption and conversion, even in those who were once adversaries.
