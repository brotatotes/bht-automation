# Acts 18:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we see Paul's dedication and faithfulness as he takes his leave from the brethren in Corinth. Despite facing trials and uncertainties, Paul remains steadfast in his commitment to God's promise. He shaves his head as part of a vow, a custom observed during that time. The setting is in Cenchrea, a seaport town near Corinth, where Paul embarked on his next journey after spending considerable time strengthening the believers in Corinth.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "For, although this vow differed from that of the Nazarite, who shaved his hair at the end of his votive period, in the temple at Jerusalem, and burnt it with his peace-offering, Josephus gives us a description of a somewhat similar one." 
2. "That he should do so apologetically, to shew that the Apostle still countenanced conformity with the law, is a view which I cannot find justified by any features of this book."
3. "There need be no enquiry what danger can have prompted such a vow on his part, when we recollect the catalogue given by him in 2 Corinthians 11:0."

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "During his long residence at Corinth, Paul planted other churches in Achaia."
2. "In this order the names also occur in 2 Corinthians 1:1, which seem to imply that the wife was the more prominent and helpful to the Church."
3. "It was probably one made in one of his seasons of difficulty or danger, in prosecution of which he cuts off his hair and hastens to Jerusalem to offer the requisite sacrifice within the prescribed thirty days."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "A 'vow' is a solemn promise made to God respecting anything. The use of vows is observable throughout the Scripture."
2. "The most remarkable vow among the Jews was that of the Nazarite, by which a man made a solemn promise to God to abstain from wine, and from all intoxicating liquors, to let the hair grow, not to enter any house polluted by having a dead body in it, or to attend any funeral."
3. "There is reason to think that it was mainly with a design to convince the Jews that he did not despise their law, and was not its enemy. In accordance with the custom of the nation, and in compliance with a law which was not wrong in itself, he might have made this vow, not for a time-serving purpose, but in order to conciliate them, and to mitigate their anger against the gospel."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Took his leave [αποταζαμενος]. See on Luke 9:61; Mark 6:46."
2. "Priscilla and Aquila. They are named in the same order, Romans 16:3; 2 Timothy 4:19."
3. "Having shorn his head. Referring to Paul, and not to Aquila. He had a vow."

### John Calvin:
1. "Paul’s constancy appeareth in this, in that he is not driven away with fear, lest he should trouble the disciples, who were as yet ignorant and weak, with his sudden and untimely departure."
2. "He did shear his head for no other cause, save only that he might apply himself to the Jews, who were as yet ignorant, and not thoroughly taught."
3. "Hence we may easily gather that which I said before, that he had some great cause to go up to Jerusalem in haste."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "During this period, after the Proconsul Gallio’s dismissal of the complaint, Paul no doubt worked unhindered by his Jewish enemies, and was able to lay the foundations of one of the most flourishing churches of the first days at Corinth."
2. "There is no doubt that it was her influence and powers, not her husband’s, which gave the couple so prominent a position in the early Christian Church."
3. "It involved, of course, a lengthened period of abstinence and special prayer. It has been asked why such an one as St. Paul, by his own example, stamped with approval such an observance, which seems to belong to the old worn-out Jewish customs."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Vindicated as Paul was, there was no reason for haste in leaving, though he usually left after such a crisis was passed."
2. "Took his leave, as in verse Acts 18:21; Mark 6:46."
3. "The participle is masculine and so cannot refer to Priscilla. Aquila comes next to the participle, but since mention of Priscilla and Aquila is parenthetical and the two other participles (προσμεινασ, αποταξαμενος) refer to Paul it seems clear that this one does also."

### John Gill:
1. "he not doubting of the promise of God, and of his power and faithfulness to fulfil it, though this was a trial of his faith and constancy"
2. "he takes his leave of them and departs"
3. "the apostle had made a vow that he would shave at Cenchrea"

### John Wesley:
1. "Paul continued many days — After the year and six months, to confirm the brethren."
2. "Aquila having shaved his head — As was the custom in a vow, Acts 21:24; Numbers 6:18."
3. "At Cenchrea — A seaport town, at a small distance from Corinth."
