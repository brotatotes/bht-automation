# Acts 18:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Located in the once-prosperous city of Ephesus, this Bible verse takes us back to a time when commerce and ancient temples brought fame to the region. As Paul arrives, we find him connecting with Priscilla and Aquila, and entering the synagogue where he engages in a series of deep discussions. Paul's presence in Ephesus, forbidden in previous times but now allowed, signifies a significant turning point as he embarks on a mission to spread the word and challenge prevalent beliefs.
