# Acts 18:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we see the couple Aquila and Priscilla, who were forced to leave Rome due to an edict by Emperor Claudius that expelled all Jews, regardless of their religious beliefs. This expulsion was a result of the Jews in Rome opposing and disputing with Christians about Jesus being the Messiah, showing a lack of consideration for religious distinctions. This historical context adds depth to the significance of Aquila and Priscilla's encounter with the apostle Paul, who sought refuge with them during his travels.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "It is remarkable, that Pontius Aquila is a name found in the Pontian gens at Rome more than once in the days of the Republic...whence some have supposed that this may have been a freedman of a Pontius Aquila." 
2. "From the notices of Aquila and Priscilla in the Epistles, they appear to have travelled, fixing their abode by turns in different principal cities, for the sake of their business."
3. "The edict soon became invalid, or the prohibition was taken off: we find Aquila at Rome, Romans 16:3, and many Jews resident there, ch. Acts 28:17 ff."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "From these Latin names one would conclude that they had resided so long in Rome as to lose their Jewish family names."
2. "Whether this couple were converted before Paul made their acquaintance, commentators are much divided."
3. "They appear to have been in good circumstances, and after travelling much, to have eventually settled at Ephesus."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Aquila is mentioned elsewhere as the friend of Paul, Romans 16:3; 2 Timothy 4:19; 1 Corinthians 16:19. Though a Jew by birth, yet it is evident that he became a convert to the Christian faith."
2. "Who this Chrestus was is not known. It might have been a foreign Jew, who raised tumults on some occasion of which we have no knowledge, as the Jews in all pagan cities were greatly prone to excitements and insurrections."
3. "There is every reason to believe that, before this, the Christian religion was preached at Rome. It would produce there, as everywhere else, great tumult and contention among the Jews."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Lately [προσφατως]. It is derived from fenw, to slay, and the adjective means, originally, lately slain; thence, fresh, new, recent." 

2. "Only here in New Testament, though the kindred adjective, rendered new, is found in Hebrews 10:20." 

3. "It is quite common in medical writings in this sense."

### John Calvin:
1. "If we compare the great fruit which ensued immediately upon his preaching with such a base entrance, the power of the Spirit of God shall [more] plainly appear."
2. "Nothing is more miserable than exile, according to the sense of the flesh. But it was far better for Aquila to be Paul’s companion, than to be in the highest office either at Rome or in his country."
3. "The estate of that nation was then very miserable, so that it is a wonder that they did not almost all depart from the worship of God. But this is a greater wonder, that the religion wherein they had been brought up prevailed against Caesar’s tyranny, and that so soon as Christ, the Sun of righteousness, did arise, few were turned unto him."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Paul’s ‘finding these Jews out and consorting with them, affords a strong presumption in favour of their Christianity: only among Christians could the apostle feel himself at home.’"
2. "The friendship between Paul and the two tentmakers, Aquila, and Priscilla his wife, appears to have been very intimate and enduring."
3. "Once (Romans 16:3-4), he tells us, these devoted friends laid down their necks for his (Paul’s) life."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Luke calls him a Jew from Pontus, apparently not yet a disciple, though there were Jews from Pontus at the great Pentecost who were converted." 
2. "Aquila who made the famous A.D. translation of the O.T. was also from Pontus." 
3. "Because Claudius had commanded... This was about A.D. 49, done, Suetonius says (Claudius C. 25), because 'the Jews were in a state of constant tumult at the instigation of one Chrestus' (probably among the Jews about Christ so pronounced)."

### John Gill:
1. "Aquila" is likely a Roman name, possibly derived from the Greek word for acorn. There was a Jewish proselyte named Akilas who translated the Bible into Greek, but he is not the same person as the Aquila mentioned here. (Commentary on Acts 18:2)

2. Aquila and Priscilla were forced to leave Rome because of an edict by Claudius that expelled all Jews. This edict was likely a result of the Jews in Rome opposing and disputing with the Christians about Jesus being the Messiah. (Commentary on Acts 18:2)

3. Aquila and Priscilla were visited by the apostle Paul, who took up lodging with them. (Commentary on Acts 18:2)

2. "All who were Jews by birth" - This phrase emphasizes that the expulsion targeted individuals who were ethnically Jewish, regardless of their religious affiliation. 

3. "Whether they were Jews or Christians by religion, the Romans were too stately to regard" - This quote suggests that the Romans did not differentiate between Jews and Christians in their expulsion, indicating a lack of concern for religious distinctions.
