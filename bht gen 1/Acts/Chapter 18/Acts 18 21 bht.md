# Acts 18:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The speaker in this Bible verse is deeply committed to participating in a religious observance in Jerusalem. The feast being mentioned is significant, and the location of Jerusalem holds great importance. There is a strong desire and obligation to partake in the feast, and the speaker is determined to meet as many fellow believers as possible and to preach the Gospel. This commitment is not due to obligation, but rather an opportunity to spread the message of Christ and overcome prejudice.
