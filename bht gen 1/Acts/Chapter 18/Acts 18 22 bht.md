## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "It would be out of the question to suppose that Paul made the long detour by Cæsarea only to go up into the town from the beach." 
2. "The expression κατέβη εἰς Ἀντ., which suits a journey from Jerusalem, would not apply to one from Cæsarea."
3. "The payment of his vow is not mentioned, partly because it is understood from the mere mention of the vow itself, partly, perhaps, because it was privately done, and with no view to attract notice."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The expression 'going up' is invariably used of a journey to the metropolis; and thence he naturally 'went down to Antioch.'" 

2. "Perhaps the vessel reached too late for the feast, as he seems to have done nothing in Jerusalem beyond 'saluting the Church,' and privately offering the sacrifice with which his vow would conclude."

3. "It is left to be understood, as on his arrival from his first missionary tour, that 'when he was come, and had gathered the church together, he rehearsed all that God had done with him' on this his second missionary journey."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The whole narrative implies that he went there before returning to Antioch."
2. "The word saluted implies that he expressed for them his tender affection and regard."
3. "To Antioch - In Syria."

### John Calvin:
1. "Though Luke saith in a word that Paul saluted the Church at Jerusalem, yet is it certain that he was drawn thither with some great necessity."
2. "Moreover, he declareth that his journey in his return was not idle or barren, in that he saith that he strengthened all the disciples, undoubtedly not without great pains-taking."
3. "They had, indeed, their pastors under whom they might profit. Yet the greater Paul’s authority was, and the more excellent spirit he had given him, so they were not a little strengthened by his by them."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "This Roman capital of Judaea was the usual and most convenient port for travellers journeying to Jerusalem."
2. "'The Church' is, of course, the mother church of Christianity, the congregations of believers in Jerusalem."
3. "Thus terminated his Second Missionary Journey; it had occupied, roughly speaking, three years."

### John Gill:
1. "Caesarea Stratonis, formerly called Strato's tower: it would have been nearest for the apostle to have landed at Joppa, in order to go to Jerusalem, but that haven was a dangerous one; this was the safest."
2. "According to Jerom, or a writer under his name, this was neither Caesarea Philippi, which indeed it could not be, that being an inland town; nor Caesarea formerly called Strato's tower, but a third Caesarea, the metropolis of Cappadocia: in which he must be mistaken, seeing that was no sea port, and the apostle could not be said to land there."
3. "Moreover, the apostle had told the Ephesians, that he must go and keep the feast in Jerusalem, as he undoubtedly did: and yet if this does not refer to his going up thither, it will not be easy to observe that he went thither at all before his return to Ephesus."

### John Wesley:
1. "Saluted the Church - This act of greeting the Church in Jerusalem demonstrates Paul's recognition and respect for the significance of this mother Church of Christian believers."

2. "Being the mother Church of Christian believers - The term 'mother Church' highlights the historical and spiritual importance of Jerusalem as the birthplace of the Christian faith and the center of early Christian community."

3. "Having kept the feast there - Paul's participation in the feast in Jerusalem signifies his commitment to observing Jewish customs and traditions, while also embracing his role as an apostle to the Gentiles."
