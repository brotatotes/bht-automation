# Acts 18:25 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This verse describes a man named Apollos who possessed knowledge about Jesus up to a certain point. He was taught accurately about Jesus and had correct views on the coming Messiah. However, he only knew what John the Baptist had preached, lacking knowledge of the full revelation of the gospel, including Jesus' death and resurrection. Despite this limitation, Apollos fervently taught the things he knew with zeal and accuracy, impacting others with his affectionate and lively ministry.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Apollos had received the true doctrine of the Messiahship of Jesus, as pointed out by John the Baptist."
2. "The mistake of supposing that he did not know Jesus to be the Messiah has arisen from the description of his subsequent work at Corinth."
3. "He knew and taught accurately the facts respecting Jesus, but of the consequences of that which he taught, he had no idea."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "He was instructed, probably, by some disciple of the Baptist, in the whole circle of John's teaching concerning Jesus, but no more: he had yet to learn the new light which the outpouring of the Spirit at Pentecost had thrown upon the Redeemer's death and resurrection."
2. "His heart warm, and conscious, probably, of his gifts and attainments, he burned to impart to others the truth he had himself received."
3. "He spake and taught diligently—rather, 'accurately'."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He had correct views of the Messiah to come - views which he had derived from the study of the Old Testament."
2. "He was just in the state of mind to welcome the announcement that the Messiah had come, and to embrace Jesus of Nazareth as the hope of the nation."
3. "Being fervent in the spirit - Being zealous and ardent."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Fervent, which is formed from the participle of the Latin ferveo, to boil or ferment, is an exact translation of this word, which means to seethe or bubble, and is therefore used figuratively of mental states and emotions."
2. "Diligently [ακριβως] . Rather, accurately; so far as his knowledge went."
3. "The limitation is given by the words following: knowing only the baptism of John."

### John Calvin:
1. "He understood the doctrine of the gospel, because he both knew that the Redeemer was given to the world, and also was well and sincerely instructed concerning the grace of reconciliation."
2. "The true use of the sacraments...is that they enter us in some certain kind of doctrine, or that they establish that faith which we have embraced."
3. "That doctrine shall be unsavory which is not joined with zeal...let knowledge be present that it may govern zeal."

Note: The commentary is from John Calvin's "Commentaries on the Acts of the Apostles."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The grand thought, that the dwellers in the countless isles of the Gentiles, too, were now fellow-heirs of the kingdom, was a thought which never occurred to one trained like Apollos."
2. "But a short intercourse with souls like Priscilla and Aquila, on whom a portion of Paul’s broad generous spirit had fallen, threw a flood of light into the heart of Apollos."
3. "He spake and taught diligently the things of the Lord. Or, as in the more ancient authorities, ‘the things concerning Jesus;’ that is, all he knew of the life of Jesus Christ."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Being fervent in spirit (ζεων τω πνευματ). Boiling (from ζεω, to boil, old and common verb, in N.T. only here and Romans 12:11) like boiling water or yeast."
2. "He taught accurately what he knew, a fine gift for any preacher."
3. "That is to say, Apollos knew only what the Baptist knew when he died, but John had preached the coming of the Messiah, had baptized him, had identified him as the Son of God, had proclaimed the baptism of the Holy Spirit, but had not seen the Cross, the Resurrection of Jesus, nor the great Day of Pentecost."

### John Gill:
1. "He was trained up by his parents in this way, who might have been the disciples of John, though afterwards removed from Judea to Alexandria."

2. "Knowing only the baptism of John." 
3. "Only what John taught those whom he baptized, namely, to repent and believe in a Messiah shortly to appear."
