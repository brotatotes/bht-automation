# Acts 18:26 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, we find a beautiful example of how true believers selflessly impart their knowledge and insight to others. This couple, Priscilla and Aquila, are commended for taking the eloquent Apollos under their wing and privately teaching him. They patiently fill in the gaps of his understanding, expounding on the way of God with accuracy and completeness. This account reminds us of the importance of ongoing learning and humility, as even a gifted minister like Apollos was open to being taught by ordinary believers.
