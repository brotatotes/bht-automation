# Acts 18:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we see the apostle Paul, together with his companions, engaging in the trade of tent-making. This not only reveals their practicality and humility but also aligns with the Jewish cultural practice of teaching children a trade. By working with their own hands, they supported themselves and avoided being a burden on others, displaying a strong work ethic and a focus on self-sufficiency. This raises the question of why Christians today don't emphasize practical skills and the importance of a trade in the same way.
