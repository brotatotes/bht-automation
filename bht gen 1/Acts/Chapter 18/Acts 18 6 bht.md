This decision is emphasized by shaking one's raiment, symbolizing separation from those who oppose the truth. The verse highlights personal accountability and the consequences one brings upon themselves, as the guilt and responsibility for their own destruction is firmly placed upon them. This act of shaking off the opposition reflects a deep conviction and resolve to proclaim the truth, while also acknowledging the organized resistance that may arise.
