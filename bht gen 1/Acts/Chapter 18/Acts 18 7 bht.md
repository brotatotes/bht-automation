# Acts 18:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As Paul's ministry evolves, he separates himself from the Jewish community, seeking to spread the gospel among the Gentiles. He chooses to no longer go to the house of the Jew Aquila but to the house of a Gentile proselyte near the synagogue. This transition signifies a change in his approach, shifting his focus to a broader audience. By preaching in the house of Justus, a Gentile believer, he showcases the inclusivity and universality of the gospel message, shaking off any limitations imposed by ethnicity or location.
