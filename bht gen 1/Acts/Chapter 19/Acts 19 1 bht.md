# Acts 19:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the midst of Paul's missionary journey, he arrived in Ephesus, a city located in the upper regions of Asia Minor. The Church in Ephesus had been influenced by the teachings of Apollos, leading to a division among the believers. Paul encountered certain disciples who were similar to Apollos, having received John's baptism but not yet fully embracing the power of the Holy Spirit. These disciples lacked the joy and enthusiasm that characterized the nascent church in Ephesus. The city itself was renowned for its commerce and grandeur but eventually faced destruction by the Goths in the third century.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "By this name were known the eastern parts of Asia Minor, beyond the river Halys, or in comparison with Ephesus, in the direction of that river."
2. "These seem to have been in the same situation as Apollos... They had received only John’s baptism, and had had no proof of the descent of the Holy Spirit, nor knowledge of His gifts."
3. "They cannot have been mere disciples of John, on account of πιστεύσαντες, which can bear no meaning but that of believing on the Lord Jesus."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Apollos' powerful ministry in Corinth had created a division in the Church, with some preferring his style of preaching over Paul's. This may have been due to the influence of Greek philosophic culture, which Paul intentionally avoided. (1 Corinthians 1:12; 1 Corinthians 3:4)"

2. "Paul, having traveled through the elevated interior of Asia Minor, arrived in Ephesus, fulfilling his promise. (Acts 18:21)"

3. "Upon his arrival in Ephesus, Paul encountered certain disciples who were in a similar stage of Christian knowledge as Apollos had been at first. They were likely newly arrived and had not yet had any communication with the church in Ephesus."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Paul, having passed through the upper coasts - The upper, or more elevated regions of Asia Minor."
2. "These regions were called upper, because they were situated on the high table-land in the interior of Asia Minor, while Ephesus was in the low maritime regions, and called the low country."
3. "And finding certain disciples - Certain persons who had been baptized into John’s baptism, and who had embraced John’s doctrine that the Messiah was soon to appear."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Better, as Rev., 'the upper country;' lit., parts or districts."
2. "Hence the expedition of Cyrus from the sea - coast toward Central Asia was called Anabasis, a going - up."
3. "They lacked, apparently, some of the tokens of the higher life that pervaded the nascent church; they were devout, rigorous, austere, but were wanting in the joy, the radiancy, the enthusiasm which were conspicuous in others."

### John Calvin:
1. "Luke showeth here that the Church of Ephesus was not only confirmed and increased by Paul’s return, but also that there was a miracle wrought there, because the visible graces of the Spirit were given to certain rude and new disciples."

2. "Furthermore, it is not known whether they were inhabitants of the city or strangers; neither doth it greatly skill."

3. "It is not to be doubted but that they were Jews, because they had received the baptism of John; also, it is to be thought that they dwelt at Ephesus when Paul found them there."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "The word for 'upper' (ανωτερικα) is a late form for ανωτερα (Luke 14:10) and occurs in Hippocrates and Galen. It refers to the highlands (cf. Xenophon's Anabasis) and means that Paul did not travel the usual Roman road west by Colossae and Laodicea in the Lycus Valley, cities that he did not visit (Colossians 2:1)." 
2. "The province of Asia included the western part of Asia Minor. The Romans took this country B.C. 130. Finally the name was extended to the whole continent. It was a jewel in the Roman empire along with Africa and was a senatorial province. It was full of great cities like Ephesus, Smyrna, Pergamum, Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia, Laodicea (the seven churches of Acts 19:2; Acts 19:3), Colossae, Hierapolis, Apamea, to go no further."
3. "The Temple of Artemis was one of the seven wonders of the world. While in Ephesus some hold that Paul at this time wrote the Epistle to the Galatians after his recent visit there, some that he did it before his recent visit to Jerusalem. But it is still possible that he wrote it from Corinth just before writing to Rome, a point to discuss later."

### John Gill:
1. "He watered what the apostle had planted, and where he became very famous and eminent; insomuch that he was set up, though not with his will, at the head of a party, in opposition to the chief of the apostles, Peter and Paul."
2. "Paul having passed through the upper coasts; that is, of Phrygia, Galatia, Pontus, Bithynia, Lydia, Lycaonia, and Paphlagonia; came to Ephesus; into Ionia, of which Ephesus was the chief city, and lay near the sea."
3. "And finding certain disciples; such as believed in Christ, made a profession of him, and had been baptized in his name, for such were commonly called disciples."
