# Acts 19:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we encounter a distinction between diseases and possession by evil spirits. The commentaries reveal that the miracles performed by Paul were not based on any personal power or magical abilities, but were instead acts of God's direct power. The mention of aprons and garments brings forth the idea that these items were not inherently powerful, but were symbolic evidence of the miraculous work done through Paul. This understanding deepens our appreciation for the supernatural nature of the miracles and reinforces the importance of recognizing Jesus as the ultimate source of power.
