# Acts 19:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this passage, we see a group of men who, inspired by Paul's success in casting out demons, attempt to perform exorcisms themselves using the name of Jesus. However, these men are merely impostors, lacking the genuine relationship with Jesus that grants true power and authority. They are described as vagabonds and strollers, wandering from place to place, practicing exorcism as a form of deceit and manipulation. The attempt to use Jesus' name as a tool shows a misunderstanding of the true power found in a deep faith and relationship with Christ.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "These men, seeing the success of Paul’s agency in casting out devils, adopt the Name of Jesus in their own exorcisms." 
2. "The power of Jesus' name is not a magical formula, but rather a recognition of the authority and power that Jesus possesses over the spiritual realm." 
3. "This passage serves as a reminder that true power and authority come from a genuine relationship with Jesus, not from simply using his name as a tool."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "That such a power did exist, for some time at least, seems implied in Matthew 12:27."
2. "But no doubt this would breed imposture."
3. "A striking testimony to the power of Christ's name in Paul's mouth."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The word, however, properly means 'one wandering from place to place, without any settled habitation, from whatever cause it may be.' Here it denotes 'those Jews who wandered from place to place, practicing exorcism.'" 
2. "This word properly denotes 'those who went about pretending to be able to expel evil spirits, or to cure diseases by charms, incantations,' etc." 
3. "The reasons why they attempted this were: (1) That Jesus had expelled many evil spirits; and, (2) That it was in his name that Paul had performed his miracles."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Vagabond [περιερχομενων] . Lit., going about. Rev., strolling." 
2. "Exorcists [εξορκιστων] . Only here in New Testament."
3. "These Jewish exorcists pretended to the power of casting out evil spirits by magical arts derived from Solomon."

### John Calvin:
1. "Whence we gather again, that whatsoever miracles do darken the name of Christ they be juggling casts of the devil."
2. "For exorcists were made after the will of men; after that (as superstition doth always wax worse and worse) the Pope would have this common to all his clerks, who were to be promoted unto an higher degree."
3. "This invocation had two faults; for whereas they were enemies to Paul’s doctrine, they abuse the color thereof without faith, as it were, unto magical enchantments; secondly, they take to themselves without the calling of God that which is not in man’s hand."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "There were, as heathen writers tell us, numbers of these Jews in various parts of the world, who wandered about trading on the credulity of men and women, professing to be magicians, fortune tellers, practicing the exorcism of evil spirits."
2. "Among the Hebrew race there seems always to have existed a strange hankering after these dealings with unlawful arts, and we find in the Pentateuch repeated laws and enactments against these sorcerers, witches, dealers in enchantments, and the like."
3. "These impostors, seeing with their own eyes that Paul could really do what they only pretended to do, attempted to use what they fancied was his powerful incantation; powerful it was indeed, only they were ignorant how that glorious name alone could be used!"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The Jews were especially addicted to such practices with spells of sorcery connected with the name of Solomon." 
2. "These men regarded Paul as one of their own number just as Simon Magus treated Simon Peter."
3. "They thought that success turned on the correct use of the magical formula."

### John Gill:
1. "Who strolled about from place to place, pretending to tell fortunes, cure diseases by charms, and dispossess devils by conjuration."
2. "They imitated the Apostle Paul, and attempted to do as he did, using the same name; hoping to get money or applause, or both, in this way."
3. "The Jews made use of the name of Jesus for healing diseases; for it is said of one that 'he swallowed something which almost choked him, and one came, and muttered to him in the name of Jesus ben Pandira, and he was well.'"

### John Wesley:
1. "Satan laughs at all those who attempt to expel him either out of the bodies or the souls of men but by Divine faith." 
2. "All the light of reason is nothing to the craft or strength of that subtle spirit." 
3. "His craft cannot be known but by the Spirit of God nor can his strength be conquered but by the power of faith."
