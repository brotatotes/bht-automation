# Acts 19:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, certain men, seven sons, attempted to exorcise demons by invoking the name of Jesus. It is intriguing that these men held distinguished positions within the Jewish religious system, perhaps as chief priests. However, their actions as wandering exorcists were not recognized as legitimate by the established Jewish hierarchy. This confronts the contrast between the spiritual authority of the apostles and the empty religious rituals performed by the sons of Sceva. The encounter serves as a reminder that true spiritual power comes from a genuine relationship with God, rather than external titles or positions.
