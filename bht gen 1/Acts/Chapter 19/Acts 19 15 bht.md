# Acts 19:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this passage, we find an intriguing encounter between Jesus and Paul, and an evil spirit. The spirit acknowledges both Jesus and Paul, recognizing their authority and power in casting out demons. However, the spirit questions the identity and legitimacy of those trying to expel it, highlighting their lack of true affiliation with Jesus or God. This exchange reveals the importance of personal knowledge and relationship with Jesus, as well as the futility of attempting spiritual warfare without genuine connection to Him.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The narrative, from describing the nature of the attempt, passes to a single case in which it was tried, and in which two only of the brothers were apparently concerned."
2. "No difference between γινώσκω and ἐπίσταμαι must be pressed: the two verbs are apparently used as separating Jesus and Paul, so that they do not stand together in the same category."
3. "Jesus I know, and Paul I know: the One being God in heaven, the other man on earth."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The evil spirit's response reveals its recognition of Jesus as someone of authority and power." 
2. "The evil spirit's acknowledgment of Paul highlights the intimate knowledge it has of him, indicating a personal encounter or familiarity." 
3. "The question posed by the evil spirit emphasizes its ignorance and lack of recognition towards the individuals it is addressing."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Jesus I know - His power to cast out devils I know." 
2. "Paul I know - Paul’s power to cast out devils." 
3. "But who are ye? - What power have you over evil spirits? By what right do you attempt to expel them?"

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "It is the difference between an instinctive perception or recognition of a supreme power and the more intimate knowledge of a human agent."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Jesus, whom ye invoke, I know: I know Him well, and His authority, and His power; and Paul too, the servant of the Highest, I am acquainted with; but who are ye?" 
2. "The question was not one of ignorance, but of censure, because they arrogated to themselves what belonged not to them, and of contempt, because they considered not their own and their opponents’ strength, but with rashness dared to contend with one more powerful, to whom it was mere play to overcome them."
3. "On many grounds we must reject (2). As regards (1), it does seem as though the first age of Christianity was a time considering its extreme sensuality (never equalled in the world’s history in any period), considering, too, the general absence of all religious belief, and consequently of all moral restraint in which a more direct influence over the souls and bodies of men and women, on the part of the powers of evil, would probably exist."

### Archibald T Robertson:

### John Gill:
1. "Jesus I know; to be the Son of God and Messiah, and own that he has power of dispossessing spirits."
2. "And Paul I know; and own to be a servant of the most high God, by whom miracles of this kind have been wrought."
3. "But who are ye? you are not the disciples of Jesus, nor the servants of God, but the children of the devil, and have no power over us."
