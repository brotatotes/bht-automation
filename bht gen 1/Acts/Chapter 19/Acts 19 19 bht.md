# Acts 19:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, a group of people in Ephesus renounced their magical practices and burned their books containing incantations, formulas, and enchantments. These books were filled with curious and elaborate arts, symbols, and mysterious words, carried as charms and amulets for protection or success. The act of burning these books was a powerful display of their genuine repentance and rejection of their former involvement in these superstitious and deceitful practices. This event had a significant impact, both on those who witnessed it and on the power of Christianity over the forces of darkness.
