# Acts 19:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, Paul sends Timothy and Erastus on a mission to Macedonia and Achaia to remind the churches of his teachings and to make preparations for his arrival. Timothy, being a previous companion of Paul, is a fitting choice for this task. Erastus, likely the same person mentioned in Romans 16:23, also joins the delegation. Meanwhile, Paul remains in Ephesus for a while, continuing his work there. This journey holds significance and uncertainty, but Paul's intentions are clear as he sends his trusted companions ahead of him to fulfill his mission.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The object of it was to bring these churches in Macedonia and Achaia into remembrance of the ways and teaching of Paul."
2. "Considerable uncertainty hangs over this journey."
3. "Asia is named by way of contrast with Macedonia, just before mentioned."

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Timotheus and Erastus - as his pioneers, in part to bring 'them into remembrance of his ways which were in Christ,' partly to convey his mind on various matters." 
2. "It is very unlikely that this Erastus was 'the chamberlain of the city' of Corinth, of that name." 
3. "He himself stayed in the province of Asia for a season - that is, at Ephesus, its chief city."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Timotheus - Timothy. He was a proper person to send there to visit the churches, as he had been there before with Paul, when they were established." 
2. "And Erastus - Erastus was chamberlain of Corinth (Romans 16:23), or, more properly, the treasurer of the city, and he was, therefore, a very proper person to be sent with Timothy for the purpose of making the collection for the poor at Jerusalem."
3. "Paul had wisdom enough to employ a man accustomed to monied transactions in making a collection. On this collection his heart was intent, and he afterward went up with it to Jerusalem."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "From a passage in that epistle, we learn some of the reasons why one of these two friends of Paul was sent over into Europe before his master." 
2. "Erastus was most likely the same as the person alluded to in Romans 16:23 as the chamberlain of Corinth, and was not improbably chosen as the companion of Timothy on this difficult and delicate mission with which he was charged."
3. "For the reason of this prolonged stay of Paulâ€™s, see note on Acts 19:21. He appears to have gone on with his work for several months after the effect produced by the failure of the pretended exorcist family of Sceva the priest and the subsequent burning of the precious works on magic."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Paul had sent Timothy to Corinth...that he might return to Paul as he evidently had before Paul leaves Ephesus."
