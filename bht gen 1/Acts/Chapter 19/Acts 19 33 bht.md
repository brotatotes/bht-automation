2. "προεβ. urged forward, through the crowd; the Jews pushing him on from behind, ‘propellentibus.’" - This quote suggests that the Jews played a role in pushing Alexander forward, potentially to divert blame from themselves or to use him as a scapegoat.

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

### Albert Barnes:

2. "The Jews putting him forward - That he might have a convenient opportunity to speak to the people."
3. "Our translation, by the phrase 'his defense,' would seem to imply that he was personally accused. But it was not so. The Greek is simply, 'was about to apologize to the people'; that is, to make a defense, not of himself particularly, but of the Jews in general."

"The Jews on this occasion, well aware of the dislike and mistrust with which they were generally regarded by the Gentile populations among whom they dwelt, fearful lest they as was only too probable should be confounded with Paul and his disciples, put forward one of their people to explain to the Ephesians that the Jews, far from being inculpated with Paul and his school, hated these men with a hatred equal to or even greater than theirs."

### Archibald T Robertson:
