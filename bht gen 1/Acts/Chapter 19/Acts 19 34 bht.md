# Acts 19:34 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In a tumultuous scene, a shouting mob in Ephesus resolutely defends their idolatry, specifically the worship of Diana, as they encounter a Jewish man named Alexander in their midst. The frenzied crowd, consisting of both Gentiles and Jews, rejects any arguments against their devotion and passionately cries out their allegiance to their goddess for a prolonged period. This accounts for the fierce opposition and challenges faced by Paul and his companions in spreading the message of the gospel within a deeply entrenched pagan culture.
