2. "Various cities have claimed this title with reference to the Virgin or certain saints." 
3. "With this we may compare various legends concerning images and pictures in the Romish Church, such as the traditional likenesses of Christ, which were said to be 'not made with hands'."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Dismissed the assembly" refers to the dispersal of the tumultuous and disorderly gathering, which is commonly translated as "church." This highlights the chaotic nature of the assembly and the need for order to be restored.

2. The term "church" in this context is used to describe the unruly gathering, emphasizing the contrast between the intended purpose of a church as a place of worship and the disorderly behavior of the assembly.

3. The use of the word "assembly" underscores the fact that the gathering was not a formal church congregation, but rather a disorderly and tumultuous group that had come together in a riotous manner. This distinction helps to clarify the context and nature of the situation.
