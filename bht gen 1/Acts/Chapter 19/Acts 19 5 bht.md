# Acts 19:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This passage describes a group of individuals who, upon hearing about Jesus and His role as the Messiah, willingly receive baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus. It is evident that their previous baptism by John the Baptist was seen as insufficient, and they desired to align themselves with the new economy and the teachings of Christ. Their re-baptism signifies their acceptance of the fullness of the Christian faith and their readiness to partake in the extraordinary gifts of the Holy Spirit.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "This obviously is contrary to fact, historically: and would leave our present narrative in a singular state: for Paul, having treated their baptism as insufficient, would thus proceed on it to impose his hands, as if it were sufficient."
2. "But, in matter of fact, such a baptism as this was a baptism into the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. As Jews, these men were already servants of the living God and by putting on the Son, they received in a new and more gracious sense the Father also."
3. "Where such manifestations were present, the form of words might be wanting; but with us, who have them not, it is necessary and imperative."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "When they heard this—not the mere words reported in Acts 19:4, but the subject expounded according to the tenor of those words." 

2. "They were baptized—not however by Paul himself (1 Corinthians 1:14)." 

3. "In the name of the Lord Jesus—into the whole fulness of the new economy, as now opened up to their believing minds."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It is evident that these persons were rebaptized by the direction of Paul."
2. "If the obvious interpretation of the passage be the true one, it follows that the baptism of John was not strictly Christian baptism."
3. "The disciples of John were rebaptized, not because baptism is designed to be repeated, but because they never had been, in fact, baptized in the manner prescribed by the Lord Jesus."

### John Calvin:
1. "It was no inconvenient thing for them to be baptized again, who were only prepared with the baptism of John."
2. "Christ received baptism in his own flesh, that he might couple himself with us by that visible sign."
3. "Luke doth honorably call them disciples of Christ."
4. "Seeing that all men agree in this, that it was a grace which was to last only for a time, which was showed by that sign, it is a perverse and ridiculous thing to retain the sign since the truth is taken away."
5. "The Papists are worthy of no pardon, who being not content with the ancient rite, durst thrust in rotten and filthy anointing."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The willingness on the part of these followers of John the Baptist to be baptized anew in the name of the Lord Jesus, tells us that they had committed no error in doctrine, no mistake in looking upon their master John as Messiah."
2. "They confessed by submitting to the Christian rite that the baptism of John was simply provisional and preparatory."
3. "These disciples of John were re-baptized with the Christian baptism."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The point here is simply that these twelve men were grossly ignorant of the meaning of John's baptism as regards repentance, the Messiahship of Jesus, the Holy Spirit."
2. "Hence Paul had them baptized, not so much again, as really baptized this time, in the name or on the authority of the Lord Jesus as he had himself commanded."
3. "Proper understanding of 'Jesus' involved all the rest including the Trinity (Father, Son, and Holy Spirit)."

### John Gill:
1. "When they heard of the Messiah, and that Jesus was he, and that it became them to believe in him."
2. "His baptism was administered in the name of the Lord Jesus."
3. "He repeats his name, as was necessary; as that he laid his hands upon them, which was all that was needful to their receiving the extraordinary gifts of the Holy Ghost."

Note: The provided commentary is quite lengthy, so I have condensed it into three quotes that capture the essence of the author's explanation.

### John Wesley:
1. "They were baptized — By some other. Paul only laid his hands upon them." 
2. "They were baptized twice; but not with the same baptism." 
3. "John did not administer that baptism which Christ afterward commanded, that is, in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost."
