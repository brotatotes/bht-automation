# Acts 19:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Through the laying on of hands, believers receive the continuous outpouring of the Holy Spirit, resulting in the manifestation of speaking in tongues as a sign of His presence and power. This supernatural ability to communicate beyond language barriers is not merely a random babble, but a meaningful testimony to the work of the Spirit. Prophesying, another gift of the Spirit, further edifies the early Christian community, revealing God's messages and His will. These visible manifestations confirm the transformation and empowerment brought by the Holy Spirit upon the believers.
