1. "Phrygia, and Pamphylia - These were also two provinces of Asia Minor. Phrygia was surrounded by Galatia, Cappadocia, and Pisidia. Pamphylia was on the Mediterranean, and was bounded north by Pisidia." 
2. "In Egypt - This was that extensive country, well known, on the south of the Mediterranean, watered by the Nile. It extends 600 miles from north to south, and from 100 to 120 miles east and west. The language used there was the Coptic tongue."
3. "Strangers of Rome - This literally means 'Romans dwelling or tarrying,' that is, at Jerusalem. It may mean either that they were permanently fixed, or only tarrying at Jerusalem. They were doubtless Jews who had taken up their residence in Italy, and had come to Jerusalem to attend the great feasts."

3. "Others of these sojourning Jews lived in Egypt, which was a large country in Africa; which had on the east the deserts of Arabia, on the west Libya, on the south Ethiopia, and on the north the Mediterranean sea; hither many Jews were carried captive by Ptolomy Lagus, and these spoke the Egyptian language."
