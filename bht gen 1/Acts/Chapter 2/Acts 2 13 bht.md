# Acts 2:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we see a scene of opposition and mockery. Some native Jews, not understanding the foreign languages being spoken, mock the believers, accusing them of being filled with sweet wine rather than the Holy Spirit. The commentators note that this kind of ridicule was not uncommon throughout history and that it often led to deterring people from embracing faith. However, the apostles stand firm, emphasizing that the supernatural events occurring were not due to natural causes but a result of the outpouring of the Holy Spirit.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "ἕτεροι] Probably native Jews, who did not understand the foreign languages."
2. "Sweet wine, not necessarily new wine."
3. "Perhaps made of a remarkably sweet small grape, which is understood by the Jewish expositors to be meant by שׂרֵק or שׂרֵקָה."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "There has seldom been a revival of religion, a remarkable manifestation of the power of the Holy Spirit, that has not given occasion for profane mockery and merriment."
2. "Derision, and mockery, and a jeer, have been far more effectual in deterring people from becoming Christians than any attempts at sober argument."
3. "The friends of revivals should not be discouraged by this; but they should remember that the very first revival of religion was by many supposed to be the effect of a drunken frolic."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The first who commented on the wonder did so curiously, but with no prejudice."
2. "Those who now spoke did so in a hostile spirit."
3. "Mocking (diacleuazontev; so the best texts). From cleuh, a joke. Only here in New Testament."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Χλευη means a joke." 
2. "Sweet wine kept a year was very intoxicating." 
3. "Tanked up with new wine, state of fulness."

### John Gill:
1. "These men are full of new wine; a very foolish and impertinent cavil this."
2. "They were indeed filled with wine, but not with wine, the juice of the grape, either new or old; but with spiritual wine, with the gifts of the Spirit of God."
3. "They might hope this insinuation, that they were drunk with wine, would take and be received, since it was a feasting time, the feast of Pentecost."

### John Wesley:
1. "The world begins with mocking, thence proceeds to cavilling, Acts 4:7; to threats, 4:17; to imprisoning, Acts 5:18; blows, 5:40; to slaughter, Acts 7:58."
2. "These mockers appear to have been some of the natives of Judea, and inhabitants of Jerusalem, (who understood only the dialect of the country,) by the apostle's immediately directing his discourse to them in the next verse."
3. "They are full of sweet wine — So the Greek word properly signifies. There was no new wine so early in the year as pentecost. Thus natural men are wont to ascribe supernatural things to mere natural causes; and many times as impudently and unskilfully as in the present case."
