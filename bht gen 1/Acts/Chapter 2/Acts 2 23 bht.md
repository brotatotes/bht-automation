# Acts 2:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, the eternal plan and foreknowledge of God are emphasized. It was God's fixed plan and perfect foresight that led to Jesus being delivered up, crucified, and slain by the wicked hands of lawless men. The death of Jesus was preordained and ordained by God, as a divine act of power and love to redeem mankind from eternal death. Despite knowing what wicked men intended to do, God allowed it to happen because of His determined counsel to save humanity through the death of His Son.
