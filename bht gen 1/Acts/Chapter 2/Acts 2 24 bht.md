### Henry Alford:
1. "The difficulty lies, not in the connexion of λύειν with ὠδῖνας, which is amply justified, but in the interpretation of ὠδῖνας here."
2. "For ὠδῖνας θαν. must mean the pains of death, i.e. the pains which precede and end in death; a meaning here inapplicable."
3. "The fact may be, that Peter used the Hebrew word חֶבְלֵי, 'nets' or 'bands,' i.e. the nets in which death held the Lord captive; and that, in rendering the words into Greek, the LXX rendering of the word in that place and Psalms 114:3, viz. ὠδῖνες, has been adopted."

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Some claim that Peter followed the Septuagint mistranslation of Psalms 18:5, where the Hebrew word for snares is rendered by the word used here, pains; and that, therefore, it should be rendered snares of death; the figure being that of escape from the snare of a huntsman."
2. "Others suppose that death is represented in travail, the birth - pangs ceasing with the delivery; i.e., the resurrection."

2. "The resurrection of Jesus...chased away all the mist and darkness which hung over the future."
