### Albert Barnes:
1. "Thou wilt not leave me in the grave. The meaning probably is, 'Thou wilt not leave me in Sheol, neither,' etc. The word 'leave' here means, 'Thou wilt not resign me to, or wilt not give me over to it, to be held under its power.'" 

2. "The word 'hell,' in English, now commonly denotes 'the place of the future eternal punishment of the wicked.' This sense it has acquired by long usage. The Greek word 'Hades' means literally 'a place devoid of light; a dark, obscure abode'; and in Greek writers was applied to the dark and obscure regions where disembodied spirits were supposed to dwell."

3. "The word originally denoting simply 'the state of the dead, the insatiable demands of the grave,' came at last to be extended in its meaning, in proportion as they received new revelations or formed new opinions about the future world. Perhaps the following may be the process of thought by which the word came to have the special meanings which it is found to have in the Old Testament."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Leave behind" implies a sense of abandonment or forsaking, suggesting that the action of leaving involves a deliberate choice to separate oneself from something or someone.
2. "Give" suggests that suffering is not merely a passive experience, but rather an active giving or surrendering of oneself to the pain or hardship.
3. These two contrasting actions highlight the tension between letting go and embracing suffering, reminding us that sometimes we must leave certain things behind in order to fully experience and grow through the challenges we face.

### John Calvin:
1. "To leave the soul in hell is to suffer the same to be oppressed with destruction."
2. "Because death is insatiable; whence also cometh that translation, Hell hath enlarged her soul."
3. "For the word anima, or soul, doth not so much signify the spirit being of an immortal essence as the life itself."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Because thou wilt not leave my soul in hell. This was the Redeemer’s sure confidence during the days of His earthly life. It may, if we will, be ours too; for after a little while the joyful resurrection of the Lord, of body as well as soul, will be the inheritance of all holy and humble men of heart."
2. "His soul was not to remain in the realm of the dead. Hell, the well-known English translation of ᾃδή;, the Hebrew שׁ ְאול, is singularly unfortunate, as the word (Greek and Hebrew) simply means ‘the abode where the souls of the dead dwell’ after body and soul are separated by death."
3. "Neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption. The Beloved One of God was not to moulder in the grave, was not to share in that part of the curse of Adam which told man he should return to dust."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Hades is the unseen world, Hebrew Sheol, but here it is viewed as death itself 'considered as a rapacious destroyer'." 
2. "The phrase in the Apostles' Creed, 'descended into hell' is from this passage in Acts (Hades, not Gehenna)." 
3. "Peter applies these words to the Messiah."

### John Gill:
1. "This is an apostrophe, or an address to his Father, who he believed would not leave his soul, as separate from his body, in Hades, in the invisible world of souls, in the place where the souls of departed saints are, but would quickly return it to its body, and reunite them."
2. "The character of an 'Holy One' well agrees with Christ, both as God, or with respect to his divine nature, holiness being a perfection in it, and in which he is glorious; and as man, he being holy in his nature, harmless in his life and conversation."
3. "Now, though he died, and was laid in the grave, and buried, yet God would not suffer him to lie there so long as to be corrupted and putrefied, which is the sense of seeing corruption."

### John Wesley:
1. "Thou wilt not leave my soul in hades — The invisible world."
2. "But it does not appear, that ever our Lord went into hell."
3. "The meaning is, Thou wilt not leave my soul in its separate state, nor suffer my body to be corrupted."
