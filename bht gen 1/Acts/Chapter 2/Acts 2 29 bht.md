## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "I am your brother, an Israelite, and therefore would not speak with disrespect of David."
2. "The title 'Patriarch' is only here applied to David, as the progenitor of the kingly race."
3. "We learn from 1 Kings 2:10 and Nehemiah 3:16, that David was buried at Jerusalem, in the city of David, i.e. the stronghold of Zion."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Peter, full of the Holy Ghost, sees in this sixteenth Psalm, one Holy Man, whose life of high devotedness and lofty spirituality is crowned with the assurance, that though He taste of death, He shall rise again without seeing corruption, and be admitted to the bliss of God's immediate presence."
2. "The Psalm is then affirmed to have had its only proper fulfilment in JESUS, of whose resurrection and ascension they were witnesses, while the glorious effusion of the Spirit by the hand of the ascended One, setting an infallible seal upon all, was even then witnessed by the thousands who stood listening to Him."
3. "A further illustration of Messiah's ascension and session at God's right hand is drawn from Psalm 110, in which David cannot be thought to speak of himself, seeing he is still in his grave."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Christians should use the usual respectful forms of salutation, whatever contempt and reproaches they may meet with from opposers."
2. "It is proper to say of him that he is dead, and has returned to corruption. This was a delicate way of expressing high respect for the monarch whom they all honored, and yet evinced boldness in examining a passage of Scripture which probably many supposed to have reference solely to him."
3. "The tomb of a monarch like David would be well known and had in reverence. Peter might, then, confidently appeal to their own belief and knowledge that David had not been raised from the dead. No Jew believed or supposed it. All, by their care of his sepulchre, and by the honor with which they regarded his grave, believed that he had returned to corruption. The Psalm, therefore, could not apply to him."

### John Gill:
1. "The apostle calls the Jews, brethren, whom he before only styled men of Judea, and men of Israel, because they were his brethren according to the flesh, as many of them afterwards were in a spiritual relation."

3. "Though it may be questioned whether any such treasure was ever in it, or taken out of it; and still less credible is the account which R. Benjamin gives of two men in his time, who, under the wall of Zion, found a cave, which led them to a large palace built on pillars of marble, and covered with gold and silver; and within it was a table, and a golden sceptre, and a crown of gold; and this, says the author, was the sepulchre of David, king of Israel."
