# Acts 2:33 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse being described portrays the exaltation and power of Jesus Christ. It emphasizes that all the mighty works and wonders performed were by the hand of God. Jesus, exalted to the right hand of God, symbolizes his authority and close relationship with the Father. His ascension signifies his glorification and the fulfillment of his mission on earth, as he receives the Holy Spirit and bestows spiritual gifts upon his disciples. The visible manifestations of the descent of the Spirit, such as the tongues of fire and the various languages spoken, further demonstrate the extraordinary nature of this divine event.
