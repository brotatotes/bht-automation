### Henry Alford:
1. "The exaltation of Christ is also proved from prophecy and from the same passage with which Jesus Himself had silenced His enemies."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The phrase 'did not ascend' emphasizes the fact that Jesus did not ascend to heaven in the same way that he descended from heaven. His ascension was not a mere physical movement, but a spiritual and divine act."
