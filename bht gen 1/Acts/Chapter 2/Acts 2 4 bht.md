# Acts 2:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The disciples, filled with the Holy Spirit, began speaking in various languages, proclaiming the wonderful works of God with clear and loud utterance. This gift of speaking in unknown languages, understood by people from different lands, was a miraculous impartation by the Spirit. The speakers themselves did not understand what they were uttering, as they were filled with the Spirit's influence. This gift of tongues, given to the apostles and other members of the church, was a means to communicate the Gospel to people of different languages and nations.

"Then was fulfilled the words of the Master’s dying prayer: ‘As Thou, Father, art in me, and I in Thee, that they also may be one in us’; and from that hour the Spirit has never departed from His Church in spite of all her divisions, her errors, her short-sighted policy has never left her, never deserted her."
