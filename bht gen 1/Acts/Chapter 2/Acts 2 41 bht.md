## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The simplicity of faith came first, the ripeness of knowledge followed."
2. "Among such a multitude, admitted by a confession which allowed of so wide an interpretation, were probably many persons who brought into the church the seeds of that Judaizing form of Christianity which afterwards proved so hostile to the true faith."
3. "Almost without doubt, this first baptism must have been administered, as that of the first Gentile converts was, by effusion or sprinkling, not by immersion."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "It is difficult to say how three thousand could be baptized in one day, according to the old practice of a complete submersion;... The difficulty can only be removed by supposing that they already employed sprinkling, or baptized in houses in large vessels." [OLSHAUSEN]
2. "Formal submersion in rivers, or larger quantities of water, probably took place only where the locality conveniently allowed it." [OLSHAUSEN]
3. "Fitting inauguration of the new kingdom, as an economy of the Spirit!"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Religion is not compulsion. They who become Christians do it cheerfully; they do it rejoicing in the privilege of becoming reconciled to God through Jesus Christ."
2. "Their conversion was instantaneous. The demand on them was to yield themselves at once to God. And their profession was made, and the ordinance which sealed their profession administered without delay."
3. "It was the first great work of grace under the gospel. It was the model of all revivals of religion. And it was doubtless intended that this should be a specimen of the manner in which the ministers of religion should act in regard to admissions to the Christian church."

### John Calvin:
1. "Faith must begin with this readiness and willing desire to obey."
2. "We must neither be slow to obey, nor yet swift to leap back; but we must stick fast, and stand stoutly to that doctrine which we did forthwith embrace."
3. "Whereas there was a great multitude converted unto Christ with one sermon, an hundred sermons can scarce move a few of us."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "This great multitude could not have been immersed, especially in a city like Jerusalem, where the supply of water was not abundant."
2. "This first baptism probably was administered by sprinkling or pouring."
3. "We may see it was not dogmas (as a preparation for baptism) upon which the apostles laid stress, but the disposition and bent of the mind."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Ουν connects with what precedes as the result of Peter's sermon while μεν points forward to what is to follow." 
2. "Luke means that the 3,000 were added to the 120 already enlisted." 
3. "Furneaux warns us that all the 3,000 may not have been genuine converts and that many of them were pilgrims at the passover who returned home."

### John Gill:
1. "These converts were the dew of Christ's youth, as well as instances of his powerful and efficacious grace."
2. "The number of those that were added to them were about three thousand souls; or persons, men, and women; and their number is no objection to their being baptized by immersion."
3. "The same day they were baptized, they were joined to the church; and that day was the day of Pentecost, the day on which the law was given on Mount Sinai, and on which now the Gospel was published to men of all nations under the heavens."

### John Wesley:
1. "The phrase 'and there were added' implies that there was an intentional and purposeful action taken to increase the number of believers. It suggests that the growth of the early church was not accidental or haphazard, but rather a result of deliberate efforts to spread the message of Jesus."

2. "The mention of 'a hundred and twenty' signifies a significant number of individuals who were united in their faith and commitment to Jesus. It highlights the idea that the early church was not just a small group of believers, but a diverse community of people who came together to worship, learn, and support one another."

3. "This verse serves as a reminder that the growth of the church is not solely dependent on human efforts, but ultimately a work of God. It shows that God is actively involved in the expansion of His kingdom and that He adds to the number of believers according to His divine plan and purpose."
