In this Bible verse, the early Christian community in Jerusalem is described as being characterized by a deep sense of unity, love, and sharing. They lived in true communion both spiritually and materially, as they held all their possessions in common and willingly provided for one another's needs.

By embracing this selfless lifestyle, they demonstrated their commitment to following the teachings of Jesus and fostering a strong sense of unity and care within their community.

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The term 'common' refers to the sharing of possessions and resources among the early believers. It signifies a radical shift from individualism to communal living, where there is a sense of shared responsibility and care for one another."

2. "By using the word 'common,' the author highlights the unity and equality that characterized the early Christian community. It emphasizes the idea that no one should be in need while others have an abundance, and that the needs of the community as a whole are prioritized over individual gain."

3. "The concept of 'common' challenges the prevailing societal norms of the time, which valued personal wealth and status. It calls believers to a higher standard of selflessness and generosity, where material possessions are seen as tools to serve others rather than as ends in themselves."
