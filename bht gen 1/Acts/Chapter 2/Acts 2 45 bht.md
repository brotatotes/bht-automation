# Acts 2:45 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, believers demonstrated their faith by willingly selling their possessions, both land and movable goods. The rich among them sold their estates and distributed the proceeds to those in need, exemplifying the selflessness and generosity inspired by religion. This act of selling and sharing was not limited to a specific time, but rather became a practice rooted in the love and devotion of the early Christian community. It served both the practical purpose of providing for the poor and supporting the spread of the gospel, reflecting the profound impact of faith on their values and actions.
