# Acts 20:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, the apostle Paul decides to take a journey from Troas to Assos. Assos is described as a fortified city difficult to ascend near the sea, and it seems to lack significant Christian influence. Paul's choice to travel on foot may have been motivated by a desire to spend more time with his fellow believers or to have moments of solitude and communion with God. Despite the challenges, Paul's courteous actions towards his companions and his commitment to fulfilling his apostolic duties shine through.

### Philip Schaff:

2. "He wished, perhaps, to secure a few more hours with his disciples at Troas, and also a quiet, solitary time of meditation as he went alone by the road to the point where he had fixed to join the ship and his friends."

### John Gill:
1. "Assos, a city of Aeolia, or Mysia, is said to be the same with Apollonia... It is represented as a place very much fortified by art and very difficult of ascent on that part which lies to the sea." This quote provides historical and geographical context for the city of Assos, highlighting its significance and physical characteristics.

This quote speculates on the possible reasons why Paul chose to travel on foot from Troas to Assos, highlighting the potential desire for fellowship or solitude during the journey.

### John Wesley:
