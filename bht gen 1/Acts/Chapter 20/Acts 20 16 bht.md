# Acts 20:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we see Paul's determination to sail past Ephesus without being detained. His haste was not due to the worship of the law, but rather his desire to edify the Church and present the generous gifts from the Gentile churches to their distressed brethren in Jerusalem. It is clear that Paul's purpose was not to waste time, but to seize the opportunity to preach the Gospel and make an impact in the presence of a great assembly.
