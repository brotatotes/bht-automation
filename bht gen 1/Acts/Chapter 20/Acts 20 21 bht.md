# Acts 20:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Bible verse being described is a declaration about the importance of repentance towards God and faith towards our Lord Jesus Christ. Commentators emphasize that this repentance is not merely a legalistic act, but an evangelical one that stems from a true understanding of God's love and mercy. Furthermore, the faith mentioned is not a mere intellectual belief, but a spiritual act of relying on Christ for grace, righteousness, and salvation. These two elements, repentance and faith, are described as inseparable and central to the preaching and ministry of the apostles.

2. "And the latter of these is not an historical faith, or an assent of the mind to whatsoever is true concerning the person, office, and grace of Christ; but is a spiritual act of the soul upon him; it is a looking and going out to him, a laying hold and leaning on him, and trusting in him, for grace, righteousness, peace, pardon, life, and salvation."
