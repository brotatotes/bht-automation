# Acts 20:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In an unknown location, an individual faced dangers and challenges. During their stay, they wrote a significant epistle and encountered opposition from enemies who plotted against them, seeking to take their life or belongings. Forced to change their plans and take a different route to ensure their safety and the well-being of the churches, this person remained steadfast and set an example of constancy and resilience amidst adversity. The plot and ambush laid for them brought to light God's providence and care for His ministers.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "He had been absent some three years, and in that period in the Christian community at Corinth had taken place, as the church increased, the disputes concerning the Lord’s Supper; the heart-burnings excited by party attachments to one or other of the early Christian leaders, himself, Peter, and Apollos; the agitation occasioned by the immoral and impure lives lived by professing members of the brotherhood." 

2. "The duty of relieving and assisting brothers and sisters unknown and living in far countries, but professing the same faith; and the general duty of almsgiving, and other questions connected with doctrine and life and ritual, which have in all the Christian ages agitated and often perplexed the Church of Christ, had been prominently brought before the Corinthian congregations."
