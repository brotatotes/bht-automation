From among the congregation, individuals will arise who pervert the true doctrines of the Gospel. Ambition and love for power give birth to divisions and distractions within the church. Beware of false teachings and the allure of self-glory, as they are corrupters of sound doctrine. The church must remain vigilant against both external enemies and those who undermine the purity of the Gospel from within its own ranks. Stay rooted in the core principles of the faith and uphold unity within the body of believers.
