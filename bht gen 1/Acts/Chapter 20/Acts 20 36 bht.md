In this Bible verse, we witness a profound display of ministerial fidelity and affection. The deep admiration and attachment between the apostle and the Ephesian presbyters is highlighted, leaving an indelible impression. The apostle demonstrates utmost reverence and humility by kneeling down in prayer, a fitting posture and an outward sign of devotion. By joining together in prayer, they not only make a profession of their godliness but also provoke one another to reverence God. The apostle seals his preceding sermon with prayer, recognizing that the blessing of God is essential for the profit of their doctrine.
