### Philip Schaff:
1. "That they should see his face no more." - This phrase suggests that Paul and his companions believed they would never see each other again. However, it is likely that Paul did revisit Ephesus and its church after his release from imprisonment, challenging this initial belief.

2. "St. Paul most probably did revisit these shores." - The commentator suggests that Paul did indeed return to Ephesus, contradicting the notion that he would never be seen again. This highlights the uncertainty surrounding the interpretation of this verse.

3. "No doubt Ephesus and its church, after his liberation from the Roman imprisonment." - The commentator emphasizes that it is highly likely that Paul would have visited Ephesus and its church after being released from his imprisonment, further supporting the idea that the initial belief of never seeing each other again was incorrect.

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Sorrowing (οδυνωμενο). Present middle participle of οδυναω, old verb to cause intense pain, to torment (Luke 16:24), middle to distress oneself (Luke 2:48; Acts 20:38). Nowhere else in N.T."
2. "Which he had spoken (ω ειρηκε). Relative attracted to the case of the antecedent λογω (word). Past perfect indicative of ειπον."
3. "They brought him on his way (προεπεμπον αυτον). Imperfect active of προπεμπω, old verb to send forward, to accompany as in Acts 15:3; Acts 20:38; Acts 21:5; 1 Corinthians 16:6; 1 Corinthians 16:11; 2 Corinthians 1:16; Titus 3:13; 3 John 1:6. Graphic picture of Paul's departure from this group of ministers."

### John Gill:
1. "It filled them with sorrow to part with him; but this was increased, and made almost intolerable by what he said, that they should see his face no more." 
2. "To be told they should never see him more in this world, it cut them to the heart; which shows what a share the apostle had in their hearts and affections." 
3. "However, that they might have a sight of him as long as they could, they went along with him to see him take shipping, and to see the last of him."

### John Wesley:
1. "Sorrowing most for that word which he spake" - This phrase highlights the deep sorrow experienced by those who heard the word that they would never see the face of God again. It emphasizes the profound loss and grief that will be felt on the day of judgment.

2. "What sorrow will be in the great day" - This statement underscores the magnitude of sorrow that will be experienced on the day of judgment. It suggests that the sorrow will be overwhelming and beyond comprehension.

3. "When God shall speak that word to all who are found on the left hand" - This phrase emphasizes the authority and finality of God's word. It implies that when God pronounces the judgment, it will be irrevocable and eternal.

These quotes collectively convey the intense sorrow and despair that will be felt when God declares that those on the left hand will never see His face again. They highlight the significance of this moment and the eternal consequences it carries.
