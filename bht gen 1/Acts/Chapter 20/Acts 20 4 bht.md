# Acts 20:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we see a group of companions accompanying Paul on his journey. Some chose to remain faithful, such as Trophimus and Aristarchus, who demonstrated loyalty and support by staying with him despite potential challenges and dangers. Their presence highlights the importance of companionship and the strength found in unity. However, not all companions remained, as some chose to leave Paul along the way. This serves as a reminder that not everyone will stay committed to the journey of faith. Nonetheless, these faithful companions, like Trophimus and Aristarchus, played significant roles in spreading the message of Christ.
