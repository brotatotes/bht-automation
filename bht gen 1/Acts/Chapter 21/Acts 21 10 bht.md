## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "This Agabus in all probability is identical with the Agabus of ch. Acts 11:28."
2. "That there is no reference to that former mention of him, might be occasioned by different sources of information having furnished the two narratives."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "There came down" - This phrase indicates that the message or revelation was given from a higher source, emphasizing the divine origin of the prophecy.

2. "Named Agabus" - The mention of Agabus is significant because he was previously mentioned in Acts 11:28, where he accurately predicted a severe famine. This establishes his credibility as a prophet and adds weight to his message.

### John Calvin:
1. "It was surely a profitable example of invincible constancy, seeing that he offered himself willingly and wittingly to the violence of the adversaries; and no less profitable is it for us at this day, that his apostleship should be confirmed with this voluntary and no less constant giving over of his life." 
2. "The same Spirit, who did apply signs to his words, did inwardly touch the hearts of the godly, as if they had been brought to the very thing itself."
3. "This is also worthy to be noted, that Agabus doth not set before their eyes a dumb spectacle, but he coupleth therewith the word, whereby he may show to the faithful the use and end of the ceremony."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The Greek word thus rendered is in the comparative degree, and apparently signifies that Paul and his companions tarried in Cæsarea ‘more days’ than at first they had intended."
2. "On the fiftieth day after Passover, the feast of Pentecost occurred."
3. "Fifteen or sixteen years had elapsed since Agabus of Jerusalem had prophesied before the Church of Antioch; he had doubtless now come down from the Holy City to meet Paul at Cæsarea."

1. "As we tarried (επιμενοντων ημων). Genitive absolute. Note επ (additional) with μενω as in Acts 12:16." 
2. "Many days (ημερας πλειους). More days (than we expected), accusative of time." 
3. "A certain prophet named Agabus (προφητης ονοματ Αγαβος). A prophet like the daughters of Philip, mentioned already in connection with the famine predicted by him (Acts 11:28), but apparently not a man of prominence like Barnabas, and so no allusion to that former prophecy."

### John Gill:
