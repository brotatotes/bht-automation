# Acts 21:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, a prophet named Agabus dramatically binds his own feet and hands with a girdle, symbolizing his submission to God's will and his role as a messenger. This action mirrors the symbolic acts performed by prophets in the Old Testament. The Holy Spirit revealed to Agabus that the Jews in Jerusalem would bind the man who owns the girdle, a prophecy which was later fulfilled when the apostle Paul was bound in a similar manner. Paul's bonds serve as a symbol of his dedication and sacrifice for the Gospel.
