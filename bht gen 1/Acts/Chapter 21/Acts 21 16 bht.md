## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The probability of Mnason being a resident at Jerusalem, and of the Cæsarean brethren going to introduce the company to him, seems to favour the latter."
2. "Both renderings are legitimate: and it is difficult to choose between them."
3. "ἀρχαίῳ probably implies that he had been a disciple ἐξ ἀρχῆς, and had accompanied our Lord during His ministry."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "One Mnason of Cyprus, an old disciple, c.—not an 'aged' disciple, but probably 'a disciple of old standing,' perhaps one of the three thousand converted on the day of Pentecost, or, more likely still, drawn to the Saviour Himself during His lifetime." 
2. "The apostle was full of anxiety about this visit to Jerusalem, from the numerous prophetic intimations of danger awaiting him, and having reason to expect the presence at this feast of the very parties from whose virulent rage he had once and again narrowly escaped with his life." 
3. "Hence we find him asking the Roman Christians to wrestle with him in prayer, 'for the Lord Jesus Christ's sake, and for the love of the Spirit, that he might be delivered from them that believed not in Judea,' as well as 'that his service which he had for Jerusalem (the great collection for the poor saints there) might be accepted of the saints'."

### Albert Barnes:

3. "It is evident that, though Mnason was originally of Cyprus, yet he was now an inhabitant of Jerusalem, and was well known to the disciples at Caesarea."

### Marvin Vincent:

2. "It seems better to suppose that the disciples accompanied the apostle in order to introduce him to Mnason, whom they knew."
3. "The rendering old might be taken to mean aged; whereas the word means of long standing."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "A simpler way, however, of translating the original, and one, too, that affords a better sense, is: ‘There went with us also certain of the disciples of Cæsarea, conducting us to Mnason of Cyprus, an early disciple, with whom we should lodge.’"
2. "Mnason was no doubt an important person in the Jerusalem Church; he is styled ‘an old or an early disciple,’ and was possibly converted during the life of our Lord Himself."
3. "If so, it is interesting as showing that our Lord’s disciples were not limited to the natives of Galilee and Judæa."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "The genitive here occurs with τινες understood as often in the Greek idiom, the partitive genitive used as nominative."
2. "A thoroughly idiomatic Greek idiom, incorporation and attraction of the antecedent into the relative clause."
3. "The use of αρχαιω for 'early' may refer to the fact that he was one of the original disciples at Pentecost."
