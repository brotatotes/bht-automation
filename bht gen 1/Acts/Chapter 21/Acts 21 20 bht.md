# Acts 21:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we see Paul facing suspicion and apprehension among the believers in Jerusalem. The Jewish complexion of the early Christian community and the adherence to the Law of Moses create tension as Paul preaches to the Gentiles. Nonetheless, the conversion of sinners and the spread of the gospel bring joy and praise to the Lord. The vast numbers of Jewish converts in Jerusalem affirm the significance of Paul's ministry, while the commitment to the law causes resistance and disbelief among some.
