# Acts 21:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, individuals are diligently instructed by anti-Pauline Judaizers, potentially leading to conflict with Paul's teachings. The instruction adheres to a specific set of rules and traditions, highlighting the importance of following established customs. There is a widespread feeling among Jewish Christian communities that Paul teaches a forsaking of Moses and abandoning sacred Jewish practices, leading to slanderous accusations. However, Paul never intended to undermine the law and customs and instead aimed to emphasize the true significance of circumcision and the law. Despite this, bringing about a change in old customs is not easily achieved.
