### John Wesley:
1. "Yielding his own judgment to their advice" - Paul's decision to take the men was not based on his own spiritual discernment, but rather on the advice of others. This highlights the tension between his desire to follow the law and his understanding of the gospel.
2. "Seeming to be what he really was not" - The commentary suggests that Paul's actions may have been perceived as him still believing in the validity of the Mosaic law, even though he knew it was no longer necessary for salvation. This shows the complexity of Paul's situation and the delicate balance he had to maintain.
3. "Making as if he believed the law still in force" - Paul's decision to participate in the days of purification was not because he truly believed in the continued validity of the law, but rather to show respect and maintain peace with the Jewish community. This demonstrates Paul's willingness to adapt and accommodate for the sake of unity.
