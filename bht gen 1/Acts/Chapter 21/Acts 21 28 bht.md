# Acts 21:28 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we see Paul being accused by the Jews of teaching against the Jewish people, the law of Moses, and the temple. The commentary suggests that Paul's teachings challenged the exclusivity of the Jewish people and emphasized that God's favor extended to the Gentiles as well. The accusation of bringing Greeks into the temple refers to the belief that Paul had defiled the inner temple, which was forbidden to Gentiles. However, the commentary points out that Gentiles were only allowed in the outer court.
