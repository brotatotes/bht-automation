### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "They did not see Trophimus with Paul now in the temple, nor had they ever seen him there. They simply argued that, if Paul was willing to be seen down street with a Greek Christian, he would not hesitate to bring him (therefore, did bring him, εισηγαγεν as in verse Acts 21:28) into the temple, that is into the court of Israel and therefore both Paul and Trophimus were entitled to death, especially Paul who had brought him in (if he had) and, besides, they now had Paul."

2. "One day they saw both of them together (συν) in the city. That was a fact. They had just seized Paul in the temple (ιερον). That was another fact."
