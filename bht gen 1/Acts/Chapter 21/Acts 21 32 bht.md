## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "The chief captain, or tribune of the Roman cohort, held a position of authority and power in the Roman military hierarchy."
2. "The Roman cohort consisted of one thousand men, making the chief captain a significant figure in the military structure."
3. "This mention of the chief captain highlights the presence and influence of the Roman Empire in the biblical narrative."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Centurions were highly respected and influential leaders in the Roman army, responsible for the command and discipline of their soldiers. This context helps us understand the significance of the centurion mentioned in the Bible, as someone who held a position of authority and had a deep understanding of leadership." 

2. "The centurion's faith is highlighted in this verse, as he recognizes the authority of Jesus and believes that a mere word from Him is enough to heal his servant. This demonstrates the centurion's humility and trust in Jesus' power, surpassing even his own position of authority."

3. "The centurion's statement, 'I am not worthy to have you come under my roof,' reveals his recognition of his own unworthiness before Jesus. This humility is a stark contrast to the typical Roman mindset of pride and self-importance, and it serves as a powerful example of how faith in Jesus can transform hearts and attitudes."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Centurions" - This refers to the Roman military officers who commanded a hundred soldiers. They were known for their discipline and authority, often seen as symbols of power and control.

2. "See on Luke 7:2" - This suggests that there is a connection or similarity between the centurions mentioned in this verse and the one mentioned in Luke 7:2. By referring to the previous verse, the commentary invites readers to explore the context and potential parallels.

3. "Unto them [επ αυτους]. Better, upon them." - This comment highlights a possible translation issue in the original Greek text. The phrase "επ αυτους" can be translated as "unto them" or "upon them." The commentary suggests that the latter translation, "upon them," may provide a clearer understanding of the verse.

### John Calvin:
1. "Those whose fury neither the majesty of God, nor yet the reverence of the temple, could once stay, begin to relent when they see a profane man." 
2. "The Spirit hath depainted out unto us the providence of God as in a table [picture] reigning amidst the confused uproars of men."
3. "The equity of the chief captain is to be commended if he be compared with the Jews. He bindeth him with chains, as if he were some evil-doer, or some wicked person; yet doth he vouchsafe to hear him when he is bound, whom they did beat unmercifully."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Forthwith (εξαυτης). Common in the Koine (εξ αυτης, supply ωρας, hour)." 
2. "Centurions (εκατονταρχας). See on Luke 7:2 for discussion. Plural shows that Lysias the chiliarch took several hundred soldiers along (a centurion with each hundred)." 
3. "Left off beating Paul (επαυσαντο τυπτοντες τον Παυλον). The participle with παυομα describes what they were already doing, the supplementary participle (Robertson, Grammar, p. 1121). They stopped before the job was over because of the sudden onset of the Roman soldiers."

### John Gill:
1. "All which shows his vigilance, prudence, and quick dispatch; and in which there was a remarkable appearance of divine providence in favour of the apostle, who otherwise in all likelihood would have quickly lost his life."
2. "This beating was what the Jews call מכות מרדית, 'the rebels' beating'; or beating, on account of rebellion and obstinacy; and differed from whipping or scourging, which was done by the order of the sanhedrim, and in measure with forty stripes save one."
3. "This was inflicted upon various offenders, particularly on such who received not admonitions given them, or transgressed by doing what was forbidden by the words of the wise men."
