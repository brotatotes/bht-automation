# Acts 22:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The act of baptism, as described by various commentators, is a significant and transformative event in the life of a believer. It symbolizes the washing away of sins, both visibly and spiritually. By calling on the name of the Lord and receiving baptism, one experiences a purifying of the soul and is initiated into the Christian faith. It is a means through which God bestows forgiveness and seals the covenant of grace. Delaying obedience to this command and neglecting the ordinance of baptism can prevent the glory of Christ and deprive oneself of the comfort and blessings it brings.
