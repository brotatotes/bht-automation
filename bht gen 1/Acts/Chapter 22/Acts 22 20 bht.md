# Acts 22:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse being described highlights the significance of Stephen's martyrdom and the shedding of his blood. Stephen's witnessing of Christ's glory before his death, along with the transition of the word "martyr" from its primary sense to its specific Christian meaning, emphasize the impact of his sacrifice on the early Christian community. This event also played a role in Paul's involvement and subsequent conversion, as well as serving as a reminder of the cost of discipleship and the sacrifice required for the Gospel.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The Apostle may have here used the (Hebrew, עֵד , as Wordsworth) word in its strict primary sense; for a view of Christ in His glory was vouchsafed to Stephen, and it was by bearing witness of that manifestation that he hastened his death."
2. "The present meaning of the word martyr did, however, become attached to it at a very early period, and is apparently of apostolic authority."
3. "The transition from the first to the secondary sense may be easily accounted for. Many who had only seen with the eye of faith, suffered persecution and death as a proof of their sincerity."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The blood of thy martyr Stephen was shed" - This quote highlights the significance of Stephen's martyrdom and the shedding of his blood as a pivotal event in the early Christian community.
2. "I also was standing by" - Paul's admission of his presence during Stephen's stoning emphasizes his involvement, albeit indirectly, in the persecution of Christians.
3. "All this showed that...he was with them in spirit" - This quote reveals Paul's alignment with the persecutors, indicating his shared mindset and agreement with their actions. It helps explain his subsequent conversion and mission to the Gentiles.

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The special sense of the word [martyr] was probably not in use at this time." 
2. "Standing by." 
3. "Slew."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "It would therefore be more strictly accurate to render here, ‘the blood of thy witness Stephen.’"
2. "Probably the transition from the general sense of ‘witness’ to the specific meaning of ‘martyr’ is traceable to its use in such passages as this and Revelation 2:13; Revelation 11:3; Revelation 17:6."
3. "Thus the word before the close of the first century had began to acquire the special Christian sense which in the second was so well known."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Was shed (εξεχυννετο). Imperfect passive of εκχυννω (see on Matthew 23:35), was being shed." 
2. "Witness (μαρτυρος). And 'martyr' also as in Revelation 2:13; Revelation 17:6. Transition state for the word here." 
3. "Consenting (συνευδοκων). The very word used by Luke in Acts 8:1 about Paul. Koine word for being pleased at the same time with (cf. Luke 11:48)."

### John Gill:
1. "Stephen was a martyr for Christ, both by confession with his mouth, and by the effusion of his blood."
2. "He was the proto-martyr, or 'the first martyr' that suffered for Christ."
3. "These things he mentions to suggest that surely the Jews would receive his testimony, since they knew what a bitter enemy he had been to this way."

### John Wesley:
1. "A real convert still retains the remembrance of his former sins." 
2. "He confesses them and is humbled for them, all the days of his life." 
3. "The shedding of Stephen's blood serves as a reminder of the cost of discipleship and the sacrifice that may be required for the sake of the Gospel."
