### Henry Alford:
1. "Not 'flinging off their garments,' as preparing to stone him, or even as representing the action of such preparation: the former would be futile, as he was in the custody of the tribune, the latter absurd, and not borne out by any known habit of the Jews: but shaking, jactitantes, their garments, as shaking off the dust, abominating such an expression and him who uttered it."
