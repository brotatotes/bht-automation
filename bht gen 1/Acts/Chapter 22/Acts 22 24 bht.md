# Acts 22:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When the tribune saw that the Jews were outraged by Paul's speech, he decided to remove him from their presence and examine him by the scourge. This method, although illegal, was used to test the truth of Paul's words. The tribune, not understanding the language Paul spoke, believed he must have committed a crime due to the intense reaction from the crowd. This unjust action aimed to extract a confession from Paul, revealing the tribune's concern for his own safety and the belief that Paul's words held hidden danger.
