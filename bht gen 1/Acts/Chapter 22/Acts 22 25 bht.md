# Acts 22:25 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this passage, we see the dramatic scene of Paul being bound and bent forward, ready to be scourged. The centurion, standing nearby, oversees the punishment. Paul, being a Roman citizen, asserts his rights boldly, questioning the legality of his treatment. Through his knowledge of Roman law, Paul defends himself against the unjust actions of those seeking to mistreat him. The physical position Paul is placed in, tied and bent forward, highlights the brutal and terrifying nature of this scene.
