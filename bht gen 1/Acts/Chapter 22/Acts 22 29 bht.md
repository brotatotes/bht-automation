### Philip Schaff:
1. "It is noticeable how the word rendered ‘should have examined’ had acquired the sense of ‘examining by torture.’"
2. "Although the stern rules which once forbade torture to be applied to any citizen of Rome had been violated even so early as the time of Tiberius, when torture was endured by citizens of the highest rank, still we imagine for a long while provincial officials would stand in awe of the old name which once was so venerated and still bore with it many precious privileges."
3. "On this occasion his claim to the citizenship saved him from the lictor’s rods, though he still remained ‘bound;’ for Acts 22:30 tells us he was not ‘loosed from his bands’ until the morrow, when he was brought before the Sanhedrim."
