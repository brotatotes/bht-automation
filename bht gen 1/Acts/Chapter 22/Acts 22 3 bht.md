# Acts 22:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, the narrator, who was a zealous Jew, recounts his upbringing and education in the strictest form of Judaism. He was raised in the city of Tarsus, but received instruction at the feet of the esteemed teacher Gamaliel. This education instilled in him a deep knowledge of the law and a fervent commitment to the Jewish traditions and customs. His zealousness was so strong that he became a persecutor of the early Christians. However, upon encountering Jesus, he experienced a transformation that led him to become a dedicated disciple and advocate for the Gospel.
