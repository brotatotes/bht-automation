# Acts 22:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, the voice from heaven resonates with such clarity in Paul's memory that he recalls it exactly as he heard it. The mention of "Hebrew" in Paul's account suggests a further connection to his identity. The use of Saul's Hebrew name, "Saoul," in the narrative emphasizes his transformation. The dramatic fall to the ground serves to highlight the authority and presence of the divine encounter, while the repetition of Saul's name adds a personal touch, showcasing Jesus' compassion. The piercing question, "Why persecutest thou me?" underscores the unity and solidarity within the body of Christ.
