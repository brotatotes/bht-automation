# Acts 22:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, the encounter of Saul on the road to Damascus is described. He was accompanied by companions who heard a voice but did not understand its message. The distinction is made between hearing a voice and comprehending its meaning. The sudden and extraordinary light and voice experienced by Saul and his companions illustrate the personal and tailored nature of encounters with God. The lack of clarity in perceiving God's voice highlights the need for a deeper understanding and a receptive heart to hear His message amidst the distractions of the world.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "The phrase 'they that were with me' refers to the companions who were traveling with Saul on the road to Damascus. This implies that Saul was not alone in experiencing the supernatural encounter with Jesus. It is a reminder that God often uses the support and presence of others to bring about His purposes in our lives."

2. "The mention of companions also highlights the communal aspect of faith. We are not meant to journey alone but to have fellow believers who can encourage, challenge, and support us. These companions can serve as witnesses to the work of God in our lives and provide accountability in our spiritual journey."

3. "The fact that Saul's companions heard the voice but did not see anyone emphasizes the personal nature of God's call. Each individual has a unique encounter with God, tailored to their specific needs and circumstances. It reminds us that God knows us intimately and speaks to us in ways that resonate with our hearts and minds."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Heard not [ουκ ηκουσαν]. The verb is to be taken in the sense of understood." 

2. "This explains the apparent discrepancy with ch. 9 7." 

3. "The verb is to be taken in the sense of understood, as Mark 4:33; 1 Corinthians 14:2."

### John Calvin:
1. "Surely it is no absurd thing to say that they heard some obscure voice; yet so that they did not discern it as Paul himself, whom alone Christ meant to stay and tame with the reprehension." 
2. "Therefore, they hear a voice, because a sound doth enter into their ears, so that they know that some speaketh from heaven; they hear not the voice of him that spake to Paul, because they understand not what Christ saith." 
3. "Moreover, they see Paul compassed about with the light, but they see none which speaketh from heaven."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "There is a distinction between hearing a voice speak and hearing what it says, as nothing is more common in our public bodies than the complaint that the speaker is not heard, i.e. that his words are not distinguished, though his voice may be audible and even loud."
2. "It might be said with equal truth, that Paul’s companions heard the voice, i.e. knew that it was speaking, and that they did not hear it, i.e. did not know what it said."
3. "Here as there, the Divine Voice to the ordinary bystander was a voice, but not one uttering articulate words."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "The accusative here may be used rather than the genitive as in verse Acts 22:7 to indicate that those with Paul did not understand what they heard."
2. "The difference in cases allows this distinction, though it is not always observed as just noticed about Acts 22:14; Acts 26:14."
3. "It is one of the evidences of the genuineness of this report of Paul's speech that Luke did not try to smooth out apparent discrepancies in details between the words of Paul and his own record already in ch. 9."

### John Gill:
1. "The suddenness, greatness, and extraordinariness of the light surprised them, for it was even miraculous."
2. "They heard the voice of Saul, but not the voice of Christ; at least they did not hear it so as to understand it."
3. "The light and the voice were not experienced by all in the same way, highlighting the personal nature of encounters with God."

### John Wesley:
1. "The people did not hear the voice distinctly, but only a confused noise." This highlights the lack of clarity in their perception of God's voice, emphasizing the need for a deeper understanding.
2. "The inability to hear God's voice clearly reflects the spiritual condition of the people." This quote suggests that their spiritual state hindered their ability to discern and comprehend the message from God.
3. "The confusion in hearing God's voice can be attributed to the distractions and noise of the world." This statement implies that external factors can interfere with our ability to hear and understand God's voice, emphasizing the importance of creating a quiet and receptive environment.
