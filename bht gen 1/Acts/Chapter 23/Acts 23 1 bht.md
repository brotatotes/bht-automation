## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "ἀτενίσας seems to describe that peculiar look, connected probably with infirmity of sight, with which Paul has already been described as regarding those before him: and may perhaps account for his not knowing that the person who spoke to him was the high priest." 

2. "The purport of Paul’s assertion seems to be this: being charged with neglecting, and teaching others to neglect the law of Moses, he at once endeavors to disarm those who thus accused him, by asserting that up to that day he had lived a true and loyal Jew, obeying, according to his conscience, the law of that divine πολιτεία of which he was a covenant member." 

3. "Thus πεπολίτευμαι τῷ θεῷ will have its full and proper meaning: and the words are no vain-glorious ones, but an important assertion of his innocence."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Paul, earnestly beholding the council—with a look of conscious integrity and unfaltering courage."
2. "I have lived in all good conscience before God until this day—The word has an indirect reference to the 'polity' or 'commonwealth of Israel,' of which he would signify that he had been, and was to that hour, an honest and God-fearing member."

2. "Men and brethren. He addresses the Sanhedrim as an equal."

### Philip Schaff:

2. "He begins as an equal speaking to equals; a former Sanhedrist to his ancient colleagues: ‘Brothers!’"
