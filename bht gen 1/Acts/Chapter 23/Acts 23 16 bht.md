# Acts 23:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
From the commentators' insights, we can gather that the Bible verse describes a plot against Paul's life. Paul's nephew, who happened to be in Jerusalem either for his studies or as a resident, discovered the conspiracy through his connections. With his knowledge of the plot, he promptly reported it to Paul. Despite the risk involved in accessing Paul, his nephew's act of intervention demonstrated both duty and affection towards his uncle. This episode showcases God's providence and his ability to frustrate human schemes, while also highlighting the privileges Paul enjoyed as a Roman citizen.

### Albert Barnes:

2. "It is possible that Paul might have a sister residing there; though, as Paul himself had been sent there formerly for his education, it seems more probable that this young man was sent there for the same purpose."
3. "Paul had the privileges of a Roman citizen, and as no well-founded charge had been laid against him, it is probable that he was not very closely confined, and that his friends might have free access to him."

2. "Though it is plain that he was not very closely confined, it was easy to have access to him; the reason might be, not only because he was a Roman, but because he was uncondemned, nor was any charge proved against him."
