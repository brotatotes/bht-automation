Paul's travels were marked by harsh treatment, as he was transported on beasts of burden and had the added burden of carrying his own baggage. The mention of Felix, a powerful and morally questionable figure, emphasizes the gravity of Paul's situation. Despite the challenges he faced, Paul remained adaptable and committed to spreading the message of the Gospel, relying on the support of others and enduring discomfort to fulfill his calling.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:

2. "Antonius Felix per omnem sævitiam et libidinem jus regium servili ingenio exercuit." (Translation: "Antonius Felix exercised royal authority with a slave's disposition through all manner of cruelty and lust.") 
3. "He was eventually recalled, and accused by the Cæsarean Jews, but acquitted at the instance of his brother Pallas."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Beasts...set Paul on" - This phrase suggests that Paul was treated like a wild animal, being transported on beasts of burden. It highlights the harsh and degrading treatment he endured during his journey.
2. "Relays, and to carry baggage" - This phrase implies that Paul was not only subjected to physical discomfort but also had the additional burden of carrying his own baggage. It emphasizes the difficult and challenging nature of his travels.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The word translated 'beasts' κτήνη ktēnē is of a general character, and may be applied either to horses, camels, or donkeys."
2. "His name was Antonius Felix. He was a freedman of Antonia, the mother of the Emperor Claudius."
3. "He governed with all the authority of a king, and the baseness and insolence of a slave."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The term 'beasts' in this verse refers to animals, as it is used in other parts of the Bible. It is important to note that animals are not inherently evil or sinful, but they are used here to illustrate the contrast between the actions of the Samaritan and the priest and Levite."

2. "The mention of beasts in this verse also highlights the compassionate and selfless nature of the Samaritan. While the priest and Levite chose to pass by the wounded man, the Samaritan showed mercy and went out of his way to help him, demonstrating the true meaning of love for one's neighbor."

3. "This verse serves as a reminder that our actions towards others should be driven by compassion and love, rather than indifference or self-interest. It challenges us to examine our own hearts and consider whether we are truly living out the commandment to love our neighbors as ourselves."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The career of this powerful and unprincipled man...is principally interesting to us as affording a good instance of the way in which high position and great dignity were acquired under the rule of the Cæsars in the first and second centuries of the Christian era."
2. "He was notoriously avaricious, cruel, and licentious, but withal a man of great energy and talent, wielding...the power of a tyrant with the temper of a slave."
3. "Felix reigned over Judæa some seven or eight years until he was recalled by Nero, who replaced him by Festus, A.D. 60."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Beasts (κτηνη παραστησα). Change from direct to indirect discourse just the opposite of that in verse Acts 23:22." 
2. "Asses or horses, but not war-horses. Since Paul was chained to a soldier, another animal would be required for baggage."
3. "Felix was one of the most depraved men of his time. Tacitus says of him that 'with all cruelty and lust he exercised the power of a king with the spirit of a slave.'"
