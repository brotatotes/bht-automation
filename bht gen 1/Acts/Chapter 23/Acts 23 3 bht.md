# Acts 23:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, a fervent Paul confronts Ananias, calling him out as a hypocrite, a whitewashed wall masking corruption within. Paul not only rebukes Ananias for unjustly ordering him to be struck but also prophesies God's retribution upon him for his deceitful actions. This denunciation, though spoken in righteous anger, reflects Paul's firm conviction and trust in God's justice to bring about deserved consequences for the wicked.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Our blessed Saviour is to us, in all His words and acts, the perfect pattern for all under all circumstances."
2. "That Paul thus answered, might go far to excuse a like fervent reply in a Christian or a minister of the gospel, but must never be used to justify it: it may serve for an apology, but never for an example."
3. "Some have seen a prophetic import in these words; see above on the death of Ananias. But I would rather take them as an expression founded on a conviction that God’s just retribution would come on unjust and brutal acts."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "God shall smite thee—as indeed He did; for he was killed by an assassin during the Jewish war." 
2. "Thou whited wall—that is, hypocrite." 
3. "This epithet, however correctly describing the man, must not be defended as addressed to a judge, though the remonstrance which follows—"for sittest thou," &c.—ought to have put him to shame."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "God shall smite thee - God shall punish thee. God is just; and he will not suffer such a manifest violation of all the laws of a fair trial to pass unavenged."
2. "That he could thus address the president of the council was not only strongly characteristic of the man, but was also a strong proof that he was conscious of innocence, and that justice was on his side."
3. "Thou whited wall - This is evidently a proverbial expression, meaning thou hypocrite. His hypocrisy consisted in the fact that while he pretended to sit there to do justice, he commanded the accused to be smitten in direct violation of the Law."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The words are not an imprecation, but a prophecy of punishment for his violent dealing."
2. "Thou whited wall."

### John Calvin:
1. "Christ doth not in these words require silence, whereby the wickedness and frowardness of the wicked may be nourished; but he doth only bridle their minds, that they may not take that injury, which they have already received, impatiently."
2. "Christ will have those that be his to be ready to suffer another injury after that they have already received one; and by this means he represseth all desire of revenge."
3. "If any man, being overcome with impatience, do but murmur, he shall not be blameless. But a manifest and sharp accusation, if it proceed from a quiet mind, doth not pass the bounds set down by Christ."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "These strange words, spoken no doubt in hot anger and excitement by the indignant prisoner, must of course be understood not as an imprecation, but as a prophetic denunciation of a future doom."
2. "The expression ‘whited wall,’ or hypocrite, was used with a slight variation by the Lord to the Pharisees and scribes."
3. "The Jews, as a rule, painted their sepulchres conspicuously white, that they might not defile themselves by unexpectedly coming in contact with them. Thus the walls of the sepulchre would be white and fair-seeming to the eye, but they would contain within, dead men’s bones and a mass of putrefying corruption."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Thou whited wall" - a picturesque way of calling Ananias a hypocrite, emphasizing Paul's perception of his true character as deceptive (Matthew 23:27).
2. "Clearly Paul felt that he, not Ananias, was living as a good citizen in God's commonwealth" - highlighting Paul's confidence in his own righteousness and commitment to God's kingdom.
3. "And thou (being what thou art) art sitting judging me" - expressing indignation at Ananias' position as judge, implying that he is unworthy or unfit for the role.

### John Gill:
1. "God shall smite thee,.... Which may be considered either as a prophecy of what would be, that God would smite him with some judgment here, or with death quickly, or with eternal damnation hereafter."
2. "Taking up his own words, and suggesting that a retaliation would be made, and that the measure he meted, would be measured to him again."
3. "And if this was Ananias, the son of Nebedaeus, as is generally thought, it is remarkable, that five years after this, in the beginning of the wars of the Jews with the Romans, this Ananias, hiding himself under the ruins of a conduit, was discovered, and taken out, and killed."

### John Wesley:
1. "Being carried away by a sudden and prophetic impulse."
2. "Fair without; full of dirt and rubbish within."
