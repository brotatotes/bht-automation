# Acts 23:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, the apostle Paul unintentionally speaks harshly towards the high priest during a hearing. The confusion surrounding the high priesthood at that time, with frequent changes and vacancies, may have contributed to Paul's lack of recognition. Nevertheless, Paul quickly acknowledges his mistake, expressing remorse for his impulsive words and showing respect for the authority of the high priesthood. Paul's response demonstrates his commitment to observing the Law and highlights his desire to maintain dignity in civil and spiritual governance.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1) "I did not know that it (or he) was the high priest."
2) "The objection stated by Wordsworth, 'If St. Paul could not discern that Ananias was high priest, how could he see that he sat there as his judge?' would of course be easily answered by supposing that Paul who had himself been a member of the Sanhedrim may have known Ananias by his voice: or indeed may not (as above) have known him at all personally."
3) "Implying in this, 'and the law is the rule of my life.'"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The high priesthood was in a state of great confusion and constant change at this time."
2. "The apostle's long absence from Jerusalem, and perhaps the manner in which he was habited or the seat he occupied, with other circumstances to us unknown, may account for such a speech."
3. "What can surpass the grace with which he recovered his self-possession, and the frankness with which he acknowledged his error? If his conduct in yielding to the momentary impulse was not that of Christ Himself under a similar provocation, certainly the manner in which he atoned for his fault was Christ-like."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "I wist not - I know not; I was ignorant of the fact that he was high priest."
2. "The true interpretation, therefore, I suppose, is what is derived from the fact that Ananias was not then properly the high priest; that there was a vacancy in the office, and that he presided by courtesy, or in virtue of his having been formerly invested with that office."
3. "Paul adduces this to show that it was his purpose to observe the Law; that he would not intentionally violate it; and that, if he had known Ananias to be high priest, he would have been restrained by his regard for the Law from using the language which he did."

### John Calvin:
1. "Therefore Paul knew what place he had, when he said that he abused his power."
2. "Therefore, this is the meaning of the words, Brethren, I acknowledge nothing in this man which belongeth to the priest."
3. "Therefore all dignity, which is appointed for maintenance of civil government, ought to be reverenced and had in honor."
4. "But when the spiritual government doth degenerate, the consciences of the godly are at liberty, and set free from obeying unjust authority."
5. "So it is not only lawful for the faithful at this day to shake off from their shoulders the Pope’s yoke, but they must do it of necessity, seeing they cannot obey his laws unless they forsake God."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Paul on this occasion ‘spoke unadvisedly with his lips,’ a fault which the noble-hearted man was himself, as we shall see, swift to acknowledge."
2. "Paul, at once recognizing he was wrong, simply and truthfully confesses that when he had uttered the reviling angry words, he had not considered that it was the high priest of Israel whom he was addressing."
3. "I spake the angry words without reflection. I thought at that moment of bitter indignation nothing of high priest or president of the supreme council of Israel."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The Greek naturally means that Paul did not know that it was the high priest who gave the order to smite his mouth." 
2. "Paul may have had poor eyesight or the high priest may not have been sitting in the official seat." 
3. "Paul at once recognizes the justice of the point made against him. He had been guilty of irreverence against the office of high priest as the passage from Exodus 22:18 (LXX) shows and confesses his fault, but the rebuke was deserved."

### John Gill:
1. "He did not really know him, either because he had been long absent from Jerusalem; and besides there were new high priests made, sometimes every year, and sometimes oftener, that it is no wonder he should not know him."
2. "The priests, both the high priest, and the common priests, only wore their priestly robes when they ministered in their office, and at other times they wore other clothes, as laymen did."
3. "Ananias not being in the discharge of his office, nor in his habit, the apostle did not know, or own him as an high priest, or consider him as in such a station."

### John Wesley:
1. "He seems to mean, I did not advert to it, in the prophetic transport of my mind: but he does not add, that his not adverting to it proceeded from the power of the Spirit coming upon him; as knowing they were not able to bear it."
2. "This answer admirably shows the situation of mind he was then in, partly with regard to the bystanders, whom he thus softens, adding also the title of brethren, and justifying their reproof by the prohibition of Moses."
3. "Partly with regard to himself, who, after that singular transport subsided, was again under the direction of the general command."
