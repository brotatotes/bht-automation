# Acts 23:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, we see a heated debate taking place among different factions. The Pharisees, holding a strong opposition to Christianity, join forces with Paul against their common rival, the Sadducees. The intensity of their disagreement reaches a point where they resort to a loud clamor and fierce arguing. The remark made by one of the Pharisees suggests that if Paul had received any divine revelation, they should not fight against God. This verse emphasizes the consequences of disagreement, the importance of doctrine, and the resistance to divine revelation.

### John Calvin:
1. "This place doth teach what mischief disagreements bring with them. For because they take their beginning for the most part of ambition, men proceed thence unto contention, and straightway stubbornness breaketh out."
