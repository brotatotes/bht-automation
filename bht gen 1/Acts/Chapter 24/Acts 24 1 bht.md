# Acts 24:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, we encounter Paul's trial where he is accused by the Sanhedrin, led by the high priest Ananias and a group of elders. To strengthen their case, they hire a skilled rhetorician named Tertullus, who is well-versed in Roman law and procedures. The Jews, not familiar with these forms, rely on a Roman advocate for proper representation. Despite the plot against him and the manipulative tactics used in court, Paul remains steadfast in enduring these challenging circumstances. The providence of God is evident here, as Paul courageously faces these fierce assaults aided by divine protection.
