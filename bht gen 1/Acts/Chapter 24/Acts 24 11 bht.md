# Acts 24:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The passage under consideration involves Paul addressing Felix, who had been a judge among the Jews for a long time. This knowledge of Jewish affairs allows Felix to thoroughly investigate the charges brought against Paul, which occurred during a short period. The defense Paul presents focuses on emphasizing the innocence of his actions and clarifying the purpose of his visit to Jerusalem as a worshipper rather than an instigator of sedition. Despite the various calculations and attempts to find errors in the narrative, the record remains faithful and noble, testament to the foundational stories of Christianity.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:

2. "This, which is also De Wette and Meyer’s arrangement, is far more natural than that of Kuin., Olsh., Heinr., &c., who suppose that the days which he had already spent at Cæsarea are not to be counted."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Paul does not mean to say that Felix could understand the case because he had been many years a judge of that nation."
2. "The defense of Paul here is, that but twelve days elapsed from the time that he went to Jerusalem until he was put under the custody of Felix; and that during so short a time it was wholly improbable that he would have been able to excite sedition."
3. "He had gone up for the peaceful purpose of devotion, and not to produce riot and disorder."

### John Calvin:
1. "He came with no other mind, but to profess himself to be a worshipper of God, and to approve the holiness of the temple by his worshipping."
2. "The faithful servants of Christ were not forbidden to worship in the temple, so they did not tie holiness to the place, but did lift up pure hands freely without making choice of places."
3. "Therefore religion did not compel him to come to Jerusalem according to the appointment of the law, as if the sanctuary were the face of God as in times past; yet he doth not abhor the external worship which was unto men a testimony of godliness."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The ‘twelve days’ are best reckoned thus: 1st Day. Arrival at Jerusalem; meeting with James, the Lord’s brother, the head of the Christian Church at Jerusalem." 
2. "A good deal of time has been spent, we might even say wasted, in the calculation of these days, and how they were to be reckoned so as to justify the various notes as to time scattered up and down the narrative." 
3. "Like the other small chronological and geographical alleged discrepancies in these Acts, it is only the cavilling, hostile spirit seeking to find errors where none really exist, which finds difficulties in this noble and faithful record of the laying the foundation stories of Christianity."
