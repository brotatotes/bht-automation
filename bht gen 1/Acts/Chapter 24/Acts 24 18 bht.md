# Acts 24:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the midst of offering gifts and engaging in the sacred rituals of the temple, certain Jews from Asia found me purified and involved in worship. My actions were not disruptive or attention-seeking, but rather a commitment to fulfilling my religious obligations and maintaining the sanctity of the temple. Despite the accusations of profaning the temple, I was actually acting in accordance with its worship and service.
