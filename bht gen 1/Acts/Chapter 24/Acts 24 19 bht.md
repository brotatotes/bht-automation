## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The sentence is an anacoluthon: δεῖ is absolutely asserted in the present: then ἔχοιεν in the opt. follows, as if the hypothetical ἔδει had been used: and hence the correction to ἔδει." 
2. "On the opt. after the hypothetical indicative, see Bern-hardy, Syntax, p. 386 ff."
3. "This also is a skilful argument on the part of the Apostle: it being the custom of the Romans not to judge a prisoner without the accusers face to face, he deposes that his real accusers were the Asiatic Jews who first raised the cry against him in the temple, not the Sanhedrim, who merely received him at the hands of others, and that these were not present."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "They were the proper witnesses, and as they had staid away it showed that they were not prepared to undergo a strict examination."
2. "They alone could testify as to anything that occurred in the temple."
3. "As they were not present, that charge ought to be dismissed."

### John Calvin:
1. "Ye which lay so many things to my charge, cannot tell how the matter standeth; but you bring before the judgment-seat of the governor a tale which was rashly believed." 
2. "After that Paul hath turned back [retorted] the crime upon others, taking to himself a good courage, he doth now appeal unto the adversaries which are present, willing them if they know anything by him freely to utter it."
3. "For his meaning is, in my judgment, that he was ready to give an account of all things in their council. And that they knew nothing then which they can lay to his charge, because they began to stir only for this one voice, when he said that he was judged of the resurrection of the dead."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Paul urges that his accusers really were not the Sanhedrim nor the Jews then in court, but certain foreign pilgrims from Ephesus (Asia)." 
2. "This was happily urged by the apostle, as it was the Roman custom not to judge a prisoner on any charge unless the accusers were present." 
3. "These we hear nothing of now; they had doubtless tarried behind in Jerusalem, or had already set out on their return journey."

### Archibald T Robertson:

2. "The accusers who were present had not witnessed the alleged offense: those who could have given evidence at first-hand were not present."

### John Wesley:
1. "The world never commit greater blunders, even against its own laws, than when it is persecuting the children of God."
2. "Persecution often blinds people to the truth and causes them to act in ways that go against their own principles and laws."
3. "The presence of God's children should be a reminder to the world of its own shortcomings and the need for repentance."
