# Acts 24:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This passage describes a powerful individual, Felix, who was known for his controversial rule. Though some commentators mentioned flattery towards Felix, it is acknowledged that he achieved a level of peace and order in his administration, effectively suppressing lawlessness and violence. However, there are also mentions of his cruelty, corruption, and manipulation, as well as his infamous character that caused trouble in the provinces under his rule. The speech given about Felix presents a stark contrast to the honesty and integrity of St. Paul's own words.
