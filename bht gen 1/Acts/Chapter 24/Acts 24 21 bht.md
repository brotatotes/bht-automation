But the fact is, I came from a distance to Jerusalem to worship in the temple; and to bring alms of charity, and also offerings of piety, as a Nazarite; and they themselves found me in the temple, engaged in a holy service, proving my respect for the temple; and they who accuse me of profaning it were guilty of profanation, in abetting those who seized me when there employed in a religious act, of which they prevented the completion.’"
