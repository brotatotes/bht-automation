# Acts 24:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we encounter a woman named Drusilla who was the daughter of Herod Agrippa I, sister of Agrippa II, and a Jewess. She was persuaded by Felix, who was infatuated with her beauty, to leave her husband and be with him. She later bore a son, and tragically, both Drusilla and her son perished in an eruption of Mount Vesuvius. The mention of Drusilla's marriage to Felix and the faith in Christ may have influenced Paul's discourse before them, particularly focusing on temperance.
