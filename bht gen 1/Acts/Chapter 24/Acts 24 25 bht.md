# Acts 24:25 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, the apostle Paul fearlessly confronted Felix, the unjust and corrupt judge, with the truth of the gospel. Paul emphasized the importance of righteousness, self-control, and the certainty of judgment to come. Through powerful preaching, Paul aimed to bring conviction to Felix's heart, exposing his need for salvation and change. Unfortunately, despite being stirred by the message, Felix did not fully yield to the truth and missed the opportunity for genuine transformation. We should learn from this encounter and avoid false dependencies that hinder us from responding to the convicting power of God's Word.

1. "The Christian teacher apparently never touched on the ‘evidences of his faith,’ said nothing of his own life nothing in connection with his own experience of shame at the hands of men, or of surpassing glory at the hands of God."
2. "With that marvellous power none seem to have been possessed like the inspired Paul, he spoke of ‘life’ rather than of ‘doctrine,’ with evidently special reference to the brilliant but mistaken lives of the pair who, surrounded with all the majesty of the ensign of the great Empire, sat in royal state, while he stood a friendless, poor-clad prisoner before them."
3. "No doubt among those precious parchments we read of in his last sad words to Timothy not many years later (2 Timothy 4:13), were records written by the older apostles, men who had been with the Lord during the days of His earthly teaching memories of the Divine words uttered in those solemn hours of communion, and many of which we now possess, most precious gems, set in the gold of the gospel setting."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Paul turned the tables completely around and expounded 'the faith in Christ Jesus' as it applied to Felix and Drusilla and discoursed concerning 'righteousness' which they did not possess, 'self-control' or temperance which they did not exhibit, and 'the judgment to come' which was certain to overtake them." 

2. "Felix was brought under conviction, but apparently not Drusilla. Like another Herodias her resentment was to be feared."

### John Gill:
1. "The apostle not only discoursed concerning the doctrine of faith in Christ, but insisted upon the duties of religion: and particularly he reasoned upon righteousness; not justifying righteousness, that is only the righteousness of Christ, but the exercise of justice, or the doing of righteousness between man and man."
2. "He might show, that it was the loss of righteousness which was the reason of the first man being removed from his place and state of happiness, in which he was whilst innocent; and that to admit persons into heaven without a righteousness, is contrary to the pure and holy nature of God, who loves righteousness, and hates iniquity."
3. "He might also reason upon the want of righteousness, which is in every man; how that the first man having lost his righteousness, all his posterity are destitute of one; and that they are not able to work out one acceptable to God, and which will justify in his sight; that the thing is impracticable and impossible, and that that which men call a righteousness is not one, at least is not a justifying one."
