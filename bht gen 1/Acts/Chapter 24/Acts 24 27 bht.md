# Acts 24:27 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
During his imprisonment in Caesarea, Paul awaited a second hearing under the governorship of Porcius Festus, who succeeded Felix. The corrupt Felix, driven by personal gain and hoping to appease the Jews, left Paul bound as he departed his province. However, Felix's attempts to please the Jews and secure his own favor were ultimately futile, as Paul's innocence became evident and accusations against him followed even to Rome. This period of confinement not only tested Paul's patience but also served as a time for Luke to gather material and potentially begin writing his Gospel.

### John Calvin:
1. "Seeing Paul knew that the judge who did gape for gain would be favorable to him so soon as he should offer him money, and seeing he had sufficient time to gather the same; it is likely that he did not only bear with the brethren, but also detest such bribery, wherewith the holiness of civil order is shamefully polluted."
2. "Now, whereas governors use to let loose such prisoners as they know are not guilty when they go from the province, Felix took the contrary way to win favor."
3. "The Jews had often complained of his filthy gain, of his extortion, cruelty, and unruly government.
