# Acts 25:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the apostle Paul invokes his right as a Roman citizen to appeal his case to Caesar, the supreme power. He firmly asserts his innocence, stating that if he is guilty, it is Caesar who must judge him, not his accusers. Paul's action is not a mere submission to political convenience, but a bold and rightful use of the laws to ensure that justice is served. His unwavering conviction in his innocence and determination to bear witness to Christ in the imperial city of Rome are demonstrated through his appeal.
