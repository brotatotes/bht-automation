# Acts 25:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, we see the power dynamics of the Roman legal system come into play. The arrival of the Jewish leaders who were determined to bring Paul to trial signifies the intense opposition he faced from his own people. As Festus, the new governor, takes charge of the case, his promptness and eagerness to address the matter at hand highlight his commitment to justice. With a command, he asserts his authority as he orders the accused to be brought forth, showing his role as a judge in the proceedings.
