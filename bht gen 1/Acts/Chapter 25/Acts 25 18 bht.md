# Acts 25:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, we see the accusers standing up, exhibiting their charges against Paul, with passion and vehemence as they bear their testimonies and present their proofs. Paul, being left in bonds and aware of the chief priests' and elders' violence against him, expected to face serious charges, supposing that the accusers were carried away by their own zeal and fervor. However, it is evident that their enthusiasm may have clouded their judgment, leading them astray in their accusations.
