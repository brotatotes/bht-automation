# Acts 25:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This verse is a dialogue between Festus and Agrippa, where Festus describes Paul's beliefs. Commentators note that Festus uses the term "δεισιδαιμονία" to describe Paul's religion, suggesting it carries connotations of religious devotion or piety. Festus's use of the term may not necessarily be disrespectful, as he was speaking to Agrippa, a Jew. However, some commentators observe that Festus's mention of Jesus is scornful and dismissive. Overall, commentators note that Festus does not fully grasp the significance of Paul's message and the resurrection of Jesus.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "δεισιδαιμ. is used by Festus in a middle sense, certainly not as = ‘superstition,’ E. V., speaking as he was to Agrippa, a Jew."
2. "The term δεισιδαιμονία (deisidaimonia) carries the connotation of excessive fear or anxiety about religious matters."
3. "Festus uses this term to describe Paul's beliefs, suggesting that he sees them as a form of religious devotion or piety rather than mere superstition."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "It cannot be supposed that Festus would use the word in any discourteous sense in addressing his Jewish guest."
2. "Thus speaks this miserable Festus of Him to whom every knee shall bow."
3. "The insignificance of the whole affair in the eyes of Festus is manifest."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Certain inquiries, or litigated and disputed subjects; certain points of dispute in which they differed."
2. "It was the word by which the worship of the Greeks and Romans, and, therefore, of Festus himself, was denoted, and he would naturally use it in a similar sense in applying it to the Jews."
3. "He meant, therefore, to say simply that they had certain inquiries about their own religion, but accused him of no crime against the Roman laws."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "He left Agrippa 'to take the word in a good sense, but reserved his own view, which was certainly the Roman one" (Meyer).
2. "There is, indeed, a similar tact in Paul's use of the word to the Athenians. He selected 'a word which almost imperceptibly shaded off from praise to blame'" (Trench).
3. "The imperfect implies something habitual. 'Paul kept asserting'" (commentary).

### Philip Schaff:
1. "This word is one which may be understood in a bad sense, viz. a ‘superstition;’ but it also signifies ‘religion,’ without a shade of disrespect or slight being intended to be conveyed." 
2. "The strict, unfaltering accuracy of the writer of these ‘Acts,’ in recording at all such a scornful remark, is especially noteworthy."
3. "He evidently, on those occasions, by no means confined himself to the general doctrine of the resurrection taught in all the Pharisee schools in Jerusalem and elsewhere, but dwelt earnestly on the special connection of these doctrines with the resurrection of their loved Master, the Lord Jesus."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Concerning their own religion... Festus would hardly mean 'superstition,' whatever he really thought, because Agrippa was a Jew." 
2. "This is the climax of supercilious scorn toward both Paul and 'one Jesus.'"
3. "With all his top-loftical airs Festus has here correctly stated the central point of Paul's preaching about Jesus as no longer dead, but living."

### John Gill:
1. "The Jews objected to him among other things, his belief in Jesus of Nazareth, whom they traduced as an impostor and deceiver."
2. "Paul on the other hand argued, that he was the true Messiah; and in proof of it, affirmed that though they had put him to death, he was risen from the dead."
3. "Festus, it is very likely, had never heard of Jesus before, and therefore speaks of him in this manner; or if he had, he had entertained a contemptible opinion of him, as well as of the Jewish religion."

### John Wesley:
1. "How coldly does he mention the things of the last importance!"
2. "Thus does Festus speak of Him, to whom every knee shall bow!"
3. "Only because thou didst not search into the evidence of it."
