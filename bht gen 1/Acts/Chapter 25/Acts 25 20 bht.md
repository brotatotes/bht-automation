## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The real reason why he proposed this" (Acts 25:9) is concealed, as he claims to refer the matter to the judgment of the Jews themselves. 
2. The use of the phrase "so σὺ δʼ εἰς τὰ μητρὸς μὴ φοβοῦ νυμφεύματα" (Soph. Œd. Tyr. 980) and "ἀμφινοῶ ἐς τέρας" (Antig. 372) suggests a sense of fear or hesitation in approaching the topic.
3. The construction of the sentence is mixed, combining elements of "I said, wilt thou?" and "I asked him whether he would..." (Acts 25:9).

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "I," as a Roman judge, being at a loss how to deal with such matters.
2. The doubt expressed by the judge reflects his uncertainty and confusion.
3. The judge's questioning reveals his struggle to understand and make sense of the situation.

### Albert Barnes:

1. "Being perplexed (απορουμενος). Present middle participle of the common verb απορεω (α privative and πορος way), to be in doubt which way to turn." 

2. "How to inquire concerning these things (την περ τουτων ζητησιν). Literally, 'as to the inquiry concerning these things.' This is not the reason given by Luke in verse Acts 25:9 (wanting to curry favour with the Jews), but doubtless this motive also actuated Festus as both could be true." 

3. "Whether he would go to Jerusalem (ε βουλοιτο πορευεσθα εις Ιεροσολυμα). Optative in indirect question after ελεγον (asked or said) imperfect active, though the present indicative could have been retained with change of person: 'Dost thou wish, etc.,' (ε βουλη, etc.)."
