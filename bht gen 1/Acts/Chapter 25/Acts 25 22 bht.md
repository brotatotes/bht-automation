# Acts 25:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we see Agrippa's curiosity and desire to hear Paul's defense. As a Jew, Agrippa is not only interested in the national impact of Paul's actions but also wants to gain further knowledge about the Christian religion. His wish to personally meet and hear from Paul reflects the significance of Paul's influence in reshaping Jewish society. Despite differing opinions among commentators, Agrippa's genuine interest and the carefully planned gathering set the stage for a momentous encounter.
