# Acts 25:26 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, Paul stands before Festus, who is perplexed by the charges against him. Festus hoped that King Agrippa, well-versed in Jewish matters, could shed light on the case. As the charges brought against Paul crumbled, it became clear that there was no legitimate accusation, only a jumble of false accusations. The title "Lord," once refused by emperors, was now being used by Nero, which brought validity to Paul's testimony of sound doctrine.
