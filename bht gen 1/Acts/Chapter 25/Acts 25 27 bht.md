# Acts 25:27 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, the accused person is bound like a criminal, and the charges against them are serious and substantial. The Roman officials are perplexed and curious to know the truth behind the allegations, and are seeking a thorough examination of the case. Despite his initial skepticism, Festus realizes the importance of a fair and just investigation, as a confounding report could have negative consequences for him in Rome. This scrutiny, however, reflects the significant impact and influence that the accused person, Paul, has had on the Jewish community.

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Paul was right when he said, 'The king knoweth of these things... for I am persuaded that none of these things are hidden from him; for this thing was not done in a corner'." 

2. "Hence his curiosity to see and hear the man who had raised such commotion and was remodelling to such an extent the whole Jewish life."

3. "The king's desire to personally witness and listen to this man reflects the significant impact and influence Paul had on the Jewish community."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "When prisoners were thus sent to Rome to be tried before the emperor, it would be proper that the charges should be all specified, and the evidence stated by which they were supported, Yet Festus could do neither, and it is not wonderful that he felt himself perplexed and embarrassed." 
2. "In the case of Agrippa, we have an instance of the reasons which induce many people to hear the gospel. He had no belief in it; he had no concern for its truth or its promises; but he was led by curiosity to desire to hear a minister of the gospel of Christ." 
3. "In Paul we have the example of a man unlike both Festus and Agrippa. He felt a deep interest in the subject a subject which pertained as much to them as to him. He was willing not only to look at it, but to stake his life, his reputation, his all, on its truth."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The word 'charges' emphasizes the legal aspect of the crimes, indicating that there is a formal accusation against the person."
2. "By using the term 'charges,' the author highlights the seriousness of the crimes, suggesting that they are not mere accusations but have substantial evidence to support them."
3. "The word 'charges' implies that there is a legal process involved, indicating that the crimes will be thoroughly investigated and justice will be served."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Festus hoped, and not without reason, that the examination before so great a man as Agrippa one, too, who was so well versed in the difficult question of Jewish law and tradition would elicit fresh facts hitherto kept in the background."
2. "By listening to the proceedings, the Roman official felt he personally would become better acquainted with the secret history of the whole affair, and more competent to write a clear and definite report to the authorities at home."
3. "He had newly come into office, and he was aware that a confused, contradictory statement might seriously injure him at Rome."

### Archibald T Robertson:

2. Note accusative case with the infinitive σημανα though μο (dative) just before.
3. This naive confession of Festus reveals how unjust has been his whole treatment of Paul.

### John Gill:
1. "A man bound as if he was a malefactor, and guilty of some heinous crimes."
2. "It seemed to Festus an absurd thing, and what might be justly looked upon by his master, a foolish, silly, and stupid piece of conduct."
3. "To send him a prisoner, and not signify in his letter to him, what was laid to his charge; and yet this was so dark and obscure, that he could not tell what to make of it."
