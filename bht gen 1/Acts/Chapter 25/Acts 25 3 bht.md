# Acts 25:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, a dangerous plot against Paul is revealed. The individuals involved were not seeking a positive outcome, but rather aimed to condemn and harm him. Their deep hostility and persistent thirst for his blood are evident, even after the failure of a previous attempt. The use of the word "ambush" implies cunning, deceit, and a surprise attack. The historical context of the region being filled with hired assassins further emphasizes the dangerous and volatile situation. The unconditional malice and scheming nature of those involved demonstrates the care of Providence over Paul's life.
