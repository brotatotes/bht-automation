# Acts 25:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we see Festus, driven by a desire to please the Jews and gain favor, suggesting that Paul be judged in Jerusalem. However, God's hidden hand is at work, guiding the situation towards His divine plan. As a Roman citizen, Paul has the right to appeal to Rome. Although Festus could have made the decision himself, God's providence is orchestrating events to bring about Paul's ultimate appeal to Rome.

### Henry Alford:
