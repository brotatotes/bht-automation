# Acts 26:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, we see the story of Saul, who, driven by his hatred and zeal, relentlessly persecuted Christians even in foreign cities. He vigorously punished and scourged believers, attempting to force them to blaspheme and deny Jesus as the Messiah. His relentless persecution caused some weaker brothers and sisters to succumb to blasphemy, leading to unspeakable sadness. Saul's dedication to stamping out this faith seemed unshakeable, but his transformative encounter with Christ on the road to Damascus would ultimately change the entire course of his life.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "τιμωρῶν] viz. by scourging; compare Matthew 10:17." This quote highlights the connection between the word "τιμωρῶν" and the act of scourging, drawing a parallel to a verse in Matthew and providing context for the term.

2. "ἠνάγκαζον does not imply that any did blaspheme (Christ: so Pliny, Ep. n. 97, speaks of ordering the Bithynian Christians 'maledicere Christo,' and adds, 'quorum nihil cogi posse dicuntur qui sunt revera Christiani'): the imperf. only relates the attempt." This quote clarifies that the use of the word "ἠνάγκαζον" does not imply that anyone actually blasphemed Christ, but rather refers to the attempt to force them to do so.

3. "The persecuting the Christians even to foreign cities, forms the transition to the narrative following." This quote highlights the significance of the persecution of Christians in foreign cities as a transition point in the narrative, suggesting that it sets the stage for what is to come.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It was not to make them blaspheme or reproach God, but to deny that Jesus was the Messiah, and to reproach him as a deceiver and an impostor."
2. "It is certainly not impossible that a few might thus have been induced by the authority of the Sanhedrin and by the threats of Paul to do it, but it is certain that the great mass of Christians adhered firmly to their belief that Jesus was the Messiah."
3. "None but a madman will persecute people on account of their religious opinions; and all persecutions have been conducted like this, with the violence, the fury, and the ungovernable temper of maniacs."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Persons were always scourged in the presence of the judges. For, punishment being designed in terrorem, what more likely to strike the mind with awe, and deter men from falling into like errors, than to have it executed in their religious assemblies and in the face of the congregation?"
2. "The dead saints; these, though he knew it not then, he had helped in the morning of their battle to win their crown. But here was a thought of unspeakable sadness: there were some weaker brothers, some timid sisters; these his harsh words and cruel deeds had compelled to blaspheme that glorious name by which they were called."
3. "How he once detested these poor persecuted saints, how he loathed their cause! His whole life was devoted to the work of stamping out this strange devotion to One who had been crucified, and who these deluded men and women affirmed had risen again."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Punishing (τιμωρων). Old word τιμωρεω originally to render help, to succor (τιμωρος, from τιμη and ουρος), then to avenge (for honour)." 
2. "I strove to make them blaspheme (ηναγκαζον βλασφημειν). Conative imperfect active of αναγκαζω, old verb from αναγκη (necessity, compulsion)." 
3. "The word 'persecute' is the Latin persequor, to follow through or after. It is a vivid picture that Paul here paints of his success in hunting big game, a grand heresy hunt."

### John Gill:
1. "I punished them oft in every synagogue... by beating and scourging them there." 
2. "Compelled them to blaspheme; the Lord Jesus Christ, both to deny him to be the Messiah, and to call him accursed."
3. "Being exceeding mad against them; full of malice, envy, and hatred."
4. "I persecuted them even to strange cities; particularly Damascus."
5. "Through the violence of his persecution he obliged them to fly to strange cities, where they were foreigners and strangers."

### John Wesley:
1. "I compelled them — That is, some of them; to blaspheme - This is the most dreadful of all!"
2. "Repent, ye enemies of the Gospel."
3. "If Spira, who was compelled, suffered so terribly, what will become of those who compel, like Saul, but do not repent like him."
