## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:

2. "It is a Greek, and not (apparently) a Hebrew proverb; but this is no reason why it should not be used in Hebrew, just as it is in Latin."
3. "Instances of its use are Pind. Pyth. ii. 173: χρὴ δὲ πρὸς θεὸν οὐκ ἐρίζειν … φέρειν δ ʼ ἐλαφρῶς ἐπαυχένιον λαβόντα ζυγὸν ἀρήγει . ποτὶ κέντρον δέ τοι λακτιζέμεν τελέθει ὀλισθηρὸς οἶμος."
