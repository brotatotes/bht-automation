# Acts 26:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we see a powerful depiction of the transformative impact of the Gospel message. Through the preaching of Paul and his fellow ministers, the eyes of both Jews and Gentiles are opened to the truth. This revelation brings about a turning point in their lives, as they are moved from darkness and under the power of Satan to the light and love of God. This process of conversion is marked by faith, leading to forgiveness, sanctification, and the ultimate hope of glory.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The general reference of οὕς becomes tacitly modified...applicable only to the Gentiles. But in reality, and in Paul’s mind, they had their sense as applied to Jews, who were in spiritual darkness and under Satan’s power, however little they thought it." 
2. "A third step: first the opening of the eyes next, the turning to God next, the receiving remission of sins and a place among the sanctified." 
3. "Thus the great object of Paul’s preaching was to awaken and show the necessity and efficacy of πίστις ἡ εἰς ἐμέ. And fully, long ere this, had he recognized and acted on this his great mission."

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "The whole passage leans upon Isaiah 61:1."
2. "Note the connection here between being 'turned from darkness' and 'from the power of Satan,' whose whole power over men lies in keeping them in the dark."
3. "Faith is here made the instrument of salvation at once in its first stage, forgiveness, and its last, admission to the home of the sanctified; and the faith which introduces the soul to all this is emphatically declared by the glorified Redeemer to rest upon Himself—'FAITH, even THAT WHICH IS IN ME.'"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Ignorance is represented by the eyes being closed, and the instruction of the gospel by the opening of the eyes."
2. "From the darkness of paganism and sin to the light and purity of the gospel."
3. "The pagan world, lying in sin and superstition, is represented as under his control; and this passage teaches, doubtless, that the great mass of the people of this world are the subjects of the kingdom of Satan, and are led captive by him at his will."

### John Calvin:
1. "But this is a common thing, that God doth translate unto his ministers that honor which is due to himself alone, not that he may take any thing from himself, but that he may commend that mighty working of his Spirit which he doth show forth in them."
2. "Therefore, teachers are sent, not to utter their words in vain in the air, or to beat the ears only with a vain sound, but to bring lively light to the blind, to fashion again men’s hearts unto the righteousness of God, and to ratify the grace of salvation which is gotten by the death of Christ."
3. "Therefore, in my judgment, this member, and that which followeth, express both one thing, to be turned from the power of Satan unto God. For that renewing which Paul declareth more largely in the second chapter to the Ephesians, is expressed in divers forms of speech."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The two great features in Jesus Christ’s life and work which shocked His own people and drove them into fierce rebellion, were (1) In His life, He presented, the true image of a suffering Messiah. (2) In His work, begun by Himself and faithfully carried on by His disciples, He showed that the kingdom of the future was not intended to be confined to the old chosen race, nor to the old Holy Land, but that the chosen race of the future was to be made up of all mankind, and the Holy Land of the future was to consist of all the countries of the world."
2. "The purpose and end of Saul’s life-work is here sketched out. The peoples who had hitherto sat in darkness and in the shadow of death, were to be guided into a knowledge of their state, of their slavery to sin, of the impossibility of their being able to help or redeem themselves, of their utter hopelessness as regards the future. Their eyes were to be opened."
3. "The second was to tell them of the one fountain where all sin and uncleanness might be washed away a fountain open to Gentile as well as Jew; they were to be told how to turn from Satan to God. The third step was to show what would be the result of this opening the blind eyes and this seeing their real state, and of their turning to God. Forgiveness of all sin would follow, and they would win a place among the sanctified, a home in one of the many mansions of the redeemed and restored."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "These important words of Jesus to Paul give his justification to this cultured audience for his response to the command of Jesus."
2. "This was the turning point in Paul's career and it was a step forward and upward."
3. "Sanctified by faith in me (ηγιασμενοις πιστε τη εις εμε). Perfect passive participle of αγιαζω, instrumental case of πιστε, article before εις εμε ('by faith, that in me')."

### John Gill:
1. "To have them opened, is to have them enlightened, to see their lost state and condition by nature, the exceeding sinfulness of sin, the plague of their own hearts, the impurity of nature, the impotence of man to that which is spiritually good, the imperfection of obedience, and the insufficiency of a man's righteousness to justify him before God."
2. "Conversion is the end of the Gospel ministry, and illumination is necessary to it; yea, it lies in a turn from darkness to light, as is here expressed."
3. "This is what every enlightened soul sees it needs, and is desirous of; it is the first thing it wants, and asks at the hands of God; and nothing can be more suitable to its case, and welcome to it; and this is the good news which is declared in the ministry of the Gospel."

### John Wesley:
1. "He opens them, who sends Paul; and he does it by Paul who is sent."
2. "That they may turn... from the power of Satan, who now holds them in sin, guilt, and misery, to the love and happy service of God."
3. "That they may receive through faith... pardon, holiness, and glory."
