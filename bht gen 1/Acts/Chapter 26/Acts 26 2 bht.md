# Acts 26:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this particular Bible verse, the apostle Paul expresses his gratitude for the opportunity to defend himself before King Agrippa, who possessed a deep understanding of Jewish customs and beliefs. Paul's approach to his defense is characterized by his emphasis on doctrine and the facts of the case, rather than mere flattery or praise. His reference to King Agrippa by name establishes a personal connection and enhances the intimacy of the conversation. Overall, this verse highlights the importance of presenting a strong defense rooted in knowledge and understanding of religious doctrines.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The omission of the article before Ἰουδαίων expresses that the charges were made by some, not by all of the Jews."
2. "The omission of the article after a preposition is often overlooked by German critics."
3. "μέλλων contains the ground of ἥγημαι, in that I am to defend myself."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "I esteem it a favor and a privilege to be permitted to make my defense before one acquainted with Jewish customs and opinions."
2. "Paul now rejoiced to know that he was before one who, from his acquaintance with the Jewish customs and belief, would be able to appreciate his arguments."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Happy [μακαριον] . See on blessed, Matthew 5:3." 

2. "Answer [απολογεισθαι] . See on 1 Peter 3:15." 

3. "The term 'happy' in this verse carries a deeper meaning of being blessed or fortunate in a spiritual sense, rather than just experiencing temporary happiness. It points to a state of inner contentment and fulfillment that comes from living in alignment with God's will."

### John Calvin:
1. "He doth not use any plain or usual form of defense, but doth rather apply his speech unto doctrine."
2. "The more expert a man is in the Scripture, the more attentive must he be when the question is about religion."
3. "It is meet that we be so careful for the worship of God, that it do not grieve us to hear those things which belong to the defining thereof."

Note: The commentary is quite lengthy, so I have selected three quotes that provide insights into Paul's approach to his defense and the importance of understanding and engaging with religious doctrine.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "I think myself happy, king Agrippa, because I shall answer for myself this day before thee touching all the things whereof I am accused of the Jews." - Paul expresses his genuine satisfaction in being able to defend himself before King Agrippa, recognizing his deep understanding of Jewish hopes and beliefs.

2. "Paul says not one word in praise of the young sovereign: he simply with courtesy prefaces his earnest and impassioned words with expressing his satisfaction." - The commentary highlights Paul's respectful approach, focusing on the opportunity to present his defense rather than flattering King Agrippa.

3. "The accusations which were made against him all had reference to these hopes and onlooks, and no one but a learned Jew could possibly understand the charges made against him, or the defence he was about to make." - The commentary emphasizes the significance of Agrippa's knowledge and understanding of Jewish beliefs, as the accusations against Paul were deeply rooted in these religious concepts.

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Paul, like Tertullus, begins with captatio benevolentiae, but absque adulatione. He says only what he can truthfully speak."
