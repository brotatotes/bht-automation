# Acts 26:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, we witness the interaction between Paul and Festus, where Festus accuses Paul of madness due to his fervent beliefs and extensive knowledge. Festus, lacking understanding and overwhelmed by Paul's confidence, interrupts him and dismisses his claims. However, Paul, undeterred by Festus's accusations, counters by pointing out the absurdity of Festus's own skepticism. This exchange reveals the stark contrast between the passionate faith of Paul and the skepticism of Festus, highlighting the difficulty of comprehending strong belief in the face of ignorance and doubt.
