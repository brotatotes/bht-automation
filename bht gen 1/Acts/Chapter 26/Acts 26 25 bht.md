1. "The same reply, 'I am not mad,' can be made by all Christians to the charge of derangement which the world brings against them. They have come, like the prodigal son, to their right mind; and by beginning to act as if there were a God and Saviour, as if they were to die, as if there were a boundless eternity before them, they are conducting according to the dictates of reason."
2. "And as Paul appealed to Agrippa, who was not a Christian, for the reasonableness and soberness of his own views and conduct, so may all Christians appeal to sinners themselves as witnesses that they are acting as immortal beings should act."
3. "One of the best ways of convicting sinners is to appeal to them just as Paul did to Agrippa. When so appealed to, they will usually acknowledge the force of the appeal, and will admit that the solicitude of Christians for their salvation is according to the dictates of reason."

### John Calvin:

2. "He doth not vaunt of his wit; he doth not labor in defense of his wisdom; but he is content with this defense alone, that he teacheth nothing but that which is true and sober."
3. "We may gather by this, which is the best manner of teaching, to wit, that which is not only clean from all fallacies and deceit, but also doth not make the minds of men drunk with vain questions, and doth not nourish foolish curiosity, nor an intemperate desire to know more than is meet, but is moderate and good for sound edification."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The Roman governor’s accusation of madness was effectively refuted by the calm, courteous words with which the prisoner at once replied to the interruption."
2. "No, most noble Festus, I am not mad. The words which excite your indignation are not the outcome of a wild, ill-balanced enthusiasm, not the fancies of the disordered intellect of a half-mad zealot, as you seem to think; they are the expression of truth, of calm, deliberate judgment."
3. "The king will bear me witness that my words have been no wild utterances of a visionary enthusiast."
