## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Agrippa is doubly his witness, as cognizant of the facts respecting Jesus, as believing the prophets."
2. "This latter he does not only assert, but appeals to the faith of the king as a Jew for its establishment."
3. "This, the act done to Jesus by the Jews, and its sequel, was not done in an obscure corner of Judæa, but in the metropolis, at a time of more than common publicity."

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "The king knows the customs and questions of the Jews, and therefore he is well qualified to judge the matters that Paul is being accused of. This shows that Paul's trial is not just a religious matter, but also a legal one, as the king has the authority to make a fair judgment based on his knowledge of Jewish customs."

2. "This verse highlights the importance of understanding the context and background of a situation before making a judgment. The king's knowledge of the customs and questions of the Jews allows him to have a deeper understanding of the accusations against Paul. It reminds us to seek knowledge and understanding before passing judgment on others."

3. "The fact that the king is aware of the customs and questions of the Jews also suggests that he is open-minded and willing to listen to different perspectives. This is a valuable lesson for us to be open to learning about different cultures and beliefs, and to approach discussions and debates with a willingness to understand and respect the views of others."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Though Agrippa might not have been fully informed respecting these things, yet he had an acquaintance with Moses and the prophets; he knew the Jewish expectation respecting the Messiah; and he could not be ignorant respecting the remarkable public events in the life of Jesus of Nazareth." 
2. "Truth is always bold and free, and it is an evidence of honesty when a man is willing to declare everything without reserve before those who are qualified to detect him if he is an impostor." 
3. "The conversion of a leading persecutor, such as Paul had been, and in the manner in which that conversion had taken place, could not but attract attention and remark."

### John Calvin:
1. "For it was to small end for him to know the thing which was done, unless he did know that those things which had been spoken before of Christ were fulfilled in the person of Jesus which was crucified."
2. "Therefore, his meaning is, that the Scripture is of sufficient credit of itself, so that it is not lawful for a man that is a Jew to diminish any jot of the authority thereof."
3. "As the common sort of men, though they do not greatly care for the word of God, yet they acknowledge and confess generally and confusedly that it is the word of God, so that they are letted with some reverence either to reject or to despise the same."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The Jewish king sitting on that throne, before whom I am now telling out my wondrous story, he knows whether what I have been quoting from the Hebrews’ sacred books is to be found there or no."
2. "Well must our King Agrippa know the circumstances of the death of Jesus which took place at Jerusalem in the busy paschal week some thirty years ago, for this thing was not done in a corner."
3. "Well is the king aware that now for many years are there countless congregations of our countrymen in the Holy City, here in Cæsarea, scattered over Judæa and Syria, even as far as Italy, no small and obscure sect now, who live and die in the firm belief that this crucified Jesus has risen from the dead, just as I aver."
