# Acts 26:27 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, Paul fearlessly approaches King Agrippa, appealing to his knowledge and faith in the prophecies of the Messiah. The king's response not only confirms his belief in these prophecies, but also acknowledges the power of Paul's bold yet respectful appeal to his conscience. Paul's unwavering conviction in the truth of Christianity drives him to relentlessly share the evidence, even with those in positions of power and authority, leaving no opportunity untouched to press the truth.

2. "Instead, therefore, of waiting for his answer, Paul anticipated it, and said that he knew that Agrippa professed to believe all these prophecies respecting the Messiah."
3. "Paul lost no opportunity in pressing the truth on every class of people.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Paul made this appeal, not without reason, to the Jewish sovereign, who, like his father, ostentatiously avowed his belief in Judaism, and was a zealous professor of the faith."
2. "There is however no reason to doubt the sincerity of the belief of Agrippa I. or his son; they seem to have been outwardly, at all events, zealous Jews, and well versed in the sacred traditions of the nation."
3. "This appeal of St. Paul to him, ‘Dost thou believe the prophets?’ could not fail at once to strike a chord in Agrippa’s heart.
