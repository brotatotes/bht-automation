# Acts 26:28 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the midst of Paul's powerful defense of the Christian faith, King Agrippa responds with a hesitant acknowledgment of the truth. His words, "Almost thou persuadest me to be a Christian!" reveal the internal struggle he faces, torn between his heathen background and the compelling message presented by Paul. Agrippa's response evokes empathy and recognition of the missed opportunity to fully embrace the faith. As readers, we are challenged not to linger in a state of indecision like Agrippa but to wholeheartedly follow the example of Paul and fully commit to our own faith journey.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Lightly (with small trouble) art thou persuading thyself that thou canst make me a Christian: and understand them, in connexion with Paul’s having attempted to make Agrippa a witness on his side, ‘l am not so easily to be made a Christian of, as thou supposest.’"
2. "The first of these considerations decides that Agrippa is characterizing no effect on himself, but what Paul was fancying in his mind, reckoning the πείθομαι which he had expressed above."
3. "The second, that he speaks of something not that he is likely to become, but that contrasts strangely with his present worldly position and intentions."

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Thou thinkest to make me with little persuasion (or small trouble) a Christian—but I am not to be so easily turned."
2. "The objection on which so much stress is laid, that the word 'Christian' was at that time only a term of contempt, has no force except on the other side."
3. "Taking it in that view, the sense is, 'Thou wilt soon have me one of that despised sect.'"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He could not deny that the argument was a strong one that they had been fulfilled in Jesus of Nazareth."
2. "The arguments of Paul had been so rational; the appeal which he had made to his belief of the prophets had been so irresistible, that he had been nearly convinced of the truth of Christianity."
3. "To be almost persuaded to do a thing which we ought to do, and yet not to do it, is the very position of guilt and danger."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The rendering almost must be rejected, being without sufficient authority."
2. "The phrase, in a little, is adverbial, and means in brief; summarily."
3. "The words are ironical, and the sense is, 'You are trying to persuade me offhand to be a Christian.'"

### John Calvin:
1. "Agrippa’s meaning is, that he will not willingly become a Christian; yea, that he will not be one at all; and yet that he is not able to gainsay, but that he is drawn after a sort against his will. Whereby it appeareth how great the pride of man’s nature is until it be brought under to obey by the Spirit of God."
2. "Paul doth fitly apply that unto the thing which was spoken of the time. Therefore, seeing Agrippa did mean that he was almost made a Christian in a small time, Paul addeth that he doth desire that as well he as his companions might rise from small beginnings, and profit more and more; and yet I do not mislike that that εν ολιγω doth signify as much as almost."
3. "This answer doth testify with what zeal, to spread abroad the glory of Christ, this holy man’s breast was inflamed, when as he doth patiently suffer those bonds wherewith the governor had bound him, and doth desire that he might escape the deadly snares of Satan, and to have both him and also his partners to be partakers with him of the same grace, being in the mean season content with his troublesome and reproachful condition."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The address of Paul on this occasion would never have called out a sarcastic reply from Agrippa. It would be quite at variance with the whole tenor of the scene."
2. "In his reply, too, Paul evidently accepted the words of Agrippa as spoken in earnest. He saw no tinge of irony or even of playful courtesy in the king’s reply. To him it was all terribly real."
3. "To win that perishing soul, he made a last brave attempt in his reply. That earnest loving appeal never surely would have been made to one who could dismiss with cruel scornful sarcasm such a defence as had been spoken that day by the prisoner Paul in the Cæsarean judgment-hall."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "The Authorized rendering is impossible: 'Almost thou persuadest me to be a Christian.' Εν ολιγω does not mean 'almost.' That would require ολιγου, παρ' ολιγον, or δε ολιγου."
2. "Most likely the idea is 'in (or with) small effort you are trying to persuade me in order to make me a Christian.'"
3. "The tone of Agrippa is ironical, but not unpleasant. He pushes it aside with a shrug of the shoulders."

### John Gill:
1. "An almost Christian is one that has much light and knowledge, but no grace."
2. "He may have a large notional knowledge of the doctrines of the Gospel, but has no experience of the power, sweetness, and comfort of them in his own soul."
3. "He may taste of the heavenly gift, of the good word of God, and of the powers of the world to come; yet it is but a taste, a superficial one, which he has."

### John Wesley:

3. "Another step, and thou art within the vail." - This phrase emphasizes the closeness Agrippa was to embracing Christianity. It suggests that just one more step would have brought him into the fullness of the faith, highlighting the importance of taking that final leap of faith.

4. "Reader, stop not with Agrippa; but go on with Paul." - This quote encourages readers to not remain in a state of indecision like Agrippa but to follow the example of Paul, who fully embraced Christianity. It urges readers to move beyond hesitation and commit wholeheartedly to their faith.
