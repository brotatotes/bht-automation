# Acts 27:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The centurion displayed remarkable faith in Jesus, not relying on his own power but recognizing the authority of Jesus. His understanding of authority led him to believe that Jesus could heal his servant even from a distance. The centurion's humility was also evident in his acknowledgement that he was unworthy to have Jesus come to his home. He acknowledged Jesus as a man of great authority and power, humbly recognizing his own unworthiness.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "From the use of θεωρῶ here, and from the saying itself, it seems clear to me that Paul was not uttering at present any prophetic intimation, but simply his own sound judgment on the difficult question at issue."
2. "μετὰ ὕβρεως is interpreted by Meyer as subjective ‘accompanied with presumption on our part:’ but not to mention that this would be a very unusual sense, Acts 27:21, κερδῆσαι τὴν ὕβριν ταύτ. κ. τ. ζημίαν, is decisive (De W.) against it."
3. "ὅτι … μέλλειν] A mixing of two constructions, see Winer, edn. 6, § 44. 8, remark 2."

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Sirs, I perceive, that this voyage will be with hurt and much damage." - The commentator notes that this statement was not based on divine communication, but rather on the speaker's good judgment and experience. 

2. "Not by any divine communication." - This quote emphasizes that the decision was not influenced by any divine revelation. 

3. "The event justified his decision." - The commentator highlights that the outcome of the voyage confirmed the accuracy of the speaker's judgment.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "I perceive - It is not certain that Paul understood this by direct inspiration. He might have perceived it from his own knowledge of the danger of navigation at the autumnal equinox, and from what he saw of the ship as unsuited to a dangerous navigation."
2. "But there is nothing that should prevent our believing also that he was guided to this conclusion by the inspiration of the Spirit of God."
3. "Paul evidently, by this, intended to suggest the propriety of remaining where they were until the time of dangerous navigation was past."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "I perceive [θεωρω] . As the result of careful observation." 
2. "Hurt [υβρεως] . The word literally means insolence, injury, and is used here metaphorically: insolence of the winds and waves."
3. "Damage [ζημιας] . Better, as Rev., loss. Hurt and damage (A. V.) is tautological."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Hurt and much damage, i.e. risk of injury and great loss." 
2. "St. Paul, with his customary good sense, uses an argument which would appeal forcibly to every one who heard him." 
3. "Whether concerned or not with the cargo or with the management of the ship."

### John Gill:
1. "Not only by the tempestuous weather...but by a spirit of prophecy, which he was endued with." 
2. "He foresaw, and so foretold, that this voyage will be with hurt, and with much damage." 
3. "It was revealed to the apostle, that not one life should be lost; but yet through the shipwreck, much damage must accrue to their persons."

### John Wesley:
1. "The centurion's faith was not in his own power or authority, but in the power and authority of Jesus. He recognized that Jesus had the ability to heal his servant, even from a distance."
2. "This centurion's faith was so remarkable because it was based on a deep understanding of authority. He understood that Jesus had authority over sickness and disease, just as he had authority over his soldiers."
3. "The centurion's humility is evident in his statement that he is not worthy to have Jesus come under his roof. He recognized that Jesus was a man of great authority and power, and he did not consider himself worthy of such a visit."
