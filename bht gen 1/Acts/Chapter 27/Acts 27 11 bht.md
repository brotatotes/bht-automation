## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The owner of the ship" (τ. ναυκλήρῳ) refers to the one who possesses and has authority over the vessel.
2. In Plutarch, it is mentioned that the captain chooses the sailors, and the owner chooses the captain (κυβερνήτην ναύκληρος).
3. Hesychius defines ναύκληρος as "the master of the ship" (ὁ δεσπότης τ. πλοίου).

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The centurion believed the master and owner... more than... Paul." 
2. "He would naturally think them best able to judge." 
3. "There was much to say for their opinion, as the bay at Fair Havens, being open to nearly one-half of the compass, could not be a good winter harbor."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The master - The person who is here meant was the helmsman, who occupied in ancient ships a conspicuous place on the stern, and steered the ship, and gave directions to the crew." 
2. "The owner of the ship - Probably a different person from 'the master.' He had the general command of the ship as his own property, but had employed 'the master,' or the pilot, to direct and manage it." 
3. "His counsel in regard to the propriety of continuing the voyage would be likely to be followed."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The term 'Master' (κυβερνητη) used in this verse is only found here and in Revelation 13:17. It literally means 'the steersman', emphasizing the idea of someone who guides and directs. This highlights the authority and leadership role of Jesus in our lives."

2. "By using the term 'Master', the author is emphasizing the sovereignty of Jesus Christ. He is not just a teacher or a prophet, but the one who has ultimate control and authority over all things. This reminds us of the importance of submitting to His guidance and allowing Him to steer our lives."

3. "The use of the term 'Master' also implies a sense of trust and reliance. Just as a ship relies on its steersman to navigate through rough waters, we are called to trust in Jesus to lead us through the challenges and uncertainties of life. He is the one who knows the way and can guide us safely to our destination."

### John Calvin:
1. "The centurion is not reproved because he hearkened rather to the master and governor of the ship than to Paul...which was a point of a wise and modest man." 
2. "Luke reciteth this not in vain; but that we may know that Paul was from the beginning furnished with the sense of the Spirit, so that he did better see what things were profitable than did the masters." 
3. "Furthermore, in that he saith that they sailed beyond the coast of Candia, until they were caught and carried away; our friend Beza doth justly reprove the error of interpreters in this word ασσον, who make of an adverb the name of a city."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The master and the owner... their united opinion must have been felt to be very weighty."
2. "It is true to nature that the centurion should have yielded to their persuasion."
3. "The centurion, too, as was natural, had a great part in settling the question."

1. "The 'Frumentarian' centurion ranked above the captain and owner."
2. "Though the season was not advanced, the centurion probably feared to risk criticism in Rome for timidity when the wheat was so much needed in Rome."
3. "To the master (τω κυβερνητη). Old word from κυβερναω, to steer, and so steersman, pilot, sailing-master."

1. "The κυβερνητης, or 'governor', was he who sat on an eminence in the stern of the ship, at the helm, and had the direction of it; he gave the orders, which others executed."
2. "What qualified him for his post chiefly lay in three things; in the knowledge of the constellations, and winds, of the former that he might direct the course of the ship according to them, and by them foresee future tempests, and of the latter, that he might be acquainted with the several points, from whence they blew; also in the knowledge of ports, and places to put into, and of rocks and sands, that they might be escaped."
3. "As these best understood naval affairs, Julius gave more heed to what they said, and rather believed them, than those things which were spoken by Paul; by a spirit of prophecy, which he had no notion of."

### John Wesley:
1. "Believe an artificer in his own art." This quote highlights the general rule that someone who is skilled in a particular field should be trusted and believed when it comes to matters within their expertise. In the context of the centurion, it suggests that he recognized Jesus as a master in his own right.

2. "A real Christian will often advise even better than him." This quote emphasizes that true followers of Christ can offer valuable insights and advice, even surpassing the expertise of those who are considered masters in their respective fields. It highlights the centurion's faith and his recognition of Jesus' authority.

3. "The centurion regarded the master." This quote simply states the centurion's attitude towards Jesus - he regarded him highly and recognized his authority. It sets the stage for the subsequent discussion on trust and faith in the commentary.
