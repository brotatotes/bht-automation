### Henry Alford:
1. "The anchorage was sheltered from the N.W., but not from nearly half the compass."
2. "For this purpose the anchorage was εὔθετος, and in it they had actually ridden out the storm, before they left it."
3. "The direction then is towards the spot indicated, just as in the present case it is in that of the motion indicated."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Phenice—'Phenix,' now called Lutro." 
2. "If this means that it was open to the west, it would certainly not be good anchorage!"
3. "It is thought therefore to mean that a wind from that quarter would lead into it, or that it lay in an easterly direction from such a wind."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Not safe or convenient to remain there."
2. "The majority of persons on board concurred with Paul in the belief that it was not advisable to attempt the navigation of the sea until the dangers of the winter had passed by."
3. "It was thus rendered perfectly safe from the winds and heavy seas; and in that harbor they might pass the winter in security."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The difference between the Rev. and A. V., as to the points of the compass, turns on the rendering of the preposition kata."
2. "According to the A. V., kata means toward, and has reference to the quarter from which these winds blow."
3. "According to the Rev., kata means down: 'looking down the southwest and northwest winds,' i.e., in the direction toward which they blow, viz., northeast and southeast."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The exact knowledge of this roadstead which we now have through the surveys of British officers, shows that the case might have been reasonably argued on both sides."
2. "The recommendation of Phoenix, as a good harbour for wintering, is precisely this, that it was sheltered from the two above-mentioned winds."
3. "There is no difficulty now in identifying Phoenix with Lutro, in the narrowest part of the island of Crete. It is a place of admirable shelter, with deep water close under the rocks, and precisely protected from south-west and north-west winds."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The harbour being unfit for wintering" - This commentary highlights the unsuitability of the harbor for wintering, emphasizing the challenging conditions faced by the ship and its passengers.

2. "We vote for going on the chance that we may be able" - This quote showcases the determination and hope of the majority who advised continuing the journey, despite the risks involved.

### John Gill:
1. "Perhaps it might be an open road or bay, and having nothing to shelter from the boisterous waves, was a place very improper for a ship to be in, in stormy weather."
2. "This was a haven fit for fair weather only, and therefore might be so called."
3. "The majority in the ship were for sailing."

These quotes provide insights into the unsuitability of the Fair Havens for wintering, the reasoning behind its name, and the majority's decision to sail.

### John Wesley:
1. "The haven described in this verse is not just a simple shelter, but a place of refuge with two openings. This symbolizes the inclusive nature of God's grace, which welcomes people from all directions and backgrounds."

2. "The southwest opening represents the path of repentance and turning away from sin, while the northwest opening represents the path of faith and trust in God. Both are necessary for finding refuge in God's haven."

3. "This verse reminds us that God's haven is not limited to a specific group or location. It is open to all who seek it, regardless of their past or present circumstances. It is a place of safety, peace, and restoration for anyone who comes with a humble and contrite heart."
