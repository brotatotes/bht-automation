In their journey, the sailors were filled with confidence and anticipation, as they believed their purpose was within reach. The favorable south wind gently blew, offering them hope and allowing them to sail along the coast of Crete. With the wind on their side, they navigated closely along the shore, confident in their ability to reach their desired destination. This display of trust in the wind's guidance reflects their willingness to leave behind the safety of familiar waters and venture into the unknown.
