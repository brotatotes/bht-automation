# Acts 27:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the midst of their journey, a sudden and violent storm erupted, driven by a tempestuous wind known as Euroclydon. This wind, like a whirlwind or hurricane, brought about a chaotic and turbulent atmosphere, causing the ship to be tossed back and forth without a clear direction. The storm, which lasted for many days, resembled a typhoon in its blustering and tempestuous nature, and proved to be a great challenge for the sailors on board. Such unpredictable storms, known as levanters, continue to plague sailors in those regions, causing destruction and chaos in their wake.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Had the wind blown in the direction of Crete at all, they, who gave themselves up to it, and were driven before it, must have been stranded on the Cretan coast, which they were not." 
2. "The sudden change from a south wind to a violent northerly wind is a common occurrence in these seas." 
3. "The term 'typhonic' indicates that it was accompanied by some of the phænomena which might be expected in such a case, viz. the agitation and whirling motion of the clouds caused by the meeting of the opposite currents of air when the change took place, and probably also of the sea, raising it in columns of spray."

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "A tempestuous wind—that is, like a typhon or tornado, causing a whirling of the clouds, owing to the meeting of opposite currents of air." 

2. "Called Euroclydon—The true reading appears to be Euro-aquilo, or east-northeast, which answers all the effects here ascribed to it."

3. "Causing a whirling of the clouds, owing to the meeting of opposite currents of air."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Arose - Beat violently." 
2. "Called Euroclydon - Εὐροκλύδων Eurokludōn. Interpreters have been much perplexed about the meaning of this word, which occurs nowhere else in the New Testament."
3. "The most probable supposition is, that it denotes 'a wind not blowing steadily from any quarter, but a hurricane, or wind veering about to different quarters.'"

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Luke is the only New Testament writer who uses nauv (see verse 41), though he uses it but once; and, as Hackett remarks, 'it would be quite accidental which of the terms would shape the pronoun at this moment, as they were both so familiar.'"
2. "A third explanation refers the pronoun to the island of Crete, and renders, 'there beat down from it.' This is grammatical, and according to a well-known usage of the preposition."
3. "The rendering of the Rev. is, therefore, well supported, and, on the whole, preferable: there beat down from it."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "How suddenly violent changes may take place when we least expect them, and when we have thought that already we have ‘gained our purpose’!"
2. "The storm came ‘down from the island.’ The land here is very high, and the gale suddenly swept down one of the gullies among the mountains, in a south-westerly direction."
3. "Whatever may be our conclusion in this matter, two things are clear, first, either word shows that the gale blew more or less from the east; while, secondly, the fact that it came ‘down from’ the island, and drove the ship to the southward (see below), shows that it blew more or less from the north."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "The Cretan mountains are over 7,000 feet high."
2. "Τυφων=Τυφως was used for the typhoon, a violent whirlwind (τυρβο) or squall."
3. "The Ευρακυλων (reading of Aleph A B against the Textus Receptus Ευροκλυδων) has not been found elsewhere."

### John Gill:
1. "A tempestuous wind, called Euroclydon... a very tempestuous one, as a sort of whirlwind or hurricane, a violent storm, though without thunder and lightning."
2. "Pliny calls it the chief plague of sailors, it breaking their sails, and even their vessels to pieces."
3. "This storm of wind was a settled and lasting one, it continued many days; and that it is only called Typhonic, because it bore some likeness to it, being very blustering and tempestuous."

### John Wesley:
1. "A tempestuous wind, called in those parts Euroclydon." 
2. "This was a kind of hurricane, not carrying them any one way, but tossing them backward and forward." 
3. "These furious winds are now called levanters, and blow in all directions from the northeast to the southeast."
