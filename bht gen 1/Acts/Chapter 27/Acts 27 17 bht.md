# Acts 27:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, we encounter a perilous situation at sea, where the ship is in danger of breaking apart. To prevent disaster, the sailors employ various methods of securing the ship, such as undergirding or frapping it with ropes and cables. Their fear is driven by the possibility of being stranded on treacherous shoals, like the notorious Greater Syrtis. As they face these challenges, the sailors take strategic actions, like lowering the sails and maneuvering the ship in the face of the storm, to navigate their way to safety.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The typhoon is called the 'principal scourge of sailors, not only breaking the masts, but twisting the very ships themselves.'" (Pliny)
2. "To frap a ship is to pass four or five turns of a large cable-laid rope around the hull or frame of a ship, to support her in a great storm." (Falconer's Marine Dict.)
3. "Fearing a certain danger, they deprived themselves of the only possible means of avoiding it." (Smith)

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Undergirding the ship" refers to the practice of securing the ship by wrapping a rope around its hull, allowing it to withstand the force of the waves. This technique is rarely used in modern seamanship.
2. The fear of falling into the quicksands, or being stranded upon the dangerous shoals of Syrtis, was a real concern for the sailors.
3. The phrase "they strake" means that they struck or lowered the gear of the ship, possibly referring to the lowering of the heavy mainyard with the sail attached to it. This action would have helped them navigate away from the dangerous Syrtis.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "They used ropes, cables, stays, or chains, for the purpose of securing the ship." 
2. "The ancients were accustomed to pass cables or strong ropes around a vessel to keep the planks from springing or starting by the action of the sea."
3. "The sailors were afraid, therefore, that they should be driven on one of those banks of sand, and thus be lost."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Undergirding [υποζωννυντες]. In modern nautical language, frapping: passing cables or chains round the ship's hull in order to support her in a storm." 
2. "The effect was at once manifest by a great diminution in the working of the parts already mentioned; and, in a less agreeable way, by impeding her rate of sailing." 
3. "Quicksands [την συρτιν]. The rendering of the A. V. is too general. The word is a proper name, and has the article. There were two shoals of this name - the 'Greater Syrtis' (Syrtis Major), and the 'Smaller Syrtis' (Syrtis Minor)."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "They used helps, undergirding the ship. It is evident that the timbers were in danger of parting. Hence they artificially strengthened the vessel by passing ropes round it over the gunwale and under the keel, and tightening them on deck by levers." 
2. "Fearing lest they should fall into the quicksands. This means a certain very definite part of the sea called the Greater Syrtis, full of shoals, on the north coast of Africa. The ancient navigators dreaded this place very much." 
3. "What they did was this. They laid the ship to; and, her head being already to the north, they laid her to on the starboard tack, or with her right side to the wind. This is done by setting a small amount of sail, and with the united action of the wind on this sail, and of the rudder on the water, keeping the ship’s head as near the wind as possible."

### John Gill:
1. "Undergirding the ship: with cords and ropes, which they drew under the keel of the ship, and so bound both sides of the ship, that it might not split and fall to pieces." 
2. "Isidorus makes mention of several sorts of ropes made use of in storms, which the mariners after their manner call 'curcubae'." 
3. "They strake sail; let down their sails; so read some manuscripts in New College, Oxford; in the Greek text it is, 'they let down the vessel'; not the boat they had taken in, nor an anchor, or anchors, which would have been improper in a storm; nor the mast, it can hardly be thought that should be the first thing they should cut down."
