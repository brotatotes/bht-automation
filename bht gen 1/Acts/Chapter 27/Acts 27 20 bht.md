# Acts 27:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the midst of a treacherous storm at sea, the sailors on the ship find themselves in utter despair. With the thick atmosphere obstructing their view of the sun and stars, their only guides, they are left disoriented and unable to determine their location. Their efforts to subdue the leak in the ship prove futile, leaving them with no choice but to face the imminent danger of sinking. As hope dwindles, a fog of despair settles, and the desperate cries of the sailors echo in the face of seemingly insurmountable circumstances.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The sun and stars were the only guides of the ancients when out of sight of land."
2. "The expression, all hope was taken away, seems...to betoken that a greater evil than the mere force of the storm...was afflicting them, viz., the leaky state of the ship."
3. "Their successive lightenings of her...showed that the leaky state of the ship increased upon them."

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "This continued thickness of the atmosphere prevented their making the necessary observations of the heavenly bodies by day or by night; so that they could not tell where they were."
2. "Their exertions to subdue the leak had been unavailing; they could not tell which way to make for the nearest land, in order to run their ship ashore, the only resource for a sinking ship."
3. "Their apprehensions, therefore, were not so much caused by the fury of the tempest, as by the state of the ship."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "As they could see neither sun nor stars, they could make no observations."
2. "They had no compass, they would be totally ignorant of their situation."
3. "They gave up all as lost."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "This was a most serious aggravation of the danger."
2. "The great reason which made ancient navigation perilous in the winter was, that the sky is then more overcast than at other seasons."
3. "Now we come to the third stage, which is absolute despair. We should note that it was precisely at this time, when no escape through human means seemed possible, that St. Paul interposed with Divine encouragement."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "No small tempest (χειμονος ουκ ολιγου). Litotes again." - The commentary highlights the intensity of the storm by using litotes, a figure of speech that emphasizes the magnitude of something by stating its opposite.

2. "All hope that we should be saved was now taken away (λοιπον περιηιρειτο ελπις πασα του σωζεσθα ημας)." - This quote emphasizes the despair and loss of hope that the people on the ship were experiencing, as their chances of being saved seemed to be diminishing.

3. "Despair was beginning to settle like a fog on all their hopes." - This metaphorical description vividly portrays the emotional state of the people on the ship, highlighting the heavy and oppressive nature of their despair.

### John Gill:
1. "The sun, moon, and stars, are useful to sailors, to steer their course by; especially they were to the ancients, before the invention and use of the loadstone."
2. "The constellations and stars were of singular use unto them; and above all, the two Bears, the greater and the lesser; the Greeks observed the former, and the Phoenicians the latter."
3. "All hope that we should be saved was then taken away; neither the master and owner of the ship, nor the mariners, nor the soldiers, nor prisoners, nor the apostle's companions, had any hope of being saved, but all expected to be lost."

### John Wesley:
1. "Neither sun nor stars appeared for many days" - This emphasizes the dire situation the sailors were in, as they were unable to navigate without the guidance of celestial bodies.
2. "Which they could the less spare" - This highlights the importance of the sun and stars for navigation, as the sailors were unable to rely on any other means to find their way.
3. "Before the compass was found out" - This suggests that the sailors were eventually able to find a compass, which would have provided them with a reliable means of navigation during their journey.
