# Acts 27:25 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the midst of a treacherous storm at sea, Paul addresses his fellow sailors. Despite their prior disregard for his warnings, Paul assures them that they will find safety and reach their destination. His words reflect a deep trust and confidence in God's promises and power. Though the circumstances appear hopeless, faith relies not on what is seen or understood, but on the character and faithfulness of God. This active and unwavering faith also resonates with Paul's prayers, as he remains certain that he will bear witness in Rome.
