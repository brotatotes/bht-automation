# Acts 27:28 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, mariners are depicted "heaving the lead," which involves using a sounding line to measure the depth of the water. Commentators refer to ancient practices of using a "bolis" or vessel filled with grease, suspended by a chain, to determine the nature of the seabed. The measurement unit mentioned is the fathom, explained as the distance between outstretched middle fingers or about six feet. As the ship approaches St. Paul's Bay, it encounters varying depths of water, satisfying the conditions required to identify the exact location of the shipwreck.

### John Gill:
1. "The sounding line, with the ancients, was called by different names; sometimes bolis, and this is the name it has here, 'they let down the bolis': and the bolis is, by some, described thus; it is a brazen or leaden vessel, with a chain, which mariners fill with grease, and let down into the sea, to try whether the places are rocky where a ship may stand, or sandy where the ship is in danger of being lost." 

2. "According to modern accounts, there are two kinds of lines, occasionally used in sounding the sea, the sounding line, and the deep sea line: the sounding line is the thickest and shortest, as not exceeding 20 fathoms in length, and is marked at two, three, and four fathoms with a piece of black leather between the strands, and at five with a piece of white leather."

3. "The deep sea line is used in deep water, and both lead and line are larger than the other at the end of it is a piece of lead, called deep sea lead, has a hole at the bottom, in which is put a piece of 'tallow', to bring up the colour of the sand at the bottom, to learn the differences of the ground, and know what coasts they are on."
