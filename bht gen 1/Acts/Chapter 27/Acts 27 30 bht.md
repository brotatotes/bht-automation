# Acts 27:30 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Amidst a turbulent voyage, the sailors, driven by fear, resorted to deceit and self-preservation. With crafty pretenses and false reasons, they attempted to carry out their plan from the front of the ship, under the guise of laying anchors. Their actions highlighted the desperate nature of human reliance on human wisdom in times of crisis. This serves as a sobering reminder that true security can only be found in surrendering to God's guidance.
