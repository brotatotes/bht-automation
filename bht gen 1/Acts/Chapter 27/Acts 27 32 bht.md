# Acts 27:32 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In a story full of symbolism and surrender, the mariners on board the ship make a decisive choice. Cutting off the ropes of the boat, they let it drift away into the darkness, relinquishing any possibility of escape. This act represents their complete detachment from the safety of the familiar and their willingness to trust in God's guidance. It is a powerful portrayal of surrendering their own plans and desires, embracing the unknown, and placing their faith in Paul as the hero who saves not only himself but also the lives of all on board.
