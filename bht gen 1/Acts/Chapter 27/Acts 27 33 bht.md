# Acts 27:33 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the midst of treacherous waters and imminent danger, the apostle Paul took on the role of leader, guiding and beseeching his companions on the ship until the break of dawn. For fourteen anxious days, they had been waiting, their strength waning, their stomachs empty. Hunger and weakness gnawed at them, but Paul's unwavering faith and steadfastness in the face of peril shone through, inspiring hope and resilience among the worn-out souls. It was in these darkest hours that the men learned the true value of perseverance and the power of trust in God's promises.
