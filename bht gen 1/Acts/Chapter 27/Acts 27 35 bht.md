# Acts 27:35 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the apostle Paul, displaying his piety as a Jew, asks for a blessing before eating, showcasing his dependence on and gratitude towards God. His action serves as an encouragement to others, planting a testimony for the God he serves. This act of giving thanks, reminiscent of the Sacred Eucharist, sets an example for both Christians and non-Christians alike present in the ship. The bread he consumes is not the Lord's Supper, but rather regular bread commonly eaten by seafaring men.
