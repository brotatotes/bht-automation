# Acts 27:38 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the face of a desperate situation at sea, the crew made a bold decision to cast out the cargo of wheat into the sea, showing the extreme measures they were willing to take for survival. This act of desperation was driven by the newfound trust and reliance placed on St. Paul's teachings, as his authority prevailed and influenced their actions. The people's strong dependence on St. Paul's words led them to prioritize what he had said, setting aside anything that did not align with his teachings, even the valuable provisions.
