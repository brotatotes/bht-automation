## Choicest Commentary Quotes:

3) "They raised their ἀρτέμων to the wind...the ‘artemon’ was the foresail of the ancient ships."
4) "They made for the beach...to steer to land."

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The expression may mean that they slipped or cut their cables, and that thus they left the anchors in the sea. This is the most probable interpretation." 
2. "The bands mentioned here were probably the cords or fastenings by which the rudder could be made secure to the sides of the ship, or could be raised up out of the water in a violent storm, to prevent its being carried away."
3. "The mainsail (foresail) being hoisted showed good judgment, as it would not only enable them to steer more correctly than without it, but would press the ship farther on upon the land, and thus enable them the more easily to get to the shore."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Taken up [περιελοντες]. Wrong. The word means to remove, and refers here to cutting the anchor - cables, or casting off, as Rev."
2. "Committed themselves [ειων]. Wrong. The reference is to the anchors. Rev., correctly, left them in the sea."
3. "Rudder bands [ζευκτηριας των πηδαλιων]. Lit., the bands of the rudders. The larger ships had two rudders, like broad oars or paddles, joined together by a pole, and managed by one steersman."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "When they had taken up the anchors...the ship was free for the full action of the wind." 
2. "They did not ‘take up’ the anchors, but cut the ropes which connected the ship with them."
3. "The rudders were now absolutely necessary in order to steer the ship precisely, so that she might take the ground at the right point."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Having taken away from around, that is all four anchors from around the stern." 
2. "They let the anchors go and the ropes fell down into the sea."
3. "Hoisting up the foresail to the wind, it is not clear what 'sail' is meant by 'αρτεμωνα.' No other example in Greek is known, though the scholiast to Juvenal XII. 68 explains ςελο προρα συο by artemone solo. Hence 'foresail' is probably correct."

### John Gill:
1. "The rudder, in navigation, is a piece of timber turning on hinges in the stern of a ship, and which opposing sometimes one side to the water, and sometimes another, turns or directs the vessel this way or that."
2. "A narrow rudder is best for a ship's sailing, provided she can feel it; that is, be guided and turned by it, for a broad rudder will hold much water when the helm is put over to any side."
3. "And certain it is, that not only oars but rudders were fastened with cords or ropes to the ship."


### John Wesley:
1. "Loosing the rudder bands" refers to the act of unfastening the ship's rudders, which were typically secured when the ship was left to drift. This action signifies the need to take control and steer the ship towards a specific destination.

2. The loosening of the rudder bands indicates a shift from passive drifting to active navigation. It symbolizes the importance of taking charge and making intentional choices in life, rather than simply going with the flow.

3. By unfastening the rudder bands, the sailors demonstrate their readiness to guide the ship into the creek. This highlights the significance of being prepared and equipped to navigate through challenging situations, ensuring a safe and successful journey.
