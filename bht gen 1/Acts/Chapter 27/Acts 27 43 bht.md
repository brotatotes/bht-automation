# Acts 27:43 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Amidst a treacherous shipwreck, a unique figure emerges: the apostle Paul. His powerful influence impresses both his fellow prisoners and the centurion in charge. The entire group owes their lives to him. With wisdom and authority, Paul's words change the course of events, commanding that those who can swim should be the first to cast themselves into the sea and reach the safety of land. His purpose, guided by divine will, is to testify of Christ in Rome.

### John Gill:
1. "Not only because he was a Roman citizen, but because he perceived he was some extraordinary person; and chiefly because he was moved there unto by a superior influence, that Satan might not have his end; and that the will of God might be fulfilled, that he should go to Rome, and there bear a testimony of Christ."

2. "Kept them from their purpose; would not suffer them to execute their design, restrained them from it, and laid his commands upon them to the contrary."

3. "And commanded that they which could swim, should cast themselves first into the sea, and get to land; which some restrain to the Roman soldiers, as if the centurion's speech was only directed to them; though it seems rather to have respect to the whole company, the mariners, who generally can swim, and the soldiers, as many of them as could, and the rest of the prisoners or passengers; though it may be, he might chiefly regard the soldiers, who were usually learned to swim, that they might the more readily pass rivers, in their marches, where they could find no bridges, that so he might be the sooner rid of them, and break their purpose."
