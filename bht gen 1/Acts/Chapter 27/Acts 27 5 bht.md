# Acts 27:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In a magnificent ruin-filled neighborhood, the name of a city still remains, where copyist errors reveal their unfamiliarity with the place. The apostle Paul's familiarity with the coasts of Cilicia and Pamphylia suggests his deep understanding of local culture and customs, advantageous for his missionary work. Having traveled extensively, Paul's visit to Myra showcases his commitment to spreading the Gospel, while its status as a port city allows for rest and strategizing. Geographically, Myra lies near Caria and Pamphylia, and its historical significance is seen through notable figures, like Bishop Nicolaus, and its connection to the Council of Nice.
