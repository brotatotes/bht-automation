2. "the coast is bold and safe, and the elevation of the mountains makes it visible at a great distance; it abounds in harbours, while the sinuosities of its shores and the westerly current would enable them, if the wind was at all off the land, to work to windward"
3. "Myra lies due N. from Alexandria, and its bay is well calculated to shelter a wind-bound ship"
