## Choicest Commentary Quotes:

2. "With N.W. winds the ship could work up from Myra to Cnidus; because, until she reached that point, she had the advantage of a weather shore, under the lee of which she would have smooth water."
3. "Unless she had put into that harbour (Cnidus), and waited for a fair wind, her only course was to run under the lee of Crete, in the direction of Salmone, which is the eastern extremity of that island."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "sailed slowly many days—owing to contrary winds." 
2. "scarce—with difficulty." 
3. "But for the contrary wind they might have made the distance from Myra in one day."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "By reason of the prevalence of the western winds" - This explains why the ship had been sailing slowly, as it was hindered by the strong winds coming from the west (Acts 27:4).
2. "The wind repelling us in that direction" - The commentary highlights that the wind was pushing against the ship, preventing it from following its intended course (Acts 27:4).
3. "We lay along near to Crete, so as to break the violence of the wind" - The ship sought shelter near the island of Crete to protect itself from the strong winds, demonstrating the crew's efforts to navigate through the challenging conditions (Acts 27:4).

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The meaning is not that they had scarcely reached Cnidus when the wind became contrary, nor that they had come only as far as Cnidus in many days; but that they were retarded by contrary winds between Myra and Cnidus."
2. "Such a contrary wind would have been the northwesterly, which prevails during the summer months in that part of the Archipelago."
3. "They might have accomplished [the distance between Myra and Cnidus] in a day with a favorable wind."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The question arises as to the cause of this slow sailing. It must have been either from lack of wind, or because the wind was contrary."

2. The phrase "in considerable days" emphasizes the length of time they struggled against the wind (εν ικαναις ημεραις).
3. By sailing under the lee of Crete, they sought protection against the wind, making a strategic decision to change their course (υπεπλευσαμεν την Κρητην).
