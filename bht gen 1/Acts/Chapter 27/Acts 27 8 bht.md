## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Now Fair Havens is the harbour nearest to Cape Matala, the farthest point to which an ancient ship could have attained with N.W.-ly winds." 
2. "The most conclusive evidence that this is the Fair Havens of Scripture, is, that its position is precisely that where a ship circumstanced as St. Paul’s was, must have put in."
3. "This place was, until recently, altogether unknown; and from the variety of readings, the very name was uncertain."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "And hardly passing it—"with difficulty coasting along it," from the same cause as before, the westerly current and head winds." 
2. "the Fair Havens—an anchorage near the center of the south coast, and a little east of Cape Matala, the southernmost point of the island."
3. "nigh whereunto was the city Lasea—identified by the REVEREND GEORGE BROWN [SMITH, Voyages and Shipwreck of St. Paul, Appendix 3, Second Edition, 1856]."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "And, hardly passing it - Scarcely being able to pass by it without being wrecked."
2. "The fair havens - This was on the southeastern part of the island of Crete. It was probably not so much a harbor as an open roadstead, which afforded good anchorage for a time."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Coasting along (παραλεγομενο). Present middle participle of παραλεγω, to lay beside, not from λεγω, to collect or λεγω, to say. Diodorus Siculus uses παραλεγομα in precisely this sense of coasting along, like Latin legere oram." This quote explains the meaning of the term "coasting along" and provides a comparison to the Latin term "legere oram," giving readers a clearer understanding of the action being described.

2. "Fair Havens (Καλους Λιμενας). This harbour is named Kalus Limeonas, a small bay two miles east of Cape Matala. It opens to the East and Southeast, but is not fit to winter in. This harbour would protect them for a time from the winds." This quote provides information about the location of Fair Havens and its suitability as a temporary shelter from the winds, adding context to the verse.

3. "The city of Lasea (πολις Λασεα). Neither Lasea nor Fair Havens is mentioned by any ancient writer, two of the hundred cities of Crete." This quote highlights the historical significance of Lasea and Fair Havens, emphasizing their importance within the context of the verse.

### John Gill:
1. "And hardly passing it,.... That is, Salmone, with great difficulty, because of the winds" - The journey to the Fair Havens was challenging due to strong winds, highlighting the obstacles faced by the travelers.
