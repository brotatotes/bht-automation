# Acts 27:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, the voyage to Italy is described during a time of dangerous sailing conditions. The commentators mention the fast of the day of expiation, the seventh month of the Jewish calendar, which typically falls around the end of September. They also emphasize how the arrival of this season brings about perilous weather conditions in the Mediterranean. Despite the external challenges, Paul exhibits remarkable faith and influence, urging caution and advising against risking their safety by setting sail during this hazardous period.
