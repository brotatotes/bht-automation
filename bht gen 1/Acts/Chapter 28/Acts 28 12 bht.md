The passage described in these commentaries is one where Paul and his companions arrived at the city of Syracuse in Sicily. They sailed about 80 miles from Malta and quickly made their way to this famous city. Syracuse was known for its beauty and significance, being a city of great historical importance and often described as consisting of four large cities.
