# Acts 28:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, the journey of the apostle Paul and his companions is vividly described. They sailed with a roundabout course, tacking against an adverse wind and taking advantage of the sinuosities of the coast. After a few days, a favorable south wind finally blew, allowing them to continue their voyage. They arrived at Puteoli, a sheltered and significant port known for its warm baths and as the customary harbor for Alexandrian grain ships. With this rich description, we can imagine the challenges and sights that Paul encountered as he set foot on Italian ground.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "περιελθόντες apparently denotes the roundabout course of a vessel tacking with an adverse wind."
2. "The South wind having sprung up, succeeded the one which blew before."
3. "Puteoli (anciently Dicæarchia, Strab. Acts 28:4, now Puzzuoli) was the most sheltered part of the bay of Naples. It was the principal port of Southern Italy, and, in particular, formed the great emporium for the Alexandrian wheat ships."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "from thence we fetched a compass—that is, proceeded circuitously, or tacked, working to windward probably, and availing themselves of the sinuosities of the coast, the wind not being favorable" [SMITH].
2. "after one day the south wind blew—a south wind having sprung up; being now favored with a fair wind, for want of which they had been obliged first to stay three days at Syracuse, and then to tack and put in for a day at Rhegium" [SMITH].
3. "the Alexandrian corn ships enjoyed a privilege peculiar to themselves, of not being obliged to strike their topsail on landing. By this they were easily recognized as they hove in sight by the crowds that we find gathered on the shore on such occasions" [HOWSON].

### Albert Barnes:
1. "We fetched a compass - We coasted about; or we sailed along the eastern side of Sicily." 
2. "And came to Rhegium - This was a city of Italy, in the kingdom of Naples, on the coast near the southwest extremity of Italy. It was nearly opposite to Messina, in Sicily. It is now called 'Reggio.'"
3. "The south wind - A wind favorable for their voyage."
4. "To Puteoli - The wells. This place was celebrated for its warm baths, and from these and its springs it is supposed to have derived its name of The Wells. It is now called 'Pozzuoli,' and is in the campania of Naples, on the north side of the bay, and about 8 miles northwest from Naples."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The meaning of this English phrase is (as in 2 Kings 3:9), that they did not sail in a straight course; and from the mention of a fair wind presently afterwards which enabled them to do so, it is natural to conclude that they were forced to tack or beat against an unfavourable wind."
2. "Puteoli (the modern Pozzuoli) was, next after Ostia, the most important harbour of Western Italy; and especially it was the customary port for the Alexandrian corn ships."
3. "Thus we have some help for imagining the scene correctly, when St. Paul first set foot on Italian ground."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The ship had to tack to reach Rhegium and was not able to make a straight course." 
2. "A south wind sprang up, though the weather was plainly treacherous at this early season." 
3. "It was eight miles northwest from Neapolis (Naples) and the chief port of Rome, the regular harbour for the Alexandrian ships from Rome."

### John Gill:
1. "whether the apostle preached here, or no, is not certain, since his stay was so short"
2. "the sea being called after its name, 'mare Puteolanum', the sea of Puteoli"
3. "perhaps the distance between the two places may not be far from truth"
