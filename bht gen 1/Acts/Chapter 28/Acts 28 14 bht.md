# Acts 28:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Upon arriving in Puteoli, Paul and his companions were pleasantly surprised to find fellow believers there, highlighting the widespread reach of the Christian community. The Christians at Puteoli eagerly requested that Paul stay with them for a week, desiring the opportunity to worship together and engage in rich Christian fellowship. This delay in Rome offered Paul a chance to rest and gather strength, as well as to enjoy the refreshing company of his brothers and sisters in Christ. Rome, known as the great city, held immense significance as the capital of Italy and the center of the Roman Empire.
