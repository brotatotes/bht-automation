# Acts 28:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, we see the Apostle Paul arriving in Rome as a prisoner, where he was warmly received by the Roman Christians. Traveling in separate groups, these brethren eagerly came out to meet him, showing their affection and support. This encounter was deeply meaningful for Paul, who had long desired to see the Roman Christians and was encouraged that his work in Rome was about to begin. Despite facing challenges and uncertainties, the presence and care of these believers uplifted Paul and fueled his determination to carry out God's work in the city.
