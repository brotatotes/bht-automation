# Acts 28:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, we see the interaction between the shipwrecked individuals and the inhabitants of the island of Malta. Despite being called barbarians by the Greeks, these so-called native "barbarous people" showed extraordinary kindness, displaying a generosity and humanity that was highly commendable. They welcomed the drenched and shivering survivors, providing them with much-needed warmth by kindling a large fire. The compassion and sympathy demonstrated by these supposedly uncultivated islanders far surpassed the expectations of the polite and educated society, proving that true acts of kindness transcend societal labels.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "βάρβαροι] A term implying very much what our word natives does, when speaking of any little-known or new place." 
2. "ὑετόν] ‘Post ingentes ventos solent imbres sequi.’ Grot." 
3. "ψῦχος] This is decisive against the Sirocco, which is a hot and sultry wind even so late as the month of November."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The barbarous people—so called merely as speaking neither the Greek nor the Latin language. They were originally Phoelignician colonists." 
2. "showed us no little—"no ordinary" kindness, for they kindled a fire, and received us every one, because of the present rain—"the rain that was on us"—not now first falling, but then falling heavily." 
3. "and because of the cold—welcomed us all, drenched and shivering, to these most seasonable marks of friendship. In this these 'barbarians' contrast favorably with many since bearing the Christian name."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The Greeks regarded all as barbarians who did not speak their language, and applied the name to all other nations but their own."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Barbarous people. From the Roman point of view, regarding all as barbarians who spoke neither Greek nor Latin. Not necessarily uncivilized." 

2. "The inhabitants of Malta were of Carthaginian descent. 'Even in the present day the natives of Malta have a peculiar language, termed the Maltese, which has been proved to be essentially an Arabic dialect, with an admixture of Italian' (Gloag)."

3. "No little [ου τυχουσαν]. See on special, ch. 19 11. Rev., much better, 'no common kindness.'"

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The Greek word, too, for ‘kindness’ (φιλανθρωπία) is worthy of remark. It denotes the kindness that is shown on the general ground of humanity, irrespective of differences of rank or race." 
2. "Their generous and sympathetic conduct is strangely contrasted with the cruelty and plunder that have often disgraced wreckers on our own coast."
