# Acts 28:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, we learn that before his appeal, the Jews in Judæa had no reason to communicate with the Jews in Rome about Paul's case. It seems that they had not sent any messengers before him, and there was no dishonest concealment. The Jews in Judea did not forward the accusation against Paul to their brethren in Rome, as they had been unsuccessful in condemning him in previous trials. Despite the lack of information from Judea, there was no prejudice against Paul, and the reply of the Roman Jews, though courteous, was deemed hollow and false.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Before his appeal, the Jews in Judæa had no definite reason to communicate with the Jews in Rome respecting him, having no expectation that Paul...would ever go to Rome." 
2. "Since his appeal, it would have been hardly possible for them to have sent messengers who should have arrived before him."
3. "It appears, however, that none had come."

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "The distinction made between himself, against whom they heard nothing, and his 'sect,' as 'everywhere spoken against,' is a presumption in favor of their sincerity." 
2. "There is ground to think that as the case took an unexpected turn by Paul's appealing to Cæsar, so no information on the subject would travel from Jerusalem to Rome in advance of the apostle himself."
3. "We need not suppose that there was any dishonest concealment here."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Why the Jews in Judea had not forwarded the accusation against Paul to their brethren at Rome, that they might continue the prosecution before the emperor, is not known."
2. "Paul had been acquitted successively by Lysias, Felix, Festus, and Agrippa; and as they had not succeeded in procuring his condemnation before them, they saw no prospect of doing it at Rome."
3. "There was a very constant contact between Judea and Rome, but it seems that the Jews who had come before Paul had arrived had not mentioned his case, so as to prejudice them against him."

### John Calvin:
1. "For many do stop the way before themselves with this prejudice, because they cannot abide to hear that which is refused by common judgment, but subscribe to the opinion of other men to the condemning of doctrine which they know not."
2. "But we must note the state of the disputation, which Luke saith is double. For Paul taught first, after what sort the kingdom of God was amongst them, and principally what manner [of] chief felicity and glory that was which was promised to them, which the prophets do so highly extol."
3. "And let us note, that (as Luke doth testify) Paul took all that which he spake of Christ out of the law and prophets. For true religion differeth from all feigned religions, because the word of God alone is the rule thereof."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "This reply of the Roman Jews was more courteous than honest."
2. "It was clearly disingenuous for them on their part to deny any knowledge of his evil fame among the rulers of the people."
3. "The result of the earnest and impassioned pleading of the Christian apostle, told so shortly, but so sorrowfully, in the words of Acts 28:24, ‘and some believed not’ coupled with the evident mournful disappointment manifested by Paul at his complete failure to convince ‘some’ evidently a large number of his Jewish audience, points to the conclusion we have arrived at, that the courteous reply of the Roman Jews to Paul (Acts 28:21) was hollow and false."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Letters (γραμματα). Official documents from the Sanhedrin about the charges against Paul." 
2. "Any harm of thee (τ περ σου πονηρον). Evil (πονηρον)." 
3. "These Jews do not mean to say that they had never heard of Paul."

### John Gill:
1. "We neither received letters out of Judea concerning thee: which was very much, that the high priest and sanhedrim had not wrote to the principal men of their religion at Rome."
2. "Neither any of the brethren that came [from] Jerusalem... shewed or spake any harm of thee."
3. "This they said, to show that they were not prejudiced against him by any person or means; and which carried in it a very considerable testimony of the apostle's innocence."

### John Wesley:
1. "There must have been a peculiar providence in this."
2. "How must the bridle then have been in their mouth!"
3. "We have neither received letters concerning thee."
