# Acts 28:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In his time in Rome, Paul fervently explained and testified about the principles and doctrines of the Christian faith. He expounded on the great spiritual principles of the kingdom of God, seeking to persuade and convince his audience. Despite his efforts, many remained unconvinced, their hearts hardened. Paul dedicated himself to sharing the truth of Jesus as the ordained Head of the kingdom, persistently striving to touch the hearts of both Jews and Gentiles, although realizing that the hope of Israel as a people might be elusive.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Paul, on his part, subjectively, performed that indicated by πείθειν; that this did not produce its objective effect in all his hearers, does not alter the meaning of the word."
2. "Probably the μίσθωμα of Acts 28:30; hardly, as Olsh., the house of Aquila."
3. "Persuading: not 'teaching,' as Kuin., nor 'trying to persuade.'"


### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "considerable numbers" - The word denotes one's place of stay as a guest, not "his own hired house." 
2. "opening up the great spiritual principles of that kingdom in opposition to the contracted and secular views of it entertained by the Jews." 
3. "persuading them concerning Jesus as the ordained and predicted Head of that kingdom."

3. "From morning till evening - An instance of Paul’s indefatigable toil in endeavoring to induce his countrymen to believe in Jesus as the Messiah."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The majority of the listeners remained unconvinced. The long and earnest pleading of Paul with his countrymen dwelling in the queen city, availed nothing."
2. "Only a very few seemed to have listened; as for the rest, their hearts were hopelessly hardened."
3. "From that hour it is probable that Paul for the remainder of his life gave up the hope of touching the heart of Israel as a people, and devoted the few remaining years of his noble life to winning to his loving Master’s side the hated and despised Gentile nations."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Formal arrangement as in Matthew 28:16 when Jesus appointed the mountain for his meeting in Galilee."

### John Gill:
1. "He produced full and sufficient proofs and testimonies from prophecies, miracles, and facts, that the kingdom of the Messiah was come."
2. "The apostle could testify and make it evident, that there was such a kingdom, and such a future glorious state; from the promise of God, to which the twelve tribes of Israel hoped to come; from the prophecies of the Old Testament, which speak of everlasting life, and of the resurrection of the dead unto it; from the expectations of the saints of the former dispensation, who all died in the faith of it; and from the coming of the Messiah, his sufferings and death, and ascension to heaven, whereby he had brought life and immortality to the clearest light."
3. "He endeavored to persuade them, that Jesus was the true Messiah; that he was truly God, and the Son of God, as well as man; that he was born of a virgin, and wrought miracles, and yielded perfect obedience to the law; that he laid down his life as a sacrifice for sin, and to make reconciliation and atonement for it; that he brought in an everlasting righteousness; that he rose again from the dead for justification; that he was ascended up to heaven, and was set down at the right hand of God, where he ever lives to make intercession, and will come again a second time to judge both quick and dead."

### John Wesley:
1. "The kingdom of the Messiah was of a spiritual, not temporal nature."
2. "Jesus of Nazareth was the very person foretold, as the Lord of that kingdom."
3. "He had as much need to persuade as to convince, their will making as strong a resistance as their understanding."
