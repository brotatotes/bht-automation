## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "What simplicity and candor are in this record of a result repeated from age to age where the Gospel is presented to a promiscuous assemblage of sincere and earnest inquirers after truth, frivolous worldlings, and prejudiced bigots!"
2. "The verse highlights the diverse responses to the Gospel, showing that belief is not universal, but rather a personal choice based on individual disposition and openness to truth."
3. "This verse reminds us that the Gospel has the power to both unite and divide, as it exposes the true nature of people's hearts and their willingness to accept or reject the message of salvation."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Belief is not merely an intellectual assent to a set of doctrines or ideas, but a deep conviction that leads to action and transformation."

### John Calvin:
1. "We know that the apostle was endued with such grace of the Spirit, that he ought to have moved stones; and yet he could not, after long disputing and testifying, win all men unto Christ." 
2. "Let us not marvel, if the unbelief of many do at this day resist the plain doctrine of the gospel, and if many remain obstinate, to whom the truth of Christ is no less made manifest than the sun at noon-day." 
3. "Moreover, those return from Paul blind and blockish, who came unto him willingly, as if they had been desirous to learn."

### Philip Schaff:

2. "The melancholy and indignant tone of the apostle’s words...only too plainly tell us of a loving patience at last exhausted."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Some began to be persuaded" - This highlights the gradual process of belief, indicating that it is not always an immediate or instantaneous decision. It suggests that belief can develop over time as one is exposed to evidence or experiences that lead to conviction.

2. "Some continued to disbelieve" - This emphasizes the persistence of disbelief, indicating that not everyone will be convinced or swayed by the same evidence or arguments. It acknowledges that skepticism or doubt can persist even in the face of contrary evidence.

3. "It is usually so" - This statement acknowledges the common pattern of some people being persuaded while others remain skeptical. It recognizes that belief and disbelief are subjective responses that can vary from person to person, highlighting the diversity of perspectives and responses to the same information or circumstances.

### John Gill:
1. "Faith is the gift of God, and which comes by hearing of the word, when it is attended with a divine power; and then it is not only notionally understood, and barely assented to as truth, but is cordially believed and embraced, and cheerfully professed, and steadily held fast."
2. "Their disbelief of these things arose from the prejudices they had conceived about a worldly kingdom; from the sufferings and death of Jesus Christ, they imagining the Messiah would not die, but abide for ever; from the carnal reasonings of their minds, about divine and spiritual things; and from the ignorance that was in them, because of the obduracy of their hearts."
3. "This difference among them, some believing and some not believing, was not owing to the power and free will of man, as if some of themselves would, and did believe, and others would not, but to the distinguishing grace of God; for faith is not of man, it is the gift of God, it is the fruit of electing grace, and is given in consequence of it."

### John Wesley:
1. "Belief is not merely an intellectual assent to a set of facts, but a deep conviction that leads to a personal commitment and trust in the truth being proclaimed."
2. "True belief involves both the mind and the heart, requiring a genuine understanding of the message and a sincere acceptance of its implications."
3. "The transformative power of belief is evident in the lives of those who not only hear the words, but also allow them to take root in their hearts and shape their actions."
