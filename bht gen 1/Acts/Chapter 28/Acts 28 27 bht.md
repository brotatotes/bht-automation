# Acts 28:27 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The people being referred to in this verse have become hardened and resistant to spiritual truths, with their ears becoming dull and their hearts closing off to the message. Their preoccupation with worldly and materialistic matters has caused them to be insensitive to divine and spiritual things. Despite the evidence and preaching they have encountered, they deliberately choose to remain blind and deaf to the truth, refusing to be converted. Without the enlightenment of understanding through the ministry of the word, there can be no healing or salvation, leading to a state of misery and ignorance.

### John Gill:
1. "For the heart of this people is waxed gross,.... Or fat; stupefied with notions of carnal and temporal things, and become hardened against, and unsusceptible of, divine and spiritual things."

2. "and their ears are dull of hearing; the Gospel, and its joyful sound; to which they stop their cars, as the deaf adder to the voice of the charmer."

3. "and their eyes have they closed; and wilfully shut, against all evidence from facts, miracles, prophecies, and preaching: lest they should see with [their] eyes, and hear with [their] ears, and understand with [their] heart, and should be converted."

4. "hearing the Gospel preached, is the ordinary means of understanding spiritual things; and the understanding being enlightened through the ministry of the word, by the Spirit of God, whereby the sinner sees his lost state by nature, his impurity and impotency, the danger he is in, and the destruction that is imminent on him, and he is liable to, and also his need of Christ, and salvation by him."

5. "but when through hearing the word, the understanding is not enlightened, and conversion does not follow upon it, there is no healing of the disease of sin, no pardon applied; and consequently such must be in a most deplorable and miserable condition, as all ignorant hearers and despisers of the Gospel are."
