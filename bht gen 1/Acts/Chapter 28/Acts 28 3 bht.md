# Acts 28:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, we see the story of Paul on the island of Malta, where a particular species of reptiles had disappeared due to human activities. With the aboriginal forest completely cleared, Malta had transformed into an artificial state. As Paul was helping to gather sticks and improve the fire, a viper hidden in the bundle of sticks was awakened by the heat and bit his hand. The viper's bite was venomous and dangerous, and it was evident that Paul was bitten by the viper. Despite these hardships, Paul's character shines through as a man of humility and condescension.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "no person who has studied the changes which the operations of man have produced on the animals of any country, will be surprised that a particular species of reptiles should have disappeared from Malta." 
2. "Perhaps there is no where a surface of equal extent in so artificial a state as that of Malta is at the present day, and no where has the aboriginal forest been more completely cleared."
3. "To suppose the converse ('the ἀπό was adopted by those who thought the sense was 'on account of the fire',' Dr. Bloomf.), is simply absurd; for 1) no man ever could suppose the sense of ἐκ in such a connexion to be this: and 2) even if any one did, he would not have substituted another ambiguous preposition, ἀπό."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The vigorous activity of Paul's character is observable in this comparatively trifling action."
2. "Having laid itself up among the sticks on the approach of the cold winter season, it had suddenly recovered from its torpor by the heat."
3. "Vipers dart at their enemies sometimes several feet at a bound. They have now disappeared from Malta, owing to the change which cultivation has produced."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The viper was doubtless in the bundle of sticks or limbs of trees which Paul had gathered, but was concealed, and was torpid."
2. "But when the bundle was laid on the fire, the viper became warmed by the heat, and came out and fastened on the hand of Paul."
3. "It is not expressly affirmed that Paul was bitten by the viper, yet it is evidently implied; and it is wholly incredible that a viper, unless miraculously prevented, should fasten himself to the hand without biting."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Of sticks [φρυγανων] . Only here in New Testament." 
2. "From ajpo to roast or parch. Hences dry sticks." 
3. "Out of [εκ] . The best texts read ajpo, by reason of."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "We see the apostle here helping with his own hands to improve the fire, as we saw him before in the storm helping with his own hands to lighten the ship." 
2. "Such incidents are part of that natural framework which gives life and reality to the biographies of the New Testament."
3. "By the expression, ‘came out of the heat,’ is meant that the animal came through the bundle of sticks in consequence of being awakened into activity from a torpid state by the heat."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Few things show Paul to better advantage than this incident."
2. "The viper was in a state of torpor in the bundle of sticks. The heat wakened him."
