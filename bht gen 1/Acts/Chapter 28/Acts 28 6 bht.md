# Acts 28:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we see the aftermath of an extraordinary event where a man was bitten by a deadly serpent. The commentators highlight the physical symptoms, such as inflammation and swelling, as well as the perception of the locals. The people initially expected the man to die, viewing his survival as a miraculous preservation attributed to divinity. This sudden change evoked awe and caused some to wrongly assume he was a god, while others praised the mercy of God. The verse also serves as a reminder of how human reasoning can lead to misconceptions and misjudgments.
