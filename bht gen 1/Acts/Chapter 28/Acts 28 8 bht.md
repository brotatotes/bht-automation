# Acts 28:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, we see Paul performing miraculous healings by laying hands on the sick and taking up serpents. The use of plural words like "fevers" suggests recurring and severe attacks of illness, potentially indicating a prolonged and severe condition. The specific mention of dysentery as a medical term highlights the accuracy of Luke's language. These miracles not only demonstrate Paul's authority and power but also serve as a fulfillment of prophecies and a way to show gratitude and bring about the healing and restoration of those in need.
