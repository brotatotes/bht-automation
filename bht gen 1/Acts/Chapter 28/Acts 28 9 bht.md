## BHT:
In this Bible verse, we see that many individuals, not just one, were healed by Jesus. The healing power extended to a multitude of people who sought His help and were afflicted with various diseases. The healing process was continuous, as people kept coming to Jesus for further healing, and it happened gradually over time, not all at once. This healing ministry presented a golden opportunity for spreading the gospel and making known the fame of the miracles performed by Jesus.
