# Acts 3:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Two close companions, Peter and John, ascended the temple terraces to attend the hour of prayer. Although not bound by sacramental redemption, they visited the temple to fulfill the duty of prayer and seize the opportunity to preach about Christ among the gathered crowds. The specific hour mentioned was the ninth hour, signifying the time of the evening sacrifice and an essential part of Jewish religious observance. These disciples engaged in regular prayer, established within their cultural practices, to worship and spread the word of God.
