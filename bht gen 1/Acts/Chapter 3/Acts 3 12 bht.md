# Acts 3:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Description:
Peter, in his response to the crowd, addresses their tendency to attribute the miraculous healing to him and John, emphasizing that it was not their own power or holiness that accomplished the miracle, but rather the work of God. He redirects their attention away from themselves and towards God and Jesus. The crowd's wonder at the Apostles' ability to perform miracles is noted, but Peter admonishes them to recognize that the true cause of these wonders is divine and not of human origin. He urges them to focus on God's power and glory rather than fixating on the messengers.
