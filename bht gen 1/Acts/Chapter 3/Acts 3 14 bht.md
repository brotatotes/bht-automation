### Henry Alford:
1. "ἅγιον κ . δίκ . contrasts with the moral impurity of ἄνδρα φονέα, ἀρχηγ . τ . ζωῆς with the destruction of life implied in φονέα, while ἀπεκτείνατε again stands in remarkable opposition to ἀρχ . τ . ζ." 
2. "This last title given to our Lord implies (as Vulg.) 'Auctorem vitæ:’ see reff.; so ἀρχηγὸν κ . καθηγεμόνα τῆς ὅλης ἐπιβολῆς Ἄρατον, Polyb. ii. 40. 2."
