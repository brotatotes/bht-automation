# Acts 3:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Old Testament prophets collectively and explicitly foretold the suffering and death of the Messiah, a truth initially difficult for both Jews and the Twelve to accept. However, this rejection and wickedness of the rulers ultimately fulfilled God's purpose and brought about the redemption of humanity. Despite the ignorance and guilt of those involved, God, in His infinite wisdom, orchestrated events in such a way that even their sinful actions served His greater plan of salvation. Through this "immense paradox," God demonstrated His power and mercy by bringing life and forgiveness through the death of Christ.
