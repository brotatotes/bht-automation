## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The gate mentioned Jos. B. J. v. 5. 3: τῶν δὲ πυλῶν αἱ μὲν ἐννέα χρυσῷ καὶ ἀργύρῳ κεκαλυμμέναι πανταχόθεν ἦσαν , ὁμοίως τε παραστάδες καὶ τὰ ὑπέρθυρα . μία δὲ ἡ ἔξωθεν τοῦ νεὼ Κορινθίου χαλκοῦ , πολὺ τῇ τιμῇ τὰς καταργύρους καὶ τὰς περιχρύσους ὑπεράγουσα." - This quote provides information about the gates of the Temple and their decoration.

2. "Only the name ὡραία cannot be derived from the town Susan (from which the gate was named, having a picture of the town over it), that word signifying ‘a lily;’ the town being named, it is true, διὰ τὴν ὡραιότητα τοῦ τόπου (Athen [35] xii. 1, p. 573): but the derivation being too far-fetched to be at all probable." - This quote discusses the possible origin of the name "ὡραία" for the gate.

3. "Another suitable circumstance was, that by this gate the market was held for sheep and cattle and other offerings, and therefore a greater crowd would be attracted." - This quote explains why the gate would have been a busy place, attracting a large crowd.

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "The man's condition of being lame from his mother's womb emphasizes the severity and permanence of his disability. It highlights the fact that he had never experienced the ability to walk, making his healing even more miraculous." 

2. "The mention of the man's age, being 'above forty years old,' adds to the significance of his healing. It shows that he had been living with his disability for a long time, making his restoration to health even more remarkable."

3. "The fact that the man was carried by others implies that he was completely dependent on the help of others for his mobility. This emphasizes the extent of his disability and the limitations he faced in his daily life."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The mention of this shows that there was no deception in the case."
2. "Among the ancients there were no hospitals for the sick, and no alms-houses for the poor."
3. "The entrance to the temple would be a favorable place for begging; for: (1)Great multitudes were accustomed to enter there; and, (2)When going up for the purposes of religion, they would be more inclined to give alms than at other times."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The outward face of the Temple, looking at it from the Mount of Olives, as our Lord did that last week of His earthly life, wanted nothing that was likely to surprise men’s minds or their eyes; for it was covered over with plates of gold, which, at the first rising of the sun, reflected back such a splendour as compelled those who forced themselves to look upon it to turn away their eyes, just as they would have done at the sun’s rays." 

2. "The whole pile consisted in a series of terraces rising one above the other, on the topmost of which stood the sanctuary. The circumference of the entire edifice was about half a mile."

3. "The Temple itself was comparatively small, 150 feet long, 150 feet broad, but narrowing as it receded to a breadth of 90 feet. Josephus states it as only 150 feet high, but opinions as to its height vary. It was built of blocks of white marble covered with plates of gold. It contained, besides other chambers, a vestibule, the Holy Place entered by a golden door, and the Holy of Holies."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "The process of carrying the man was ongoing, as depicted by the imperfect passive tense of the verb 'carried'."

3. "The gate through which the man was laid was known for its beauty, possibly being the Gate of Nicanor described by Josephus as magnificent."

### John Gill:
1. "He was born so; his lameness came not through any disease or fall, or any external hurt, but from a defect in nature, in one of his limbs, or more; which made the after miracle the more extraordinary."
2. "Hence he was well known by the people, and to have been of a long time lame, even ever since he was born; so that there could be no imposture in this case."
3. "And as this was now the hour of prayer, and the people were going to the temple to pray, whose entrance was at the east gate; here it might be thought, in all probability, was laid the lame man."

### John Wesley:
1. "The gate of the temple, called Beautiful, was a magnificent structure, adorned with Corinthian brass that surpassed even the gates covered in precious metals. This highlights the grandeur and opulence of the temple, serving as a reminder of the importance and significance of the place where this miracle occurred."

2. "The gate of the temple, called Beautiful, symbolizes the boundary between the Gentiles and the people of Israel. It represents the division and separation that existed between different groups of worshippers. The healing of the lame man at this gate signifies the breaking down of barriers and the inclusivity of God's love and power."

3. "The gate of the temple, called Beautiful, serves as a physical and metaphorical entrance to the presence of God. It is a reminder that God's beauty and glory can be found in the most unexpected places, even in the midst of brokenness and suffering. This miracle at the gate signifies the transformative power of encountering God in the ordinary and mundane aspects of life."
