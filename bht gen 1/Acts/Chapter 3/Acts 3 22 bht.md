## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "That the words, as spoken by Moses, seem to point to the whole line of prophets sent by God, is not any objection to their being applied to Christ, but rather necessitates, and entirely harmonizes with, that application."
2. "And none of the whole prophetic body entirely answered to the ὡς ἐμέ, but Christ."
3. "The Jews therefore rightly understood it (though not always consistent in this, compare Joh 1:21 with Act 6:14) of the Messiah."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "a prophet . . . like unto me—particularly in intimacy of communication with God" - This quote highlights the aspect of the prophet being similar to Moses in terms of their close relationship with God, emphasizing the unique and special nature of this prophet.
2. "Peter takes it for granted that, in the light of all he had just said, it would be seen at once that One only had any claim to be that Prophet." - This quote suggests that Peter believed there was only one person who could fulfill the role of the prophesied prophet, further emphasizing the exclusivity and significance of this individual.
3. "him shall ye hear in all things, &c.—This part of the prediction is emphatically added, in order to shut up the audience to the obedience of faith" - This quote highlights the importance of listening and obeying the words of this prophet, emphasizing the necessity of faith and obedience in response to his teachings.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The authority of Moses among the Jews was absolute and final."
2. "The object of the passage is not to prove that the heavens must receive him, but that he was truly the Messiah."
3. "The promise...is a promise that God would send his prophets, as occasion might demand, to instruct and counsel the nation."

### John Calvin:
1. "For he should have preached in vain of all other things, unless they had been persuaded that his doctrine was reverently to be received."
2. "For although he make mention of a prophet in the singular number, yet the text [context] doth plainly declare, that he speaketh not of one alone; but that this word is put indefinitely."
3. "For, in the second place, the likeness or equality is expressed, as it doth plainly appear. They catch also at another thing, that the prophet shall far excel Moses, of whom he beareth witness as a crier or herald. But this is never a whit stronger, because Moses goeth about to bring to pass that the word of God may be believed by whomsoever it be brought."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Moses claims that God raised him up as a prophet and that another and greater one will come, the Messiah." 
2. "The Jews understood Moses to be a type of Christ." 
3. "God spoke to Moses face to face and he was the greatest of the prophets."

### John Gill:
1. "The passages referred to are in Deuteronomy 18:15 - 'a prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you' - which is not to be understood of a succession of prophets, but of a single prophet, and so the Targums or Onkelos and Jonathan understood it; but not to be applied to Joshua, Jeremiah, or David, but to the Messiah, the Lord Jesus Christ."
2. "He was a prophet in every sense, who brought a revelation of the divine will, taught the way, and explained the Scriptures of truth perfectly, and foretold things to come."
3. "Moses, under God, was an instrument of redeeming the people of Israel out of Egypt, and Christ, he is the Redeemer of his people from sin, Satan, and the law, and all their enemies."

### John Wesley:
1. "The Lord shall raise you up a prophet like unto me — And that in many particulars."
2. "With the prophesying of Moses was soon joined the effect, the deliverance of Israel from Egypt: with the prophesying of Christ that grand effect, the deliverance of his people from sin and death."
3. "Much more do those who are wearied with the law, desire to hear the voice of Christ."
