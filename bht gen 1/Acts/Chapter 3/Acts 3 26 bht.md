## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "It is strange how Olshausen can suppose that the Spirit in Peter overleapt the bounds of his subsequent prejudice with regard to the admission of the Gentiles: he never had any such prejudice, but only against their admission uncircumcised, and as Gentiles."
2. "It is still stranger how a scholar like Dr. Burton can propose the ungrammatical and unmeaning rendering, 'πρῶτον is perhaps used with reference to Christ’s first coming, as opposed to his second.' This would require τὸ πρῶτον, and would certainly imply in the mind of the speaker an absolute exclusion of all but Jews till the second coming."
3. "He came blessing you (his coming was an act of blessing it consisted in the εὐλογεῖν: an anarthrous present participle in such a connexion carries necessarily a slightly ratiocinative sense), in (as the conditional element of the blessing) turning every one from your iniquities: thus conferring on you the best of blessings."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "God, having raised up... his Son Jesus—'His Servant Jesus'... sent him to bless you."

But we have learned other things, and now announce to you that the great blessing with which Messiah has come laden is the turning away of every one of you from his iniquities." 
3. "With what divine skill does the apostle, founding on resistless facts, here drive home to the conscience of his auditors their guilt in crucifying the Lord of Glory; then soothe their awakened minds by assurances of forgiveness on turning to the Lord, and a glorious future as soon as this shall come to pass, to terminate with the Personal Return of Christ from the heavens whither He has ascended."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The highest blessing that can be conferred upon people is to be turned from sin."

3. "For Christ doth not do away the sins of the faithful, to the end they may grant liberty to themselves to sin under this color; but he maketh them therewith all new men."
