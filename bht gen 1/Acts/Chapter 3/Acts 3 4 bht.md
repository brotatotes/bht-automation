## BHT:
In this Bible verse, we see Peter and John approaching a lame man, and with great intensity, Peter fixes his eyes upon him, under the guidance of the Spirit of God. This powerful gaze conveys Peter's focused attention and expectation. Peter then invites the man to look at them closely, urging him to observe their presence and recognize the unlikelihood of them being able to perform a miraculous healing. This extraordinary encounter is marked by the divine power at work, contrary to the tales of supernatural cures from other sources, underscoring the remarkable nature of what is about to unfold.
