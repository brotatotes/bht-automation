# Acts 3:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this biblical verse, a man who had been lame from birth experiences a miraculous healing. He leaps up in joy and begins walking, praising God for his restoration. The immediateness and perfection of the cure are emphasized, as well as the instinctive response of the man to give thanks to God. The healing is described as a leap from weakness to strength, with the man leaping forth repeatedly, standing firm, and walking about. It is evident to all that this was a divine miracle, not the work of man.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "ἐξαλλᾷ describes his first joyous liberation from his weakness: as soon as he felt himself strengthened, he leapt up, for joy."
2. "His joy is quite sufficient to explain the gesture, and it is better to leave the narrative in its simplicity."
3. "If καί before αἰνῶν is omitted, the present participle has its ratiocinative force, alleging the cause of the walking and leaping: and would best be rendered in English, in his praising of God."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Every word here is emphatic, expressing the perfection of the cure."
2. "Its immediateness."
3. "The man went from being unable to walk to leaping, walking, and praising God."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The man would be filled with joy, and would express it in this manner. He had been lame from a child; he had never walked; and there was more in the miracle than merely giving strength."
2. "It is remarkable that he praised God without being taught or entreated to do it. It was instinctive - the natural feeling of the heart."
3. "His first feelings, when he is converted, will be to ascribe the praise to God. While he may and will feel regard for the ministry by whose instrumentality he has received the blessing, yet his main expression of gratitude will be to God."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Leaping up [εξαλλομενος]. Strictly, leaping forth. Only here in New Testament."
2. "Used in medical language of the sudden starting of a bone from the socket, of starting from sleep, or of the sudden bound of the pulse."
3. "The medical notes of the case are, that the disease was congenital, had lasted over forty years, and the progressive steps of the recovery - leaped up, stood, walked."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "His first thought seems to have been: ‘He would go into the sanctuary of his God and there return thanks for his great deliverance.’" This quote highlights the immediate response of the healed man, showing his gratitude and desire to worship God in the temple.

2. "Peter and John, guided by the Holy Ghost, when they cast their eyes on the poor cripple, were not deceived in their estimate of his character." This quote emphasizes the discernment of Peter and John, who were led by the Holy Spirit to recognize the genuine faith and sincerity of the crippled man.

3. "And entered with them into the temple." This simple statement indicates the significance of the temple as a place of worship and the desire of the healed man to join Peter and John in praising God in His sanctuary.
