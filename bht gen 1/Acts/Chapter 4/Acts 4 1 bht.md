# Acts 4:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we see a scene unfolding where the preaching of the apostles is met with resistance and opposition. The Levitical guard, responsible for protecting the temple, was annoyed and displeased with the disturbance caused by the apostles' preaching. Particularly, the Sadducees, who denied the resurrection, were greatly irritated by the apostles' message of Jesus' resurrection. Their opposition stemmed from the threat that the resurrection of Christ posed to their own beliefs and doctrines. Despite the challenges and hostilities they faced, the apostles remained diligent and faithful in their mission to share the word of God.
