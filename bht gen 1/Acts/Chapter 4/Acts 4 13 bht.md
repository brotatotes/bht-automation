# Acts 4:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This verse describes a scene where the rulers are astonished by the boldness and eloquence of Peter and John, who were unlearned and unrecognized men. These men, though lacking in formal education, spoke with conviction and reasoning that impressed those familiar with Jewish learning. Their association with Jesus, along with their astonishing boldness, made their testimony powerful and undeniable. This event serves as a reminder that the effectiveness of ministry relies on genuine conviction and divine empowerment rather than human knowledge or qualifications.
