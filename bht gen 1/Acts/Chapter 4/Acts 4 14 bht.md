# Acts 4:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In a remarkable display of courage and evidence, Peter and the apostles present their claims before the Sanhedrin. The healed man, standing confidently beside them, serves as an irrefutable witness to the truth. Unable to deny the boldness of these uneducated men or the presence of the once-lame man, the critics are silenced and left without any substantial argument against the overwhelming proof presented before them. It is clear that this miraculous event cannot be dismissed or doubted.
