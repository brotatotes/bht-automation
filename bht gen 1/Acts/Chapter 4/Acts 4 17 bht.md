# Acts 4:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the face of opposition and threats, the early Christians faced the challenge of spreading their message. The authorities sought to suppress the influence of the disciples by strictly prohibiting them from speaking in the name of Jesus and performing miracles. However, the passion and unwavering commitment of the disciples, combined with the support of the people, frustrated these attempts. The world saw the spreading of the Christian message as a dangerous infection, but believers found refuge and strength in God, recognizing the insignificance of the threats of powerful individuals compared to the power of their faith.
