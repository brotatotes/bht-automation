# Acts 4:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the face of opposition and potential harm, the apostles boldly stood their ground, fully convinced of the truth they proclaimed. They knew that God's approval was of utmost importance, as their actions were a matter of conscience before Him. Choosing to prioritize God's authority over that of man, they fearlessly declared that they would obey God rather than the commands and decrees of earthly rulers. Even if it meant facing death, they remained steadfast in their conviction to faithfully witness and proclaim the message of Christ.
