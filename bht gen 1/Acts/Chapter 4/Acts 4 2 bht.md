# Acts 4:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Bible verse describes a situation where the preaching of the apostles about the resurrection of the dead, specifically through Jesus, angered and troubled certain individuals. The Sadducees, who denied the resurrection, were upset because the apostles taught about the resurrection of Jesus and the implications it had for their beliefs. The priests and captain of the Temple were also troubled because they saw the apostles' preaching as a threat to their authority and the continuation of their temple services. This preaching caused a stir and challenged the beliefs of various groups, resulting in anger, grief, and opposition.
