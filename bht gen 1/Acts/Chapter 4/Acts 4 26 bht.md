## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Observe the two opposite classes, representing the two interests which were about to come into deadly conflict." 

2. "This verse highlights the tension and conflict that is about to unfold between the followers of Jesus and the religious leaders of the time." 

3. "The release of the apostles and their return to their own company foreshadows the coming clash between the kingdom of God and the kingdom of this world."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The rulers - This is another instance of the Hebrew parallelism. The word does not denote another class of people from kings, but expresses the same idea in another form, or in a more general manner, meaning that all classes of persons in authority would be opposed to the gospel."

2. "Against the Lord - In the Hebrew, 'against Yahweh.' This is the special name which is given in the Scriptures to God. They rose against his plan of appointing a Messiah, and against the Messiah whom he had chosen."

3. "This passage implies that opposition to the Messiah is opposition to Yahweh. And this is uniformly supposed in the sacred Scriptures. He that is opposed to Christ is opposed to God. He that neglects him neglects God. He that despises him despises God."

These quotes highlight the commentary's explanation of the opposition faced by the Messiah from kings, rulers, and all classes of authority. It emphasizes that opposing the Messiah is equivalent to opposing God and neglecting or despising the Messiah is neglecting or despising God.

### John Calvin:
1. "The Spirit teacheth by this word, that all those do make war against God which refuse to submit themselves to Christ."
2. "Because God will reign in the person of his Son alone, we refuse to obey him so often as we rebel against Christ."
3. "Let the hypocrites profess a thousand times that they mean nothing less than to make war against God, yet shall they find this true, that God is their open enemy, unless they embrace Christ with his gospel."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The 2d Psalm, the first two verses of which are woven into the earliest fragment we possess of Christian public worship, was interpreted originally by the Jews as referring to King Messiah." 
2. "The king who sits on David’s throne has become glorified and transfigured in the light of the promise. The picture is half ideal, half actual; it concerns itself with the present, but with that only so far as it is typical of greater things to come."
3. "There is an exact correspondence between the leading enemies mentioned in the Psalm, who arose against the Lord and His Anointed, and those who were present at the scenes of the condemnation and death of Jesus."

### Archibald T. Robertson:

### John Gill:
1. "The kings of the earth stood up... and the rulers were gathered together." 
2. "And this opposition, and these conspiracies and consultations, were against the Lord."
3. "What was done against Christ, was done against the Lord, their views and designs, their interest and glory, being the same."
