## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "ποιῆσαι, (ὡς μὲν ἐδόκει, τὴν ἰδίαν βουλήν, ὄντως δὲ) ὅσα... As De Wette well remarks, συνήχθησαν ποιῆσαι) is used subjectively, ‘they were collected, to do,’ and then the speaker changes his ground to an objective one in ὅσα (as they believed but really) as many things as Thy hand, &c."
2. "ποιῆσαι must not be rendered, with Kuinoel, ‘ita ut facerent.’ It does not express the result, but the intention, of their assembling. Still worse is it to take ποιῆσαι with ἔχρισας, ‘Whom Thou hast anointed, … to do,’ &c., as some have proposed: the parenthesis, as well as the whole train of thought, forbidding it."
3. "ἡ χείρ σ. κ. ἡ βουλή] not a ἓν διὰ δυοῖν (Kuinoel): χείρ indicates the Power, βουλή the Wisdom of God. The Wisdom decreed, the Hand performed: but the same word προώρισεν is used of both by what grammarians call zeugma as in γάλα ὑμᾶς ἐπότισα ‚ οὐ βρῶυα, 1 Corinthians 3:2."
