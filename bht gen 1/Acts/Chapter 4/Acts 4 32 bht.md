## BHT:
In this verse, the commentator emphasizes the unity and harmony among believers. They stress that when faith rules in our hearts, it reconciles our minds and causes us to desire the same things. It is through this unity, marked by a deep and intimate connection with God, that we are able to love one another with an undivided affection. This love is not merely superficial, but it manifests as a genuine and selfless commitment to support one another and prioritize the common cause of Christ.
