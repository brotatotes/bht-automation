## BHT:
In the early Christian community, believers showed great veneration and respect for the apostles, willingly subjecting their worldly possessions to their disposal. Distribution was made in a humble act of submission and acknowledgment of authority, ensuring that every individual received what they needed, as determined by the apostles. This act of sharing and giving was initially carried out by the apostles themselves, but later entrusted to others whom they appointed, emphasizing the importance of generosity, compassion, and the continued commitment to meeting the needs of the community.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "παρὰ τοὺς πόδας, not a Hebraism for the whole person but literal." 
2. "The Apostles, like the Prætor, probably sat upon a raised seat, on the step of which, at their feet, the money was laid, in token of reverence." 
3. "In token of reverence."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "laid . . . at the apostles' feet" - This phrase suggests a position of submission and humility, as if the person bringing the offering is acknowledging the authority and leadership of the apostles.
2. "sitting, it may be, above the rest" - This implies that the person who brought the offering may have been given a place of honor or distinction among the believers, possibly due to their generosity or devotion.
3. "here meant figuratively" - This suggests that the act of laying the offering at the apostles' feet may symbolize the surrender of one's possessions and resources to God, recognizing that everything belongs to Him and should be used for His purposes.
