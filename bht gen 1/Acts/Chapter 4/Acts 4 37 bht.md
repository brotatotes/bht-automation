# Acts 4:37 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This Bible verse describes a situation where a person, possibly Barnabas, who may have had a significant estate, sells a valuable piece of land. The ownership and acquisition of this land are uncertain, as it could be in Cyprus or elsewhere. Being a Levite, Barnabas would not have had a specific inheritance in Israel, making his act of selling the land and laying the money at the apostles' feet significant.

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Having a held (υπαρχοντος αυτω αγρου)." - This phrase indicates that the person in question already possessed the field before selling it. It emphasizes the ownership and possession of the field.

2. "Sold it and brought (πωλησας ηνεγκεν)." - This highlights the action of selling the field and bringing the proceeds. It shows the intentionality and purpose behind the sale, suggesting that it was a deliberate decision.

3. "So also with εθηκεν (laid), first aorist active." - This phrase refers to the action of laying the proceeds at the apostles' feet. It implies a sense of humility and submission, as the person willingly gives up their possession and presents it to the apostles.

### John Gill:
1. "Whether this was in Cyprus, or in Judea, is not certain; nor how he came by it, whether he had bought it, as the priests and Levites might, and as Jeremiah, who was of the priests, bought a field at Anathoth."
2. "Moreover, the Jewish doctors interpret the above law otherwise; and understand it only of changing, and not of selling, which they allow of."
3. "And agreeably to this is what Maimonides says, 'they do not make in the cities of the Levites a city a suburb, or a suburb a city, or a suburb a field, or a field a suburb...but the field, suburbs, and city, everyone of these three shall be as they are forever.'"

These quotes provide insights into the uncertainty surrounding the location and acquisition of Barnabas' land, the interpretation of the law regarding the selling of land by the Levites, and the significance of Barnabas' action in laying the money at the apostles' feet.
