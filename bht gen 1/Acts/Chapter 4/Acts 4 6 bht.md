# Acts 4:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we encounter a powerful and politically charged scene involving key figures in the Jewish religious establishment during the time of Jesus. The mention of Annas and Caiaphas, both referred to as high priests, reflects the corrupt and political nature of the high priesthood. Annas, though deposed from the position, still exerted significant influence within the religious hierarchy. The presence of these high priests and their associates highlights the collusion and conspiracy against Jesus, illustrating the unity of the religious leaders in opposing him.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:

2. "Lightfoot supposes John to be identical with the Jochanan ben Zacchai of the Talmud, who however (De W.) was not of the high-priestly, but only of the priestly race."
3. "Pearson, Wolf, Krebs, and Mangey suppose Alexander to have been the brother of Philo Jud√¶us, mentioned by Jos. Antt. xviii. 8. 1. But this is very improbable; for he was Alabarch of the Jews at Alexandria, Jos. ibid."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Annas and Caiaphas, the high priests during the time of Jesus, held significant religious and political power in Jerusalem. Their mention in this verse highlights the authority and influence they had in the Jewish community."
2. "The inclusion of John and Alexander, although little is known about them, suggests that they were also prominent figures in the religious hierarchy. This further emphasizes the significance of the individuals involved in the trial of Jesus."
3. "The mention of these high priests and their associates underscores the gravity of the situation. It reveals the powerful forces at play and the extent to which Jesus' trial was orchestrated by influential figures within the Jewish religious establishment."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The Sanhedrim was the supreme court in the Jewish nation. Its powers embraced all matters, civil as well as religious. It tried accused persons, and its decisions admitted of no appeal."
2. "The actual high priest at this time was Caiaphas; but Annas, his father-in-law, originally held this great dignity."
3. "He [Annas] was perhaps the most influential person among the Jews at this time. Raised to the high-priestly dignity by Cyrenius, the governor of Syria, then deposed by Valerius Gratus, procurator of Judea, early in the reign of Tiberius, he still continued to exercise the chief power during the priesthood of his son-in-law Caiaphas a period of twelve years."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Annas, one of the rulers or chief priests, ex-high priest and father-in-law of Caiaphas, was a prominent figure in the religious hierarchy of the time." 

2. "The title of high priest may have belonged to Caiaphas by Roman law, but Annas still held influence and was considered a high priest by the Jewish people." 

3. "Annas, along with John and Alexander, were leaders among the Sadducees and played a significant role in opposing Peter and John."

### John Gill:
1. "And Annas the high priest,.... So called, either because he had been an high priest, though he was not now, but Caiaphas his son-in-law; or because he was the Sagan of the high priest, and had all the other priests under his government." This quote explains the reason for Annas being referred to as the high priest, even though he was not currently holding that position.

2. "AndCaiaphas; who was properly high priest, and continued so for three years after the death of Christ." This quote provides information about Caiaphas, stating that he was the legitimate high priest and remained in that position for three years after Jesus' crucifixion.

3. "and John; who is thought by Dr. Lightfoot to be the same with Jochanan, or John ben Zaccai; a famous Jewish Rabbi, who lived at this time, and until, and after the destruction of Jerusalem." This quote introduces John, possibly identified as John ben Zaccai, a renowned Jewish Rabbi who lived during that period and even after the destruction of Jerusalem.

### John Wesley:
1. "The mention of both Annas and Caiaphas as high priests during the time of Jesus is historically accurate and significant. It highlights the corrupt and political nature of the high priesthood in that era, where the position was often bought or inherited rather than earned through spiritual qualifications."

2. "The fact that Annas is mentioned first, even though he had been deposed from the position of high priest, shows that he still held significant influence and power in the religious hierarchy. This further emphasizes the political maneuvering and power struggles within the Jewish religious leadership."

3. "The presence of both Annas and Caiaphas as high priests during Jesus' trial underscores the collusion and conspiracy against Jesus. It suggests that the religious leaders were united in their opposition to Jesus and were willing to set aside their differences to ensure his arrest and crucifixion."
