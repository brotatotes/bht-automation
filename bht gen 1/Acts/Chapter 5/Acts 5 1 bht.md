# Acts 5:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we see the cautionary tale of Ananias and Sapphira, who sought to deceive the early Christians and God Himself. Their hypocrisy is exposed as they attempt to appear generous in selling their field, while secretly keeping a portion of the proceeds for themselves. The act of selling the field was deliberate and final, emphasizing their intentional deceit. This story serves as a reminder that even in the purest churches, there may be those who seek personal gain and disguise it as devotion.
