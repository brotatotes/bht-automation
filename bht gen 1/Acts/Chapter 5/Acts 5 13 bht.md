# Acts 5:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse describes a scene where the early believers are held in both fear and admiration by the masses. The disciples are regarded with reverence and kept at a distance out of a sense of awe. The fate of Ananias and Sapphira serves as a deterrent, causing people to hesitate before joining the believers. The refusal to join them signifies the need for genuine faith and sincere devotion, as hypocrites and formalists are rejected.

### John Wesley:
1. "None of the rest â€” No formalists or hypocrites, durst join themselves" - This quote highlights that the verse is referring to those who were not genuine in their faith.

2. "In an outward show only, like Ananias and Sapphira" - This quote draws a parallel to the story of Ananias and Sapphira, who pretended to be fully devoted followers but were ultimately exposed for their deceit. It serves as a cautionary reminder that true faith cannot be faked, and that God sees through any facade.

3.
