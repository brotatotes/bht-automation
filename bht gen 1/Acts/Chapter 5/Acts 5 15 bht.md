# Acts 5:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, the apostles perform miraculous acts, which caused admiration and respect among the people. They brought sick individuals out into the broad streets, hoping to be healed by their touch or even the shadow of Peter. This incredible belief in Peter's power to work miracles shows the full faith the people had in him. However, it is important to note that this passage has been misused by some to support claims of miracles and relics. The main emphasis, though, is on the apostles' role as powerful ministers of the gospel.
