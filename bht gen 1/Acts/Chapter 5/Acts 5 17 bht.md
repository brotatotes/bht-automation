# Acts 5:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, we see the opposition Jesus faced from the Sadducees, a sect within Judaism known for denying the resurrection and the existence of angels. Their skepticism towards Jesus' teachings on eternal life and the spiritual realm is evident, as they were envious of the success of the apostles and filled with anger and bitter persecution. The inclusion of the Sadducees emphasizes the diversity of religious beliefs in Jesus' time and sheds light on the political and religious power they held.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "To suppose that the H. P. 'rose up' after a council held is far-fetched, and against the ἐπλήσθησαν ζήλου, which points to the kindling zeal of men first stirred up to action."
2. "ὁ ἀρχ. Annas, ch. Acts 4:6, and note on Luke 3:2."
3. "ἡ οὖσα attr., but implying more than οἱ ὄντες ἐξ αἱρέσεως τ. Σ.: the movement extended through the whole sect."

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "The mention of the Sadducees in this verse is significant because it helps us understand the context and the opposition that Jesus faced. The Sadducees were a sect within Judaism that denied the resurrection of the dead and the existence of angels and spirits. This sheds light on their skepticism towards Jesus and his teachings on eternal life and the spiritual realm."

2. "The inclusion of the Sadducees in this passage also highlights the diversity of religious beliefs and factions within Judaism during Jesus' time. It reminds us that Jesus' ministry was not only met with opposition from the religious leaders but also from different theological perspectives within the Jewish community."

3. "By specifying the Sadducees, the author of Acts is emphasizing the particular group that was responsible for the arrest and persecution of the apostles. This highlights the political and religious power that the Sadducees held, as they were able to influence the authorities and suppress the spread of the early Christian movement."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It seems from this place that he belonged to the sect of the Sadducees."
2. "The main doctrine of this sect was the denial of the resurrection of the dead."
3. "They were 'envious' at the success of the apostles - at the number of converts that were made to a doctrine that they hated."

### John Calvin:
1. "With what blind fury and rage Satan driveth them forward, when as they are so little terrified with such evident power of God, that they run headlong more boldly, and with greater force, and bend all their force, as it were, to overthrow the very heaven."
2. "Especially the knowledge of the gifts of God, whereby he testifieth that he is present with us, ought to encourage us, lest the fury and boldness of the wicked do terrify and dismay us."
3. "We see at this day those men moved and stirred with devilish fury, who will be counted the most devout of all men, who rage horribly to shed innocent blood."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The high priest rose up...excited and alarmed at the growing power of these followers of the Crucified, determined at once again to try and crush them by violent measures."
2. "These were not his brother judges in the great council, but those who sympathized with him in his bitter hatred of Christ’s followers."
3. "The fear and anger of the Sadducees were more than ever stirred up...with them, in their bitter hostility to the doctrines of Jesus, Annas heartily joined."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "The existing sect of the Sadducees" - This phrase highlights the specific group being referred to, emphasizing their distinct beliefs and practices.
2. "An opinion chosen or tenet" - This description of the word "heresy" provides insight into the nature of the Sadducees' beliefs, suggesting that they held a particular set of chosen opinions or doctrines.
3. "Applied here to the Sadducees; to the Pharisees in Acts 15:5; Acts 26:5; to the Christians in Acts 24:5-14; Acts 28:22" - This shows that the term "heresy" is not exclusive to the Sadducees but is also used to describe other religious groups, indicating the existence of various factions and divisions within the religious landscape of the time.

### John Gill:
1. "He having heard what miracles were wrought by the apostles, and what additions were made to them, rose up from his seat and went out of the sanhedrim, in great haste and in much wrath and passion." 
2. "The high priest and his party very uneasy; whence it seems that the then high priest was a Sadducee, and also the sanhedrim at that time."
3. "They were filled with indignation; or 'zeal,' for Sadducism; and which was a blind zeal, and not according to knowledge."

Note: The commentary is quite long, so I had to condense it into three quotes that capture the main points.

### John Wesley:
1. "The high priest — and the sect of the Sadducees - A goodly company for the priest!"
2. "He, and these deniers of any angel or resurrection, were filled with zeal."
3. "Angry, bitter, persecuting zeal."
