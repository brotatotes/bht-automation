# Acts 5:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verses in question include a bold and pictorial command, urging the disciples to stand and proclaim all the words of this life, which refers to the message of eternal life found in the Risen One. The Lord's deliverance of the disciples from prison was not to excuse them from their duty, but rather to empower them to fulfill their calling and proclaim the life-giving power of Jesus Christ. This Gospel message is the means by which dead sinners are quickened, drooping saints are revived, and believers are nourished unto eternal life.
