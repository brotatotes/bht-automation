# Acts 5:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the early hours of the morning, as day was breaking, there was a hasty gathering of the Sanhedrin, possibly with some elders who were opponents of Jesus and his teachings. The Apostles, filled with the indwelling Spirit, fearlessly stood before the council, following the command of the angel. The council attempted to gather all the courts of judicature to try the Apostles for their disobedience, but little did they know that Peter and the others had miraculously escaped from prison.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Perhaps the παραγενόμενος … συνεκάλεσαν …, implying that the summons was not issued till after the arrival of the H. P. and his friends, may point to a meeting of the Sanhedrim hurriedly and insufficiently called, for the purpose of ‘packing’ it against the Apostles."
2. "If so, they did not succeed, see Acts 5:40; perhaps on account of the arrival of some who had been listeners to the Apostles’ preaching."
3. "Probably the πρεσβύτεροι, including perhaps some who were not members of the Sanhedrim; the well-known foes of Jesus and his doctrine."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "How self-possessed! the indwelling Spirit raising them above fear."
2. "An unusually general convention, though hastily summoned."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Early in the morning - Greek: at the break of day. Compare Luke 24:1; John 8:2." 
2. "Called the council together - The Sanhedrin, or the Great Council of the nation. This was clearly for the purpose of 'trying' the apostles for disregarding their commandments."
3. "And all the senate - Greek: 'eldership.' Probably these were not a part of the Sanhedrin, but were people of age and experience, who in Acts 4:8; Acts 25:15, are called 'elders of the Jews,' and who were present for the sake of counsel and advice in a case of emergency."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Render as Rev., about daybreak."
2. "The word in this passage is the name of the Spartan assembly, Gerousia, the assembly of elders, consisting of thirty members, with the two kings."
3. "The different words emphasize different aspects of confinement. Thrhsiv is keeping, as the result of guarding. See on ver. Acts 5:18Fulakh emphasizes the being put under guard, and desmwthrion the being put in bonds."

### John Calvin:
1. "The beautiful colors of right and equity do never so cover hypocrites, but that they do at length betray their wickedness."
2. "We know how proudly the Papists boast of that maxim of theirs, that lawful councils must be obeyed, because they represent the Church."
3. "Where the truth of God is not sought, all outward appearance is nothing else but a mere visor."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "During many months of the year in the Holy Land the heat becomes too oppressive for the ordinary labour of the day soon after sunrise."
2. "In the early dawn (see John 20:1) the work of the day would begin, and the worshippers and the many traders and others connected with the busy life of the great Temple of Jerusalem would have arrived."
3. "The high priest and his friends in the council assembled in the early morning without being aware of the escape of Peter and the others."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Under the dawn" or "about dawn." Sub lucem. The temple doors would be open for early worshippers and traffickers (John 2:14).
2. The council (το συνεδριον). The Sanhedrin.
3. The senate (την γερουσιαν). From γερων, an old man, just as the Latin senatus is from senex, old. Like the γεροντες in Homer and the Elder Statesmen in Japan.

### John Gill:
1. "They were obedient to the command of the angel, believing him to be a messenger of God, who declared his will, which they readily complied with."
2. "They went in [to the temple] early in the morning, as soon as ever the temple doors were opened, and there were any people got together."
3. "The high priest, and those that were with him at the same time that they convened all the courts of judicature in Jerusalem together, sent their officers to the prison, to fetch the apostles."
