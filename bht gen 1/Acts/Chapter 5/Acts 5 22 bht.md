## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The mention of the Sadducees in this verse is significant because it helps us understand the context and the opposition that Jesus faced. The Sadducees were a sect within Judaism that did not believe in the resurrection of the dead or in the existence of angels or spirits. This sets up a theological clash between Jesus and the Sadducees, as Jesus often taught about the resurrection and the spiritual realm."

2. "The fact that the Sadducees were mentioned in Acts 4:1 also highlights the political and religious power that they held during that time. They were part of the ruling elite and had significant influence over the religious affairs of the Jewish people. This adds another layer of complexity to the opposition that Jesus faced, as he not only challenged their theological beliefs but also threatened their authority."

3. "By specifying the Sadducees, the author of Acts is emphasizing the diversity and complexity within Judaism during the time of Jesus. It shows that there were different sects and groups with varying beliefs and practices. This helps us understand the broader religious and cultural landscape in which Jesus ministered and the challenges he encountered from different factions."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The term 'officers' refers to those who served as attendants or assistants to the judge or magistrate in the court of law. They were responsible for maintaining order and ensuring that justice was carried out. In this context, Jesus is using the term to emphasize the importance of settling disputes quickly and peacefully."

2. "The role of the officers was not just to enforce the law, but also to promote reconciliation and harmony among the people. Jesus is urging his followers to seek resolution and avoid unnecessary conflict, highlighting the value of forgiveness and peacemaking."

3. "By addressing the officers, Jesus is reminding them of their responsibility to uphold justice and righteousness. He encourages them to act with integrity and fairness, reminding them that their actions have a significant impact on the lives of those involved in legal disputes."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The officers, or under-rowers, were the servants or officers who executed the orders of the Sanhedrin." 

2. "The doors were shut tight, indicating the secure and guarded nature of the prison." 

3. "The image of the sentinels standing at the doors provides a vivid picture of the guards stationed at the prison."

### John Gill:
1. "The officers came to the prison and found them not in the prison."
2. "The angel had opened the doors for the apostles, yet he shut them again."
3. "Upon opening them and searching the prison, they could find none of them in it."
