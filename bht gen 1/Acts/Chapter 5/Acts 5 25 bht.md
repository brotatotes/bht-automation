In this verse, a man is mentioned who is not identified by name, but is described by John Gill as someone who is likely not a disciple or a professing Christian.

Another commentator adds that this man was part of a group that had been imprisoned for their teachings in the name of Jesus, yet they fearlessly continue to teach openly in the temple.

### John Gill:
1. "Who this man was, is of no consequence to know; it can hardly be thought that he was one of the number of the disciples, or a member of the church, or a professor of the Christian religion." 
2. "But rather an enemy, and one that sought his own interest, and to obtain the favour and affection of the chief priests and elders."
3. "Behold, the men whom ye put in prison, last night, are standing in the temple; openly and publicly, and without fear; and teaching the people; in the name of Jesus, which the sanhedrim had forbid them to do."
