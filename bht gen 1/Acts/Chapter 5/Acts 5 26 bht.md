# Acts 5:26 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, a group of ecclesiastics approached the apostles with caution, not resorting to violence but instead using gentle methods to convince them to go with them. The ecclesiastics were aware of the favorable opinion the people held of the apostles, considering the miracles they had witnessed, and they feared a potential backlash from the crowd. The apostles, therefore, were being handled delicately, as the ecclesiastics were mindful of the people's admiration for them and sought to maintain peace.

3.
