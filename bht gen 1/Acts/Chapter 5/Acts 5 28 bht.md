# Acts 5:28 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we see the high priest and the Sanhedrin accusing the apostles of disobedience to their commands and spreading a novel doctrine. The enemies of the Gospel resort to cunning tactics, punishing the innocent for obeying God. The apostles, on the other hand, simply proclaim the truth without any intention to accuse or harm anyone. This confrontation reflects the tension between religious authority and the faithful who remain steadfast in their beliefs.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The same shyness of open allusion to the names or facts connected with Jesus and the spread of his doctrine may be traced in the ὀνόματι τούτῳ, and the ἀνθρώπου τούτου, and is a strong mark of truth and circumstantiality." - Chrys.

2. "Not meaning, that divine vengeance would come on them for the murder of Jesus: but with a stress on ἡμᾶς that the people would be incited to take vengeance on them, the Sanhedrim, for that murder." - Commentary

3. "This being so, the resemblance between this expression and the imprecation of the people in Mat 27:25 must not be too closely pressed, though the coincidence is too striking to escape notice." - Commentary

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "They avoid naming Him whom Peter gloried in holding up." 
2. "In speaking thus, they seem to betray a disagreeable recollection of their own recent imprecation, His blood be upon us." 
3. "And of the traitor's words as he threw down the money, 'I have sinned in that I have betrayed innocent blood'."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "When Chastens are arraigned or persecuted, it is well if the only charge which their enemies can bring against them is that they have been distinguished for zeal and success in propagating their religion." 
2. "To bring 'one's blood' upon another is a phrase signifying to hold or to prove him guilty of murdering the innocent." 
3. "That the apostles 'did' intend to charge them with being guilty of murder is clear; but it is observable that on 'this occasion' they had said no thing of this, and it is further observable that they did not charge it on them 'except in their presence.'"

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The best texts omit ouj, not, and the question."
2. "We straitly charged. So Rev. [παραγγελια πατηγγειλαμεν] . Lit., we charged you with a charge."
3. "The phrase is remarkable as furnishing the first instance of that avoidance of the name of Christ which makes the Talmud, in the very same terms, refer to him most frequently as Peloni, 'so and so.'"

### John Calvin:
1. "He pretendeth, at the first, doctrine; but we may gather out of the end that he was not so careful for doctrine."
2. "It was an heinous offense not to obey the chief priest; how much more heinous was it, then, to despise the whole order?"
3. "Now, forasmuch as he doth manifestly play the minister of Satan, he borroweth authority, without shame and color, of the name of Christ."

These quotes highlight the chief priest's ulterior motives, the seriousness of disobeying authority, and the misuse of religious authority for personal gain.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "A concealed dread underlies the whole of the high priest’s accusation."
2. "The charge against them really was one of direct disobedience to a decree of the Sanhedrim."
3. "In their public teaching, the high priest and his assessors in the council were charged with the awful accusation of murdering the Messiah."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Like the Hebrew idiom (common in the LXX), though found in Greek, with charging (instrumental case) we charged." 
2. "The Sanhedrin gladly took the blood of Christ on their heads and their children to Pilate."
3. "Contemptuous slur and refusal to call the name of Jesus as in the Talmud later."

### John Gill:
1. "They disregarded the council, and its orders, its commands and threatenings, and preached the doctrines of the Gospel."
2. "And this they represent as a novel doctrine, devised by the apostles, and peculiarly theirs; and which Moses, and the prophets, were strangers to."
3. "As we have been guilty in shedding his blood, the punishment of it will, one day or other, be inflicted on us; as it accordingly was, and as they themselves imprecated in Matthew 27:25."

### John Wesley:
1. "See the poor cunning of the enemies of the Gospel. They make laws and interdicts at their pleasure, which those who obey God cannot but break; and then take occasion thereby to censure and punish the innocent, as guilty."
2. "An artful and invidious word. The apostles did not desire to accuse any man. They simply declared the naked truth."
3. "They make laws and interdicts at their pleasure, which those who obey God cannot but break; and then take occasion thereby to censure and punish the innocent, as guilty."
