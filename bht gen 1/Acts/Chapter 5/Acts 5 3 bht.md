### John Calvin:
1. "If the Spirit of God, by the mouth of a mortal man, do so sore urge an hypocrite, being otherwise painted with the beautiful color of virtues, how shall the reprobate abide the voice of God himself, with the sound of the trumpet, when they shall appear before his judgment-seat?"
2. "For there is no man whose heart is not pricked with the pricks of Satan, and all men are also many ways tempted, yea, these temptations pierce into their minds; but where Satan possesseth the heart, he reigneth in the whole man, having, as it were, expelled God."
3. "Wherefore we must take great heed, that hypocrisy reign not in us, which hath this wickedness proper to it, to go about to deceive God, and, as it were cornicum oculos configere. To go about to make blind those which are most wise."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "It was in the solemn assembly of the believers for prayer and counsel, Peter and the twelve no doubt sitting on their raised chairs...when Ananias presented his rich offering." 
2. "We are not directly told how Peter obtained his information respecting the fraud; still, we can have no doubt of the source: it was no earthly presence which guided and executed the dread judgment of that court."
3. "In Peter’s question to Ananias, ‘Why hath Satan filled thine heart?’ two points claim a special comment: (1) The foremost of the Twelve, who had learned his doctrine from the life of Jesus, distinctly here acknowledges his belief in the existence and personality of the spirit of evil, Satan; (2) By his Question, ‘Why,’ etc., he evidently recognises man’s free will, his power to resist if he choose, the promptings of the evil one."

2. "Why hath Satan filled thine heart? or emboldened thee, given thee so much spirit and courage to act in such an impudent and audacious manner."
3. "This instance of Ananias was such, that none but Satan could have put him upon, or emboldened him to have done; who from hence appeared to have the power over him, and to have possessed him, to have great access to him, even to his heart, and great influence upon it."
