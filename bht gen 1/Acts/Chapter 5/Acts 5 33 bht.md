# Acts 5:33 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The crowd's response to the apostles' message was intense and filled with rage. They were deeply offended and their hearts were cut as if with a saw, seething with anger. The religious leaders, driven by their fury and indignation, plotted to kill the apostles, disregarding legal procedures and seeking a private or forceful execution. This violent reaction showcases their hardened hearts and resistance to the message of Jesus, contrasting with the humbled hearts of the first converts on the day of Pentecost.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "They were cut asunder (in heart)." 
2. "Findor, ut Arcadiæ pecuaria rudere credas." (Translation: "I am split, as if you would believe the flocks of Arcadia to be lowing.") 
3. "Cor meum et cerebrum, Nicobule, finditur, Istius hominis ubi fit quaque mentio." (Translation: "My heart and brain, Nicobule, are split, whenever mention is made of that man.")

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "How different this feeling and the effect of it from that 'pricking of the heart' which drew from the first converts on the day of Pentecost the cry, 'Men and brethren, what shall we do?'" 
2. "The words used in the two places are strikingly different." 
3. "The contrast between the response of the crowd on the day of Pentecost and the response of the religious leaders here highlights the hardness of heart and resistance to the message of Jesus."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "They were cut to the heart - The word used here properly denotes 'to cut with a saw'; and as applied to the 'mind,' it means to be agitated with 'rage' and 'indignation,' as if wrath should seize upon the mind as a saw does upon wood, and tear it violently, or agitate it severely."
2. "When used in connection with 'the heart,' it means that the heart is violently agitated and rent with rage."
3. "The 'reasons' why they were thus indignant were doubtless: Took counsel - The word rendered 'took counsel' denotes commonly 'to will'; then, 'to deliberate'; and sometimes 'to decree' or 'to determine.' It doubtless implies here that 'their minds 'were made up' to do it; but probably the formal decree was not passed to put them to death."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "They were cut to the heart [διεπριοντο]. Only here and ch. 7 54. The verb means, originally, to saw asunder. A strong figure for exasperation." 

2. "To slay. See on Luke 23:32." 

3. "The verb means, originally, to saw asunder."

### John Calvin:
1. "No reasons can prevail with the reprobate, to bring them unto the obedience of Christ; for unless God speak within, the outward doctrine shall be able to do nothing else but to beat the cars."
2. "The force of the word pierceth into their hearts, so that it urgeth their consciences; for thence springeth their fury, because they saw themselves urged by their judge."
3. "There is in the gospel a certain hidden majesty, which driveth away mightily all their delicacy."

2. "Took counsel to slay them. To carry out such a sentence, the sanction of the Roman Government must have been first obtained" - This quote emphasizes the seriousness of the situation and the potential legal consequences the religious leaders were considering.

3. "This was the case in the summary execution of St. Stephen the deacon" - This reference to a previous event adds historical context and suggests a pattern of violence against those who challenged the religious authorities.

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Rage that cuts into their hearts" - The intense emotions of the crowd were not driven by conviction of sin, but by anger and hostility towards the apostles.
