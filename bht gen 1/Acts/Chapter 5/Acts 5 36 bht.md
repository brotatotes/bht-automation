## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "We are plainly in no position to charge St. Luke with having put into the mouth of Gamaliel words which he could not have uttered."
2. "All we can say is, that such impostors were too frequent, for any one to be able to say that there was not one of this name at the time specified."
3. "The λέγων εἶναι of our text is curiously related to the ἔλεγεν εἶναι of Josephus."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The 'advice' of Gamaliel was to permit these men to go on."
2. "The name 'Theudas' was a common name among the Jews; and there is no improbability that there were 'two' leaders of an insurrection of this name."
3. "It is altogether improbable that 'Gamaliel' should refer to a case which was not well authenticated, and that Luke should record a speech of this kind unless it was delivered, when it would be so easy to detect the error."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Joined themselves [προσεκολληθη] . The best texts read prosekliqh, were inclined; i.e., leaned to, or took sides with."

2. "The word προσεκολληθη implies a strong attachment or association, suggesting that those who joined themselves to someone were closely united with them."

3. "This verse highlights the idea that when we join ourselves to someone, we are not merely making a casual connection, but rather forming a deep bond and aligning ourselves with their beliefs and values."

### John Calvin:
1. "Men have unlucky success when as they advance themselves un-advisedly; and that cometh to pass by the just judgment of God."
2. "The constancy of the apostles was the more excellent, who, though they be so evil rewarded for those long pains which they had endured, yet are they not discouraged, neither do they cease to hold on as they had begun."
3. "He feareth [deterreth] the wicked from wicked boldness, because there is nothing more to be feared than to strive against God."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "He does not speak of ancient records, though he might have done so, but of more recent histories, which are most powerful to induce belief."
2. "This is one of the so-called historical inaccuracies of the ‘Acts.’"
3. "The mistake of identifying the Theudas of Josephus with the Theudas instanced by the writer of the ‘Acts,’ is probably in great measure owing to the mistake of Eusebius."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Josephus gives an account of four men named Simon who followed each other within forty years, and of three named Judas within ten years, who were all instigators of rebellion" (Hackett).
2. "If the same Theudas is meant, then either Josephus or Luke (Gamaliel) has the wrong historical order. In that case one will credit Luke or Josephus according to his estimate of the two as reliable historians."
3. "To be somebody (εινα τινα). Indirect assertion with the infinitive and the accusative of general reference (εαυτον) and τινα, predicate accusative. Τινα could be 'anybody' or 'somebody' according to context, clearly 'somebody' of importance here."

### John Gill:
1. "This account agrees with this instance of Gamaliel, only differs in chronology; since, according to Gamaliel's account, this case of Theudas was some time ago, and must have been before now, or he could not have mentioned it; whereas the story Josephus relates, as being in the times of Cuspius Fadus, was several years after this."
2. "Some think Josephus is mistaken in his chronology, and then all is right."
3. "This instance Gamaliel produces, to show that impostors and seditious persons, such as the apostles were thought to be, seldom succeeded, but generally failed in their attempts, and were blasted."

### John Wesley:
1. "He prudently mentions the facts first, and then makes the inference."
2. "The author skillfully presents the sequence of events, allowing the reader to draw their own conclusions."
3. "By presenting the facts before drawing any conclusions, the author demonstrates a logical and methodical approach to his argument."
