# Acts 5:38 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Refrain from opposing these men and their work, for if it is a human endeavor it will fail on its own. Instead, join a cause that is clearly good and oppose one that is clearly evil. The divine purpose is fixed and the Christian religion, untouched by time and persecution, demonstrates its origin from God.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The very way to exalt error into notice, and to confirm people in it, is to oppose it in a harsh, authoritative, and unkind manner."

3. "The preservation of the Christian religion, unchanged through so many revolutions, and in so many fiery trials, shows that it is not of men, but of God."

1. "Refrain [αποστητε] . Lit., stand off. Of men [εξ ανθρωπων] . Out of men, proceeding out of their devices."

"If this counsel, or this work be of men; if the doctrine these men preach is a human device; or this business they are engaged in is only a human affair, projected by men, and carried on upon selfish principles, and worldly views, seeking only themselves, and their secular interests, and not the glory of God: it will come to nought."

### John Wesley:
1. "In a cause which is manifestly good, we should immediately join."
2. "In a cause, on the other hand, which is manifestly evil, we should immediately oppose."
