# Acts 5:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, a supernatural event occurs where two individuals, Ananias and Sapphira, are struck dead. The severity of their deceitful actions and the need for the infant church to be protected from corruption are emphasized by the commentators. The suddenness of their deaths, attributed to the power of the Holy Spirit, instills fear among those who witness it and serves as a reminder of the consequences of dishonesty. Through this divine intervention, the righteousness of the apostles is upheld, and the importance of living a truthful and accountable life is reinforced within the early Christian community.
