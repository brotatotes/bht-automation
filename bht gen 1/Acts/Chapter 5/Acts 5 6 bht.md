# Acts 5:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the early church, the younger members arose to serve their community, not as official leaders, but rather as active participants who willingly performed acts of servitude. When tragedy struck and a member passed away, these robust and strong young men promptly and respectfully took up the responsibility of preparing the body for burial. With efficiency and reverence, they wrapped the body in linen cloths, following the customary practice of the time, and laid it to rest outside the city, ensuring the preservation of order and preventing any potential unrest.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "We can hardly assume, as yet, any such official distinctions in the congregation as would mark off οἱ νεώτεροι from οἱ πρεσβύτεροι."
2. "And the use of οἱ νεανίσκοι in Acts 5:10, as applying to these same persons, seems to decide that they were merely the younger members of the church."
3. "The context will not permit any more careful enfolding of the body to be understood."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "the young men—some of the younger and more active members of the church"
2. "not as office-bearers, nor coming forward now for the first time"
3. "but who probably had already volunteered their services in making subordinate arrangements"
4. "In every thriving Christian community such volunteers may be expected"
5. "and will be found eminently useful."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The fact that they took up Ananias voluntarily implies that they were accustomed to perform offices of servitude to the congregation."
2. "It was the usual custom with the Jews to wind the body in many folds of linen before it was buried; commonly also with spices, to preserve it from putrefaction."
3. "There might have been some danger of an excitement and tumult in regard to this scene if the corpse had not soon been removed; and as no valuable purpose could be answered by delaying the burial, the body was decently committed to the dust."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The verb means to draw together, or draw in; hence used for shortening sail, reducing expenses, lowering or humbling a person."
2. "In the sense of wrapping up it is found in Aristophanes, of wrapping cloaks or garments about one; also of tucking up the garments about the loins, as a preparation for service."
3. "In medical language, of bandaging a limb; of the contraction of tumors, and of organs of the body, etc."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The prompt and orderly acts which followed immediately upon the terrible event just discussed all point to a simple order and discipline reigning from the first among the new congregations."
2. "The officials whose duty it was to arrange the details of these meetings of the believers, reverently took up the poor body, and hastily, as is ever the custom in the East in the case of death, but reverentially, wrapped round each limb with the linen cloths used in the burying of the dead, sprinkling spices between each fold of the linen."
3. "In the East the usual custom is only to allow a few hours’ interval between death and burial."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The young men (ο νεωτερο)... Same as νεανισκο in verse Acts 5:10 and so no order in the young church."
2. "Perhaps these young men were acting as ushers or actual pallbearers."
3. "Wrapped him round (συνεστειλαν)... to draw together, or contract, to roll together, to wrap with bandages, to enshroud as here."

### John Gill:
1. "The younger brethren of the church, who were robust, and strong, and fit for the following service."
2. "Not willing that such an awful spectacle should lie long before them."

These quotes highlight the swift and respectful actions of the young men in response to the death of a man. They emphasize their physical strength, their desire to quickly remove the body, and the cultural practice of burying outside the city.
