# Acts 5:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, a couple named Ananias and Sapphira deceives the church by pretending to give the full amount received from selling their land, while keeping some for themselves. This deception is condemned as an act of hypocrisy and deceit within the church. God judges their dishonesty by striking them both dead, serving as a powerful warning against lying to God and the seriousness of hypocrisy. The timing of the event, lasting about three hours, adds to the anticipation and reveals the gravity of their actions.
