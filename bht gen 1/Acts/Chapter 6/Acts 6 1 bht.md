# Acts 6:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this significant chapter, we witness Judaizing divisions that unsettled and caused disquiet among the early Church. The distinction between the Hellenists and Hebrews was not merely linguistic but rooted in broader cultural and religious differences. The daily ministration of alms and food, entrusted to laymen, aimed to provide for all the poor, with widows requiring special attention. However, discontent and murmurs of partiality arose, revealing the ongoing need for the Church to address and mend internal tensions.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Introducing that great and important chapter in her history of Judaizing divisions, which from this time onward disquieted her."
2. "The Hellenists were the Grecian Jews: not only those who were themselves proselytes, nor only those who came of families once proselytized, but all who, on account of origin or habitation, spoke Greek as their ordinary language, and used ordinarily the LXX version."
3. "The use of this appropriate word shews, I think, that Olsh.’s supposition, that χῆραι implies all their poor, is not correct. Those poor who could attend for themselves and represent their case were served: but the widows, who required more searching out at their own houses, were overlooked."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The complaint was in all likelihood well founded, though we cannot suspect the distributors of intentional partiality."
2. "It was really just an emulation of love, each party wishing to have their own poor taken care of in the best manner."
3. "The daily ministration—the daily distribution of alms or of food, probably the latter."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It was necessary that this matter should be entrusted to the hands of 'laymen,' and that the 'ministry' should be freed from all embarrassment, and all suspicions of dishonesty and unfairness in regard to pecuniary matters."
2. "Dissensions would be very likely to arise between these two classes of persons. The Jews of Palestine would pride themselves much on the fact that they dwelt in the land of the patriarchs and the land of promise; that they used the language which their fathers spoke, and in which the oracles of God were given; and that they were constantly near the temple, and regularly engaged in its solemnities."
3. "The property which had been contributed, or thrown into common stock, was understood to be designed for the equal benefit of 'all' the poor, and particularly, it would seem, for the poor widows."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The present participle indicating something in progress."
2. "The word Hellenists denotes Jews, not Greeks, but Jews who spoke Greek."
3. "The distinction between Hebrew and Hellenist was a distinction within the Jewish nation, and not between it and other nations."

### John Calvin:
1. "Good laws have taken their beginning of evil manners."
2. "We learn in this history that the Church cannot be so framed by and by, but that there remain somewhat to be amended."
3. "The apostles have taught us, by their example, that we must not yield unto such engines (and policies) of Satan."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The literal rendering was multiplying is more forcible; while the apostles after their liberation went on with their high mission, every day the number of believers continued to increase." 
2. "The distinction between the Grecians and the Hebrews was not one of nationality, but of language."
3. "There is no doubt that the real cause of these 'murmurings' which disturbed the peace of the early Church, must be sought for in the jealousy which always existed between the Jews who, with the ancient language, had preserved more rigidly the old customs and tone of Hebrew thought, and the Grecian or foreign Jews who, with the Greek language, had adopted broader and less rigid views generally."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "The new freedom from the intercession of Gamaliel was bearing rich fruit."
2. "It is the secret grumblings that buzz away till they are heard."
3. "Women and money occasion the first serious disturbance in the church life."

### John Gill:
1. "This increase of the disciples agrees with what Maimonides says, that 'in the days of Gamaliel, the heretics were multiplied in Israel.'" 
2. "The word 'disciples' was a common name to all Christians, to all that believed in Christ, and was the name they went by, before they were called Christians."
3. "It is also manifest, that though they were at first so united and harmonious in their affections and judgments, yet they were not always clear of feuds, animosities, and contentions; Satan bestirred himself, and got footing among them, as he commonly does where the Gospel is preached, and there is an increase of it."
