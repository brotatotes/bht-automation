# Acts 6:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the verse being described, a man named Stephen delivers a powerful speech that challenges the traditional beliefs and practices of the Mosaic law. He highlights the transitory nature of the old covenant and its temple, asserting the permanence of the new covenant. Stephen's arguments reveal his role as a forerunner to Paul, and his teachings on the abrogation of the ceremonial law and the supremacy of Christ attract false accusations of blasphemy. These accusations are fueled by deceitful tactics, with the intent to incite the people and protect Jewish rights and privileges.
