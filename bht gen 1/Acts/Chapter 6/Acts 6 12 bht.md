# Acts 6:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The turmoil surrounding the events of this Bible verse involved the manipulation of public opinion, with the enemies of the disciples seeking to gain support by riling up the people. Their tactics aimed to incite fear and alarm among the masses, who were easily swayed. The followers of Jesus found themselves caught between two opposing forces - the crowd's hostility and the authority of the religious leaders. In this charged atmosphere, the disciples grappled with the dangerous effects of zealous yet unspiritual movements, leading to Stephen's confrontation before the council.
