# Acts 6:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Out of jealousy and anger, false witnesses distorted Stephen's words, accusing him of blasphemy against Moses and God. They misrepresented his arguments against the Temple and the Law, taking them out of context. Stephen persistently spoke against the Temple's destruction and the rituals of the Mosaic law, which led to his charge of blasphemy. The Council, unwilling to utter his name out of contempt, directed their anger towards Stephen.
