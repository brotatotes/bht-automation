In this verse, a person's face is described as radiating with divine light, resembling that of an angel. The angelic glow reflects the individual's inner calm, innocence, and closeness with God.

The person's countenance bears witness to their unwavering faith in Jesus as the Christ, just as Moses had once received divine confirmation of his role in delivering the law.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Both from the plain language of our text, well understood among the Jews to signify supernatural brightness, and from the fact that in Luke’s own narrative we have supernatural brightness associated with angelic appearances more than once, I should be inclined to think that the face of the martyr was lighted up with a divine radiance." 
2. "That the effect on those present was not such as to prevent the examination proceeding, is no argument against this view: in the very mildness of the question of the H. P. which follows, I see the trace of some unusual incident exercising an influence over him."
3. "Chrysostom explains well the effect on the council: 'He seems to me to have made God gracious to them, perhaps because he was about to say something, and in order to strike them immediately with his appearance. For there are, there are also faces full of spiritual grace, visible to those who desire to have them, and venerable and terrible to those who hate and fear. Or perhaps he said this as the cause for which they endured his speech. What, then, the high priest?... Do you see how the question is asked with gentleness and has nothing burdensome for the time being?'"
