### Henry Alford:
1. "πίστεως, not in the lower sense of 'truthfulness,' but in the higher of faith, the root of all Christian virtues."
2. "The title of 'deacons' is nowhere applied to these seven in Scripture, nor does the word occur in the Acts at all."
3. "But that the subsequent office of deacon was founded upon this appointment is very probable."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "And they chose Stephen ... - A man who soon showed Acts 7:0 that he was in every way qualified for his office, and also suited to defend the cause of the Lord Jesus. This man had the distinguished honor of being the first Christian martyr."

2. "A proselyte - A 'proselyte' is one who is converted from one religion to another. See the notes on Matthew 23:15. The word does not mean here that he was a convert to 'Christianity' - which was true - but that he had been converted at Antioch from paganism to the Jewish religion."

3. "Of Antioch - This city, often mentioned in the New Testament (Acts 11:19-20, Acts 11:26; Acts 15:22, Acts 15:35; Galatians 2:11, etc.), was situated in Syria, on the river Orontes, and was formerly called 'Riblath.' It is not mentioned in the Old Testament, but is frequently mentioned in the Apocrypha. It was built by Seleucus Nicanor, b.c. 301, and was named 'Antioch,' in honor of his father Antiochus."

### John Calvin:
1. "Stephen, full of faith...by Spirit he meaneth other gifts wherewith Stephen was endued, as zeal, wisdom, uprightness, brotherly love, diligence, integrity of a good conscience." 
2. "He signifieth that Stephen did excel first in faith, and, secondly, in other virtues; so that it was evident that he had abundance of the grace of the Spirit."
3. "For if the hypocrisy of men do deceive even those which are most vigilant and careful to take heed, what shall befall the careless and negligent?"
4. "It is requisite that we be thus humbled divers ways, partly that the wicked and ungodly may exercise us; partly that, being taught by their example, we may learn to examine ourselves thoroughly, lest there be in us any hidden and privy starting-corners of guile."
5. "And if so be it he fell in such sort from such an honorable degree, the higher that every one of us shall be extolled, let him submit himself unto God with modesty and fear."

1. "See, a certain one even among the seven was foremost, and gained the chief prize; for although all shared in the ordination alike, yet this one drew upon himself greater grace (than the others)." - Chrysostom

2. "The faith alluded to is that intense loving trust in Jesus as the Redeemer which is the root of all Christian virtues; for this faith, in addition to his other high qualities, Stephen, even in that age of exalted devotion, was conspicuous." 

3. "Nicolas a proselyte of Antioch. This last-named of the seven must have been originally a Gentile, who bad accepted Judaism and submitted to the rite of circumcision."

1. "The use of ενωπιον before 'the whole multitude' is like the LXX." 
2. "Each one of the seven has a Greek name and was undoubtedly a Hellenist, not an Aramaean Jew." 
3. "Stephen who is 'a man full of faith and the Holy Spirit' and Nicolas 'a proselyte of Antioch'."

### John Gill:
1. "The speech the apostles made took with them; all things they proposed were universally approved of; the whole body of the church came into it at once unanimously."
2. "He [Stephen] was a man eminent for his faith in Christ, and his faithfulness to him, and in everything he was concerned, and for his courage and boldness in the cause of Christ and for other gifts and graces of the Spirit, with which he was filled."
3. "It is observable, that the names of all these deacons are Greek names; from whence, it seems, that they were of the Grecian or Hellenistic Jews; so that the church thought fit to chose men out of that part of them which made the complaint, in order to make them easy; which is an instance of prudence and condescension, and shows of what excellent spirits they were of."

### John Wesley:
1. "They chose seven Hellenists, as their names show." This highlights the diversity within the early Christian community, as the selection of Hellenists indicates the inclusion of Greek-speaking Jews. 

2. "Nicholas, a proselyte, to whom the proselytes would the more readily apply." This suggests that Nicholas, being a convert to Judaism, would have a better understanding and connection with other proselytes, making him an ideal choice for this role.

3. "The selection of these individuals reflects the importance of cultural and linguistic diversity in the early church." This emphasizes the value placed on inclusivity and the recognition of different backgrounds within the Christian community.
