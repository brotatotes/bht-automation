In the Scripture described, commentators highlight the significance of the laying on of hands as an act of consecration and the impartation of gifts and graces needed for the ministry. The practice, seen from the time of the Apostles, symbolized that the authority and power bestowed upon ministers came from God. While the act itself did not possess inherent power, it served as a prayerful acknowledgement and dedication to the divine source of authority and a tangible way of designating individuals for their roles.
