The narrative of Stephen's extraordinary life and faith is just beginning to unfold, and it holds great significance.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The power was perhaps conferred by the laying on of the Apostles’ hands; though, that having been for a special purpose merely, and the working miracles being a fulfilment of the promise, Mark 16:17-18, to all believers, I should rather refer the power to the eminence of Stephen’s faith."
2. "χάριτος, divine grace (not ‘favour with the people’): the effects of which, the miracles, were called χαρίσματα."
3. "The miracles performed by Stephen were not just a display of power, but a manifestation of the divine grace bestowed upon him."

3. "Full of grace." This phrase implies that Stephen's faith is not self-generated or self-sustained, but rather a result of God's unmerited favor and goodness towards him.
