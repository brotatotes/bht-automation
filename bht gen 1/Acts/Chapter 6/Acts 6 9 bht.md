# Acts 6:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, we are introduced to a scene where Stephen faces opposition from various groups in Jerusalem. Commentators suggest that these opponents include Jews who were once slaves in Rome but later gained their freedom and settled in Jerusalem. The Libertines, as they are called, had their own synagogue and were likely to be the chief opponents of Stephen. Additionally, Stephen encountered resistance from Hellenistic Jews, who had their own synagogues in Jerusalem. Despite the opposition, Stephen's teaching and miracles had won favor among the people, leading to a new hindrance to his mission.
