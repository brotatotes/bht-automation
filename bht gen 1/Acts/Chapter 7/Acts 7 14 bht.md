# Acts 7:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In Acts, there is a mention of seventy-five souls, a number that encompasses Jacob's immediate family, the descendants of Joseph's two sons, and additional individuals. The use of the Greek translation of the Old Testament, the Septuagint, accounts for the inclusion of these additional individuals. This numbering reflects the completeness and divine authority symbolized by the number seventy. The reference to Genesis 46:27 further emphasizes the continuity and expansion of the Israelite family, demonstrating the fulfillment of God's promise.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The LXX, whom Stephen follows, insert in Gen 46:20 an account of the children and grandchildren of Manasseh and Ephraim, five in number."
2. "The remarks of Jerome are curious: he is arguing, on Gen. l. c., that the number really was seventy."
3. "When we come to understand μετεκαλέσατο … πᾶσαν τὴν συγγένειαν ἐν ψυχαῖς ἑβδομηκονταπέντε, as represented by including, for a purpose, those already in Egypt, it seems to me that a stigma is cast on St. Stephen far more serious than that of mere numeral inaccuracy."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Threescore and fifteen souls" - This phrase refers to the total number of individuals who went down to Egypt with Jacob. It includes not only Jacob's immediate family but also the descendants of Joseph's two sons. 

2. "According to the Septuagint version" - Stephen, in his speech, is using the Greek translation of the Old Testament known as the Septuagint. This version includes the additional five children and grandchildren of Joseph's sons, which is why the total number is higher than what is mentioned in the Hebrew text.

3. "Including the five children and grandchildren of Joseph's two sons" - The inclusion of Joseph's descendants in the count is significant because it highlights the fulfillment of God's promise to make Israel a great nation. It also emphasizes the unity and continuity of the Israelite people, even in their time of exile in Egypt.

### Albert Barnes:

2. "We ought rather to weigh the miracle which the Spirit commendeth unto us in this place, than to stand long about one letter, whereby the number is altered."

(Note: The commentary is quite lengthy, so I have selected three quotes that capture the essence of the author's argument and provide insight into the verse.)

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Another memory of Divine favour which Stephen knew would be very grateful to the zealous Jews who sat as judges in that stern council."

### John Gill:
1. "Moses and Stephen are speaking of different things; Moses speaks of the seed of Jacob, which came out of his loins, who came into Egypt, and so excludes his sons' wives; Stephen speaks of Jacob and all his kindred, among whom his sons' wives must be reckoned."
2. "To which if we add Jacob himself, and Joseph who was before in Egypt, and who might be truly said to come into it, and his two sons that were born there, who came thither in his loins, as others in the account may be said to do, who were not yet born, when Jacob went down, the total number is threescore and ten."
3. "So that the Jew has no reason to charge Stephen with an error, as he does; nor was there any need to alter and corrupt the Septuagint version of Genesis 45:27 to make it agree with Stephen's account."
