## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The facts, as related in the O. T., were these: Jacob, dying in Egypt, was taken into the land of Canaan, and buried in the cave of Machpelah, before Mamre."
2. "Joseph, dying also in Egypt, was taken in a coffin at the Exodus, and finally buried at Shechem."
3. "The fact of the mistake occurring where it does, will be far more instructive to the Christian student than the most ingenious solution of the difficulty could be, if it teaches him fearlessly and honestly to recognize the phænomena presented by the text of Scripture."

### John Calvin:
1. "Moses speaketh of Joseph for honor’s sake, because he had given express commandment concerning his bones, which we cannot read to have been done of the rest."
2. "I can affirm nothing concerning this matter for a certainty, save only that this is either a speech wherein is synecdoche, or else that Luke rehearseth this not so much out of Moses, as according to the old fame."
3. "And whereas he saith afterward, they were laid in the sepulcher which Abraham had bought of the sons of Hemor, it is manifest that there is a fault [mistake] in the word Abraham."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Jacob was buried in the cave of Machpelah (Genesis 50:13). The O.T. does not say where the sons of Jacob were buried save that Joseph was buried in Shechem (Joshua 24:32)."
2. "Possibly only 'our fathers' without Jacob is the subject of 'were carried.'"
3. "Abraham bought a burying-place, the cave of Machpelah, from Ephron the Hittite at Hebron (Genesis 23:16), while Jacob bought a field from the sons of Hamor at Shechem (Genesis 33:19; Joshua 24:32)."

### John Gill:
1. "Joseph and the rest of the patriarchs, who died in Egypt, when the children of Israel came out from thence, they brought their bones along with them, and buried them in Sichem."
2. "It is most reasonable to believe that the rest were buried there likewise; though it must be owned, that there is an entire silence about them, even when the sepulchre of Joseph is taken notice of."

### John Wesley:
1. "This concise manner of speaking, strange as it seems to us, was common among the Hebrews; particularly, when in a case notoriously known, the speaker mentioned but part of the story, and left the rest, which would have interrupted the current of his discourse, to be supplied in the mind of the hearer."
2. "The first land which these strangers bought was for a sepulchre. They sought for a country in heaven."
3. "So Jacob went down into Egypt and died, he and our fathers, and were carried over to Shechem, and laid by the sons (that is, descendants) of Hamor, the father of Shechem, in the sepulchre that Abraham bought for a sum of money."
