Second aorist middle indicative (with first aorist vowel α instead of ε as often in the Koine) of αναιρεω, common in the N.T. in the sense of take up and make away with, to kill as in verse Acts 7:28, but here only in the N.T. in the original sense of taking up from the ground and with the middle voice (for oneself)."

3. "They also tell this story as a means of saving it, that Jethro who was sitting by, or Gabriel in the form of one of the king's princes, suggested that the action of the child was not to be regarded, since it had no knowledge of what it did; and as a proof of it, proposed that there might be brought in a dish, a coal of fire, and a piece of gold, or a precious stone; and that if he put out his hand and laid hold on the piece of gold, or precious stone, then it would appear that he had knowledge, and deserved death; but if he took the coal, it would be a plain case that he was ignorant, and should be free."
