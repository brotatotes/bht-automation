# Acts 7:29 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
After Moses' flight from Egypt, he found himself in a desert region near Sinai and Horeb, inhabited by a nomad detachment called the Midianites. Jethro, Moses' father-in-law, sought him out from a distance, recognizing the peril he faced. Moses resided as a temporary dweller in this unfamiliar land, under the protection of Jethro, the priest. During this time, Moses fathered two sons, Gershom and Eliezer, after marrying Zipporah, Jethro's daughter. The journey into Midian became a crucial phase for Moses, as his presence there foreshadowed both deliverance for the Israelites and the ultimate redemption through Jesus Christ.
