2. "The nature and character of this messenger are to be determined by other considerations. The word may denote that the 'bush on fire' was the messenger.

### John Gill:
1. "Moses, he says, 'led the flock to the Sinaean mountain, as it is called: this is the highest mountain in that country, and best for pasture, abounding in good herbage; and because it was commonly believed the Divine Being dwelt there, it was not before fed upon, the shepherds not daring to go up to it.'" 
2. "This bush was a bramble bush, or thorn; so Aben Ezra says it was a kind of thorn, and observes, that in the Ishmaelitish or Turkish language, the word signifies a kind of dry thorn; and so Philo the Jew says, it was a thorny plant, and very weak; and therefore it was the more wonderful, that it should be on fire, and not consumed." 
3. "The Jews allegorize this vision different ways: sometimes they say, 'the fire designs the Israelites, who are compared to fire, as it is said, Obadiah 1:18 'the house of Jacob shall be a fire'; and the bush denotes the nations of the world, which are compared to thorns and thistles; so shall the Israelites be among the people, their fire shall not consume the people, who are like to thorns and briers; nor shall the nations of the world extinguish their flame, which is the words of the law: but in the world to come, the fire of the Israelites shall consume all people, who are compared to thorns and thistles, according to Isaiah 33:12.'"
