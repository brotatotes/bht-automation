## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The parallel of Jesus Christ is no doubt in Stephen’s mind, and the inference intended to be drawn, that it does not follow that GOD REJECTS those whom THEY REJECTED."
2. "The difficulty of ἀπέσταλκεν has caused it to be altered into the historic tense, ἀπέστειλεν. But the perf. sets forth not only the fact of God’s sending Moses then, but the endurance of his mission till now."
3. "Him hath God sent: with a closer reference than before, to Him whom God had now exalted as the true ἄρχοντα κ. λυτρωτήν."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "the stone which the builders refused is made the head of the corner" - This quote highlights the rejection of Moses by the Israelites, paralleling the rejection of Jesus by the religious leaders. It emphasizes the theme of God's chosen ones being rejected by those who should have recognized and accepted them.

2. "This Moses whom they refused" - This quote emphasizes the disbelief and rejection of Moses as a leader and judge by the Israelites. It highlights the irony that the very person they rejected became the instrument of their deliverance.

3. "Who made thee a ruler and a judge, &c." - This quote captures the skepticism and questioning of Moses' authority by the Israelites. It reflects their resistance to accepting his leadership and their lack of faith in God's chosen servant.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Stephen introduces and dwells upon this refusal in order, perhaps, to remind them that this had been the character of their nation, and to prepare the way for the charge which he intended to bring against those whom he addressed, as being stiff-necked and rebellious."
2. "A deliverer - A Redeemer - λυτρωτὴν lutrōtēn. It properly means one who redeems a captive or a prisoner by paying a 'price' or 'ransom.' It is applied thus to the Lord Jesus, as having redeemed or purchased sinners by his blood as a price."
3. "By the hand of the angel - Under the direction and by the 'help' of the angel."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Deliverer [λυτρωτη, ν]. Strictly, a ransomer or redeemer."
2. "By the hand [εν χειρι] The best texts read sun ceiri, 'with the hand;' i.e., in association with the protecting and helping power of the angel."
3. "Only here in New Testament, See on ransom, Matthew 20:28; and redeemed, 1 Peter 1:18."

### John Calvin:
1. "The Jews may understand that the fathers were not delivered therefore, because they had deserved that with their godliness, but that this benefit was bestowed upon them, being altogether unworthy."
2. "It is surely a strange thing, that God doth vouchsafe to declare his power by divers wonders, for such an unthankful people’s sake."
3. "And whereas Moses hath such an honorable title given him, God doth not so give and resign unto man that honor which is due to himself, that he loseth any whit of his authority thereby."

These quotes highlight the themes of God's grace towards unworthy individuals, the display of God's power through miracles, and the recognition that human honor does not diminish God's authority.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "This Moses, whom the children of Israel refused, but whom God marked with such distinguished honour."
2. "By men rejected, but by God exalted to be ruler and deliverer."
3. "The parallel between the great Hebrew lawgiver and his own crucified Master, scarcely veiled at first, except by the studied concealment of the name of Jesus Christ, as the argument proceeds, becomes closer and more marked."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Clearly Stephen means to draw a parallel between Moses and Jesus."
2. "Those in Egypt scouted Moses as 'ruler and judge' and God 'hath sent' Moses 'both a ruler and a deliverer' as Jesus was to be."
3. "Stephen here answers that slander by showing how Moses led the people out of Egypt in co-operation with the hand of the Angel of Jehovah."

### John Gill:
1. "He was an eminent type of the Messiah; and the redemption of the people of Israel out of the Egyptian bondage, by him, was emblematical of redemption from the bondage of sin, Satan, and the law by Jesus Christ."
2. "As Moses had his mission and commission from God, so had Jesus Christ, as Mediator."
3. "Though Jesus was set at nought by the Jews, yet he was made both Lord and Christ, and exalted to be a Prince and a Saviour."
