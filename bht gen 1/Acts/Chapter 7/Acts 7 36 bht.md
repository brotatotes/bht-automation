# Acts 7:36 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This verse describes a series of remarkable and miraculous events that God performed for the Israelites. In the land of Egypt, God displayed his power through wonders and signs, such as turning a rod into a serpent and the ten plagues. He then led the Israelites in a miraculous escape through the Red Sea, parting the waters and ensuring their safety while causing the downfall of their pursuers, the Egyptians. These acts of deliverance demonstrate God's unwavering protection and divine intervention in the face of oppression and danger.
