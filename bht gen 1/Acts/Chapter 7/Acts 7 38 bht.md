# Acts 7:38 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse being described talks about how Moses, as the mediator, communicated with the Angel of the covenant and the people, emphasizing his role in bridging the gap between them. It mentions the assembly at Mt. Sinai as the place where the law was given, not referring to the general Church. The term "living" used to describe the oracles highlights the active and transformative nature of the Word of God, capable of bringing obedience, vigor, and spiritual growth. Despite the miraculous signs, Israel remained disobedient, ultimately underscoring their ingratitude and condemning their actions.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "That Moses conversed with both the Angel of the covenant and our fathers, implies that he was the mediator between them."
2. "ἐκκλησίᾳ probably, the assembly held for the promulgation of the law at Mt. Sinai, not ‘the Church’ generally."
3. "λόγια ζῶντα, living, not = ζωοποιοῦντα, 'life-giving': still less to be understood 'given vivá voce'."

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "In the church—the collective body of God's chosen people."
2. "This is he that was in the church in the wilderness, with the angel . . . and with our fathers."
3. "By this high testimony to Moses, Stephen rebuts the main charge for which he was on trial."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The word 'church' means literally 'the people called out,' and is applied with great propriety to the assembly or multitude called out of Egypt, and separated from the world."
2. "It is clear, therefore, that by 'the angel' here, Stephen intends to designate him who was God."
3. "The word 'lively,' or 'living,' stands in opposition to what is dead, or useless, and means what is vigorous, efficacious; and in this place it means that the commands were of such a nature, and given in such circumstances, as to secure attention; to produce obedience; to excite them to act for God."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The term 'lively' in this verse can be better understood as 'living'. This emphasizes the active and vibrant nature of the Word of God, which is not static or lifeless, but rather full of vitality and power." 

2. "The comparison to 1 Peter 2:4 and 1 Peter 2:5 highlights the connection between the living Word of God and the living stones that make up the spiritual house of believers. Just as Christ is the living stone, so too are believers called to be living stones, actively participating in the work of God's kingdom." 

3. "By describing the Word of God as 'lively', the verse reminds us that the Scriptures are not mere words on a page, but rather a living and active force that has the power to transform lives and bring about spiritual growth and renewal."

### John Calvin:
1. "If they had been disobedient and unthankful to God before, yet this so wonderful a deliverance ought to have brought them into a better mind; but he declareth that they were always like themselves."
2. "It was meet that so many miracles should not only have stuck fast in their minds, but also have continued still before their eyes."
3. "This doth greatly augment the greatness of the offense, where Stephen saith that Moses was then with them in the wilderness. For besides that there appeareth here rare goodness and long-sufferance of the Lord, in bearing with them, they make themselves to be without all excuse."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "God’s church is not limited to Judæ. It was in the wilderness; and there Moses, your great lawgiver, was with it; and remember he died there in the wilderness, and was never permitted to enter the Promised Land, to which you would restrain the favours of God."

2. "A λογιον is a little word, common in the old Greek, LXX, Philo, in ecclesiastical writers for sayings of Christ, Papias saying that Matthew wrote in Hebrew 'Logia of Jesus.' The words from God to Moses are still 'living' today."
