# Acts 7:39 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Israelites, in their journey towards the Promised Land, experienced a deep struggle within themselves. Their hearts were torn between their longing for the comforts and familiarity of Egypt, their inclination towards idolatrous practices, and their rebellion against God's authority. They were weary of the restraints of worshipping Jehovah and instead, yearned for the fleshpots and gods of Egypt. Despite being led by Moses, they often murmured, disobeyed, and turned away from God's commands. This internal conflict and spiritual battle highlight the Israelites' struggle to fully trust in God's provision and remain faithful to His ways.
