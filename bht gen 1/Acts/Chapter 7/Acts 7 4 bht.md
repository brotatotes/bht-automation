Ultimately, Abraham's choice to dwell solely in Canaan exemplifies his obedience and reliance on God's faithfulness.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "It seems evident, that the Jewish chronology, which Stephen follows, was at fault here, owing to the circumstance of Terah’s death being mentioned before the command of Abram to leave Haran; it not having been observed that the mention is anticipatory."
2. "The subterfuge of understanding the spiritual death of Terah, who is, as a further hypothesis, supposed to have relapsed into idolatry at Haran, appears to have originated with the Rabbis."
3. "The way in which the difficulty has been met by Wordsworth and others, viz. that we have no right to assume that Abram was born when Terah was 70, but may regard him as the youngest son, would leave us in this equally unsatisfactory position."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Abraham's settlement in Canaan was not contingent on the death of his father, but rather a divine transaction between him and Jehovah." 

2. "The timing of Abraham's move to Canaan after his father's death highlights the significance of God's calling and the establishment of the land as the promised inheritance." 

3. "The mention of Terah's death serves as a marker for the beginning of a new chapter in Abraham's journey, emphasizing the divine purpose and sovereignty behind his relocation."

### Albert Barnes:

1. "In Genesis 11:32 it is stated that Terah died at Haran at the age of 205. There are various explanations of the discrepancy, but no one that seems certain."
2. "It is possible that Abraham is mentioned first in Genesis 11:26 because he became the most prominent and was really younger than Haran his brother who died before the first migration."

### John Gill:
