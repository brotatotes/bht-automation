# Acts 7:40 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we see the Israelites' lack of faith as they turn away from God during a period of uncertainty. Their request to make gods and return to Egypt displays a lack of trust in God's guidance and provision. Instead of relying on the invisible God who led them out of Egypt, they sought tangible representations of divine power. Their disobedience reveals their inclination towards idolatry and highlights their unthankfulness towards God's deliverance.

They were willing to abandon the freedom and promises of God in exchange for the comfort and stability they had known in Egypt, revealing a lack of trust in God's ability to provide and protect them."
