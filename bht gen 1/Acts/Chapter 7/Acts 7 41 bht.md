# Acts 7:41 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Israelites, in their disobedience, made a golden calf, imitating the idolatrous practices of the Egyptians. This act symbolized their rejection of God and their attachment to worldly things. They foolishly believed that this creation of their own hands was a representation of Jehovah. In their idolatrous celebration, they rejoiced, ate, drank, and engaged in various sinful activities. This shameful and scandalous act brought upon them guilt, reproach, and the anger of God.
