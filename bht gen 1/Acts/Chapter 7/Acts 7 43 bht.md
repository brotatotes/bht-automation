# Acts 7:43 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Bible verse being described is a powerful indictment against the Israelites for their idolatrous practices and the corruption of their worship over time. Commentators shed light on the specific idols mentioned, such as Moloch and Remphan, and their horrific rituals involving child sacrifices. The commentators also point to the punishment the Israelites will face, being carried away beyond Babylon, as a consequence of their disobedience. Despite variations in wording and interpretation, the overall message underscores the severity of Israel's idolatry and the need for repentance.

### John Calvin:
1. "If I shall rip up from the beginning, (O house of Jacob,) how your kindred hath behaved itself toward me; your fathers began to overthrow and corrupt, even in the wilderness, that worship which I had commanded; but you have far passed their ungodliness, for you have brought in an infinite company of gods." 
2. "And although the prophet’s words be somewhat unlike to these, yet is the sense all one. It is to be thought that Stephen, who had to deal with the Jews, did repeat word for word in their tongue that which is in the prophet; Luke, who wrote in Greek, did follow the Greek interpreter."
3. "Because God will not be worshipped under a visible and external form.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "In the rabbinical tradition respecting the worship paid to this deity, a fire was kindled beneath the idol, which was a hollow figure with the head of an ox with outstretched arms: a child was placed in the arms of the figure, and thus was burned to death, while the priests beat their drums so as to stifle the child’s cries." 
2. "Stephen here quotes verbatim from the LXX., which differs in some respect from the Hebrew of Amos 5:26, which runs thus: ‘Ye have borne the Tabernacle of Moloch [so the Authorised Version, which here must have followed the LXX.; for the Hebrew has, instead of “Moloch” your king, םַלְ בּ ְבֶם  malk’kem ] and Chiun.’"
