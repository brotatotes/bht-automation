# Acts 7:46 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This verse describes the sincere desire of David to build a permanent house for God. Through the prophet Nathan, he sought permission but was denied, as God intended to remain without a temple until Solomon's time. David's deep sense of God's love in his heart fueled his longing for a dwelling place for God. However, the psalmist reminds us that God cannot be confined to a physical structure, but instead seeks a dwelling place in the hearts of His people.
