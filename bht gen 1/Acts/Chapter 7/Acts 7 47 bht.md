# Acts 7:47 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
David desired to build the temple, but God had a different plan and chose Solomon for the task instead. The temple symbolized God's presence among His people and was a reminder that He cannot be confined to a physical dwelling. Our desires may not always align with God's will, but we must trust in His plan and recognize that each person has a unique role to play in fulfilling His purposes. Collaboration, honoring His presence within us, and seeking Him in faith are central to our worship.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Albert Barnes:
1. "David's desire to build the temple was noble, but God had a different plan. He recognized that David's role as a warrior was not aligned with the task of building a house of worship. This teaches us that sometimes our desires may not align with God's will, and it is important to trust His plan." 

2. "Solomon's role in building the temple was significant. While David prepared the materials, it was Solomon who actually constructed the temple. This reminds us that collaboration and teamwork are essential in fulfilling God's purposes. Each person has a unique role to play, and together, we can accomplish great things for His glory." 

3. "The construction of the temple was a symbol of God's presence among His people. It was a physical representation of His dwelling place. Similarly, as believers, we are temples of the Holy Spirit. Our bodies are vessels for His presence, and we should strive to honor and glorify Him in all that we do."

### John Calvin:
1. "Stephen denieth that God dwelleth in temples made with hands, that is not referred unto Solomon, who knew full well that God was to be sought in heaven, and that men’s minds must be lifted up thither by faith."
2. "He reproveth the blockishness of the people, which abused the temple, as if it had had God tied to it."
3. "This was almost a common error in all ages; because men thought that cold ceremonies were sufficient enough for the worship of God."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The Temple, against which you accuse me of having spoken blasphemous words, because I pointed out [as did my Master] that it was a building which would not endure for ever, was first built, not by David, the man after God’s own heart, but by Solomon, and replaced an older sanctuary, and one that possessed far holier associations than the Temple, seeing it was designed upon a model which Moses received from the Most Highest."
2. "That sacred Tabernacle even was not meant to endure for ever. Is it then blasphemy for me to teach that the Temple which succeeded it was also of a transitory nature?"
3. "Tabernacle and Temple are alike things belonging to time, and are by no means the necessary or only places in which God could be acceptably worshipped."

### John Gill:
1. "Though David was so set upon it, and made such large provisions for it, he was not to be the man that should build it." 
2. "Solomon his son, who enjoyed much peace, was the person designed for this work, and who did accomplish it." 
3. "Solomon built him an house."
