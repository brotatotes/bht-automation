The verse being described emphasizes that God cannot be confined or limited by any physical structure or temple.

Even at the dedication of Solomon's temple, it was recognized that God could not be contained within it. This highlights the timeless truth of God's incomprehensible nature, surpassing any human-made boundaries or limitations. Isaiah 66:1 further reinforces this idea, affirming that God is greater than any physical structure we could ever build.
