### John Calvin:
1. "God promised the land to the seed of Abraham when he was fourscore years old, and had to wife one that was barren, neither had he any hope to have any issue. This seemeth to be more than frivolous. For why doth he not rather promise that he will give him seed? But this was a notable trial of faith, in that Abraham, without asking any question, or any curious disputation, did obediently and meekly embrace that which he had heard proceed out of the mouth of the Lord."

2. "Therefore, let us remember that God doth so lift up and comfort his servant with his word, that he doth not only defer the giving of the thing, but also he may seem after a sort to mock him; as he dealeth with us also in some respect. For, although he call us the heirs of the world, he suffereth us oftentimes to want even a competent living and necessary helps."

3. "And this doth he of set purpose, that he may bring the wisdom of the flesh to nought, seeing that we do not otherwise give due honor to his word."
