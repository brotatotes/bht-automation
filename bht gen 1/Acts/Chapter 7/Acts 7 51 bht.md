### Henry Alford:
1. "He has now brought down the history to the establishment of the temple worship. From Solomon’s time to his own, he saw but a succession of apostasies, idolatries, rejection of God’s prophets: a dark and loathsome catalogue, terminated by the betrayal and murder of the Just One Himself."
2. "Words and figures familiar to the prophets in speaking of the rebellious Israel."

### John Calvin:
1. "Stephen had blasphemed God and his temple; that he went about to disannul the law."
2. "That Stephen might clear himself of both these false slanders, he began at the calling of Abraham, and declareth that the Jews excelled the Gentiles, not of their own nature, not by any right of their own, not by any merits of works, but by a free privilege, because God had adopted them in the person of Abraham."
3. "Last of all, he showeth that all the old worship which was prescribed by Moses is not to be esteemed of itself, but that it ought rather to be referred to another end, because it was made according to the heavenly pattern; and that the Jews have always been wicked interpreters of the law, because they conceived nothing but that which was earthly."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Stephen pursued his great argument calmly and without passion, though, as one great division of the history after the other passed before him in review, his style became more fervid, and the reproachful allusions less and less veiled."
2. "It was this terrible memory of the last long chapters of the story he was telling, it was the thought above all of the crucifixion of the Just, which filled the soul of Stephen with holy indignation, which found vent in this torrent of rebuke and anger against his guilty judges."
3. "The wickedness of the children of Israel during the period, the contemplation of which roused so fierce a storm of righteous anger in Stephen’s heart, was of a darker hue even than that described in the ‘kings’ and ‘prophecies.’"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Stiffnecked...Uncircumcised in heart" - These epithets applied to the Jews in the Old Testament are a sharp critique of their stubbornness and lack of true spiritual transformation.
2. "Ye always" - This emphasis on the continuous resistance of their forefathers highlights the persistent pattern of rejecting God's revelation throughout their history.

"Resist...the Holy Spirit" - Stephen points out how their resistance to the Holy Spirit mirrors the mistakes of their ancestors, clinging to the material and external rather than embracing higher spiritual levels. This resistance is likened to the way the patriarchs treated Joseph and the Hebrews treated Moses.

### John Gill:
1. "Ye stiffnecked,.... Or 'hard necked', the same withקשה עורף, which is a character frequently given of this people, Exodus 32:9 and elsewhere, and is expressive of their obstinacy, stubbornness and refractoriness; who would not submit their necks to the yoke of God's law, and be obedient to his commands."
2. "and such who resist him, may be said to resist his Holy Spirit; and the word here used signifies a rushing against, and falling upon, in a rude and hostile way, and fitly expresses their ill treatment of Christ and his ministers, by falling upon them and putting them to death."
3. "as your fathers did, so do ye; or as 'your fathers were, so are ye'; as they were stiffnecked, self-willed, obstinate, and inflexible, so are ye; as they were uncircumcised in heart and ears, so are ye; and as they resisted the Spirit of God in his prophets, so do ye resist him in the apostles and ministers of the Gospel."
