# Acts 7:55 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the midst of his trial and impending death, Stephen was granted a supernatural vision of the glory of God. This divine intervention operated on Stephen's imagination, enabling him to see something beyond the physical realm. This experience of God's presence and assistance in times of persecution is not unique to Stephen; other martyrs have received similar extraordinary support. Through Stephen's vision, we gain a deeper understanding of the transcendent power of God and His willingness to provide comfort and strength to His faithful servants in the face of adversity.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Certainly, in so far as the vision of Stephen was supernatural, it was not necessary that the material heavens should have been visible to him; but from the words ἀτενίσας εἰς τὸν οὐρανόν it would seem that they were."
2. "A reason why the glorified Saviour was seen standing, and not sitting, has been pleasingly given by Chrysostom: 'ἵνα δείξῃ τὴν ἀντίληψιν τὴν εἰς τὸν μάρτυρα' (to show the attention towards the martyr)."
3. "Stephen, under accusation of blaspheming the earthly temple, is granted a sight of the heavenly temple; being cited before the Sadducee High Priest who believed neither angel nor spirit, he is vouchsafed a vision of the heavenly HIGH PRIEST, standing and ministering at the throne amidst the angels and just men made perfect."

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "You who can transfer to canvas such scenes as these, in which the rage of hell grins horribly from men, as they sit condemned by a frail prisoner of their own, and see heaven beaming from his countenance and opening full upon his view—I envy you, for I find no words to paint what, in the majesty of the divine text, is here so simply told."
2. "As the sight was witnessed by Stephen alone, the opened heavens are to be viewed as revealed to his bright beaming spirit."
3. "Clearly, to express the eager interest with which He watched from the skies the scene in that council chamber, and the full tide of His Spirit which He was at that moment engaged in pouring into the heart of His heroical witness, till it beamed in radiance from his very countenance."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "When dangers threaten us, our hope of safety lies in heaven."
2. "When people threaten our persons, reputation, or lives, it becomes us to fix our eyes on the heavenly world; and we shall not look in vain."
3. "Objects were often represented to prophets by 'visions'; and probably something similar is intended here."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Being [υπαρχων]. See on James 2:15." 
2. "Looked up steadfastly. Compare ch. 1 10; Acts 3:4, Acts 3:12; Acts 6:15; and see on Luke 4:20." 
3. "Standing. Rising from the throne to protect and receive his servant. Usually Jesus is represented in the New Testament as seated at the Father's right hand. See Ephesians 1:20; Colossians 3:1; Hebrews 1:3."

### John Calvin:
1. "Stephen did look unto God, who is the judge of life and death, when he was brought into extreme despair of all things, whilst that there is nothing but death before his eyes."
2. "Stephen looketh up toward heaven, that he may gather courage by beholding Christ; that dying he may triumph gloriously, having overcome death."
3. "God will be no less present with us, if, forsaking the world, all our senses strive to come to him; not that he appeareth unto us by any external vision, as he did to Stephen, but he will so reveal himself unto us within, that we may indeed feel his presence."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The scene before his eyes was no longer the council hall at Jerusalem, and the circle of his infuriated judges; but he gazed up into the endless courts of the celestial Jerusalem, with its innumerable company of angels, and saw Jesus, in whose righteous cause he was about to die."
2. "This vision of the splendour of the glory of the Shekinah, Stephen might have beheld as he gazed through the window of the judgment hall, shining through the deep blue arch of sky which overhung Jerusalem."
3. "Many rationalistic attempts have been made to explain away this vision of Stephen, by suggesting it was a bright luminous cloud, or a thunderstorm accompanied by vivid lightning; but such attempts have all signally failed, and only contradict the plain text."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Jesus 'standing' as if he had risen to cheer the brave Stephen."
2. "He saw God's glory and Jesus 'standing' as if he had risen to cheer the brave Stephen."
3. "Elsewhere he is pictured as sitting at the right hand of God (the Session of Christ)."

3. "Jesus being risen from the dead, and ascended on high, was set at the right hand of God, in human nature, and so was visible to the corporeal eye of Stephen."

### John Wesley:
1. "He saw the glory of God" - This suggests that Stephen had a supernatural vision of God's glory, similar to the experience of the prophet Ezekiel. It implies that God miraculously operated on Stephen's imagination, allowing him to see something beyond the physical realm.

2. "God miraculously operating on his imagination" - This phrase highlights the divine intervention in Stephen's vision. It emphasizes that God was actively working in Stephen's mind, enabling him to perceive the glory of God in a way that surpassed ordinary human perception.

3. "Other martyrs... have had extraordinary assistance of some similar kind" - This statement suggests that Stephen's experience was not unique. It implies that throughout history, other martyrs may have received supernatural assistance or visions from God during their moments of extreme suffering. This insight sheds light on the spiritual support that God provides to those who face persecution.
