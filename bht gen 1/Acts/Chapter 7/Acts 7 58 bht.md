# Acts 7:58 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the midst of a tumultuous and unjust execution, the witnesses laid down their clothes at the feet of a young man named Saul. Stephen, a martyr for the cause of Jesus, was stoned outside the city, with the forms of law reluctantly observed. This event marked the first appearance of Paul (then Saul) in the church, and who could have foreseen that this same man would later embrace the faith he was now opposing? The martyr Stephen and Saul, once enemies, now find eternal unity in their shared devotion to Christ.
