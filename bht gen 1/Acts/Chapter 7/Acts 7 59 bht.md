## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The attempt to escape from this direct prayer to the Saviour by making Ἰησοῦ the genitive, and supposing it addressed to the Father, in the face of the ever-recurring words κύριος Ἰησοῦς (see Rev 22:20 especially), and the utter absence of any instance or analogy to justify it, is only characteristic of the school to which it belongs."
2. "The same prayer in substance had been made by our Lord on the cross (ref. Luke) to His Father. To Him was now committed the key of David."
3. "Similarly, the young man Saul, in after years: πέπεισμαι ὅτι δυνατός ἐστιν τὴν παραθήκην μου φυλάξαι εἰς ἐκείνην τὴν ἡμέραν, 2 Timothy 1:12."

4. "It behoveth us with David to commit our souls into the hands of God daily so long as we are in the world, because we are environed with a thousand deaths, that God may deliver our life from all dangers; but when we must die indeed, and we are called thereunto, we must fly unto this prayer, that Christ will receive our spirit."
