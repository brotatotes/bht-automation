# Acts 7:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the history of God's covenant with Abraham, circumcision plays a prominent role. The covenant, marked by circumcision, symbolizes the agreement between God and Abraham. It is a seal, an outward sign of the covenant, representing the commitment and obedience of Abraham and his descendants. The birth of Isaac, occurring after the establishment of the covenant, serves as a fulfillment of God's promises and a confirmation of His faithfulness. Isaac's birth solidifies the connection between the covenant and the chosen people of God, ultimately leading to the twelve patriarchs who become the heads of the twelve tribes of Israel.
