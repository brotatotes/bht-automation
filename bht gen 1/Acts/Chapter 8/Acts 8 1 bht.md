# Acts 8:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this passage, we witness the intense persecution that followed the stoning of Stephen. Saul, who not only consented but took pleasure in Stephen's death, continued his savage work by relentlessly pursuing other Christians. As a result, the members of the church faced great danger, with these bloodthirsty individuals seeking to kill them wherever they found them. Despite this, the ministers of the word, including Philip and Ananias, carried the gospel to various regions, spreading it even to places like Samaria, Damascus, Phenice, Cyprus, and Antioch.
