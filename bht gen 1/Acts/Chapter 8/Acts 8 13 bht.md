# Acts 8:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, we witness Simon's encounter with Philip and his growing belief in the truth of Jesus as the Messiah. Simon's initial interest was rooted in his own magical practices, but as he observed Philip's genuine miracles and witnessed the baptism of others, his understanding began to deepen. Simon's belief was more than a mere intellectual exercise; it compelled him to accompany Philip and seek the source of his power. His journey towards true belief involved not only acknowledging the truth, but also surrendering his own will and aligning himself with the will of God.

2. "He was convinced, from the works which Philip did, that he was in league with some powerful spirit: he viewed baptism as the initiation into communion with that spirit, and expected that he should be able to make use of the higher power thus gained for his own purposes, and unite this new magical power to his own."
