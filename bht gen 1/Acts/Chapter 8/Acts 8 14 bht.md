3. "The monstrous fiction begins, when to Peter is attributed a fixed diocese and successors, and to those successors a delegated power more like that ascribed to Simon Magus than that promised to Peter."

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "The apostles . . . sent Peter and John—showing that they regarded Peter as no more than their own equal." This highlights the equality among the apostles and their unity in carrying out their mission.

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The mention of Samaria here is significant because it represents a place of spiritual and moral decay. It serves as a warning to the people of Israel that they too are susceptible to the same fate if they continue down the path of idolatry and disobedience to God."

2. "The reference to Samaria also highlights the inclusivity of God's love and mercy. Despite the spiritual condition of the people in Samaria, God still reaches out to them and desires their repentance. This serves as a reminder that no one is beyond the reach of God's grace."

3. "The mention of Samaria serves as a reminder that God's judgment is not limited to one particular group or nation. It is a universal principle that applies to all people, regardless of their background or status. This should serve as a sobering reminder to the people of Israel that they are not exempt from God's judgment if they continue in their sinful ways."

### John Calvin:
1. "He used Philip as an instrument to bring them unto the faith; now he ordaineth Peter and John to be ministers to give the Spirit and thus doth he foster the unity of his Church when one helpeth another, and not only knit man and man together, but whole churches also."
2. "The apostles do not this through any distrust, as if they did suspect that Philip did not his duty so uprightly as he ought; but they set to their hand to help him in his work, and Peter and John came not only to help him, and to be partakers of his labors, but also to approve the same."
3. "Again, Philip is not grieved because other men finish that building which he had begun, but they one help another full gently and faithfully; and surely it is ambition alone which will not suffer holy fellowship and mutual imparting of duties to enter."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "To formally sanction this work of Philip in Samaria, and the subsequent general admission of the Samarian people into the Church of the Master, was for the College of Apostles in Jerusalem no slight matter, for it signified a complete breaking down of the old barriers of prejudice." 
2. "We can hardly understand now what a painful struggle it must have been for pious Jews like James, the Lord’s brother, and John to concede that even the hated Samaritan had a right to the kingdom of heaven."
