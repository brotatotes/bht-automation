# Acts 8:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse describes the rapid and sudden coming of the Holy Spirit from heaven. Invoking the name of Jesus holds significance, with baptism being a sign of being washed from sins by the Spirit's work. While only the apostles were empowered to bestow such gifts, the early Church recognized the Holy Spirit as a person, not an impersonal "it." These baptismal believers showed faith and had received the Spirit's sanctification, although they did not possess gifts for ministry yet.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Albert Barnes:
1. "He was fallen - This expression is several times applied to the Holy Spirit... It means that he came from heaven; and the expression 'to fall,' applied to his influences, denotes the 'rapidity' and 'suddenness' of his coming."
2. "In the name of the Lord Jesus - See the notes on Acts 2:38. See also Acts 10:48; Acts 19:5-6."
3. "It does not differ materially from the common expression, 'The Holy Spirit descended.'"

Note: The commentary provided is very short and does not provide much depth or insight into the verse. However, these quotes highlight the meaning of the phrase "He was fallen" and the significance of invoking the name of Jesus.
