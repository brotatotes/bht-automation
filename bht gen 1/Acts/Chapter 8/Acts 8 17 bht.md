## BHT:
In this Bible verse, we see the early Christian community unified in their mission, with Peter and John being sent as equal messengers to spread the Gospel. The act of laying on hands symbolizes a prayerful invocation for God's blessing and the impartation of the Holy Spirit. This practice of laying on hands demonstrates trust in the chosen messengers, signifying their authority and enabling them to carry out the work of the ministry. Through this process, these disciples receive the gifts of the Holy Spirit, enabling them to prophesy, speak in tongues, heal diseases, and perform other miraculous acts.
