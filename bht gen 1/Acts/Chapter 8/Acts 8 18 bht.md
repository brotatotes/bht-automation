# Acts 8:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we see the story of Simon, who attempted to purchase the power of the Holy Spirit with money. The commentators highlight the outward nature of the gifts bestowed by the laying on of hands, as well as Simon's misguided belief that he could obtain spiritual authority externally. The term "simony" originated from this event, denoting the corruption of spiritual matters through the pursuit of personal gain. This cautionary tale serves as a reminder of the dangers of seeking worldly influence within the church and emphasizes the need for integrity and purity in matters of faith.
