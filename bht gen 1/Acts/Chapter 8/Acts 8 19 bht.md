# Acts 8:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This verse speaks of a man who, driven by spiritual ambition and a desire for power, seeks to receive the Holy Spirit in order to transfer spiritual power and authority. He mistakenly views this as a means of personal gain, not realizing that the true value lies in wisdom, faith, and holiness that cannot be bought. Though his request goes beyond the scope of what the apostles can do, it reveals his greedy intention to profit from the ability to confer spiritual gifts on others.
