# Acts 8:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This verse speaks of someone who is excluded and lacks any share or inheritance in the spiritual blessings of God. Their heart is insincere and not aligned with the truth, seeking personal gain rather than the genuine seeking of the gospel. This person is condemned for their covetousness and hypocrisy, lacking the grace of the Holy Spirit. Their wrongdoing is evident in their actions, revealing traits that are incompatible with true religion. The gifts of the Spirit cannot be obtained with money but are freely given by God for the edification of the Church.
