# Acts 8:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, a serious and uncertain sin is mentioned, possibly falling into the category of unpardonable offenses. The doubt expressed about forgiveness serves to emphasize the gravity of the sin and increase the urgency of repentance. The commentators stress the importance of personal responsibility, genuine repentance, and the need for prayer and seeking forgiveness. Despite the seriousness of the sin, there is still hope for forgiveness, with the power of absolution ultimately resting in the hands of God.

3. "They are to be directed to repent; not because they have the 'promise' of forgiveness, and not because they 'hope' to be forgiven, but because sin 'is a great evil,' and because it is 'right' and 'proper' that they should repent, whether they are forgiven or not."
