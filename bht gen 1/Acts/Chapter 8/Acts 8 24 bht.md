# Acts 8:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, a man named Simon is described as seeking intercession from others after being confronted by the apostle Peter. Simon exhibits fear and a sense of guilt, but his motives and sincerity are questioned by commentators. Despite his initial terror and recognition of his wickedness, there is uncertainty regarding the genuine nature of his repentance. It becomes evident that Simon's external acts of faith and baptism do not align with a true conversion, emphasizing the importance of sincere repentance and a genuine relationship with God.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Simon speaks here much as Pharaoh, who yet hardened his heart afterwards." 
2. "It is observable also that he wishes merely for the averting of the punishment." 
3. "The words ὅπως μηδὲν ἐπέλθῃ ἐπ ʼ ἐμὲ ὧν εἰρήκατε seem remarkably to set forth the mere terror of the carnal man, without any idea of the ἐμέ becoming another man in thoughts and aims."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Pray ye to the Lord for me—Peter had urged him to pray for himself: he asks those wonder-working men to do it for him; having no confidence in the prayer of faith, but thinking that those men possessed some peculiar interest with heaven." 
2. "That none of these things come upon me—not that the thought of his wicked heart might be forgiven him, but only that the evils threatened might be averted from him." 
3. "While this throws great light on Peter's view of his melancholy case, it shows that Christianity, as something divine, still retained its hold of him."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Sinners will often ask others to pray for them, when they are too proud, or too much in love with sin, to pray for themselves."
2. "The main thing that Peter wished to impress on him was a sense of his sin. Simon did not regard this, but looked only to the punishment."
3. "If people expect to be saved, they must pray 'for themselves'; and pray not chiefly to be freed from 'punishment,' but from the 'sin which deserves hell.'"

### John Calvin:
1. "And though Peter alone spake, yet he attributeth the speech unto all by reason of the consent." 
2. "Whereas he yieldeth when he is reproved, and being touched with the feeling of his sin, feareth the judgment of God; and that done, flieth unto the mercy of God, and commendeth himself to the prayers of the Church; these are assuredly no small signs of repentance." 
3. "Therefore, we may conjecture that he repented."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "He confesses his fear of punishment, not horror of guilt."
2. "We are left in doubt whether or no St. Peter’s solemn words had any effect on the subsequent life and conduct of Simon."
3. "This gifted but deeply erring man seems, after his meeting with the apostles, to have gone on from bad to worse."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Pray ye for me" - This emphasizes the need for others to intercede on behalf of Simon, indicating that he is in a desperate situation and in need of divine intervention.

2. "Simon is thoroughly frightened by Peter's words" - This highlights Simon's fear and the impact of Peter's words on him, suggesting that he is beginning to realize the gravity of his actions.

3. "He was an unconverted man in spite of his profession of faith and baptism" - This reveals that Simon's outward display of faith and baptism did not reflect a genuine transformation of his heart, underscoring the importance of true repentance and a sincere relationship with God.

### John Gill:
1. "Whose conscience might be touched, and smote with what Peter had said; and he might be terrified with the wrath of God, and filled with fear of his judgment coming upon him for his wickedness, and might now stand trembling before the apostles."
2. "Simon desires both of them, that they would pray to the Lord for him; but whether he was serious, and in good earnest in this, is a question."
3. "And if he was in earnest, he did not take Peter's advice to pray for himself; nor did he declare any repentance for his sin; and his desire that the apostles would pray for him, might not be from any sense he had of the evil of his sin, but from a slavish fear of the evil, or mischief, that was like to come upon him for his sin."
