# Acts 8:25 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the account described, the spreading of the Gospel takes on a gradual and advancing nature, moving further away from Jerusalem. The narrative follows the journeys of individuals like Philip, who is sent to a remote location, and John and Peter, who carry on the work of Philip. The Gospel is not limited because it reaches out to all nations, establishing faith, and testifying to the truth. With unity and testimony, the preaching of the Gospel becomes a joyful journey that closes the issue of spreading the word of the Lord far and wide.
