# Acts 8:26 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In Acts, we read about Philip's obedience to a divine command to take a less-traveled and desolate road from Jerusalem to Gaza, a journey that involved the ministration of angels. This decision reveals Philip's faith and willingness to fulfill God's purpose, unaware of the specific reason for the trip. The mention of the desert path not only describes the physical landscape but also symbolizes the spiritual journey of the Ethiopian eunuch, who sought meaning and truth in a barren world. This account demonstrates that God's plan and salvation extend to individuals even in the most unexpected circumstances.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The ministration of angels introduces and brings about several occurrences in the beginning of the church."
2. "The words, I believe, of the angel, not of Luke."
3. "The way of which I speak to thee is desert."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "To go from a city, where his hands had been full of work, so far away on a desert road, could not but be staggering to the faith of Philip."
2. "He was kept in ignorance of the object of the journey."
3. "But like Paul, he 'was not disobedient to the heavenly vision'; and like Abram, 'he went out not knowing whither he went'."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The word properly means a 'messenger'; and all that it can be shown to signify here is, that the Lord sent a 'message' to Philip of this kind."
2. "It is evident that God designed the 'conversion' of this eunuch, and the direction to Philip shows how he accomplishes his designs."
3. "The salvation of a single sinner is an object worthy the attention of God. When such a sinner is converted, it is because God forms a plan or 'purpose' to do it."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The south [μεσημβριαν]. A contracted form of meshmeria, midday, noon, which is the rendering at Acts 22:6 the only other passage where it occurs." 

2. "Rev. gives at noon in margin." 

3. "There were several roads from Jerusalem to Gaza. One is mentioned by the way of Bethlehem to Hebron, and thence through a region actually called a desert."

### John Calvin:
1. "For we know that the gospel grew of small beginnings; and therein appeared the power of the Spirit more plainly, in that one grain of seed did fill a whole country in a small space."
2. "Therefore let us be content with the commandment of God alone, although the reason of that which he enjoineth, or the fruit of obedience, appear not by and by."
3. "Therefore nothing doth hinder and keep us back from being ready to follow God, save only our own slothfulness and coldness in prayer."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Among the strange and supernatural manifestations which accompanied the laying of the first stones of the Christian Church, the visible manifestation of angels is not the least remarkable."
2. "It was no special minister of the great King in this case, as we read of in the announcement to Zacharias the priest and Mary the virgin, but simply one of the army of Heaven."
3. "The exact application of the words, 'which is desert,' has given rise to much argument... but the simple meaning of the words gives the best sense."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Toward the South (κατα μεσημβριαν). Old word from μεσος and ημερα, midday or noon as in Acts 22:16, the only other example in the N.T."
2. "That may be the idea here also, though 'towards the South' gets support from the use of κατα λιβα in Acts 27:12."

### John Gill:
1. "The phrase denotes readiness, alacrity, and expedition."
2. "This place is sometimes called Azzah, and sometimes Gaza, which is owing to the different pronunciation of the first letter of it."

### John Wesley:
1. "The way which is desert" refers to a less populated route from Jerusalem to Gaza, highlighting the isolation and potential danger of the journey.
2. This choice of route suggests that Philip was willing to go to great lengths to fulfill God's purpose, even if it meant venturing into a desolate and challenging environment.
3. The mention of the desert path also symbolizes the spiritual journey of the Ethiopian eunuch, who was searching for meaning and truth in a barren and empty world.
