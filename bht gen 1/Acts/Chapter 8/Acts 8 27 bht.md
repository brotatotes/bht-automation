# Acts 8:27 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, we see the walls of separation being broken down as the Gospel reaches those considered outcasts under the old covenant. Physical barriers and religious restrictions are no longer grounds for exclusion, as even eunuchs and foreigners are embraced in the inheritance of believers. This occurrence sets the stage for the radical truth that in Christ, all divisions are dissolved, as seen in Galatians 3:28. Through divine providence, an Ethiopian eunuch, a significant figure in the court, becomes a messenger of the gospel, bridging the gap between Judaism and Ethiopia.
