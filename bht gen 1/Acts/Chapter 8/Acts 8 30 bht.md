# Acts 8:30 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, a reader is asked if they understand what they are reading. The question is not meant to be dismissive or rude, but rather to offer assistance in understanding. It suggests that simply reading the words is not enough; a deeper comprehension of their meaning is necessary. The reader, eager to obey the divine order, reads aloud with clarity and reverence, in hopes of gaining a better understanding and being an instrument for good. This inquiry also reminds us that when speaking for God, we can come directly to the point, without unnecessary explanations.
