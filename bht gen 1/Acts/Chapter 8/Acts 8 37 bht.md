# Acts 8:37 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Bible verse being described emphasizes the importance of faith and profession of belief before baptism. It is necessary to truly believe in Christ with the heart for a genuine profession of faith. This faith should not be superficial or insincere, but a true surrender of the heart, will, and affections to the truth of the Gospel. Without such faith, it is impossible to please God, making it a vital prerequisite for baptism.

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The respect with which he here addresses Philip was prompted by his reverence for one whom he perceived to be his superior in divine things."

3. "The eunuch's response reflects his recognition of Philip's authority in matters of faith."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "There is required not merely the assent of the understanding, but a surrender of the 'heart, the will, the affections,' to the truth of the gospel."

### Marvin Vincent:
I apologize for the confusion, but I am unable to generate a response without the commentary. Could you please provide the commentary so that I can assist you further?

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The devout student of the word of God fearlessly accepts the conclusions which result from a careful examination of the varied evidence upon which the genuineness of each passage of the New Testament rests."
2. "The result of such study has been, that scholars have agreed to reject as undoubtedly spurious, here and there, a famous doctrinal text, such as I St. John 5:7, to mark as at least doubtful such a passage as Acts 8:37."
3. "Meyer suggests that the words may have been taken, in the first instance, from some very early Baptismal Liturgy, and thence copied by some scribe into a manuscript of the Acts."

### John Gill:
1. "Faith in Christ, and a profession of it, are necessary prerequisites to baptism."
2. "This faith should not be a mere historical and temporary faith, nor a feigned one, but a believing in Christ with the heart unto righteousness."

Note: The commentary is quite long, so I had to condense it significantly to fit within the word limit.
