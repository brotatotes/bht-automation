# Acts 8:38 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, a command is given to a eunuch, who obediently follows it by going down into the water. This encounter between the eunuch and Philip highlights the inclusivity of God's word, transcending social barriers. The passage also sheds light on the mode of baptism, suggesting that it involved a physical immersion in water rather than a symbolic sprinkling. However, there is debate among commentators about the exact mode of baptism, with some emphasizing the act of obedience and commitment rather than the specific method.

1. "They went down both into the water" - This phrase suggests that baptism involved a physical immersion in water, rather than just a symbolic sprinkling or pouring.
2. "He baptized him" - This highlights the role of the baptizer as the one who administers the sacrament, emphasizing the authority and responsibility of the baptizer.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The preposition εἰς eis, translated 'into,' does not of necessity mean that they went 'into' the water. Its meaning would be as well expressed by 'to' or 'unto,' or as we should say, 'they went 'to' the water,' without meaning to determine whether they went 'into' it or not."
2. "It is incumbent on those who maintain that 'immersion' is the only valid mode of baptism to prove that this passage cannot possibly mean anything else, and that there was no other mode practiced by the apostles."
3. "No such positive command can be adduced. And it follows, therefore, that it cannot be proved that immersion is the only lawful mode of baptism."

### John Calvin:
1. "We ought rather to fight even an hundred times to death for the ceremony itself of baptism, inasmuch as it was delivered us by Christ that we should suffer the same to be taken from us."
2. "Forasmuch as we have as well a testimony of our washing, as of newness of life, in the figure of water; forasmuch as Christ representeth unto us his blood in the water as in a glass, that we may fetch our cleanness thence."
3. "For some dipped them thrice, some but once. Wherefore there is no case why we should be so straitlaced in matters which are of no such weight; so that external pomp do no whit pollute the simple institution of Christ."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Say, Here is water, what hindereth me to be baptized? Seize the opportunity."
2. "Though an Ethiop in body, be thou pure in heart; and do not say: Let a bishop baptize me, and if a presbyter, let him be unmarried."
3. "Man looketh on the face, but God on the heart. Any minister can cleanse you by baptism if he is not alien from the Church."

### John Gill:
1. "Hence we see what was the manner of baptizing with the ancients, for they plunged the whole body into water."
2. "If sprinkling or pouring of water had been practiced, there would have been no necessity for going out of the chariot or going down into the water."
3. "The Jewish ablutions and purifications, which were performed by immersion, are spoken of in the same sort of language as here."

Note: The commentary provides insights into the ancient practice of baptism, emphasizing the immersion of the whole body in water. It also compares this practice to the Jewish ablutions and purifications, which were also performed by immersion.

### John Wesley:
1. "It does not follow that he was baptized by immersion."
2. "The text neither affirms nor intimates anything concerning it."
3. "The verse simply states that they both went down, without specifying the method of baptism."
