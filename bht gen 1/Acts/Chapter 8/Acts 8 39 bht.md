In this verse, we see the account of Philip's departure after baptizing the Samaritan eunuch. Commentators describe this event as a supernatural disappearance and a miraculous assurance. The Spirit of the Lord caught away Philip, vanishing him suddenly and miraculously. This divine intervention highlights the power and authority of the Holy Spirit and emphasizes God's ability to work beyond human understanding. Philip's departure was not a result of his own actions, but rather a testament to the sovereignty and divine orchestration of God.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The Spirit of the Lord - See Acts 8:29. The Spirit had suggested to Philip to go to meet the eunuch, and the same Spirit, now that he had fulfilled the design of his going there, directed his departure."
2. "The meaning is, clearly, that the Spirit, who had directed Philip to go near the eunuch, now removed him in a similar manner. That this is the meaning is clear: (1) Because it accounts for all that occurred. It is not wise to suppose the existence of a miracle except where the effect cannot otherwise be accounted for, and except where there is a plain statement that there was a miracle."

For what truer matter of joy can be invented than when the Lord doth not only set open unto us the treasures of his mercy, but poureth out his heart into us, and giveth us himself in his Son, that we may want nothing to perfect felicity?"
