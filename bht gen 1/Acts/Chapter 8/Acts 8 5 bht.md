## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Philip is mentioned again as ὁ εὐαγγελιστής, probably from his having been the first recorded who εὐηγγελίσατο τὸν λόγον, in ch. Acts 21:8, as married and having four daughters, virgins, who prophesied."
2. "Verbatim as John 4:5, in which case it is specified as being Sychar (Sichem). As the words stand here (πόλιν = τὴν πόλιν, after εἰς, compare also 2Pe 2:6), seeing that Σαμάρεια (Acts 8:9; Acts 8:14; ch. Acts 9:31; Act 15:3) signifies the district, I should be inclined to believe that Sychem is here also intended."
3. "The inhabitants, implied in πόλις."
