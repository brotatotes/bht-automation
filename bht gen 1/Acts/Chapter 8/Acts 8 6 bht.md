1. "For those which refuse that doctrine which they have not heard, how is it possible that they should ever come unto faith, which cometh by hearing?" (Romans 10:14.) Therefore, whereas they were ready to hear, that was the first step unto reverence and attentiveness.

2. "And therefore it is no marvel if faith be so rare, and almost none in the world; for how many be there which vouchsafe to hearken when God speaketh? whereby it cometh to pass that the more part rejecteth the truth before they know the same, and have not so much as lightly tasted it."

3. "And as hearing is the beginning of faith, so it should not be sufficient of itself, unless the majesty of doctrine should also move the hearts. And surely, whosoever considereth that he hath to do with God, cannot hear him contemptuously when he speaketh; and the very doctrine which is contained in his word shall purchase authority for itself, so that attentiveness shall flow of itself from hearing."
