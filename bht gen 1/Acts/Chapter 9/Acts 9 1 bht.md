# Acts 9:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This remarkable Bible verse describes the profound transformation undergone by Saul, who would later become the apostle Paul. With zeal and violence, Saul relentlessly persecuted the disciples of Jesus, breathing out threats and seeking their destruction. His intense hatred and rage made him an unwavering enemy of the early Christian movement. However, through a divine encounter, Saul's entire being was changed, and he became an instrument of God's grace, proclaiming the very Gospel he had sought to destroy. This dramatic conversion serves as a testament to the depths of God's mercy and the power of transformation.
