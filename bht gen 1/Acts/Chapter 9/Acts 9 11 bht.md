# Acts 9:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the city of Damascus, there is a street called Straight, known for its direct path from the eastern to the western gate. This street, which has remained unchanged over time, serves as a significant location in the biblical narrative. It is said to be the very street where Ananias encountered Saul, the former persecutor of Christians who had now become a fervent prayer warrior. Despite its narrowness, this street symbolizes the straight and unobstructed path to salvation, reminding us of the transformative power of prayer and the unexpected ways in which God works in the lives of His people.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "We are allowed to bear in mind that the thoroughfares of Eastern cities do not change, and to believe that the ‘straight street,’ which still extends through Damascus in long perspective from the eastern gate, is the street where Ananias spoke to Saul."
2. "Still, true as this is, we have sometimes proofs and illustrations unexpectedly appearing, as research goes on, which identify as authentic, sites long pointed out by tradition."
3. "TARSUS was the capital of the province of Cilicia, a large and populous city in a fruitful plain on the river Cydnus, which flowed through the midst of it, with a swift stream of remarkably cold water."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "There is something touching in the minuteness of these directions."

### John Calvin:
1. "Luke showeth that Paul gave himself to prayer those three days; and peradventure this was one cause why he fasted."
2. "Christ doth assuredly speak of no short prayer in this place, but he doth rather show that Paul continued in this kind of exercise until he should be more quiet in mind."
