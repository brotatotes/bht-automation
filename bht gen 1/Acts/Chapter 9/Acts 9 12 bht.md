# Acts 9:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we see God's providence at work as he prepares both Saul and Ananias for their encounter. Through a vision, Saul is made aware of Ananias, fostering a sense of expectation and confirming that Ananias is genuine. Ananias, in turn, receives his own vision, assuring him that Saul is divinely appointed and directing him to restore Saul's sight. This divine orchestration highlights the transformative power of God's grace in bringing these two individuals together for a significant and life-changing moment.
