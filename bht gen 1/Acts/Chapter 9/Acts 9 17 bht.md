# Acts 9:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In Acts, Ananias follows a divine command to visit Saul, whom he addresses as a brother in Christ. Ananias acknowledges that his mission is not of his own accord but sent by the Lord Himself. The encounter highlights the significance of Saul's conversion and hints at the unfolding of a greater purpose.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "I can hardly think, with De W. and Meyer, that these words imply that the Lord had said to Ananias more than is above related: I would rather view them as a natural inference from what was said in Acts 9:15."
2. "It is remarkable again how Paul, speaking there to an infuriated Jewish mob, gives the words spoken just that form which would best gain him a favourable hearing with them."
3. "He there too gives ἀναστὰς βάπτισαι καὶ ἀπόλουσαι τὰς ἁμαρτίας σου, ἐπικαλεσάμενος τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ as part of the exhortation of Ananias."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "How beautifully childlike is the obedience of Ananias to 'the heavenly vision!'" 
2. "This clearly shows in what sense the term 'Lord' is used in this book. It is JESUS that is meant, as almost invariably in the Epistles also." 
3. "This knowledge by an inhabitant of Damascus of what had happened to Saul before entering it, would show him at once that this was the man whom Jesus had already prepared him to expect."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Putting his hands on him - This was not 'ordination,' but was the usual mode of imparting or communicating blessings."
2. "Brother Saul - An expression recognizing him as a fellow-Christian."
3. "Be filled with the Holy Ghost - See the notes on Acts 2:4."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "This verse reminds us that God's love is not based on our performance or worthiness, but on His own character and nature. It is a love that is unconditional, unchanging, and everlasting."

2. "The phrase 'the world' in this verse refers to all of humanity, regardless of race, nationality, or background. God's love is not limited to a select few, but extends to every person on earth."

3. "The sacrifice of Jesus on the cross is the ultimate expression of God's love for us. It is through His death and resurrection that we can experience the fullness of God's love and have eternal life."

### John Calvin:
1. "The apostles translated that custom taken from sacrifices to their use, either when they gave the visible graces of the Spirit or when they made any man minister of the Church."
2. "To this end doth Ananias lay his hands now upon Paul, partly that he may consecrate him unto God, partly that he may obtain for him the gifts of the Spirit."

1. "The hesitation, the doubts and fears of Ananias, the Jewish Christian, and his subsequent visit and complete acceptance of the persecutor Saul as a brother saint chosen by the Master for a great and mighty work."

3. "Here Ananias directly refers to the appearance of the glorified Jesus to Saul ‘in the way.’ These and similar declarations are important, as in later days Paul, in speaking of the evidences, seems to have attached the deepest importance to the fact that he had seen the Lord."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "All suspicion has vanished and Ananias takes Saul to his heart as a brother in Christ."

3. "This enduement of special power he will need as an apostle and as promised by Jesus."
