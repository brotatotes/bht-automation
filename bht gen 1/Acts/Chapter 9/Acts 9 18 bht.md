# Acts 9:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this mysterious event, the blindness of Saul is miraculously healed through the laying on of hands. His eyes are freed from a supernatural scale-like substance, symbolizing the removal of ignorance, sin, and the veils hindering his understanding. The sudden restoration of his physical sight parallels the spiritual insight he has gained. This extraordinary conversion from fanaticism to wisdom is ascribed to a miraculous appearance of Christ, and Saul's submission to baptism emphasizes the importance of the sacrament in the entrance to the Church.
