# Acts 9:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
After his dramatic conversion, the newly transformed Saul spent a few days in quiet, getting to know his former enemies as brothers. It wasn't a time to learn the gospel, as he had already received direct revelation. Instead, it was a reorientation for Saul, a time of fellowship and regaining his spiritual strength. This experience, along with Saul's subsequent journey to Arabia, is strong evidence of the truth of Christianity and the sincerity of his conversion.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "A few days; of quiet, and becoming acquainted with those as brethren, whom he came to persecute as infidels."
2. "Not to learn from them the gospel, nor was the time longer than to admit of εὐθέως being used."
3. "The same εὐθέως of the whole space preceding the journey to Arabia."

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "The exhaustion occasioned by his three days' fast would not be the less real, though unfelt during his struggles."
2. "Making their acquaintance, in another way than either he or they had anticipated, and regaining his tone by the fellowship of the saints."
3. "Not certainly in order to learn from them what he was to teach, which he expressly disavows."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "His conversion has always been justly considered as a strong proof of the Christian religion."
2. "There must have been some cause, some motive for it; and is there anything more rational than the supposition that Saul was convinced in a most striking and wonderful manner of the truth of Christianity?"
3. "If Paul was sincere; if his conversion was genuine, the Christian religion is true."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Paul, in his Galatian Epistle (Acts 1:16-18), tells how, shortly after his conversion, he went into Arabia, then returned to Damascus, and after a space of three years went up to Jerusalem to see Peter and the older apostles."
2. "On the question of the Arabian journey referred to in Galatians 1:17, considerable doubt exists as to the meaning of the word ‘Arabia.’"
3. "It is, however, possible that Saul, after the first excitement wrought by his conversion had in some measure passed away, longed for solitude, for a time of meditation before setting out on his great life’s work, and in the stillness of the Arabian desert, near the Red Sea, the well-known desert of the wanderings of his fathers, sought and found opportunity for solitary communion with God."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Was strengthened (ενισχυθη). First aorist passive indicative of ενισχυω, to receive strength (ισχυς), comparatively late verb and here only in the N.T. save Luke 22:43 where it is doubtful." 

2. "This clause belongs in sense to verse Acts 9:18."

3. "Some days (ημερας τινας). An indefinite period, probably not long, the early period in Damascus before Saul left for Arabia (Galatians 1:13-24)."

### John Gill:
1. "He was strengthened; in body, being before very weak and feeble; not so much through fatigue of his journey, as through the fear and surprise the appearance of Christ to him, and his words, threw him into."
2. "Through his fasting so long, and his continuance and constancy in prayer all this while, and the attention he gave to the divine instructions which were communicated to him, internally and externally."
3. "These disciples, with the new converts afterwards, it is highly probable, formed a church state in Damascus; Ananias is said to be the bishop or pastor of it, and which remained in several ages."
