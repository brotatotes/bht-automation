# Acts 9:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, we witness the remarkable transformation of Saul, who was known for his zealous persecution of Christians. As he embraced the message of Christ, he faced opposition from adversaries who sought to defame him. Yet, despite the threats to his life, Saul's conversion remained steadfast, leading to an interval where he withdrew from public sight for a period of personal reflection and spiritual growth. This account offers valuable insights into the power of God's grace to change hearts and the enduring impact of Paul's journey in advancing the Gospel.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The whole time, from his conversion to his journey to Jerusalem, was three years."

3. "The Jews no longer seek to slander and accuse him falsely."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Had we no other record than this, we should have supposed that what is here related took place while Saul continued at Damascus after his baptism."
2. "That such a blank should occur in the Acts, and be filled up in Galatians, is not more remarkable than that the flight of the Holy Family into Egypt, their stay there, and their return thence, recorded only by Matthew, should be so entirely passed over by Luke."
3. "Perhaps (1) because he felt a period of repose and partial seclusion to be needful to his spirit, after the violence of the change and the excitement of his new occupation."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "There is, therefore, an interval here which Luke has not filled up; and if this were the only narrative which we had, we should be at a loss how to understand this."
2. "By comparing these two accounts together, we arrive at the whole state of the case. Neither seems to be complete without the other."
3. "And as the two parts were made by different individuals, and without design of adapting them to each other, they show that the writers had formed no collusion or agreement to impose on the world; that they are separate and independent witnesses; that they are honest men; that their narratives are true records of what actually occurred."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The act of killing is a stark reminder of the depths of human sin and the brokenness of our world. It reveals the darkness that resides within us and the devastating consequences of our actions." 

2. "In this verse, the act of killing is not only a physical act, but also a symbol of the ultimate sacrifice that Jesus made for humanity. It is a powerful reminder of the lengths to which God was willing to go to redeem us and bring us back into relationship with Him."

3. "The killing of Jesus on the cross serves as a profound example of God's love and mercy. It is through this act of sacrifice that we are offered forgiveness and salvation, despite our own sinful nature. It is a reminder that even in the face of our worst actions, God's grace is greater and His love is unending."

### John Calvin:
1. "The Lord did not suffer the course which he had begun well to be broken off so soon, so he doth with his wonderful counsel hinder the purposes of the enemies, stay their endeavors, restrain their malice and madness, whilst that he furthereth the gospel."
2. "The unadvised and rash heat of zeal will always almost break out into such cruelty, unless men suffer themselves to be ruled by the word of God."
3. "Furthermore, we see how sweetly these preposterous zealous fellows grant themselves liberty to do whatsoever them lusteth, when Satan hath once pricked them forward to persecute the truth."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Saul, as inflexible in the defence of the Gospel as before, through ignorance he had been furious against it, was willing, we cannot doubt, to lay down his life for his creed." 
2. "Providence had destined him for many a long year to stand forth as the great champion of the Church, and to carry its standard triumphantly into far remoter regions."
3. "The plot against his life was divulged, and the disciples took him, and at midnight let him down through the window of one of the houses built upon the wall."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Paul there states definitely that he went away from Damascus to Arabia and returned there before going back to Jerusalem and that the whole period was about 'three years' which need not mean three full years, but at least portions of three." 
2. "It cannot be argued from the frequent lacunae in the Acts that Luke tells all that was true or that he knew. He had his own methods and aims as every historian has."
3. "Paul was now seeing the fulfilment of the prophecy of Jesus about him (Acts 9:16)."

### John Gill:
1. "The phrase 'many days' signify at least three days; for by 'days', in the plural number, two must be designed, and many signifies a third, or that one at least is added to them."
2. "Such a space of time is designed by the many days here; for when the apostle had stayed a little while at Damascus, and preached Christ in the synagogues, he went into Arabia, where he continued about three years."
3. "The Jews took counsel to kill him; being filled with indignation at him, that he had changed his religion, and from a persecutor was become a preacher of the Gospel."
