## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The purpose of this journey was to become acquainted with Peter, a resolution probably taken during the conspiracy of the Jews against him at Damascus." 
2. "By conference with the Apostles, his sphere of work might be agreed on."
3. "And this purpose his escape enabled him to effect."

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Saul's visit to Jerusalem after his conversion was significant as it showed his desire to connect with the leading apostle, Peter, and receive guidance for his ministry to the Gentiles."
2. "By joining himself to the disciples, Saul demonstrated his humility and willingness to be part of the community, setting aside his apostolic commission for the time being."
3. "The disciples' initial fear of Saul stemmed from their knowledge of him as a persecutor of the faith, with any belief in his conversion fading away during his absence in Arabia and lack of information about his subsequent labors in Damascus."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He did not go to Jerusalem immediately after he escaped from Damascus. He first went into Arabia, where he spent a considerable part, or the whole of three years."
2. "Their fear, or suspicion, was excited probably on these grounds: (1) They remembered his former violence against Christians. They had an instinctive shrinking from him, and suspicion of the man that had been so violent a persecutor."
3. "It is not unnatural, however, to have doubts respecting an open and virulent enemy of the gospel who suddenly professes a change in favor of it. The human mind does not easily cast off suspicion of some unworthy motive, and open itself at once to entire confidence."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "To 'join himself' implies a deep level of commitment and attachment. It suggests a willingness to align oneself with a particular group or cause, in this case, the disciples of Jesus. It signifies a desire to be united with them in purpose and mission."

2. "This act of joining oneself to the disciples is not just a physical association but also a spiritual one. It involves embracing their beliefs, values, and way of life. It requires a surrendering of one's own agenda and a wholehearted dedication to the teachings and principles of Jesus."

3. "By joining himself to the disciples, one becomes part of a community that shares a common faith and a common purpose. It is a fellowship of believers who support and encourage one another, striving together to live out the teachings of Jesus and advance His kingdom on earth."

### John Calvin:
1. "All his own nation was set against him for Christ’s cause. The Christians refuse him. Might he not have been quite discouraged and out of hope as one expelled out of men’s company?" 
2. "This was true conversion, that whereas he raged horribly before, he doth now valiantly suffer the storms of persecutions."
3. "Here is no ambition, but he was to be instructed by this means to make more account even of the lowest place amongst the disciples of Christ than of all masterships in corrupt and revolted synagogues."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "He returned to the capital poor, despised, a proscribed outlaw, his brilliant earthly prospects blasted, only burning to preach the Name of the Crucified, whose devoted followers he had once persecuted with so bitter, so relentless a hostility."
2. "He entered then perfectly willing, were it God’s will, to be dragged out through them to the same fate. He would feel a peculiar tie of brotherhood to that martyr, for he could not now be ignorant that the same Jesus, who in such glory had called him, had but a little while before appeared in the same glory to reassure the expiring Stephen."
3. "The Jerusalem Church, therefore, must have been in a state of great uncertainty and perplexity as to the intentions of their ancient and bitter enemy. Hackett suggests, ‘The sudden appearance of Voltaire in a circle of Christians, claiming to be one of them, would have been something like this return of Saul to Jerusalem as a professed disciple.'"

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "He had left a conquering hero of Pharisaism. He returns distrusted by the disciples and regarded by the Pharisees as a renegade and a turncoat."
2. "He made no effort to get in touch with the Sanhedrin who had sent him to Damascus. He had escaped the plots of the Jews in Damascus only to find himself the object of suspicion by the disciples in Jerusalem."
3. "They had probably heard of his conversion, but they frankly disbelieved the reports and regarded him as a hypocrite or a spy in a new role to ruin them."

### John Gill:
1. "Grace had made a strange alteration in him; those whom he hated, and was exceeding mad against, he now loves; they are the excellent ones in the earth in whom is all his delight; and whom he persecuted to strange cities, he now courts their company, and attempts to get among them; accounting it his greatest honour and happiness to be one of their society."

2. "And a great privilege it is to be in such a relation, having the grace of God; for such have the best of company, and the most refreshing ordinances; are in the greatest safety, being under the watch and care of ministers and members, of angels, and of God himself; and shall never be disfranchised, or become foreigners and strangers; they may expect the presence of God, fresh supplies of his grace, and even life for evermore, and need fear no enemy."

3. "Hence it appears, that the primitive churches were very careful in the admission of persons into fellowship with them; as they could not bear them in their communion who were evil, so they would not admit any among them but such as they looked upon to be the true disciples of Christ: and this is a method worthy of imitation."

### John Wesley:
