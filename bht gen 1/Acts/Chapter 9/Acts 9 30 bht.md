# Acts 9:30 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
After receiving a vision from the Lord during his prayer in the temple, the apostle was commanded to leave because his testimony would not be accepted. He stayed in Jerusalem for fifteen days, during which he preached the Gospel and founded churches. It was likely during this visit that he gathered his own family members into the fold of Christ. Afterwards, due to the enmity and hostility of the Jews, he was sent to Tarsus, his native city, both for his safety and in hopes of receiving favor and authority among his own people.
