## BHT:
During this period, the believers experienced a time of rest and peace, as the persecutions against them ceased. The Church grew and multiplied, with congregations scattered throughout the land, united by the apostles and the Holy Spirit. The individual members' spiritual life was deepened, as they walked in the fear of the Lord and were comforted by the Holy Spirit. Their faith strengthened, they were built up in love and continued to spread the Gospel message.
