# Acts 9:33 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this passage, Peter visits a man named Aeneas, who had been bedridden for eight years due to paralysis. The mention of Aeneas being a Hellenistic Jew and the use of specific Greek terms for "bed" and "paralyzed" highlight the attention to detail by Luke, who was a physician. Aeneas's condition was not only physically debilitating but also considered incurable, making his miraculous healing by Peter all the more unexpected and praiseworthy.
