# Acts 9:37 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In those days, a woman in Lydda fell ill and died. As was customary, her body was washed and prepared for burial. The disciples placed her in an upper chamber, possibly a gathering place for the believers, as a witness to the potential miracle that might occur through Peter. This upper chamber symbolizes a space of spiritual elevation and connection with God, a reminder of the higher purpose followers of Jesus are called to fulfill.
