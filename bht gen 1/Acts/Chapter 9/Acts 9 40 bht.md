### Henry Alford:
1. "After the example of his divine Master"
2. "See ref. Mark"

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Peter put them all forth, and kneeled down—the one in imitation of his Master's way ( :-; and compare 2 Kings 4:33); the other, in striking contrast with it." 
2. "The kneeling became the lowly servant, but not the Lord Himself, of whom it is never once recorded that he knelt in the performance of a miracle."
3. "The graphic minuteness of detail here imparts to the narrative an air of charming reality."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Perhaps it was because he did not wish to appear as if seeking publicity."
2. "If done in the presence of many persons, it might seem like ostentation."
3. "Others suppose it was that he might offer more fervent prayer to God than he would be willing they should witness."

### John Calvin:
1. "When he healed AEneas he broke out into these words, without making any stop, AEneas, Jesus Christ make thee whole. But as the operation of the Spirit is not always alike and the same, it may be that though he knew the power of God, yet he went forward unto the miracle by degrees."
2. "It is recorded in the Sacred History, (1 Kings 17:23,) that Elias did the same. For he being alone, and not so much as the mother of the child with him, doth stretch himself thrice upon the dead corpse. For the Spirit of God hath his vehement motions, which, if any man will square out according to the common use of men, or measure by the sense of the flesh, he shall do wickedly and unjustly."
3. "Kneeling in time of prayer is a token of humility, which hath a double profit, that all our members may be applied unto the worship of God, and that the external exercise of the body may help the weakness of the mind; but we must take heed so often as we kneel down, that the inward submission of the heart be answerable to the ceremony, that it be not vain and false."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Peter put them all forth, following the example of Christ, to avoid anything like a crowd of curious spectators in the hushed and solemn death-chamber, at the moment when the soul should return to the body."
2. "Jesus, without any preceding prayer, restored to life the son of the widow of Nain and the little daughter of Jairus."
3. "A ‘new life’ had been pointed out to and quietly adopted by the women of the new society. From the first days which succeeded that glad Pentecost morning when the Holy Spirit fell on the twelve, we have noticed the holy influence which the ‘sisters in Christ’ quietly exercised in the Jerusalem Church."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Put them all forth (εκβαλων εξω παντας). Second aorist (effective) active participle of εκβαλλω, a rather strong word, perhaps with some difficulty." 

2. "Tabitha, arise (Ταβειθα, αναστηθ). With sublime faith like Ταλειθα κουμ of Jesus in Mark 5:41." 

3. "She sat up (ανεκαθισεν). Effective aorist active indicative of ανακαθιζω. Often in medical writers, only here in the N.T. and Luke 7:15 where Westcott and Hort have in the margin the uncompounded form εκαθισεν. Vivid picture."
