# Acts 9:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, Saul, who later becomes the apostle Paul, encounters a divine encounter with Jesus. Saul is initially ignorant of Jesus' identity but is then confronted with the realization that he has been persecuting Jesus himself. Jesus uses the phrase "It is hard for thee to kick against the pricks," to illustrate the futility and pain of resisting divine guidance. This proverbial expression emphasizes that resistance to God's will only leads to self-inflicted harm and serves as a warning against opposing the powerful presence of Christ.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "That Saul saw, as well as heard, Him who spoke with him, is certain from Ananias's speech, Acts 9:17, and ch. Acts 22:14, that of Barnabas, Acts 9:27, from ch. Acts 26:16 (ὤφθην σοι), and from the references by Paul himself to his having seen the Lord, 1Co 9:1; 1 Corinthians 15:8." 

2. "These last I unhesitatingly refer to this occasion, and not to any subsequent one, when he saw the Lord ἐν ἐκστάσει, ch. Acts 22:17."

3. "Such appearances could hardly form the subject of autoptic testimony which should rank with that of the other apostles: this, on the contrary, was no ἔκστασις, but the real bodily appearance of the risen Jesus: so that it might be adduced as the ground of testimony to His Resurrection."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Jesus knew Saul ere Saul knew Jesus."
2. "That Saul saw as well as heard this glorious Speaker."
3. "The term 'JESUS' is purposely chosen, to convey to him the thrilling information that the hated name which he sought to hunt down—'the Nazarene,' was now speaking to him from the skies, 'crowned with glory and honor'."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The word 'Lord' here, as is frequently the case in the New Testament, means no more than 'sir.' It is evident that Saul did not as yet know that this was the Lord Jesus." 
2. "In his amazement and confusion, he naturally asked who it was that was thus addressing him." 
3. "There can be no doubt that he had often blasphemed his name, and profanely derided the notion that the Messiah could come out of Nazareth. Jesus here uses, however, that very designation. 'I am Jesus the Nazarene, the object of your contempt and scorn.'"

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "It is hard for thee" - This phrase emphasizes the difficulty faced by the individual in question. It suggests that the task or situation at hand is challenging and may require perseverance and strength.

2. "Transferred from ch. 26 14" - This indicates that the phrase in question was originally found in another chapter of the Bible. It highlights the importance of considering the context and cross-referencing different passages to gain a deeper understanding of the verse.

3. "Omitted by the best texts" - This phrase suggests that some versions or manuscripts of the Bible do not include the specific phrase mentioned. It emphasizes the need for careful examination and comparison of different textual sources to ensure accuracy in interpreting the verse.

### John Calvin:
1. "Christ showeth what great account he maketh of his gospel, when he pronounceth that it is his cause, from which he will not be separated. Therefore he can no more refuse to defend the same than he can deny himself."
2. "The Son of God is partner with them of the cross, when as they suffer and labor for the testimony of the gospel, and that he doth, as it were, put under his shoulders, that he may bear some part of the burden."
3. "We gather hereby what horrible judgment is prepared for the persecutors of the Church, who like giants besiege the very heaven, and shake their darts, which shall pierce their own head by and by."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "If He had said to him (Saul), I am the Son of God, I am the Eternal Word, He who made the heavens, then he (Saul) would have been able to reply, The object of my persecution was a different one from this’ . . . So the glorified One simply replied: ‘I am Jesus of Nazareth whom thou persecutest.’"
2. "The metaphor, ‘It is hard for thee to kick against the pricks,’ was a favourite one in the heathen world... Its meaning here is obvious: it was useless, nay injurious, to resist Christ by persecuting His disciples."
3. "To resist the call of Christ is ever a hard and profitless task; one, too, which is far beyond man’s power. Such a course of action must ever end in utter ruin and wreck for the unhappy one who struggles to resist."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "It is open to question if κυριε should not here be translated 'Sir' as in Acts 16:30 and in Matthew 21:29; Matthew 21:30; John 5:7; John 12:21; John 20:15; and should be so in John 9:36."
2. "Saul surrendered instantly as Thomas did (John 20:28) and as little Samuel (1 Samuel 3:9)."
3. "This surrender of the will to Christ was the conversion of Saul. He saw a real Person, the Risen Christ, to whom he surrendered his life."

### John Gill:
1. "He knew not Christ by his form or voice, as Stephen did, when he saw him standing at the right hand of God; he was in a state of ignorance, and knew neither the person, nor voice of Christ, and yet his heart was so far softened and wrought upon, that he was desirous of knowing who he was."
2. "It is hard for thee to kick against the pricks; or 'to resist me', as the Arabic version renders it; and which is the sense of the phrase; it is a proverbial expression, taken from beasts that are goaded, who kick against the goads or pricks, and hurt themselves the more thereby."
3. "Christ uses it, suggesting hereby, that should Saul go on to persecute him and his people, to oppose his Gospel, and the strong evidence of it, in doctrine and miracles, and notwithstanding the present remonstrances made in such an extraordinary manner; he would find himself in the issue greatly hurt by it, and could not rationally expect to succeed against so powerful a person."

### John Wesley:
1. "To kick against the goads" is a powerful Syriac proverb that vividly captures the futility and pain of resisting divine guidance.
2. This phrase conveys the idea that when we resist the direction and correction of God, we only end up hurting ourselves.
3. It serves as a reminder that our attempts to go against God's will are ultimately in vain and will only lead to more suffering.
