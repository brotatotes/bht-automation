# Acts 9:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The men who accompanied Saul rose from the ground in awe, having been struck down just as he had. They heard a noise, although it was not a distinct voice, and they saw a bright light, but did not see Jesus himself. This account underscores the extraordinary and mystical nature of the experience that left them speechless and in wonder.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The companions of Saul saw and were struck to the ground by the light, but saw οὐδ  ένα, no person: that they stood mute, hearing τῆς φωνῆς, the sound of the voice, but not τὴν φωνὴν τοῦ λαλοῦντός μοι, the words spoken and their meaning." 
2. "The devout and intelligent student of Scripture will see in such examples a convincing proof of the simple truth of the narrative, the absence of all endeavour to pare away apparent inconsistencies or revise them into conformity."
3. "I should not too hastily determine that this account has not come from Saul himself, on account of the above differences: they are no more than might arise in narrations at different times by the same person."

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "The standing posture be intended, we have only to suppose that though at first they 'all fell to the earth,' they arose of their own accord while Saul yet lay prostrate."
2. "Just as 'the people that stood by heard' the voice that saluted our Lord with recorded words of consolation and assurance, and yet heard not the articulate words, but thought 'it thundered' or that some 'angel spake to Him'—so these men heard the voice that spake to Saul, but heard not the articulate words."
3. "Apparent discrepancies like these, in the different narratives of the same scene in one and the same book of Acts, furnish the strongest confirmation both of the facts themselves and of the book which records them."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The word 'speechless' properly denotes 'those who are so astonished or stupefied as to be unable to speak.'"
2. "The word here rendered 'voice' is thus frequently used, as in Genesis 3:8; 1 Samuel 12:18; Psalms 29:3-4; Matthew 24:31 (Greek); 1 Thessalonians 4:16."
3. "They heard a 'noise'; they were amazed and alarmed, but they did not hear the distinct words addressed to Saul."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Speechless [ενεοι]. The word means 'to be silent' or 'to have no words.' It emphasizes the profound impact and astonishment that the people experienced in response to Jesus' teaching and miracles." 

2. "This word highlights the inability of the people to fully comprehend or articulate the depth of Jesus' wisdom and power. It underscores the awe and wonder that Jesus inspired in those who witnessed his works." 

3. "The silence of the crowd also serves as a reminder of the limitations of human language and understanding when faced with the divine. It points to the ineffable nature of God's truth and the need for humility and reverence in approaching the mysteries of faith."

### John Calvin:
1. "They heard not the voice of him that spake with me." - This quote highlights that Paul's companions may have heard a voice, but they did not understand or discern who was speaking or what was being said. It emphasizes that Paul alone had the knowledge and understanding of the speech of Christ.

2. "Luke saith in this place that there was a voice heard, and no man seen, his meaning is, that the voice proceeded from no man, but that it was uttered by God." - This quote clarifies that the voice heard by Paul's companions was not from a human source, but rather it was a divine voice from God. It emphasizes the miraculous nature of the event.

3. "Paul's companions see a light like to lightning; they see Paul lie prostrate; a voice they hear (though not distinctly) sounding from heaven; and yet, nevertheless, Paul alone is taught what he must do." - This quote highlights the various elements of the miraculous event - the bright light, Paul's prostration, and the voice from heaven. It emphasizes that despite the shared experience, Paul alone received the specific instructions from God.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The words ‘stood speechless’ do not signify apparently that they stood erect, in distinction from lying prostrate, but that, overpowered with what they saw and heard, they were fixed, rooted as it were to the spot."
2. "The fact, which it was especially desired that the reader or hearer of this narration should be impressed with, was not that the ‘men stood’ or were ‘fallen to the ground,’ this detail is utterly unimportant, but that they were speechless and confounded."
3. "The companions of Saul heard the sound of the words, while in Paul’s account (chap. Acts 22:9) ‘his companions did not understand what was spoken;’ or in other words, Saul received a clear impression of what was being spoken, whilst those with him received only an indefinite one."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "That journeyed with him (ο συνοδευοντες αυτω). Not in the older Greek, but in the Koine, with the associative instrumental."
2. "Hearing the voice, but beholding no man (ακουοντες μεν της φωνησ, μηδενα δε θεωρουντες). Two present active participles in contrast (μεν, δε)."
3. "Instead of this being a flat contradiction of what Luke says in Acts 9:7 it is natural to take it as being likewise (as with the 'light' and 'no one') a distinction between the 'sound' and the separate words spoken."

### John Gill:
1. "Out of respect to him, to keep him company; or rather to assist him in his designs."
2. "They were as if they were thunderstruck, and fastened to the earth."
3. "They heard the voice of Saul, saying, who art thou? and what wilt thou have me to do? but saw nobody that he spoke to, which surprised them."

These quotes highlight the companions' intention to support Saul, their astonishment and inability to speak, and their confusion at hearing Saul's voice but not seeing anyone he was speaking to.

### John Wesley:
1. "The men...stood - Having risen before Saul; for they also fell to the ground." (Acts 26:14) 
2. "Hearing the noise - But not an articulate voice." (Acts 26:13) 
3. "And seeing the light, but not Jesus himself." (Acts 26:13)
