# Colossians 1:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Through the will of God, along with Timothy, and referred to as the brother, this verse introduces an Apostle of Jesus Christ who was not sent by men but by Christ Himself. This Apostle, whose authority and power were derived from God's will, addresses the recipients of the letter as faithful brethren, invoking a sense of kinship among the believers. The mention of Timothy as a brother, companion, fellow soldier, and fellow laborer exemplifies the close bond they share as partakers of the same grace and as members of God's family.

2. "Hence the Colossians seem to have associated him with Paul in their affections, and the apostle joins him with himself in the address."
3. "Neither, probably, had seen the Colossian Church but had seen, during their tour through Phrygia, individual Colossians, as Epaphras, Philemon, Archippus, and Apphia."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "There was a particular reason why Timothy should be associated with him in writing this Epistle."
2. "It is evident, however, from the manner in which Paul mentions him here, that he did not regard him as 'an apostle.'"
3. "Paul is careful never to apply the term 'apostle' to Timothy; Philippians 1:1."

1. "Χριστου Ιησου. This order in the later epistles shows that Χριστος is now regarded as a proper name and not just a verbal adjective (Anointed One, Messiah)."
2. "Paul describes himself because he is unknown to the Colossians, not because of attack as in Galatians 1:1."

1. "He calls himself an apostle 'of Jesus Christ'; not of men, he was not sent out by men, but by Christ, who appeared to him, made him a minister of his, gave him his Gospel by revelation, abundantly qualified him for the work, sent him forth unto the Gentiles, in whose name he went as an ambassador and messenger of his." 

2. "Into which office he came by the will of God; not by the will of men, for he derived no authority and power, nor received any doctrine from men; nor by his own will, of his own head, by any usurpation of his; he did not take this office upon him of himself, but was invested with it, according to the secret will and purpose of God, from everlasting."

3. "Timothy...whom he calls a 'brother'; partly because of the Christian relation he stood in to him, and them, they being all brethren, children of the same Father, partakers of the same grace of regeneration, belonging to the same family, and so should own and love one another as brethren; and partly and chiefly because of his being a brother, companion, fellow soldier, and a fellow labourer in the Gospel."
