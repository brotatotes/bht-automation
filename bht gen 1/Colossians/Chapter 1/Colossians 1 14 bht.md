# Colossians 1:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we find that our redemption is attained through Christ. It brings deliverance from sin, the law's curse, and bondage. Through Christ's blood, we obtain forgiveness of sins, which is the starting point of our redemption. His voluntary sacrifice reveals God's love, the great efficacy of His atonement, and the righteousness of God in bringing about our redemption. This redemption not only secures our forgiveness but also frees us from the dominion and power of Satan over us.

3. "The means by which this blessing is procured, is through his blood... Christ's shedding his blood freely on this account is a proof of his great love to his redeemed ones; the efficacy that was in it to answer this purpose shows the dignity and greatness of his person; and it not being to be effected without it, demonstrates the strictness of divine justice, and that the redemption of men is brought about in a way entirely consistent with the righteousness and holiness of God."
