# Colossians 1:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This Bible verse describes the unique and majestic role of Christ. He is the image of the invisible God, representing the perfections and essence of God to humanity. Christ's preeminence and eternal existence are emphasized, for he is the firstborn over all creation. As the firstborn, he holds the highest rank and authority, surpassing even the angels. In Christ, God is made visible, and through him, we can behold the glory and revelation of the Father.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1) "He is described, in His relation to God and His Creation, as the image of the invisible God."
2) "The first and simplest meaning is that of priority of birth. But a secondary and derived meaning of πρωτότοκος, as a designation of dignity and precedence, implied by priority, cannot be denied."
3) "Christ was not only first-born of His mother in the world, but first-begotten of His Father, before the worlds, and that He holds the rank, as compared with every created thing, of first-born in dignity."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "They who have experienced in themselves 'redemption' know Christ in the glorious character here described, as above the highest angels." 
2. "Image always supposes a prototype, which it not merely resembles, but from which it is drawn: the exact counterpart, as the reflection of the sun in the water: the child the living image of the parent." 
3. "Even before His incarnation He was the image of the invisible God, as the Word by whom God created the worlds, and by whom God appeared to the patriarchs."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The meaning is, that he represents to mankind the perfections of God, as an image, figure, or drawing does the object which it is made to resemble."
2. "In what respects particularly he was thus a representative of God, the apostle proceeds to state in the following verses, to wit, in his creative power, in his eternal existence, in his heirship over the universe, in the fulness that dwelt in him."
3. "The expression does not mean that he was 'begotten before all creatures,' as it is often explained, but refers to the simple fact that he sustains the highest rank over the creation."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Image is more than likeness which may be superficial and incidental. It implies a prototype, and embodies the essential verity of its prototype." 

2. "Of the invisible God [του θεου του αορατου] . Lit., of the God, the invisible. Thus is brought out the idea of manifestation which lies in image."

3. "The first-born of all creation. For first-born, see on Revelation 1:5; for creation, on 2 Corinthians 5:17. As image points to revelation, so first-born points to eternal preexistence."

### John Calvin:
1. "He calls him the image of the invisible God, meaning by this, that it is in him alone that God, who is otherwise invisible, is manifested to us."
2. "That, therefore, we may not receive anything but what is solid, let us take notice, that the term image is not made use of in reference to essence, but has a reference to us; for Christ is called the image of God on this ground — that he makes God in a manner visible to us."
3. "The sum is this — that God in himself, that is, in his naked majesty, is invisible, and that not to the eyes of the body merely, but also to the understandings of men, and that he is revealed to us in Christ alone, that we may behold him as in a mirror."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The image of the invisible God. This indicates the relation to God, immanent and permanent. On this relation rests the actual revelation of God in the Person of Christ." 
2. "The firstborn of (or, 'before') every creature (or, 'all creation'). 'The first born with respect to every creature; He was born before every creature. He is not the first created, the previous clause as well as the terms here chosen forbid such a view." 
3. "While His priority in time shows His independence of creation, creation is not independent of Him, as He is here described. In this relation of the Son to the Invisible God is to be found the ground or condition of the whole creation."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Jesus is the very stamp of God the Father as he was before the Incarnation and is now." 
2. "But the one who sees Jesus has seen God." 
3. "Paul is here refuting the Gnostics who pictured Christ as one of the aeons by placing him before 'all creation' (angels and men)."

### John Gill:
1. "Not of deity, though the fulness of it dwells in him; nor of himself, though he is the true God, and eternal life; nor of the Spirit, who also is God, and the Spirit of the Son; but the Father, called 'God', not to the exclusion of the Son or Spirit, who are with him the one God."
