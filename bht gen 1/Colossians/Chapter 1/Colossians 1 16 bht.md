# Colossians 1:16 Commentary Help Text

In this Bible verse, we are reminded that Christ is the creative force behind all existence. He is separate from the creation and superior to any angels or spiritual beings. Through Him, the universe was brought into being, and all things find their purpose and fulfillment in Him. This passage emphasizes that Christ is the ultimate source and sustainer of everything, and that His authority surpasses any other powers or dominions.

2. "The idea of the schoolmen, that in Christ was the 'idea omnium rerum,' adopted in the main by Schl., Neandor, and Olsh., is entirely unsupported by any views or expressions of our Apostle elsewhere."
3. "For Christian faith it remains fixed, and it is sufficient, that there is testimony borne to the existence of different degrees and categories in the world of spirits above; but all attempts more precisely to fix these degrees, beyond what is written in the N. T., belong to the fanciful domain of theosophy."

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "God revealed Himself in the Son, the Word of the Father, before all created existence."

3. "He is the final cause as well as the efficient cause."

### Albert Barnes:

2. "The passage is aimed at the angel-worship of the Colossians, showing that while they have been discussing the various grades of angels which fill the space between God and men, and depending on them as media of communion with God, they have degraded Christ who is above them all, and is the sole mediator."
3. "All things came to pass within the sphere of His personality and as dependent upon it. Here He appears as the mediating cause; through Him, as 1 Corinthians 8:6. Unto Him. All things, as they had their beginning in Him, tend to Him as their consummation, to depend on and serve Him."

### John Calvin:

2. "These all things are, as to the quality of them, distributed into visible and invisible, both in heaven and in earth: the visible things in heaven are the fowls that fly in the airy heaven, the sun, and moon, and stars in the starry heaven, and the bodies of those saints that have been either translated, or raised, in the third heaven."
3. "The apostle's sense is, that the angels, the invisible inhabitants of the upper world, are all created by Christ, let them be called by what names they will, that the Jews, or the false teachers, or any sort of heretics of those times thought fit to give them, whether they called them thrones or dominions, c."
