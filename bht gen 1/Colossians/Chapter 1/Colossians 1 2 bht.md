# Colossians 1:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the commentator highlights the significance of being addressed as "saints" and "brethren." The term "saints" signifies the believers' union with God, while "brethren" signifies their union with their fellow Christians. The use of these terms emphasizes the sense of spiritual connection and community among believers. It is a reminder that their faith is not merely an individual experience, but that they are part of a larger body of believers who share a special relationship with God and with one another.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "ἁγίοις should be taken (Mey.) as a substantive, not (De W.) with ἀδελφοῖς, in which case πιστοῖς, being already (as Mey.) presupposed in ἁγίοις, would be tame and superfluous."
2. "καὶ πιστοῖς ἀδελφοῖς ἐν χριστῷ seems to be a specifying clause, ‘viz. to the &c.:’ or perhaps added merely on account of the natural diplomatic character of an opening address."
3. "ἐν χριστῷ belongs closely to πιστοῖς ἀδελφοῖς or perhaps rather to ἀδελφοῖς alone, as Philippians 1:14; no article before ἐν χριστῷ being wanted, because no distinction between these and any other kind of brethren is needed the idea ἀδελφὸς - ἐν - χριστῷ being familiar."

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "As 'saints' implies union with God, so 'the faithful brethren' implies union with Christian men." [BENGEL]

2. "The Lord Jesus Christ" is supported by some oldest manuscripts, although it is omitted by others of equal antiquity. [BENGEL]

3. "Colosse" is written as "Colasse" in the oldest manuscripts. [BENGEL]

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Grace is the unmerited favor and kindness of God towards sinners. It is the divine influence upon the heart that is reflected in the life of a believer. This grace is not earned or deserved, but freely given by God."

2. "The greeting of 'grace be unto you' is not merely a polite salutation, but a powerful declaration of God's abundant love and mercy towards His people. It is a reminder that we are saved by grace alone, and that our salvation is not based on our own efforts or works."

3. "This greeting also serves as a reminder that grace is not a one-time event, but an ongoing experience in the life of a believer. It is the daily provision of God's strength, guidance, and forgiveness that enables us to live a life pleasing to Him."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The region is volcanic, and the earthquakes common to large portions of Asia Minor are here peculiarly severe."
2. "Fatal to vegetation, these incrustations spread like a stony shroud over the ground."
3. "The church at Colossae was the least important of any to which Paul's epistles were addressed."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Colossae was a city of Phrygia on the Lycus, the tributaries of which brought a calcareous deposit of a peculiar kind that choked up the streams and made arches and fantastic grottoes." 
2. "The church at Colossae was the least important of any to which Paul's epistles were addressed" (Vincent). 
3. "But he had no greater message for any church than he here gives concerning the Person of Christ."

### John Gill:
1. "The persons wrote unto are described as 'saints', or holy men; not by birth, for all are unholy and unclean by nature; nor by baptism, for that neither takes away sin, nor gives grace; nor merely externally, by an outward reformation; but by separation, being by an act of eternal election set apart for God, for holiness, and happiness."
2. "Being born of God, having him for their Father, and being of his household, and a part of the family in heaven and earth named of Christ, and heirs together of the grace of life, and of the heavenly glory."
3. "They were saints in him; they were chosen in him, and sanctified in him their head, and received all their holiness from him; they were brethren in him the firstborn of them; his God being their God, and his Father their Father; and had their faith and faithfulness from him, as well as it was exercised towards, and on him."

### John Wesley:
1. "The saints-This word expresses their union with God."
2. "And brethren — This, their union with their fellow-Christians."
