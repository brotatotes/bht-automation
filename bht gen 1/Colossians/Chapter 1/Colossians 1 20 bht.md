## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

2. "All creation subsists in Christ, all creation is therefore affected by His propitiation: sinful creation is strictly 'reconciled' from its enmity; sinless creation, comparatively distant from His unapproachable purity, is lifted into nearer participation of Him, and in this wider sense is reconciled."
3. "As long as that blood of reconciliation was not actually shed, which is opposed to the accusations of Satan, but was only in promise, Satan could plead his right against men before God day and night; hence he was in heaven till the ban on man was broken."

### Albert Barnes:
