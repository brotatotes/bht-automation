### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Being in time past alienated (ποτε οντας απηλλοτριωμενους). Periphrastic perfect passive participle (continuing state of alienation) of απαλλοτριοω, old word from Plato on, to estrange, to render αλλοτριος (belonging to another), alienated from God, a vivid picture of heathenism as in Romans 1:20-23."

"They were enemies to God, the true God, and were lovers and worshippers of idols; they were enemies to the being and perfections of God, as all men in a state of nature are; and more or less show it, by either denying there is a God, or wishing there was none, or fancying him to be such an one as themselves."
2. "They are enemies to Christ in one shape or another; either to his person, denying his proper deity, or real humanity; or to his offices, not hearkening to him as a prophet, trampling on his blood and sacrifice as a priest, and unwilling to have him to rule over them as a King."
3. "And this enmity to everything divine and good is seated 'in the mind'; the mind is not the object of this enmity, as some read the words, 'to the mind': for the mind of a carnal man is enmity itself against God; but it is the subject of it, where it has its chief place, and from whence it proceeds, and shows itself in evil actions."

### John Wesley:
1. "Actual alienation of affection makes habitual enmity."
2. "Both your understanding and your affections."
3. "Which continually feed and increase inward alienation from, and enmity to, God."
