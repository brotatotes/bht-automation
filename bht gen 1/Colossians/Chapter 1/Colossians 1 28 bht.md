## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "WE preach Christ not circumcision, not angel worship, not asceticism, as the source of this hope."
2. "warning every man, and teaching every man in all wisdom."
3. "that we may present every man perfect in Christ."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Warning" is connected with repentance, refers to one's conduct, and is addressed primarily to the heart.
2. "Teaching" is connected with faith, refers to doctrines, and is addressed primarily to the intellect.
3. Even one soul is of incalculable value. Each individual among them should be zealous for himself and his neighbor.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Our word warn is commonly used in the sense of cautioning against danger. The Greek word here means to put in mind; to admonish; to exhort. The idea of the apostle is, that he made it his great business to bring the offers of the gospel fairly before the mind of every man."
2. "Paul made it his business to instruct men, as well as to exhort them. Exhortation and warning are of little use where there is not sound instruction and a careful inculcation of the truth."
3. "Paul was anxious that no one to whom this gospel was preached should be lost. He believed it to be adapted to save every man; and as he expected to meet all his hearers at the bar of God, his aim was to present them made perfect by means of that gospel which he preached."

### John Calvin:
1. "It was not, however, without good reason that he had taken notice a little before, that Christ is the sum of that secret, that they might know that nothing can be taught that has more of perfection than Christ."
2. "He represents himself as the teacher of all men; meaning by this, that no one is so eminent in respect of wisdom as to be entitled to exempt himself from tuition."
3. "This expression is equivalent to his affirming that his doctrine is such as to conduct a man to a wisdom that is perfect, and has nothing wanting; and this is what he immediately adds, that all that shew themselves to be true disciples will become perfect."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Whom we set forth, or, 'announce,' not the word usually 'rendered preach.' 'We,' the preachers of the true gospel, in contrast with errorists."
2. "Admonishing every man, etc. This indicates the manner of their declarations respecting Christ."
3. "That we may present (at the day of Christâ€™s appearing) every man. 'Notice the emphatic triple repetition of every man, showing that the Apostle was jealous of even the least invasion, on the part of the false teachers, of those souls with whom he was put in charge."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Christ in you, the hope of glory."
2. "We proclaim... against the Gnostic depreciation of Christ."
3. "Warning about practice and teaching... about doctrine."
4. "That we may present... the final presentation to Christ."
5. "Perfect... mature and ripened Christians... fully developed."

### John Gill:
1. "Christ and him crucified, and salvation by him, were the subjects of the ministry of the apostles; on this they dwelt, and it was this which was blessed for the conversion of sinners, the edification of saints, the planting of churches, and the setting up and establishing the kingdom and interest of Christ."
2. "Showing sinners that they are unrighteous and unholy, that their nature is corrupt and impure, their best righteousness imperfect, and cannot justify them before God; that they stand guilty before him, and that destruction and misery are in all their ways; and therefore advise them to flee from the wrath to come, to the hope set before them in the Gospel."
3. "Teaching them to believe in Christ for salvation, to lay hold on his righteousness for justification, to deal with his blood for pardon, and with his sacrifice for the atonement of their sins; and to observe all things commanded by Christ, and to live soberly, righteously, and godly."

### John Wesley:
1. "Teaching the ignorant is an act of compassion and a duty for those who have knowledge. It is a way to uplift and empower others, helping them to grow in wisdom and understanding."
2. "Admonishing those who are already taught is a reminder that learning is a lifelong journey. Even those who have knowledge can benefit from correction and guidance, as it keeps them humble and open to further growth."
3. "In this verse, we see the importance of both teaching and admonishing. It is a call to share knowledge and wisdom, while also fostering a spirit of humility and continuous learning."
