## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Having heard." The language implies that he had only heard of, and not seen, them. Compare Romans 1:8, where like language is used of a Church which he had not at the time visited.
2. "Love... to all." The love mentioned here extends to both the absent and the present. 
3. "The absent, as well as those present." This emphasizes the inclusive nature of love, reaching out to those who are not physically present.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "This does not prove that Paul had never been at Colossae, or that he did not establish the church there... The meaning is, that he had heard of their faith at that time, or of their perseverance in faith and love." 
2. "It would seem that Paul had been informed that this was a character of their piety, that they had remarkable love for all who bore the Christian name." 
3. "Nothing could be more acceptable information respecting them to one who himself so ardently loved the church; and nothing could have furnished better evidence that they were influenced by the true spirit of religion."

### John Calvin:
1. "Having heard of your faith. This was a means of stirring up his love towards them, and his concern for their welfare, when he heard it that they were distinguished by faith and love."
2. "And, unquestionably, gifts of God that are so excellent ought to have such an effect upon us as to stir us up to love them wherever they appear."
3. "True love, therefore, will extend to mankind universally, because they all are our flesh, and created in the image of God, but in respect of degrees, it will begin with those who are of the household of faith."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Having heard. ‘After hearing,’ rather than, ‘since we heard,’ or, ‘because we heard.’" - This clarifies that the emphasis is on the action of hearing, indicating an active response to the message being shared.

2. "He is the sphere and object of the faith; comp. Ephesians 1:15." - This highlights the centrality of Jesus Christ in the believers' faith, emphasizing that their faith is not just a general belief but specifically directed towards Christ.

3. "The love which ye have to all the saints. The Italics of the E. V. are unnecessary, since the better supported reading gives ‘which ye have,’ thus emphasizing the fact that they possess it." - This points out that the love the believers have for all the saints is not just a theoretical concept, but something they actively possess and demonstrate in their relationships with others.

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Epaphras had told Paul." 
2. "No article is needed before εν as it is a closely knit phrase and bears the same sense as the objective genitive in Galatians 2:16."
3. "There is a real distinction here between εν (sphere or basis) and εις (direction towards), though they are often identical in idea."

### John Gill:
1. "Their faith in Christ; by which is not only meant their hearty assent to the whole doctrine of faith, concerning the person, offices, and grace of Christ, their soundness and steadfastness in it, and their sincere and constant profession of it; but the grace of faith in them, the operation of the Spirit of God in their souls." 

2. "The object of this grace are 'saints'; all men indeed are to be loved, and even our very enemies; and good is to be done to all, but especially to holy and good men, to the household of faith."

3. "It denotes both the grace of love itself, which is a fruit of the Spirit implanted in regeneration, and is an evidence of the new birth, and always is where true faith in Christ is, for faith works by it."
