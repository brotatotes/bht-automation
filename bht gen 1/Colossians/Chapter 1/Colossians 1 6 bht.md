# Colossians 1:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The word of the Lord, which is present among us, has not been confined to a specific region or people. It has been sent to all nations, bearing fruits of righteousness and growing abundantly in its reach. The Gospel's universal impact can be observed everywhere it is preached, producing salutary influences and resulting in genuine encounters with the grace of God. Its continuous growth and fruitfulness spread throughout the world, like a tree flourishing with both new growth and abundant fruit.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The expression παντὶ τῷ κόσμ . is no hyperbole, but the pragmatic repetition of the Lord’s parting command."
2. "The filling up would be, to insert καί after κόσμῳ as in rec. Then it would be, ‘which is present with you, as also in all the world, and καρπ . and αὐξ . (in all the world), as also among you.’"
3. "The figure is taken from a tree, whose καρποφορία does not exclude its growth: with corn, it is otherwise."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "He speaks of the word as a living person present among them."
2. "The Gospel should be preached to all nations, and not be limited, as the law was, to the Jews."
3. "The Gospel is bearing fruits of righteousness and growing in numbers of its converts throughout all the world."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It has not been confined to the Jews, or limited to the narrow country where it was first preached, but has been sent abroad to the Gentile world."
2. "The gospel was not without effect wherever it was preached. The same results were observable everywhere else as in Colossae, that it produced most salutary influences on the hearts and lives of those who received it."
3. "Ever since they had heard the gospel it had been producing among them abundantly its appropriate fruit, and that the same thing had also characterized it wherever it had been dispensed."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "In all the world. Hyperbolical. Compare Romans 1:8; 1 Thessalonians 1:8; Acts 17:6. Possibly with a suggestion of the universal character of the Gospel as contrasted with the local and special character of false Gospels."
2. "This would emphasize the continuous fruitfulness of the Gospel. The middle voice of the verb, of which this is the sole instance, marks the fruitfulness of the Gospel by its own inherent power."
3. "Not like those plants which exhaust themselves in bearing fruit. The external growth keeps pace with the reproductive energy."

### John Calvin:
1. "The faith of it does not, it is true, depend on its success, as though we should believe it on the ground that many believe it. Though the whole world should fail, though heaven itself should fall, the conscience of a pious man must not waver, because God, on whom it is founded, does nevertheless remain true."
2. "Is it a trivial or common aid to faith, to see accomplished before our eyes what the Prophets long since predicted as to the extending of the kingdom of Christ through all countries of the world?"
3. "For it is not enough to hold the term gospel, unless we know that this is the true gospel — what was preached by Paul and Epaphras."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "This refers directly to ‘the gospel.’"
2. "The figure is borrowed from a tree which both bears fruit and grows."
3. "'In truth' suggests more than 'truly,' pointing to the element in which they knew the grace of God."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The gospel was spreading all over the Roman Empire."
2. "The growing and the fruit-bearing go on simultaneously as always with Christians."
3. "They fully apprehended the grace of God and should be immune to the shallow vagaries of the Gnostics."

### John Gill:
1. "The Gospel is always in one place or another, and will be to the end of the world; but it is not always in the same place; but as yet it was not removed from Colosse; it was still with them in the external ministry of it, and it remained in their hearts in the powerful and comfortable experience of it."
2. "The Gospel of the kingdom was to be preached in all the world, for a witness to all nations, before the end of the Jewish state came, or before the destruction of Jerusalem."
3. "The graces of the Spirit, as faith, hope, love, repentance, humility, self-denial, with all the effects thereof, in new obedience, and a godly conversation, come from Christ, the green fir tree, and are produced by the Spirit, through the preaching of the Gospel."

### John Wesley:
1. "It bringeth forth fruit in all the world" - This highlights the universal impact of the Gospel, reaching every corner of the world where it is preached. 

2. "In every place where it is preached" - Emphasizes the widespread reach and effectiveness of the Gospel message, regardless of geographical boundaries. 

3. "Ye knew the grace of God in truth" - Indicates a deep and personal experience of God's grace, going beyond mere knowledge to a genuine encounter with His transformative power.
