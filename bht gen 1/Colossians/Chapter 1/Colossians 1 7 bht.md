# Colossians 1:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse describes a faithful and knowledgeable individual who played a crucial role in founding and ministering to the church in Colossae. This person, referred to as a "fellow servant" of Christ and an apostolic representative, had a deep friendship with the Apostle Paul. Epaphras, as he is likely known, had taught the Colossians the true gospel, proving instrumental in countering the teachings of false prophets. His dedication and service exemplify the unity, equality, and mutual support necessary for effectively spreading God's message.
