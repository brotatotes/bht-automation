# Colossians 1:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
"Love in the Spirit" is not merely a human emotion, but a love that is produced by the Holy Spirit. It is a love that flows from the nature of God Himself, sacrificial and unconditional. The Holy Spirit enables believers to love beyond their natural capacity, reflecting the character of Christ. It is a transformative love that draws others to Him and seeks the well-being of others, even those who may be difficult to love.
