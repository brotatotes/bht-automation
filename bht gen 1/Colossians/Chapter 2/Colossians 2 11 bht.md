# Colossians 2:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, commentators emphasize the spiritual nature of the circumcision mentioned. They highlight that believers have received the substance and reality represented by this rite. Baptism is seen as the sign and seal of the new life where the old sinful nature is put off. The circumcision of Christ refers to the cutting away of sin and the corruption of the heart through union with Him. This spiritual circumcision, not an outward ordinance, involves a complete putting away of the old self and a transformation through Christ's work in the heart.
