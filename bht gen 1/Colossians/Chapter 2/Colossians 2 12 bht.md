1. "The process itself of baptism is regarded as the burial of the former life: originally, perhaps, owing to the practice of immersion, which would most naturally give rise to the idea."
2. "The things represented by both figures belong to the essentials of the Christian life: the minor details of the sacrament which corresponded to them, may in different ages or climates be varied; but the spiritual figures remain."
3. "Faith is the hand by which we lay hold on Christ the Ark of our refuge."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

3. "Faith in God's mighty operation in raising again Jesus, is saving faith; and it is wrought in the soul by His same 'mighty working' whereby He 'raised Jesus from the dead'."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Buried with him in baptism - See the notes at Romans 6:4."
2. "Ye are risen with him - From the death of sin to the life of religion; Notes, Romans 6:4-5; compare the notes at Ephesians 2:5-6."

### John Gill:
1. "Christ having died for their sins, was laid in the grave, where he continued for a while, and then rose again; and as they were crucified with him, they were also buried with him, as their head and representative; and all their sins too, which he left behind him in the grave, signified by his grave clothes there."
2. "Baptism being performed by immersion, when the person baptized is covered with water, and as it were buried in it, is a very significant emblem of all this; it is a representation of the burial of Christ, and very fitly holds him forth to the view of faith in the state of the dead, in the grave, and points out the place where the Lord lay."
3. "Christ is risen from the dead as the head and representative of his people, and they are risen with him; and their baptism is also an emblem of his and their resurrection, being administered by immersion, in which way only this can be signified."

### John Wesley:
1. "The ancient manner of baptizing by immersion is as manifestly alluded to here, as the other manner of baptizing by sprinkling or pouring of water is." 
2. "No stress is laid on the age of the baptized, or the manner of performing it, but only on our being risen with Christ, through the powerful operation of God in the soul."
3. "It does not appear that in all this St. Paul speaks of justification at all, but of sanctification altogether."
