This verse speaks to the spiritual condition of humanity before being saved by Christ. We were dead in our sins, separated from God's covenant, indulging in worldly desires, and morally corrupt. But through Christ's resurrection, we are revived and given new life, symbolizing the transformative power of Jesus' sacrifice. The verse emphasizes the need for redemption, forgiveness, and the universal nature of God's forgiveness, reaching all sins past, present, and future. It also highlights the distinction between justification and sanctification in the Christian faith.

2. "Your not having put off the old fleshly nature, the carnal foreskin, or original sin, which now by spiritual circumcision, that is, conversion and baptism, you have put off."
3. "Our spiritual quickening proves that we have been forgiven our sins."

2. "The uncircumcision of your flesh." - This phrase is described as representing the sinful, carnal nature that is indicated by uncircumcision. It highlights the source of their trespasses and the need for spiritual transformation.

### John Calvin:
1. "Uncircumcision is the badge of alienation from God; for where the covenant of grace is not, there is pollution, and, consequently, curse and ruin."
2. "Hence it follows, that all wicked persons, however they may seem to themselves to be in the highest degree lively and flourishing, are, nevertheless, spiritually dead."
3. "He says that these were dead in sins: this is the cause, for our sins alienate us from God."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The phrase is then precisely as in Ephesians 2:1, where, however, ‘sins’ is added."
2. "This is the spiritual application of a literal fact. They were Gentiles, as such uncircumcised; this external condition fitly indicated their depraved, carnal condition."
3. "It is God who quickens; comp. Ephesians 2:5. The reference here is the same as in ‘raised with Him’ (Colossians 2:12), probably the future resurrection is slightly more prominent."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Being dead through your trespasses... a lapse or misstep as in Matthew 6:14; Romans 5:15-18; Galatians 6:1, can be still in the locative, though the instrumental makes good sense also." 
2. "The uncircumcision of your flesh was a symbol" (Abbott). Clearly so, "the uncircumcision" used merely in a metaphorical sense.
3. "Did he quicken together with him... apparently coined by Paul for this passage."

### John Gill:
1. "Sin had brought a death upon them in a moral sense, they were separated from God, as at death the body is from the soul, and so were alienated from the life of God, and consequently must be dead."
2. "They had lost the image of God, which consisted in knowledge, righteousness, and holiness; and were dead as to the understanding of what was good, as to their affections for it, or will and capacity to do it."
3. "Forgiveness of sin is not done by piecemeals, or at different times, or by divers acts, but is done at once, and includes sin past, present, and to come; and is universal, reaches to all sin, original and actual, before and after conversion; sins of thought, word, and action."

### John Wesley:
1. "Doubly dead to God, not only wallowing in trespasses, outward sins, but also in the uncircumcision of your flesh - A beautiful expression for original sin, the inbred corruption of your nature, your uncircumcised heart and affections."
2. "Quickened together with him — Making you partakers of the power of his resurrection."
3. "It is evident the apostle thus far speaks, not of justification, but of sanctification only."
