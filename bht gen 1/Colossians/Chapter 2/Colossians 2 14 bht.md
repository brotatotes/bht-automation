# Colossians 2:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse describes how Christ's sacrifice has freed believers from the condemnation of the law. Commentators emphasize that the law, with its burdensome requirements and accusations, serves as a bond against humanity and is against us. Christ's death has blotted out and cancelled this bond, erasing its remembrance and offering absolution. By nailing the law to the cross, Christ has abolished its decrees and freed believers from its condemnation. This verse highlights the transformative power of Christ's sacrifice in removing the burden of the law and providing redemption for sinners.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The law (including especially the moral law, wherein lay the chief difficulty in obeying) is abrogated to the believer, as far as it was a compulsory, accusing code." 
2. "The handwriting of ordinances is the whole law, the obligatory bond, under which all lay; the Jews primarily were under the bond, but they in this respect were the representative people of the world."
3. "Christ, by bearing the curse of the broken law, has redeemed us from its curse. In His person nailed to the cross, the law itself was nailed to it."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The burdensome requirements of the Mosaic law are abolished, and its necessity is superseded by the death of Christ."
2. "His death had the same effect, in reference to those ordinances, as if they had been blotted from the statute-book."
3. "The gospel contains nothing which is 'against,' or 'contrary to,' the true interest and happiness of any nation or any class of people."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The law is against us, because it comes like a taskmaster, bidding us do, but neither putting the inclination into our hearts nor the power into our hands."
2. "Law is against us, because the revelation of unfulfilled duty is the accusation of the defaulter, and a revelation to him of his guilt."

### John Calvin:
1. "He now says, that we have been freed from condemnation, in such a manner, that even the hand-writing is blotted out, that no remembrance of it might remain."
2. "This, therefore, is a truly theological reason for proving the abrogation of ceremonies, because, if Christ has fully redeemed us from condemnation, he must have also effaced the remembrance of the obligation, that consciences may be pacified and tranquil in the sight of God."
3. "The Son of God has not only by his death delivered us from the condemnation of death, but in order that absolution might be made more certain, he abrogated those ceremonies, that no remembrance of obligation might remain."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Having blotted out, i.e., erased or cancelled, since the tense is the same as ‘having forgiven.’ But it does not follow that this act is contemporaneous."
2. "The handwriting of ordinances, etc. The word ‘handwriting’ had the technical sense of a bond, obligating the signer against whom it was held."
3. "‘It was the law rather than Christ, which was slain and done away with on the cross, because He bore the curse of the law, took away its condemnation."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Having blotted out (εξαλειψας)... First aorist active participle of old verb εξαλειφω, to rub out, wipe off, erase... Often MSS. were rubbed or scraped and written over again... The bond written in ordinances that was against us (το καθ' ημων χειρογραφον τοις δογμασιν)." 

2. "Undoubtedly 'the handwriting in decrees' (δογμασιν, the Mosaic law, Ephesians 2:15) was against the Jews... but the Gentiles also gave moral assent to God's law written in their hearts (Romans 2:14). So Paul says 'against us' (καθ' ημων) and adds 'which was contrary to us' (ο ην υπεναντιον ημιν) because we (neither Jew nor Gentile) could not keep it."

3. "And he hath taken it out of the way (κα ηρκεν εκ του μεσου)... The perfect tense emphasizes the permanence of the removal of the bond which has been paid and cancelled and cannot be presented again. God has taken the bond against us 'out of the midst' (εκ του μεσου)."

4. "Nailing it to the cross (προσηλωσας αυτο τω σταυρω)... The victim was nailed to the cross as was Christ. 'When Christ was crucified, God nailed the Law to His cross' (Peake). Hence the 'bond' is cancelled for us."

### John Gill:
1. "Blotting out the handwriting of ordinances... cancelled and abolished by Christ."
2. "The whole law of Moses is intended, which was the handwriting of God... this book is of no force."
3. "Nailing it to his cross... so torn and rent, as to be of no force."

### John Wesley:
1. "Having blotted out...that Christ should come into the world to save sinners" - This highlights the purpose of Christ's coming into the world, to save sinners and offer them everlasting life.

2. "The handwriting against us...God's destroying the handwriting which was contrary to us" - The imagery of a debt being testified by handwriting emphasizes the guilt and enmity of our sins before God. Through Christ, God destroys this handwriting, freeing us from its burden.

3. "This was not properly our sins themselves, but their guilt and cry before God" - The commentary clarifies that it is not the sins themselves that are blotted out, but rather their guilt and cry before God. This distinction helps to deepen our understanding of God's forgiveness and redemption.
