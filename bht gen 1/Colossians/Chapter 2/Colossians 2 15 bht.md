## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The first seems to me to necessitate the rendering of ἀπεκδυσάμενος, not, as the great majority of Commentators, ‘having spoiled’ (ἀπεκδύσας), a meaning unexampled for the middle, and precluded by the plain usage, by the Apostle himself, a few verses below, ch. Colossians 3:9, of the same word ἀπεκδυσάμενοι, but ‘having put off,’ ‘divested himself of.’"
2. "Now the words have occurred before in this very passage, Colossians 2:10, where Christ is exalted as the κεφαλὴ πάσης ἀρχῆς κ. ἐξουσίας: and it is hardly possible to avoid connecting our present expression with that, seeing that in τὰς ἀρχὰς κ. τὰς ἐξουσίας the articles seem to contain a manifest reference to it."
3. "Thus God ἀπεξεδύσατο τὰς ἀρχὰς κ. τὰς ἐξουσίας divested Himself of, put off from Himself, that ἀγγέλων διαταγή, manifesting Himself henceforward without a veil in the exalted Person of Jesus."

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "God put off from Himself the angels, that is, their ministry, not employing them to be promulgators of the Gospel in the way that He had given the law by their 'disposition' or ministry."
2. "In the sacrifice of Jesus on the cross, God subjected all the principalities, c., to Jesus, declaring them to be powerless as to His work and His people."
3. "If 'in Him,' that is, Christ, be read, still the Cross will be the place and means of God's triumph in Christ over the principalities."

2. "The Saviour, by his death, wrested the dominion from them, and seized upon what they had captured as a conqueror seizes upon his prey."
3. "Christ, as a conqueror, dragged Satan and his legions at his triumphal car; compare Romans 16:20."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "God put off from himself, when the bond of the law was rendered void in Christ's crucifixion, that ministry of angels which waited on the giving of the law, revealing Christ as the sole mediator, the head of every principality and power."

3. "Even in the figure in 2 Corinthians, the captives rejoice in the triumph. Compare Revelation 19:11."

### John Calvin:

2. "For if our liberty is the spoil which Christ has rescued from the devil, what do others, who would bring us back into bondage, but restore to Satan the spoils of which he had been stript bare?"

2. "He led Satan and his principalities and powers captive, who had led others, as he passed through the air, the territories of the devil, in the sight of God and the holy angels."
