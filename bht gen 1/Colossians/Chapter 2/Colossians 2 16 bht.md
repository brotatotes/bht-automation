## BHT:
In this Bible verse, we are reminded not to be swayed by the judgments of others and their expectations. The commentaries discuss the freedom we have from religious restrictions and ceremonial laws. They emphasize that the essence of the Christian faith lies not in outward observances, but in internal righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit. It is a call to stand firm in our faith and not be burdened by unnecessary regulations imposed by others.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Let no one sit in judgment on you, or claim the right to decide for you in those matters. You are not responsible to man for your conduct, but to Christ; and no man has a right to impose that on you as a burden from which he has made you free."
2. "No one had a right to impose their observance on Christians, or to condemn them if they did not keep them. They had been delivered from that obligation by the death of Christ."
3. "There is no evidence from this passage that he would teach that there was no obligation to observe any holy time, for there is not the slightest reason to believe that he meant to teach that one of the ten commandments had ceased to be binding on mankind."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The allusions which follow (vers. 16 - 19) are to the practical and theoretical forms of the Colossian error, as in vers. 9 - 15; excessive ritualism, asceticism, and angelic mediation."
2. "The Mosaic law contained very few provisions concerning drinks... Hence it is probable that the false teachers had extended the prohibitions as to the use of wine to all Christians."

2. "Consider whether it may not be taken to mean separation, for those that make a distinction of days, separate, as it were, one from another. Such a mode of partition was suitable for the Jews, that they might celebrate religiously the days that were appointed, by separating them from others."
3. "I answer, that we do not by any means observe days, as though there were any sacredness in holidays, or as though it were not lawful to labor upon them, but that respect is paid to government and order — not to days."

"The Mosaic law had prohibitions respecting food alone...hence the Phrygian ascetics had probably gone beyond the law." - This quote highlights the fact that the ascetics in Colossae may have been imposing stricter dietary restrictions than what was required by the Mosaic law.

3. "The Lord’s Day is in a different position, has a fresh sanction, and should have its higher observance." - This statement emphasizes the importance of observing the Lord's Day, which is different from the Jewish Sabbath.
