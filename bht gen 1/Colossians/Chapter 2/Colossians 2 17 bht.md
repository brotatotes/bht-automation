# Colossians 2:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse being described emphasizes the superiority of Christ over the rituals and practices of the Old Testament. These practices were mere shadows, lacking true substance and fulfillment. Christ, on the other hand, is the body and the substance, the ultimate fulfillment and embodiment of all that these rituals symbolized. Through Christ, we are able to experience the blessings and realities that these rituals could only anticipate.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "the blessings of the Christian covenant: these are the substance, and the Jewish ordinances the mere type or resemblance, as the shadow is of the living man."
2. "the substantial blessings, which those legal observances typified, are attached to, brought in by, found in union with, Christ"
3. "if the ordinance of the Sabbath had been, in any form, of lasting obligation on the Christian Church, it would have been quite impossible for the Apostle to have spoken thus."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The blessings of the Christian covenant, the substance of which Jewish ordinances were but the type."
2. "The real substance (of the blessings typified by the law) belongs to Christ."
3. "The body is of Christ."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "They were only a dim outline of future things, not the reality."
2. "The reality, the substance. All that they signified is of or in Christ."
3. "Between those things themselves which are in Christ, and those which only represented or prefigured them, there is as much difference as there is between a body and a shadow; a solid substance and a mere outline."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The Mosaic ritual system was to the great verities of the Gospel what the shadow is to the man, a mere general type or resemblance."
2. "The body is Christ's. The substance belongs to the Christian economy."
3. "It is derived from Christ, and can be realized only through union with Him."

### John Calvin:
1. "For Christ is now manifested to us, and hence we enjoy him as being present."
2. "The man that calls back the ceremonies into use, either buries the manifestation of Christ, or robs Christ of his excellence, and makes him in a manner void."
3. "The representation of Christ under the law was unpolished, and was, as it were, a first sketch, but in our sacraments it is seen drawn out to the life."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The whole system of prohibitions and festivals has a typical significance, pointing to 'the things to come,' namely, the new dispensation."
2. "The reality of these observances is found in the new dispensation."
3. "In this substantial reality there is a place for the Lord's Day, which is 'now to be a season of loftier joy, as it commemorates a more august event than either the creation of the universe, or the exodus from Egypt'."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "A shadow (σκια). Old word, opposed to substance (σωμα, body)."
2. "The σωμα (body) casts the σκια (shadow) and so belongs to Christ (Χριστου, genitive case)."
3. "In Hebrews 10:1 σκια is distinguished from εικων (picture), but here from σωμα (body, substance)."

### John Gill:
1. "The different 'meats and drinks', clean and unclean, allowed or forbidden by the law, were emblems of the two people, the Jews and Gentiles, the one clean, the other unclean."

5. "The 'sabbaths' were also shadows of future things...the seventh day sabbath was a type of that spiritual rest we have in Christ now, and of that eternal rest we shall have with him in heaven hereafter."

### John Wesley:
1. "The verse highlights the superiority of Christ over the Old Testament rituals and practices, which were merely a shadow of what was to come." 
2. "The phrase 'lifeless shadow' emphasizes the emptiness and lack of true substance in the Old Testament practices, in contrast to the fullness and reality found in Christ." 
3. "By referring to Christ as the 'body' and the 'substance,' the verse emphasizes that he is the fulfillment and embodiment of all that the Old Testament rituals pointed towards."
