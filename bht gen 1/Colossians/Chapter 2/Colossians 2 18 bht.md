# Colossians 2:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the commentators warn against false teachers who seek to deceive and defraud believers of the great reward that awaits them. These teachers, under the guise of humility and devotion, promote the worship of angels and elevate themselves as judges over the believers' future reward. Their actions, however, are rooted in self-interest and pride, rather than genuine humility. True humility, in contrast, is a virtue that adorns believers and leads them to approach God directly, free from any idolatrous or self-serving practices.
