## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "There is an ascending climax of superstitious prohibitions."
2. "The first Greek word (hapse) is distinguished from the third (thiges), in that the former means close contact and retention: the latter, momentary contact."
3. "The three refer to meats. 'Handle not' (a stronger term than 'nor even touch'), 'nor taste' with the tongue, 'nor even touch,' however slight the contact."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The rapid succession of the words here, without any connecting particle, is supposed to denote the eagerness of the persons who imposed this injunction, and their earnestness in warning others from contaminating themselves with the prohibited things."
2. "Perhaps there was at Colossae a society of this kind, as there were in many other places out of Judea; and, if there was, it is not improbable that many Christians imitated them in the uniqueness of their rules and observances."
3. "These words are often used as a kind of motto in reference to the use of intoxicating drinks. They express very well what is held by the friends of total abstinence; but it is obvious that they had no such reference as used by the apostle."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Touch is properly to fasten one's self to or cling to." 
2. "To get hands on so as to injure." 
3. "Handle comes, perhaps, as near as any other, especially in its sense of treatment, as when we say that a speaker or writer handles a subject; or that a man is roughly handled by his enemies."

### John Calvin:
1. "Paul points out, (μιμητικῶς,) by way of imitation, to what length the waywardness of those who bind consciences by their laws is wont to proceed."
2. "When persons have once taken upon them to tyrannize over men’s souls, there is no end of new laws being daily added to old ones, and new enactments starting up from time to time."
3. "Hence Paul acts admirably well in admonishing us that human traditions are a labyrinth, in which consciences are more and more entangled; nay more, are snares, which from the beginning bind in such a way that in course of time they strangle in the end."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The climax is reached in 'do not even touch.'" 
2. "The prohibitions are specific in form, and refer to certain kinds of food and drink."
3. "This series of condemned prohibitions cannot be used in support of total abstinence from intoxicating liquors, except through culpable ignorance or dishonesty."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "The Essenes took the Mosaic regulations and carried them much further and the Pharisees demanded ceremonially clean hands for all food."
2. "Even today men are finding that the noble prohibition law needs enlightened instruction to make it effective."
3. "The Pharisees, Essenes, Gnostics made piety hinge on outward observances and rules instead of inward conviction and principle."

### John Gill:
1. "Touch not, taste not, handle not." - The apostle is quoting the Jewish doctors who emphasized the observance of the ceremonial law and added their own decrees and constitutions.

2. "There is a treatise in their Misna, called Oholot, which gives many rules, and is full of decrees about things 'that defile by touching'." - The Jewish doctors had detailed regulations regarding what could defile a person through touch. This demonstrates the extent to which they emphasized purity and avoidance of anything that could potentially make them unclean. 

3. "Some think that these several rules have respect only to meats... Others think that touch not regards abstinence from women." - There are different interpretations of the meaning behind these rules. Some believe they solely pertain to dietary restrictions, while others suggest they may also involve abstaining from certain relationships or practices. This highlights the complexity and varying perspectives on the interpretation of these rules.

### John Wesley:
1. "Touch not - An unclean thing." This phrase emphasizes the importance of avoiding impurity and defilement. It serves as a reminder to stay away from anything that may taint one's spiritual purity.
