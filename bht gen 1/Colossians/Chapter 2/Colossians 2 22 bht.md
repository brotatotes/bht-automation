# Colossians 2:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse being described here emphasizes that certain customs and practices, such as dietary restrictions, are ultimately inconsequential and transitory. These regulations originate from human traditions rather than divine authority and hold no lasting significance. The use of perishable items and observance of temporary ordinances cannot bring true righteousness or eternal life. Instead, the focus should be on matters of the soul and the enduring principles of true worship and faith.
