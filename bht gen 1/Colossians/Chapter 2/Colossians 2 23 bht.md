# Colossians 2:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, there is a warning against false worship and empty religious practices. Some individuals may present themselves as exceptionally devout and spiritual, going beyond what is required, but in reality, they are focused on their self-interests rather than God's will. They engage in asceticism and external displays of piety, but these actions lack true substance and do not lead to genuine transformation of the heart. Ultimately, their actions only serve to satisfy the desires of the flesh and promote self-importance rather than a genuine connection with God.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "This 'voluntary worship' is the counterpart to their 'voluntary humility': both specious in appearance, the former seeming in religion to do even more than God requires, but really setting aside God's will for man's own."
2. "Not paying any of that 'honor' which is due to the body as redeemed by such a price as the blood of Christ. We should not degrade, but have a just estimation of ourselves, not in ourselves, but in Christ."
3. "While seeming to deny self and the body, they really are pampering the flesh. Thus 'satisfying of the flesh' answers to 'puffed up by his fleshly mind', so that 'flesh' is used in its ethical sense, 'the carnal nature' as opposed to the 'spiritual'; not in the sense, 'body'."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "By our prayers and sympathy, we may often do much good to those whom we shall never see until we meet them in heaven." 
2. "We should be on our guard against the seductive arts of false teachers." 
3. "Our views of the 'mystery of God' - of the divine nature, and especially of the rank and character of Christ, will determine all our views of theology."

### John Calvin:
1. "For it should be a settled point among all the pious, that the worship of God ought not to be measured according to our views; and that, consequently, any kind of service is not lawful, simply on the ground that it is agreeable to us."
2. "We owe to God such humility as to yield obedience simply to his commands, so as not to lean to our own understanding."
3. "The zeal of men, therefore, for superstition is surpassingly mad, which could not be restrained by so plain a declaration of God from breaking forth, as historical records testify."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Which things... have indeed a show of wisdom, have the reputation of wisdom, but lack the reality." 
2. "Ascetic rules cannot restrain these desires."
3. "Asceticism degenerates into mere mechanical morality, casuistic hair-splitting about the divine law, an externalizing of self-discipline and self-exertion, a stirring up of spiritual pride."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "These ascetic regulations have indeed a show of wisdom." 
2. "Clearly here the bad sense, 'in mock humility.'"
3. "Ascetics often practice flagellations and other hardnesses to the body."

Note: The commentary provides insights into the meaning of certain words and phrases in the Bible verse, highlighting the negative aspects of asceticism and emphasizing the limitations of mere rules in guiding human conduct.

### John Gill:
1. "Their pretensions to it lay in the following things, in will worship; being what was over and above that which was commanded by God, and so, like the freewill offerings under the law, must be acceptable to him; this was one of their colours, which had some show of wisdom, religion, and zeal."
2. "In worshipping of angels, and not coming directly, and with boldness, to God or Christ; or rather in subjecting themselves to the yoke of the law, and submitting to the decrees of the fathers and doctors of the church, who were more wise, and learned, and knowing than they, and so had the appearance of prudence, gentleness, and goodness."
3. "And neglecting of the body; by fastings and watchings, whereby they seemed to be very religious and devout, holy and mortified persons, who kept under their bodies, subdued their unruly appetites, and fulfilled not the lusts of the flesh: but then this was only a show of wisdom and godliness; there was no truth nor reality in these things; they were only a mere form, an outside show, a mere pretence."

### John Wesley:
1. "Not sparing the body â€” Denying it many gratifications, and putting it to many inconveniences."
2. "Yet they are not of any real value before God, nor do they, upon the whole, mortify, but satisfy, the flesh."
3. "They indulge our corrupt nature, our self-will, pride, and desire of being distinguished from others."
