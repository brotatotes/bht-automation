# Colossians 2:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this passage, the commentators warn against being deceived by persuasive words and deceitful reasoning that may lead one astray from the truth revealed in Christ. The sufficiency and simplicity of the knowledge of Christ should be upheld, rather than being enticed by empty and illusive arguments. By remaining rooted in Christ and not pursuing alternative sources of wisdom, one can avoid falling into the trap of deceptive doctrines, which may seem plausible but lack substance. The emphasis is on the importance of discerning the true wisdom and not being swayed by clever rhetoric or attractive falsehoods.
