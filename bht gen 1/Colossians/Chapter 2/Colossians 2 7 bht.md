### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Rooted (ερριζωμενο). Perfect passive participle of old verb ριζοω from ριζα, root. In N.T. only here and Ephesians 3:17. Paul changes the figure from walk to growing tree."
2. "Builded up in him (εποικοδομουμενο εν αυτω). Present passive participle (rooted to stay so) of εποικοδομεω, old verb, to build upon as in 1 Corinthians 3:10; 1 Corinthians 3:12. The metaphor is changed again to a building as continually going up (present tense)."
