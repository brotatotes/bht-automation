# Colossians 2:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Beware of being led astray by the empty deceit of false philosophy that seeks to plunder and rob you of your faith in Christ. This warning is specifically directed against a mixture of Jewish, Oriental, and Gnostic philosophies that deviate from the truth. Do not be deceived by plausible arguments and traditions that elevate human wisdom above the knowledge of Christ and His Gospel. Instead, guard yourselves against teachings that promote materialism over spirituality and prioritize elements of worldly wisdom rather than Christ as the ultimate measure of truth.
