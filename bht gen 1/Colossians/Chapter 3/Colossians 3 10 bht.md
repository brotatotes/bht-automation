# Colossians 3:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The renewed soul is described as a "new man" that is in the continuous process of being renewed and transformed. This renewal involves both a deepening knowledge of God and a conscious decision to clothe oneself with the character of Christ. It is not simply about acquiring information, but rather about cultivating a personal and intimate relationship with God in order to align one's thoughts and actions with His truth. This pursuit of knowledge leads to spiritual growth and a greater ability to live according to God's purposes.
