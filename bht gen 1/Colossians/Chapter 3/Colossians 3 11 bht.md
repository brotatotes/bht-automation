# Colossians 3:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Bible verse being described is one that emphasizes the unity and equality found in Christ, where all distinctions and privileges based on race, nation, or social status are obliterated. Commentators highlight that in the new creation, these distinctions are no longer relevant, as Christ encompasses and permeates all aspects of life. They emphasize that external factors have no bearing on one's salvation or status as a new creature in Christ. Ultimately, Christ is the source of perfection, unity, and all that is needed for justification, sanctification, and glorification.
