# Colossians 3:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Beloved and chosen, as part of the Christian body, we are called to manifest compassion, kindness, and forgiveness towards one another. This renewal by Christ is evidenced by our merciful and kind hearts, stemming from an earnest affection within us. As we imitate God's love and embrace true humility, we bear the virtues of the new man in Christ, clothing ourselves with a heart of compassion, kindness, humility, meekness, and long-suffering. Bearing in mind our election and holiness, we embrace these virtues as reflections of God's superior love.

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Election from eternity precedes sanctification in time; the sanctified, feeling God's love, imitate it."

3. "True 'lowliness of mind'; not the mock 'humility' of the false teachers."

### Albert Barnes:

3. "As, however, it frequently happens, that we come in contact with wicked and ungrateful men, there is need of patience, that it may cherish mildness in us."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "For although the putting on of the new man as a fact, has historically occurred through the conversion to Christ, yet it has, according to the nature of the new man, its continued acts, which should occur, namely, through the appropriation of those virtues, which the new man as such must possess." (Meyer)
2. "The consciousness of this extraordinary privilege, of being the elect of God, who as such are holy and beloved of God how it must have affected the conscience of the readers and aroused them to the very virtues, corresponding with so high a position, which Paul here enjoins." (Meyer)
