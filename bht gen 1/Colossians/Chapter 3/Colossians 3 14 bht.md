# Colossians 3:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, commentators speak of a love that goes beyond ordinary affection. They emphasize that this love is not just an additional virtue but the very essence that completes and holds together all other virtues. It is described as the crowning grace, the bond of perfectness, and the principle that drives and exercises all other Christian graces. This love, referred to as the love of God, is the ultimate authority in our hearts, unifying believers as members of one body and adding glory, lustre, and beauty to their lives.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Over all these things (put on) love, which thing is the bond of perfectness." - The article gives a fine and delicate sense here, which we cannot express. ἡ ἀγάπη is not merely love, but ‘the (well-known) love which becomes Christians.'

2. "This completes and keeps together all the rest, which, without it, are but the scattered elements of completeness." - Love is the bond that holds everything together and makes it complete.

3. "Let Christ’s peace rule in your hearts, to which ye were also called in one body." - The peace of Christ should be the ultimate authority in our hearts, as we are called to live in unity as members of one body.

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Charity, which is the crowning grace, covering the multitude of others' sins, must overlie all the other graces enumerated."
2. "Seeming graces, where love is wanting, are mere hypocrisy."
3. "Love and its works 'perfect,' that is, manifest the full maturity of faith developed."
4. "Love...be ye perfect...If we love one another, God's love is perfected in us."
5. "Keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Love will bind all the other graces fast together, and render the whole system complete."
2. "Without love, though there might be other graces and virtues, there would be a want of harmony and compactness in our Christian graces."
3. "If it were possible to conceive that the other graces could exist among a Christian people, yet there would be a sad incompleteness, a painful want of harmony and union, if love were not the reigning principle."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Charity. See on 1 Corinthians 13:1." 
2. "Love embraces and knits together all the virtues." 
3. "Teleiothv perfectness is a collective idea, a result of combination, to which bond is appropriate."

### John Calvin:
1. "For as all the things that he has hitherto enumerated flow from love, he now on good grounds exhorts the Colossians to cherish love among themselves, for the sake of these things — that they may be merciful, gentle, ready to forgive, as though he had said, that they would be such only in the event of their having love."
2. "For this truly is the rule of our whole life, and of all our actions, so that everything that is not regulated according to it is faulty, whatever attractiveness it may otherwise possess."
3. "The genuine exposition of the passage is this — that other things will be in a desirable state as to our life, if love be exercised among us."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Above all these things. Not simply 'in addition to,' nor 'above all,' in the colloquial sense, but 'over' as one puts on an outer garment or girdle, this figure being still in mind."
2. "Love, lit, 'the love,' that well known Christian grace, described by the Apostle in 1 Corinthians 13:0."
3. "Love binds together into one moral perfection all the Christian graces. 'Bond' is not = sum total, nor is the phrase = perfect love, nor to be explained as love which is the distinctive feature of perfection."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "And above all these things... Put on love." 
2. "The bond of perfectness... the girdle that holds the various garments together." 
3. "In a succinct way Paul has here put the idea about love set forth so wonderfully."

### John Gill:
1. "Without love, all other virtues are nothing but show and hypocrisy."
2. "Love is the principle that drives and exercises all other virtues."
3. "Love adds a glory, lustre, and beauty to all other virtues."
