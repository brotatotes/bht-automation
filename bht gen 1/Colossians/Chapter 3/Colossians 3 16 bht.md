# Colossians 3:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Let the word of Christ, the Gospel word by which you have been called, dwell in you richly in all wisdom. This rich indwelling of the word of Christ will show itself in the overflow of praise and instruction, as the mouth gives utterance to hymns and psalms imbued with truth. It is through the dwelling of the word in you that it becomes a source of wisdom, teaching, and admonishment, enriching your heart and guiding your communications for edification.

1. "The word of Christ. The only occurrence of the phrase. The word spoken by Christ." 
2. "The participles teaching and admonishing are used as imperatives."
3. "A psalm was originally a song accompanied by a stringed instrument. The idea of accompaniment passed away in usage, and the psalm, in New - Testament phraseology, is an Old - Testament psalm, or a composition having that character."

### John Calvin:
1. "For, unquestionably, Paul here addresses men and women of all ranks; nor would he simply have them take a slight taste merely of the word of Christ, but exhorts that it should dwell in them; that is, that it should have a settled abode, and that largely, that they may make it their aim to advance and increase more and more every day."
2. "Teaching is taken here to mean profitable instruction, which tends to edification... This is the true use of Christ’s word."

1. "The word of Christ. This precise phrase only here, though 'the word of the Lord' in 1 Thessalonians 1:8; 1 Thessalonians 4:15; 2 Thessalonians 3:1. Elsewhere 'the word of God.' Paul is exalting Christ in this Epistle."
