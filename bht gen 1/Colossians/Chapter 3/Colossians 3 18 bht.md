# Colossians 3:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the duty of wives to submit to their husbands is described as an act of voluntary yielding and support, akin to the obedience soldiers demonstrate to their generals. However, this does not imply oppression or passivity, but rather a willing choice to honor and respect the God-given authority of the husband. Submission is not a sign of weakness, but a display of strength and trust in God's design for marriage.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The verb is in the imperfect as ἔδει and χρῆν, conveying always in its form a slight degree of blame, as implying the non-realization of the duty pointed out just as when we say, ‘It was your duty to,’ &c."

### Albert Barnes:

2. "The call for wives to submit is not a call for blind obedience or the suppression of their individuality, but rather a call to honor and respect the God-given authority of their husbands."
3. "Submission is not a one-sided command, but a mutual responsibility within the context of a loving and sacrificial relationship. Husbands are called to love their wives as Christ loved the church, which means laying down their lives for their wives."
4. "Submission is ultimately an act of trust in God's design for marriage, recognizing that both husbands and wives have unique roles and responsibilities that, when embraced with humility and love, can lead to a flourishing and harmonious relationship."

### Marvin Vincent:

2. "The past tense perhaps implies an essential a priori obligation."
3. "Connect with is fitting, and compare well-pleasing in the Lord, ver. 20."

### John Calvin:
1. "He commands wives to be subject. This is clear, but what follows is of doubtful signification — as it is fit in the Lord. For some connect it thus — 'Be subject in the Lord, as it is fit.' I, however, view it rather differently, — As it is fit in the Lord, that is, according to the appointment of the Lord, so that he confirms the subjection of wives by the authority of God."
2. "He requires love on the part of husbands, and that they be not bitter, because there is a danger lest they should abuse their authority in the way of tyranny."
3. "In handling these it were superfluous to take up many words, inasmuch as I have already stated in the Epistle to the Ephesians almost everything that was necessary."

### Philip Schaff:

2. "Hence the submission is to be a loving one, with a Christian motive."
3. "As if fitting (as it should be) in the Lord. This means: as should be the case, in consequence of the fellowship with Jesus Christ."

### Archibald T Robertson:

2. "Obedience in government is essential as the same word shows in Romans 13:1; Romans 13:5."
3. "Wives have rights and privileges, but recognition of the husband's leadership is essential to a well-ordered home, only the assumption is that the husband has a head and a wise one."

### John Gill:
1. "Subjection of wives to their own husbands is 'fit' and proper in its own nature, by reason of the original creation of man, and of the woman from him."
2. "Moreover, the woman was made for the man, and not the man for the woman; add to this, that the woman was in the transgression, and the means of the fall of man, which gave a fresh reason for, and made the obligation to subjection to him the stronger."
3. "It is what is fitting 'in the Lord': it is what he requires, not only what the law of God requires... but is what is commanded by Christ under the Gospel dispensation, and is to be observed by all those that are 'in' him."
