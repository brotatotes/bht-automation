2. "Obedience to parents is not just about blindly following orders, but it is an act of respect and honor. It is a recognition of the authority and wisdom that parents possess, and a willingness to submit to their guidance and instruction."

3. "The responsibility of parents is not just to demand obedience, but to nurture and train their children in the ways of the Lord. This involves teaching them God's commandments, modeling godly behavior, and providing a loving and secure environment for them to grow."

### John Calvin:
1. "But what if parents should feel disposed to constrain them to anything that is unlawful; will they in that case, too, obey without any reservation? Now it were worse than unreasonable, that the authority of men should prevail at the expense of neglecting God." (458)

2. "Obedience must be rendered not merely to just commands, but also to such as are unreasonable. For many make themselves compliant with the wishes of their parents only where the command is not grievous or inconvenient." (460)

3. "In all things, therefore, that they may not refuse anything, however difficult or disagreeable — in all things, that in things indifferent they may give deference to the station which their parents occupy — in all things, that they may not put themselves on a footing of equality with their parents, in the way of questioning and debating, or disputing, it being always understood that conscience is not to be infringed upon." (461)
