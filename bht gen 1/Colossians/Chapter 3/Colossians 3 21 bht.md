2. "In ἵνα μὴ ἀθ., it is assumed that the result of such irritation will be to cause repeated punishment, and so eventual desperation, on the part of the child."
3. "Wetst. quotes from Æneas Tacticus, ὀργῇ δὲ μηθένα μετιέναι τῶν τυχόντων ἀνθρώπων · ἀθυμότεροι γὰρ εἶεν ἄν."

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "By perpetual fault-finding 'children' are 'discouraged' or 'disheartened.'" 
2. "A broken-down spirit is fatal to youth." 
3. "It is a different Greek verb, therefore translate here, 'irritate not.'"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Children should not be flattered, but they should be encouraged."
2. "They should not be so praised as to make them vain and proud, but they should be commended when they do well."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Provoke to anger" - This phrase suggests that there is a deliberate action involved in stirring up negative emotions in others. It implies an intention to incite a negative response.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Provoke not your children; or, ‘do not irritate your children.’ ‘To anger’ is an unnecessary addition; the term used in Ephesians is different. Severe, unjust, capricious treatment is forbidden."
2. "That they be not disheartened; this is the certain result of such treatment. Bengel: ‘a broken spirit, the bane of youth.’ The child feels: I can never satisfy my father. Affection and confidence are destroyed, or at least cease to act as motives."
3. "Obedience becomes soulless, and the child loses its moral discrimination, and finally becomes reckless. The history of too many brought up in nominally Christian families."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Provoke not (μη ερεθιζετε). Present imperative of old verb from ερεθω, to excite. Only twice in N.T., here in bad sense, in good sense in 2 Corinthians 9:2 (to stimulate). Here it means to nag and as a habit (present tense)."

2. "That they be not discouraged (ινα μη αθυμωσιν). Negative purpose (ινα μη) with the present subjunctive (continued discouragement) of αθυμεω, old verb, but only here in N.T., from αθυμος (dispirited, α privative, θυμος, spirit or courage)."

3. "One does not have to read Jane Eyre or Oliver Twist to know something of the sorrows of childhood as is witnessed by runaway children and even child suicides."
