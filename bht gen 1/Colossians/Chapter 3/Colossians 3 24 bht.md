# Colossians 3:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, believers are encouraged to find their ultimate reward in Christ, rather than in the praise or recognition of others. The inheritance they receive is not earned through good works, but is a gift of God's grace. This inheritance is described as the full recompense for their present privations, a heavenly glory that is eternal and reserved for them. By serving the Lord Christ faithfully, believers will be treated as His children and will possess this eternal reward.
