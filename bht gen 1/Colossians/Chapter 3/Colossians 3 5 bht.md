# Colossians 3:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, believers are urged to put to death their sinful desires and corrupt tendencies. This involves denying and abstaining from these vices, recognizing that they are remnants of our old selves before we were spiritually united with Christ. The apostle Paul specifically mentions sins such as fornication, uncleanness, and covetousness, highlighting their destructive nature and their opposition to a life dedicated to God. By actively putting these sinful desires to death, believers can experience true spiritual transformation and live in obedience to God's will.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Follow out to its necessary consequence the fact of your having once for all died with Christ spiritually at your regeneration, by daily 'deadening your members,' of which united 'the body of the sins of the flesh' consists."
2. "Habitually repress and do violence to corrupt desires of which the members are the instruments."
3. "Covetousness—marked off by the Greek article as forming a whole genus by itself, distinct from the genus containing the various species just enumerated. It implies a self-idolizing, grasping spirit; far worse than another Greek term translated 'the love of money'."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Mortify therefore your members - Since you are dead to sin and the world, and are to appear with Christ in the glories of his kingdom, subdue every carnal and evil propensity of your nature."
2. "The word mortify means to put to death... and the meaning here is that they were entirely to subdue their evil propensities, so that they would have no remains of life; that is, they were not at all to indulge them."
3. "And covetousness, which is idolatry - It is remarkable that the apostle always ranks covetousness with these base and detestable passions... That it secures the affections which properly belong to God, and is, therefore, idolatry."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Mortify is used in its literal sense of put to death." 
2. "The physical members, so far as they are employed in the service of sin."
3. "Fornication, etc. In apposition with members, denoting the modes in which the members sinfully exert themselves."

### John Calvin:
1. "He conceives of our nature as being, as it were, a mass made up of different vices. They are, therefore, our members, inasmuch as they in a manner stick close to us." 
2. "He intimates, however, that we are earthly, so long as the vices of our flesh are vigorous in us, and that we are made heavenly by the renewing of the Spirit." 
3. "To these is added, πάθος that is, lust, which includes all the allurements of unhallowed desire."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Kill once for all, is the thought of the original" - The command to put to death our sinful desires is not a temporary or partial action, but a complete and permanent eradication.
2. "The putting to death is to be understood in an ethical, not in a physical sense" - The command to put to death our sinful desires is not about physically harming ourselves, but about actively resisting and overcoming them in our thoughts and actions.
3. "There is an intimate connection between sins of lust and sins of greed" - Lust and greed both stem from a longing for worldly satisfaction and can be seen as forms of idolatry, where we prioritize and worship material desires over God.

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Paul boldly applies the metaphor of death... to the actual life of the Christian."
2. "He is not to go to the other Gnostic extreme of license on the plea that the soul is not affected by the deeds of the body."
3. "Paul's idea is that the body is the temple of the Holy Spirit."

### John Gill:
1. "Mortify therefore your members...of the body of sin, indwelling sin...and signify a denial of them, an abstinence from them, and a non-performance of them."
2. "These members, or deeds of the body, or acts of sin, are called 'your'...and are concerned about earthly things, the things of the world, worldly lusts and pleasures."
3. "Fornication; the sin of uncleanness committed by single persons, or out of the state of marriage...and should be abstained from, and never committed by those who profess to be alive unto God."
4. "Uncleanness; of every sort, all other impure actions...should be abstained from, and never committed by those who profess to be alive unto God."
5. "Covetousness; an immoderate love of money, the root of all evil...and is enlarged as hell, and as death is not satisfied, but still craves more, without making any good use of what is possessed."

### John Wesley:
1. "Put to death, slay with a continued stroke."
2. "Every passion which does not flow from and lead to the love of God."
3. "Covetousness...means the desire of having more, or of anything independent on God."
