# Colossians 3:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Before their transformation, the Ephesians lived in and walked according to sinful desires and behaviors. These vices were a common part of their pagan culture. However, when they turned to Christ, they left behind their former sinful ways and embraced a new life. The distinction between living and walking emphasizes that their conversion was both an internal change of heart and an external change in actions. Through their faith in Christ, they were no longer defined by their past sins but were made new.
