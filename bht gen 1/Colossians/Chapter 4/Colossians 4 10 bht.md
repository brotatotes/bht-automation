## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "συναιχμάλωτος belongs to the same image of warfare as συνστρατιώτης." 
2. "ἀνεψιός, meaning that ἀνεψιοί are sons of brothers, i.e. cousins."
3. "What these commands were, must be left in entire uncertainty."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The Greek for 'fellow prisoner' is literally, fellow captive, an image from prisoners taken in warfare, Christians being 'fellow soldiers', whose warfare is 'the good fight of faith.'" 
2. "The relationship naturally accounts for Barnabas' selection of Mark as his companion when otherwise qualified; and also for Mark's mother's house at Jerusalem being the place of resort of Christians there."
3. "Paul's rejection of him on his second missionary journey, because he had turned back at Perga on the first journey, had caused an alienation between himself and Barnabas. Christian love soon healed the breach."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He, together with Gaius, had been seized in the tumult at Ephesus and treated with violence, but he adhered to the apostle in all his troubles, and attended him all his perils." 
2. "Paul mentions Mark here with affection... Paul did not harbor unkind and unforgiving feelings toward anyone."
3. "Paul here intimates that he was about to leave Rome, and he enjoins it on the Colossians to receive him kindly... Paul retained no malice, and now commended, in the warmest manner, one from whom he was formerly constrained to separate."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Unnecessary difficulty is made over the fact that the term fellow - prisoner is applied to Epaphras in Philippians 1:23, and not to Aristarchus; while here the case is reversed."
2. "All the three terms fellow - prisoner, fellow - servant, fellow - worker - might be applied to both."
3. "Reasons unknown to us may easily have determined the use of one word or the other, independently of the question as to the particular time when they were in imprisonment."

### John Calvin:
1. "It is also probable that his enemies exerted themselves, in the outset, to deter all pious persons from giving him help, by threatening them with the like danger, and that this for a time had the desired effect."
2. "They were careful in furnishing attestations, that they might distinguish good men from false brethren — from pretenders, from impostors, and multitudes of vagrants."
3. "The same care is more than simply necessary at the present day, both because good teachers are coldly received, and because credulous and foolish men lay themselves too open to be deceived by impostors."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "He might have voluntarily shared the Apostle’s captivity, or been temporarily confined in consequence of his intimacy with the latter."
2. "‘Cousin’ is doubtless the proper rendering, referring to the relation between children of brothers or of sisters, or of brother and sister."
3. "The past failure was forgiven by the Apostle, he would have it forgotten by the churches."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "My fellow-prisoner (ο συναιχμαλωτος μου). One of Paul's compounds, found elsewhere only in Lucian. Paul uses it of Epaphras in Philemon 1:23, but whether of actual voluntary imprisonment or of spiritual imprisonment like συνστρατιωτες (fellow-soldier) in Philippians 2:25; Philemon 1:2 we do not know."
2. "Mark (Μαρκος). Once rejected by Paul for his defection in the work (Acts 15:36-39), but now cordially commended because he had made good again."
3. "If he come unto you, receive him (εαν ελθη προς υμας δεξασθε αυτον). This third class conditional sentence (εαν and second aorist active subjunctive of ερχομα) gives the substance of the commands (εντολας) about Mark already sent, how we do not know. But Paul's commendation of Mark is hearty and unreserved as he does later in 2 Timothy 4:11."

### John Gill:
1. "He was a constant companion of the apostle, and one of his fellow labourers."
2. "Barnabas being so great a man as he was, and so well known, it added some credit to Mark, that he was a relation of his."
3. "Receive him; for this was either the substance of those letters, or what the apostle now adds of his own, for the further confirmation of them."

### John Wesley:
1. "Aristarchus my fellowprisoner" - This verse highlights the shared suffering and imprisonment that Aristarchus and Paul experienced together, emphasizing their strong bond and unity in faith.
2. "Ye have received directions" - The mention of Tychicus bringing the letter and giving directions implies the importance of clear instructions and guidance in the early Christian community.
3. "They might have scrupled to receive him, without this fresh direction" - This quote suggests that the early Christians may have had reservations about accepting someone who had previously left the work, highlighting the need for reassurance and confirmation in matters of faith.
