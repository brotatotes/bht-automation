# Colossians 4:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, we find a mention of Jesus Justus, a common name among the Jews. The use of the surname Justus indicates the presence of Jewish believers in Rome who were supportive of the gospel. These Jewish fellowworkers, who were a source of comfort to the Apostle Paul, played an important role in spreading the kingdom of God through their preaching. Despite the general opposition of the Jewish teachers, the presence of these dedicated Jews stood out as a testament to their commitment to the message of Christ.
