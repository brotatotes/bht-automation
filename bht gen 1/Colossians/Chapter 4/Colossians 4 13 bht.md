# Colossians 4:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, we see the Apostle Paul commending Epaphras for his fervent prayers and diligent labor in the region of Laodicea, Hierapolis, and Colossae. These cities, once prosperous and influential, had been affected by various challenges such as false teaching and spiritual complacency. Epaphras's zeal and affection for these believers were evident as he worked tirelessly to ensure their spiritual welfare and guard them against error. The interconnectedness of these cities and the urgency of the situation underline the significance of Paul's commendation and the need for the Colossians to remain steadfast in their faith.
