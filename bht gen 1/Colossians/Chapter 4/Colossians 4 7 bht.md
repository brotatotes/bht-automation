3. "δείκνυσιν αὐτοὺς ἐν τοῖς πειρασμοῖς ὄντας , Chrys."

### John Calvin:
1. "For although he was in prison, and was in danger of his life, making care for himself a secondary matter, he consults for their interests by sending Tychicus to them."
2. "Thus, the body, indeed, is under confinement, but the mind, anxious to employ itself in everything good, roams far and wide."
3. "His prudence shows itself in his sending a fit and prudent person to confirm them, as far as was necessary, and withstand the craftiness of the false apostles."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Fellow-servant. This is peculiar to this passage; it gives prominence to the fact that Tychicus had shared with the Apostle in the service of the same Master."
2. "Bishop Lightfoot calls attention to the word ‘fellow-servant,’ as a customary form of address in the early Church on the part of a bishop, when speaking of a deacon."
3. "In the Lord qualifies both the preceding terms (‘brother’ needs no such qualification)."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "All my affairs (τα κατ' εμε παντα). 'All the things relating to me.'"
2. "Tychicus (Τυχικος). Mentioned also in Ephesians 6:21 as the bearer of that Epistle and with the same verb γνωρισε (future active of γνωριζω) and with the same descriptive epithet as here (ο αγαπητος αδελφος κα πιστος διακονος εν Κυριω, the beloved brother and faithful minister in the Lord) except that here we have also κα συνδουλος (and fellow-servant)."
3. "Abbott suggests that Paul adds συνδουλος because he had used it of Epaphras in Colossians 1:7. Perhaps πιστος goes with both substantives and means faithful to Paul as well as to Christ."

### John Gill:

3. "He was a 'brother' in Christ, being a partaker of the same grace, and in the same spiritual relation; and 'beloved' of God, and Christ, of all the churches and saints that knew him, and especially by the apostle."
