1. "The Epistolary aorist in this verse indicates that Tychicus had already carried the letter to the recipients." 

2. "The phrase 'gnwte ta peri hJmwn' can be translated as 'ye might know the things about us' or 'our estate,' highlighting the desire for the recipients to have knowledge about the writer's circumstances." 

3. "A parallel can be drawn with Ephesians 6:21, where Tychicus is mentioned as a beloved brother and faithful minister, emphasizing his role as a trustworthy messenger."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Whom I sent, etc. See Ephesians 6:22, which is verbally identical, if we accept here the reading of the earliest authorities: that ye may know the things respecting us." 
2. "The received reading (in the Greek) differs from this in but three letters; moreover the variations are such as would readily arise."
3. "Since the discovery of Aleph, which in its corrections presents the entire history of the change, critical editors have usually accepted ‘ye’ and ‘our.’ The weight of authority overbears the probability of an alteration to conform with Ephesians 6:22."
