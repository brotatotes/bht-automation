## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "χρ. Ἰησ., as in the case of δοῦλος Ἰησ. χρ., seems rather to denote possession, than to belong to ἀπόστολος and designate the person from whom sent."
2. "On ἁγίοις, see Ellicott’s note. It is used here in its widest sense, as designating the members of Christ’s visible Church, presumed to fulfil the conditions of that membership."
3. "The ἁγίοις and πιστοῖς denote their spiritual life from its two sides that of God who calls and sanctifies, that of themselves who believe."

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "called to the apostleship through that same 'will' which originated the Church"
2. "The sanctification by God is here put before man's faith."
3. "The twofold aspect of salvation is thus presented, God's grace in the first instance sanctifying us, and our faith, by God's gift, laying hold of salvation."

2. "To the saints. See on Romans 1:7; Colossians 1:2; Philippians 1:1."
3. "The faithful. Not faithful in the sense of fidelity and perseverance, but believing, as John 20:27; Acts 10:45."

### John Calvin:
1. "He calls himself 'an apostle of Jesus Christ;' for all to whom has been given the ministry of reconciliation are his ambassadors."
2. "The word Apostle, indeed, carries something more; for it is not every minister of the gospel that can be called an apostle."

### John Gill:
1. "The persons residing there, to whom the epistle is written, are described by their character, as 'saints'; being separated by the grace of God the Father in eternal election; whose sins were expiated by the blood and sacrifice of Christ; and to whom he himself was made sanctification; and who were internally sanctified by the Spirit of God, and lived holy lives and conversations." 
2. "And to the faithful in Christ Jesus: who were in Christ, not only by electing grace, but were openly and manifestly in him, through converting grace; and abode in him as branches in the vine; continued constant, and persevered in faith and holiness; and were faithful to the cause and interest of Christ, and to his Gospel and ordinances; and were hearty and sincere in the profession of their faith in Christ, and love to him and his."
3. "Of such the church at Ephesus consisted, to whom this epistle was written."
