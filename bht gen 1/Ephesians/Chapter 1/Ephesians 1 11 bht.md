# Ephesians 1:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Believers have been chosen by God to receive an inheritance, predestined according to His purpose. This inheritance is a glorious possession, like the land of Canaan assigned by lot. It is obtained by God's free grace, not by our own works. God's will, determined by His perfect wisdom, is the foundation of our election and the assurance of our salvation with an incorruptible and eternal inheritance in Christ.
