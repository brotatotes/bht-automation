# Ephesians 1:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Bible verse being described is a greeting that combines the Greek concept of grace with the Jewish concept of peace. This greeting emphasizes the unity of believers, as recipients of God's grace and participants in His peace. It reminds us of our intimate relationship with God as His children. Grace is not earned or achieved, but freely given by God, while peace goes beyond mere absence of conflict, bringing a deep sense of wholeness. These blessings are not fleeting, but foundational to our faith, sustaining and transforming us in our daily lives.

### Henry Alford:
1. "On the form of greeting, cf. Romans 1:7; 1 Corinthians 1:3; 2 Corinthians 1:2; Galatians 1:3, &c."
2. "The Socinian perversion of the words, ‘from God, who is the Father of us and of our Lord Jesus Christ,’ is decisively refuted by Titus 1:4."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The phrase 'grace to you and peace' is a common greeting in the New Testament letters. It is significant because it combines the Greek greeting 'grace' (charis) with the Jewish greeting 'peace' (shalom). This combination highlights the unity of the Jewish and Gentile believers in Christ, as they are both recipients of God's grace and participants in His peace." 

2. "The mention of 'our Father' in these verses emphasizes the intimate and personal relationship that believers have with God through Jesus Christ. It reminds us that we are not just recipients of grace and peace, but we are also children of God, adopted into His family. This familial language underscores the love and care that God has for His children."

3. "The repetition of the phrase 'grace to you and peace' in multiple letters indicates the importance of these blessings in the lives of believers. It serves as a reminder that grace and peace are not fleeting or temporary, but they are foundational aspects of the Christian faith. They are gifts from God that sustain and strengthen us in our journey of faith."
