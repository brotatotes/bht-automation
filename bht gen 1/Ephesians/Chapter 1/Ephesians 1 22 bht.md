## Henry Alford:
1. "Christ is Head over all things: the Church is the BODY of Christ, and as such is the fulness of Him who fills all with all." 
2. "The church, being the Body of Christ, is dwelt in and filled by God: it is His πλήρωμα in an especial manner." 
3. "The Church is the special receptacle and abiding place, the πλήρωμα κατ᾽ ἐξοχήν, of Him who fills all things."

## Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "HIM He gave as Head over all things to the Church." - This quote emphasizes the special advantage the Church has in having Christ as its Head, as opposed to anyone else. 

2. "He is OVER ('far above') all things; in contrast to the words, 'TO the Church,' namely, for her advantage." - This quote highlights the contrast between Christ's dominion over all things and His specific role as Head for the benefit of the Church. 

3. "For the Head and body are not severed by anything intervening, else the body would cease to be the body, and the Head cease to be the Head." - This quote illustrates the inseparable union between Christ as the Head and the Church as His body, emphasizing the importance of this relationship.

## Albert Barnes:
1. "The universe is under his control and direction for the welfare of his people."
2. "All the elements - the physical works of God - the winds and waves - the seas and rivers - all are under him, and all are to be made tributary to the welfare of the church."
3. "Earthly kings and rulers; kingdoms and nations are under his control. Thus far Christ has controlled all the wicked rulers of the earth, and they have not been able to destroy that church which he redeemed with his own blood."

## Marvin Vincent:
1. "Put all things in subjection." - This phrase emphasizes the authority and power of Jesus Christ, who is given dominion over all things. It highlights his role as the supreme ruler and head of the Church.

2. "Him is emphatic: and Him He gave." - This emphasizes the significance of God giving Jesus as a gift to the world. It underscores the divine act of grace and love in sending Jesus to reconcile humanity to God.

3. "Not merely set Him over the Church, but gave Him as a gift." - This highlights the special nature of Jesus' relationship with the Church. He is not just a ruler or leader, but a precious gift bestowed upon believers, demonstrating God's abundant love and care for His people.

## John Calvin:
1. "The apostle shows that it was not a mere honorary title, but was accompanied by the entire command and government of the universe."
2. "Since Christ alone is called 'the head,' all others, whether angels or men, must rank as members."
3. "The Church is His body, and, consequently, those who refuse to submit to Him are unworthy of its communion; for on Him alone the unity of the Church depends."

## Philip Schaff:
1. "The unlimited Sovereignty of the exalted Christ is now set forth: ‘all things’ sums up what has been detailed in Ephesians 1:21." 
2. "The passage plainly says that Christ is given to the Church, and the next verse as plainly indicates that He is Head of the Church. What, then, is His relation to ‘all things?’ Evidently that of Head also."
3. "The word itself suggests two ideas: that the members are ‘called out,’ and that they form one assembly. The definition of the next verse justifies the saying, Ubi Christus, ibi ecclesia (wherever Christ is, there is the Church)."

## Archibald T Robertson:
1. "He put all things in subjection" - This quote highlights the authority and power of God, who has subjected all things under His control. It emphasizes the sovereignty of God over all creation.

2. "Gave him to be head" - This quote emphasizes that God has appointed Christ as the head of the church. It signifies Christ's leadership and authority over the spiritual body of believers.

3. "This conception of εκκλησια runs all through Ephesians" - This quote suggests that the idea of the church as the universal spiritual kingdom is a recurring theme in the book of Ephesians. It underscores the significance of the church in God's plan and purpose.

## Adam Clarke:
1. "All beings and things are subject to him, whether they be thrones, dominions, principalities, or powers." 
2. "He, God the Father, has given him to be head-chief, and supreme, over all, to the Church." 
3. "The Church having no ruler but Jesus Christ; others may be officers in his Church, but he alone is head and supreme."
