# Ephesians 1:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, commentators highlight the reciprocal relationship of blessing between God and believers. Being "blessed" by God means receiving spiritual and heavenly blessings. God's blessing extends beyond just words, as He bestows actual acts of grace upon His children. This reciprocal blessing is based on the covenant relationship between God and Christ, emphasizing the role of the Father in blessing both Christ and believers. These blessings are not temporary or earthly, but rather eternal and heavenly in nature, surpassing the external privileges of the Jews.
