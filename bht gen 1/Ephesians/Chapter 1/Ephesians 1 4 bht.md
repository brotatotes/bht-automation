# Ephesians 1:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This verse speaks of God's eternal purpose and divine election of believers in Christ for the reception of spiritual blessings. The chosen ones are called to a life of holiness and blamelessness, a sanctification that follows justification by faith. This election is rooted in God's love, and it is in union with Christ that believers receive all their blessings. The passage emphasizes that this choice is not based on human merit, but is a result of God's sovereign design and grace.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "He selected us, in preference to elected, as better giving the middle sense, 'chose for himself,' and the ἐξ, that it is a choosing out of the world."
2. "This holiness and unblamableness must not be understood of that justification by faith by which the sinner stands accepted before God: it is distinctly put forth here as an ultimate result as regards us, and refers to that sanctification which follows on justification by faith."
3. "ἀγάπη, that which man lost at the Fall, but which God is, and to which God restores man by redemption, is the great element in which, as in their abode and breathing-place, all Christian graces subsist, and in which, emphatically, all perfection before God must be found."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The repetition of the idea, 'in Christ,' implies the paramount importance of the truth that it is in Him, and by virtue of union to Him, believers have all their blessings."
2. "This assumes the eternity of the Son of God, as well as the election of believers in Him."
3. "Love, lost to man by the fall, but restored by redemption, is the root and fruit and sum of all holiness."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "These blessings were bestowed upon Christians in accordance with an eternal purpose. They were not conferred by chance or hap-hazard. They were the result of intention and design on the part of God."
2. "The phrase 'according as' implies that these blessings were in conformity with that eternal plan, and have flowed to us as the expression of that plan."
3. "The whole choice and purpose of salvation had reference to [Christ], and 'out' of him no one was chosen to life, and no one out of him will be saved."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "His blessing is in conformity with the fact that He chose." 
2. "Divine election is in Christ the Redeemer." 
3. "The positive and negative aspects of Christian life."

### John Calvin:
1. "The foundation and first cause, both of our calling and of all the benefits which we receive from God, is here declared to be his eternal election."
2. "The very time when the election took place proves it to be free; for what could we have deserved, or what merit did we possess, before the world was made?"
3. "The name of Christ excludes all merit, and everything which men have of their own; for when he says that we are chosen in Christ, it follows that in ourselves we are unworthy."
4. "Holiness, purity, and every excellence that is found among men, are the fruit of election; so that once more Paul expressly puts aside every consideration of merit."
5. "The only reason why he chose us, was his love to men. But I prefer connecting it with the latter part of the verse, as denoting that the perfection of believers consists in love."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "These spiritual blessings are conferred upon us, not merely because God chose us, but they are given in perfect harmony with His eternal purpose." (Eadie)
2. "This election is not, however, an arbitrary or mechanical matter: it is in him, i.e., in Christ. This indicates that those who are chosen are chosen ‘in Christ,’ as the second Adam, the new head and representative of spiritual humanity."
3. "‘If men are chosen to be holy, they cannot be chosen because they are holy.’ ‘Holiness is the only evidence of election’ (Hodge)."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Definitive statement of God's elective grace concerning believers in Christ." 
2. "This very phrase with προ in the Prayer of Jesus (John 17:24) of love of the Father toward the Son." 
3. "Paul in summary fashion gives an outline of his view of God's redemptive plans for the race."

### John Gill:
1. "This choice cannot be understood of a national one, as Israel of old were chosen by the Lord; for the persons the apostle writes to were not a nation; nor does he address all the inhabitants of Ephesus, only the saints and faithful in Christ that resided there."
2. "The objects of it, us, are not angels, but men, considered as unfallen with respect to the end, and as fallen with respect to the means; and these not all mankind: to choose, implies the contrary; and they that are chosen are distinguished from others, and are represented as few."
3. "The end of this choice follows, that we should be holy, and without blame, before him in love; the objects of it are not chosen because they were holy, but that they might partake of the sanctification of the Spirit; that they might be sanctified by him here, and be perfectly holy hereafter."

### John Wesley:
1. "God's choice of us is not based on our own merit or worthiness, but on His foreknowledge of our faith in Christ." 

2. "This verse reminds us that God's election is not limited to a specific group or ethnicity, but includes both Jews and gentiles." 

3. "The fact that God has chosen us should bring us great comfort and assurance, knowing that our salvation is secure in His hands."
