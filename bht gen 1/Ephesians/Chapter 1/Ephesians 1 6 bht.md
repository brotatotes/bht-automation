# Ephesians 1:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse being described is a powerful reminder of the incredible nature of God's grace. It highlights the glory and magnificence of His grace, emphasizing that it is freely given without any merit or deserving on our part. This description captures the essence of God's love, which is glorious, free, and unconditional. It humbles us by reminding us that we do not earn or deserve His grace, but rather, we are entirely dependent on His mercy. It calls us to offer our heartfelt praise and gratitude for the unfathomable gift of His grace.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The end, God’s end, in our predestination to adoption, is, that the glory, glorious nature, brightness and majesty, and kindliness and beauty, of His grace might be an object of men and angels’ praise."
2. "He bestowed upon us...the meaning of χαριτόω is disputed...And this latter sense is adopted, here and in Luke 1:28 (where see note), by many, e.g. by Chrys., τουτέστιν , οὐ μόνον ἁμαρτημάτων ἀπήλλαξεν , ἀλλὰ καὶ ἐπεράστους ἐποίησε , Erasm., Luth., all. But the meaning of χάρις , on which this is founded, does not seem to occur in the N. T., certainly not in St. Paul. And χαριτόω , both here and in I. c., according to the analogy of such verbs, will be ‘to bestow grace.’"
3. "The becoming χαρίεντες may be a consequence of being κεχαριτωμένοι, but must be quite independent of its verbal meaning."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The end aimed at (Psalms 50:23), that is, that the glory of His grace may be praised by all His creatures, men and angels."
2. "Us accepted—a kindred Greek word to 'grace': charitos, echaritosen: translate, 'graciously accepted'; 'made us subjects of His grace'; 'embraced us in the arms of His grace' (Romans 3:24; Romans 5:15)."
3. "In the beloved—pre-eminently so called (Matthew 3:17; Matthew 17:5; John 3:35; Colossians 1:13). Greek, 'Son of His love.' It is only 'IN HIS BELOVED' that He loves us (Ephesians 1:3; 1 John 4:9; 1 John 4:10)."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The doctrine of predestination and election lays the foundation of adoring gratitude and praise."
2. "All the joys which any of the human race have, are to be traced to the purpose of God to bestow them."
3. "The doctrine of predestination to life has added no pang of sorrow to anyone of the human race. It has made millions happy who would not otherwise have been, but not one miserable."

Note: The provided commentary is quite lengthy, so I have selected three quotes that capture the essence of the author's argument.

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Glory is an attribute of grace: that in which grace grandly and resplendently displays itself."
2. "In praising God for what He does, we learn to praise Him for what He is."
3. "Grace is an act of God, not a state into which He brings us."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "We are to praise Him, not simply for His favor to us, but for that exhibition of grace which exalts us to a higher knowledge of His glory, so that, even in praising Him for what He does for us, we learn to praise Him for what He is."
2. "This phrase must not, therefore, be weakened into ‘His glorious grace.’"
3. "We become the objects of God’s love through His grace, which has in Christ its sphere, and becomes ours through union with Him."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Note the prepositions in this sentence." 

2. "Genitive case of the relative ην (cognate accusative with εχαριτωσεν (he freely bestowed), late verb χαριτοω (from χαρις, grace), in N.T. attracted to case of antecedent χαριτος only here and Luke 1:28."

3. "Perfect passive participle of αγαπαω. This phrase nowhere else in the N.T. though in the Apostolic Fathers."

### John Gill:
1. "The grace of God manifestly appears in the predestination of men to adoption; in that God had no need of sons, he having a dear and well beloved one; in whom he is well pleased."
2. "The glory of the grace of God appears herein; the glory of God is the supreme end of all he does; and the glory of his grace, and not his power, or other perfections of his, and the manifestative glory of that is here intended; yea, the 'praise' of that glory."
3. "He hath made us accepted in the beloved; the Lord Jesus Christ, who is the beloved of God the Father; and was so from everlasting, and will be so to everlasting; which has appeared by his nearness to him, lying in his bosom; by his being privy to all his counsels, purposes, and designs."

### John Wesley:
1. "To the praise of the glory of his grace" - This phrase emphasizes the magnificence and splendor of God's grace, which is freely given to us without any merit or deserving on our part. It highlights the unmerited favor and love that God bestows upon us.

2. "His glorious, free love" - This phrase captures the essence of God's love for us. It is not based on our actions or worthiness, but is freely given out of His own glorious nature. It reminds us that God's love is boundless, unconditional, and beyond our comprehension.

3. "Without any desert on our part" - This statement underscores the fact that we do not earn or deserve God's grace. It highlights the humbling truth that we are completely dependent on His mercy and that our salvation is solely a result of His unmerited favor. It reminds us of our need for humility and gratitude in receiving God's grace.
