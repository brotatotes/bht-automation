# Ephesians 1:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Through the blood of Christ, we have obtained redemption and forgiveness of our sins. This redemption is a deliverance from the power and guilt of sin, achieved by the atonement made by Jesus. God's grace, rich and overflowing, is the ultimate ground and source of our redemption. The blood of Christ, freely shed on the cross, serves as the payment and ransom that sets us free from the bondage of sin and reconciles us with God. This forgiveness, obtained through the riches of His grace, is the essential part of our redemption.
