# Ephesians 2:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the commentator highlights the contrast between the Gentiles and the Jews, represented by the abstract terms uncircumcision and circumcision. The commentators emphasize that the Gentiles, once called uncircumcised, are now included in God's plan of salvation, while the Jews who were traditionally referred to as the circumcised are being excluded. The commentator also emphasizes the importance of remembering their previous state of being, the Gentiles in the flesh, before their conversion to Christianity. Additionally, the true circumcision is depicted as a spiritual transformation of the heart rather than a mere physical act.
