# Ephesians 2:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The passage being described highlights the previous state of the Gentiles before embracing Christ. They were separated from the promised Messiah, alienated from the commonwealth of Israel, and were strangers to the covenants of promise. They lived without hope and without God in the world. The absence of Christ led to a lack of knowledge, faith, and communion with Him, resulting in despair and distance from the blessings and privileges offered by God. This description emphasizes the transformative power of faith and the significance of the covenant of salvation in the Gentiles' newfound hope and reconciliation with God.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "You were without the knowledge of the Messiah...living without any of the hopes and consolations which you now have, from having embraced him."
2. "All Christians may in like manner be reminded of the fact that, before their conversion, they were 'without Christ.'"
3. "To be in possession of [the covenants of promise] was regarded as a high honor and privilege; and Paul refers to it here to show that, though the Ephesians had been by nature without these, yet they had now been brought to enjoy all the benefits of them."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Paul speaks ideally of a spiritual commonwealth in which Jew and Gentile were together at peace with God, and of which the commonwealth of Israel is a type."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The emphasis rests on ‘were;’ the fact that this was their condition being made more prominent by the added phrase ‘at that time,’ which is stronger than ‘once.’"
2. "'Alienated’ is more exact than ‘aliens,’ pointing to a previous nearness, for Paul in Romans 1:18, etc., states that there was such a process of alienation from God, and this alienation would be involved in that."
3. "'Covenants,’ as in Romans 9:4, points to the several renewals of the covenant with the patriarchs, all pertaining to the one ‘promise’ of the Messiah. To these the Gentiles were ‘strangers,’ having no part in them."
