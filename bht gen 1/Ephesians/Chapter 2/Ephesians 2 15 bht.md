# Ephesians 2:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Christ, through His sacrificial death and the abolition of the ceremonial law, has removed the enmity between Jews and Gentiles. He reconciled them not only to each other but also to God, forming a new unity. This unity is rooted in Himself, as all are now one in Christ Jesus. The division and hostility caused by the ceremonial law have been replaced with a new creation and a common fellowship of grace.

1. "It was not by instruction merely; it was not by communicating the knowledge of God; it was not as a teacher; it was not by the mere exertion of power; it was by his flesh - his human nature - and this can mean only that he did it by his sacrifice of himself."
2. "The idea is, that the ceremonial law of the Jews, on which they so much prided themselves, was the cause of the hostility existing between them. That made them different people, and laid the foundation for the alienation which existed between them."
3. "These were the occasion of the enmity between the Jews and the Gentiles, and these were abolished by the great sacrifice which the Redeemer made; and of course when that was made, the purpose for which these laws were instituted was accomplished, and they ceased to be of value and to be binding."

### Marvin Vincent:

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Enmity is then an explanation of the previous figure, and must refer to the enmity between Jews and Gentiles."
