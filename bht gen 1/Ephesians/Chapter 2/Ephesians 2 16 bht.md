# Ephesians 2:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Bible verse being described speaks of the reconciliation brought about by Jesus Christ's sacrificial death on the cross. Commentators highlight that this reconciliation involves not only a return to favor with God, but also the laying aside of enmity and a restoration to a primal unity. By fulfilling the ceremonial law and bearing the penalty for sin, Christ reconciled humanity to God, thus removing the enmity that existed. Through this act, not only are individuals reconciled to God, but they are also brought into unity with one another in the body of believers, the church.

2. "By His being slain, He slew the enmity—namely, that had been between man and God; and so that between Jew and Gentile which had resulted from it."
3. "By the cross, that is, His crucifixion."

### Albert Barnes:

### John Calvin:

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The compound verb here used occurs elsewhere only in Colossians 1:20-21. It may either be a strengthened form, or mean ‘reconcile again.’ The former is preferable, since the context speaks of ‘one new man,’ ‘one body,’ not of a restoration."
2. "The reference is not to Christ’s human body, but to his mystical body (comp. chap. Ephesians 1:23), the church. Jews and Gentiles being, as they are, in this one body, are reconciled to God through the death of Christ."
3. "‘Having slain’ carrying out the figure suggested by the reference to the crucifixion. ‘The enmity’ has been explained (1.) of enmity toward God, (2.) of enmity between Jew and Gentile, (3.) of both. The last is preferable, for the complex idea runs through the whole passage."
