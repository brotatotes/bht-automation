# Ephesians 2:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Bible verse being described speaks of Christ as the inclusive Head of the building, wherein the Church is fitly framed together and growing as a living organism. The building is a spiritual structure, with believers as its materials, and it centers on Christ as the master builder. This growth refers to the increase of believers and their spiritual growth, guided by the word and ordinances. It is a divine temple, dedicated to Christ, surpassing the greatness of any earthly worship.
