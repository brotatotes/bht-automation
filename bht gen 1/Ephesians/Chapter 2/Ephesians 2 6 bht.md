# Ephesians 2:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Bible verse describes the believers' union and identification with Christ, as they are "raised up" both spiritually and bodily, in connection with Jesus' resurrection and ascension. The believers are already seated in heavenly places with Christ, sharing in his glory and authority. This intimate relationship with Christ is the source of their present spiritual resurrection, their future bodily resurrection, and their future entrance into heaven. Through their mystical union with Christ, believers already possess a blessed immortality and anticipate the glorious future that awaits them.
