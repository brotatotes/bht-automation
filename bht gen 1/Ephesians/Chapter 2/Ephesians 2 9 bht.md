# Ephesians 2:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse we are describing underscores that our salvation is rooted in God's grace, not our own works. It emphasizes that salvation is a gift freely given by God, received through faith alone. No amount of good deeds or personal efforts can earn our salvation, as all glory belongs to God alone. This passage reminds us to humbly acknowledge our complete dependence on God's grace for our salvation.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Not of works—This clause stands in contrast to 'by grace,' as is confirmed by Romans 4:4; Romans 4:5; Romans 11:6." 

2. "Lest—rather, as Greek, 'that no man should boast' (Romans 3:27; Romans 4:2)." 

3. "That no man should boast" emphasizes the fact that salvation is not earned through our own efforts or good works, but is a gift of God's grace.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Not of works" means that our salvation is not based on our own efforts or good deeds. It is a gift from God that we receive through faith in Jesus Christ.

2. This phrase reminds us that we cannot earn our way into heaven by trying to be good enough or by following a set of rules. Our salvation is solely dependent on God's grace and the sacrifice of Jesus on the cross.

3. It is important to understand that while good works are not the basis of our salvation, they are still an important part of the Christian life. Our faith should naturally lead us to do good works as a response to God's love and grace.

### John Calvin:
1. "In these three phrases, — not of yourselves, — it is the gift of God, — not of works, — he embraces the substance of his long argument in the Epistles to the Romans and to the Galatians, that righteousness comes to us from the mercy of God alone, — is offered to us in Christ by the gospel, — and is received by faith alone, without the merit of works."
2. "This passage affords an easy refutation of the idle cavil by which Papists attempt to evade the argument, that we are justified without works. Paul, they tell us, is speaking about ceremonies. But the present question is not confined to one class of works."
3. "Paul’s doctrine is overthrown, unless the whole praise is rendered to God alone and to his mercy."

Note: The commentary is quite long, so I have selected three quotes that summarize the main points of the commentary.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Not of works. This resumes the negative side, asserting that salvation does not proceed from works, as a meritorious ground." 
2. "It is obvious that we cannot supply ‘faith’ here, and this is a strong argument for the view taken of the latter part of Ephesians 2:8."
3. "The purpose of this method of grace is that God alone should have the glory, the negative side of which is ‘that no man should boast’."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "No man should glory." - This phrase emphasizes the humility and recognition that all glory belongs to God alone. It reminds us that boasting or taking credit for our accomplishments is contrary to the nature of God's grace.

2. "It is all of God's grace." - This statement highlights the source of our salvation and blessings. It reminds us that we are entirely dependent on God's grace and that our own efforts or merits play no role in obtaining salvation.

3. "All of God's grace." - This phrase underscores the magnitude and completeness of God's grace. It reminds us that everything we have and everything we are is a result of God's unmerited favor and love towards us.

### John Gill:
1. "Works are neither the moving causes, nor the procuring causes, nor the helping causes, nor 'causa sine qua non', or conditions of salvation."
2. "The best works that are done by men, are not done of themselves, but by the grace of God, and therefore can never merit at his hand."
3. "Salvation is put upon such a foot, lest any man should boast; of his works before God, and unto men."

These quotes emphasize that salvation is not achieved through works, but rather through the grace of God. They highlight the idea that no amount of good deeds can earn salvation, and that boasting in one's own works is to be avoided.

### John Wesley:
1. "Not by works" - This phrase emphasizes that faith and salvation are not earned through our own efforts or good deeds. It highlights the importance of recognizing that our salvation is a gift from God, received through faith alone.

2. "Neither this faith nor this salvation" - The commentary emphasizes that both faith and salvation are not achieved through our own actions. It reminds us that our faith is a response to God's grace, and salvation is a result of God's mercy and love.

3. "Owing to any works you ever did, will, or can do" - This quote emphasizes the complete inability of human works to contribute to our salvation. It reminds us that no matter how good or righteous our actions may be, they cannot earn us salvation. Our salvation is solely dependent on God's grace and our faith in Him.
