# Ephesians 3:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Through faith in Christ, we are granted boldness and confidence to approach God with unrestricted freedom and express our deepest desires. Our access to God is like that of favored petitioners who are introduced by a trusted advocate, and our boldness is akin to the unrestrained speech of children addressing a loving father. In this relationship, we find assurance of God's favor and acceptance, enabling us to openly disclose our needs and make known our requests without fear of offense.
