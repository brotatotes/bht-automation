# Ephesians 3:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, the commentators emphasize the concept of a unified family under God's fatherhood. God, as the great prototype of the paternal relation, is the original source of this familial bond. This family extends beyond earthly boundaries and includes angels, saints, and believers, forming one holy community. Whether on earth or in heaven, all members of this family bear the same name derived from the redeeming work of Christ. They are united under one head and share a relationship grounded in reconciliation and adoption.
