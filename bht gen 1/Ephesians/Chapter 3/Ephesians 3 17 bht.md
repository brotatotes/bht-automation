1. "Where the Spirit is there Christ is."
2. "It is not enough that He be on the tongue, or flit through the brain: the heart is His proper seat."
3. "Love, the first-fruit of the Spirit, flowing from Christ's love realized in the soul, was to be the basis on which should rest their further comprehension of all the vastness of Christ's love."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Expressions like this often occur in the Scriptures, where God is said to dwell in us, and we are said to be the temples of the Holy Spirit."
2. "The meaning is, that his love should be as firm in our hearts, as a tree is in the soil, whose roots strike deep into the earth."
3. "The word is taken from architecture, where a firm foundation is laid, and the meaning is, that he wished them to be as firm in the love of Christ, as a building is that rests on a solid basis."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "May dwell [κατοικησαι] . Settle down and abide. Take up His permanent abode, so that ye may be a habitation [κατοικητηριον] of God." 
2. "The connection is with the preceding clause: 'to be strengthened, etc., so that Christ may dwell,' the latter words having at once a climactic and an explanatory force, and adding the idea of permanency to that of strengthening."
3. "By faith [δια της πιστεως] . Through your (the article) faith, as the medium of appropriating Christ. Faith opens the door and receives Him who knocks."

### John Calvin:
1. "It is a mistake to imagine that the Spirit can be obtained without obtaining Christ; and it is equally foolish and absurd to dream that we can receive Christ without the Spirit. Both doctrines must be believed." 
2. "By faith we not only acknowledge that Christ suffered and rose from the dead on our account, but, accepting the offers which he makes of himself, we possess and enjoy him as our Savior. This deserves our careful attention."
3. "The firmness and constancy which our love ought to possess are pointed out by two metaphors. There are many persons not wholly destitute of love; but it is easily removed or shaken, because its roots are not deep. Paul desires that it should be rooted and grounded, — thoroughly fixed in our minds, so as to resemble a well-founded building or deeply-planted tree."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The word ‘dwell ‘points to a permanent indwelling of one who takes entire possession."

1. "Christ is asked to make his home in our hearts. This is the ideal, but a deal of fixing would have to be done in our hearts for Christ." 

2. "Being rooted and grounded in love." 

3. "Paul piles up metaphors (dwelling, rooted, grounded)."

### John Gill:
1. "The inhabitant Christ is he who dwells in the highest heavens, who dwells in the Father, and the Father in him, in whom all fulness dwells, the fulness of the Godhead, and the fulness of grace."
2. "This inhabitation of Christ prayed for is not to be understood in such sense, as he dwells everywhere, being the omnipresent God; or as he dwells in the human nature; nor of his dwelling merely by his Spirit, but of a personal indwelling of his; and which is an instance of his special grace."
3. "The place where he dwells is not their heads, nor their tongues, but their hearts; and this is where no good thing dwells but himself and his grace; and where sin dwells, and where he is often slighted, opposed, and rebelled against."

### John Wesley:
1. "Dwell - That is, constantly and sensibly abide." 

2. "To dwell in the secret place of the Most High is to live in a state of intimate communion with God, to be close to Him, and to experience His presence and protection."
