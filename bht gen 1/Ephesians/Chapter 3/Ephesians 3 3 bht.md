### John Calvin:
1. "The present instance, on account of its novelty, had few supporters; and therefore he calls it a mystery. By this name he endeavors to remove the prejudice which the general displeasure at the event was fitted to excite."
2. "Paul draws the line of distinction between himself and those fanatics, who ascribe to God and to the Holy Spirit their own idle dreams. The false apostles boast of revelations, but it is a false boast."
3. "Paul was persuaded that his revelation was true, could prove it to others, and speaks of it as a fact of which no doubt could be entertained."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The mystery of redemption, whose centre is the Person of Christ, whose object and purport is Christ, taking that term as including the Body of which He is the Head, which He has redeemed, and in which the Gentiles are ‘fellow-members’ (Ephesians 3:6); the latter thought being the special reference throughout, though never to the exclusion of the wider thought."
2. "What he has written in this Epistle confirms the statement that this mystery had been made known to him."
3. "'In comparison with the wealth of the truth revealed, its fulness, its wide-reaching, deep-moving efficiency, what he writes is to him always little and brief.'"

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "By revelation (κατα αποκαλυψιν). Not essentially different from δι' αποκαλυψεως (Galatians 1:12). This was Paul's qualification for preaching 'the mystery' (το μυστηριον. See Ephesians 1:9)."

2. "As I wrote afore (καθως προεγραψα). First aorist active indicative of προγραφω as in Romans 15:4, not picture forth as Galatians 3:1. But when and where? Epistolary aorist for this Epistle? That is possible. A previous and lost Epistle as in 1 Corinthians 5:9? That also is abstractly possible."

3. "In few words (εν ολιγω). Not = προ ολιγου, shortly before, but as in Acts 26:28 'in brief space or time' = συντονως (Acts 24:4), 'briefly.'"

### John Gill:
1. "The Gospel, which is sometimes called a mystery, the mystery of the Gospel, the mystery of godliness, and the mystery of faith: the several doctrines of the Gospel are the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven."

3. "He had it by the revelation of Jesus Christ, and by the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him."
