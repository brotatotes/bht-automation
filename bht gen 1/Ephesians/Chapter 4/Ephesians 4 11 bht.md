# Ephesians 4:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Bible verse under consideration speaks of the various gifts given to the Church by Christ for its growth and edification. These gifts include apostles, who were divinely called and commissioned as ministers and witnesses of the resurrection of Christ. Alongside them are prophets, who testify of future events, and evangelists, who proclaim the gospel message. Additionally, pastors provide guidance and care for their flocks, while teachers assist in the instruction of the Church. Through these different offices and gifts, God equips His Church for its mission and its unity in faith.

1. "The men who filled the office, no less than the office itself, were a divine gift."
2. "True and full unity of faith is then found, when all thoroughly know Christ, the object of faith, alike, and that in His highest dignity as the Son of God."
3. "The bestowal of gifts on the church is aimed at the ultimate goal of the perfecting of the saints and the building up of the body of Christ."

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "The men who filled the office, no less than the office itself, were a divine gift."
2. "Evangelists were itinerant preachers like our missionaries, as Philip the deacon."
3. "The 'pastor' had the outward rule and guidance of the Church: the bishop."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He gave some to be apostles...to show that he has made ample provision for the extension and edification of his church." 
2. "The evangelist 'may' have been one whose main business was 'preaching,' and who was not particularly engaged in the 'government' of the church."
3. "The word is given to ministers of the gospel with obvious propriety, and with great beauty. They are to exercise the same watchfulness and care over the people of their charge which a shepherd does over his flock."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Christ's ministers are gifts to His people."
2. "The distinguishing features of an apostle were, a commission directly from Christ: being a witness of the resurrection: special inspiration: supreme authority: accrediting by miracles: unlimited commission to preach and to found churches."
3. "The omission of the article from teachers seems to indicate that pastors and teachers are included under one class. The two belong together. No man is fit to be a pastor who cannot also teach, and the teacher needs the knowledge which pastoral experience gives."

### John Calvin:
1. "The external ministry of the word is also commended, on account of the advantages which it yields... It may excite surprise, that, when the gifts of the Holy Spirit form the subject of discussion, Paul should enumerate offices instead of gifts. I reply, when men are called by God, gifts are necessarily connected with offices."
2. "The government of the church, by the preaching of the word, is first of all declared to be no human contrivance, but a most sacred ordinance of Christ... They who reject or despise this ministry offer insult and rebellion to Christ its Author."
3. "The different names and offices assigned to different persons take their rise from that diversity of the members which goes to form the completeness of the whole body... He therefore reminds them, that the gifts bestowed on individuals are intended, not to be held for their personal and separate interests, but to be employed for the benefit of the whole."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Christ gives the Church’s ministers; the Church takes those given and sets them in the service of the Church."
2. "It is generally agreed that only those are Apostles, who (1.) were commissioned by Christ Himself; (2.) were witnesses of His resurrection, because they had seen the Risen Lord; (3.) that they had a special inspiration; (4.) that their authority was supreme; (3.) that they were furnished with ample credentials."
3. "The only question is, whether two classes are meant, or only one, the two-fold duty of which is thus indicated."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "There are four groups... The titles are in the predicate accusative... Each of these words occurs in 1 Corinthians 12:28 except ποιμενας (shepherds)."
2. "This word ποιμην is from a root meaning to protect. Jesus said the good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep and called himself the Good Shepherd."
3. "Only here are preachers termed shepherds in the N.T. But the verb ποιμαινω, to shepherd, is employed by Jesus to Peter, by Peter to other ministers, by Paul to the elders of Ephesus."
