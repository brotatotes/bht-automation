### Albert Barnes:
1. "It is that Christians may have every possible advantage for becoming complete in love, and knowledge, and order."
2. "All these are engaged in the work of the ministry, though in different departments. Together they constituted the 'ministry' by which Christ meant to establish and edify the church."
3. "The presumption is rather that he meant that there should be but one permanent order of ministers, though the departments of their labor might be varied according to circumstances, and though there might be helpers, as occasion should demand."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "For perfecting, see on mending, Matthew 4:21; perfected, Matthew 21:16; Luke 6:40; 1 Peter 5:10. Compare 1 Corinthians 1:10; Hebrews 13:21."

1. "The Greek word employed by Paul is καταρτισμός, which signifies literally the adaptation of things possessing symmetry and proportion; just as, in the human body, the members are united in a proper and regular manner; so that the word comes to signify perfection."
2. "Our true completeness and perfection consist in our being united in the one body of Christ. No language more highly commendatory of the ministry of the word could have been employed, than to ascribe to it this effect."
