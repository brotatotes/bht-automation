# Ephesians 4:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse in question highlights the vulnerability of those who lack firm principles and are easily swayed by different teachings. The commentators describe such individuals as being like children, uncertain and wavering in their beliefs. These individuals, like ships on a restless sea, are tossed about by the winds of various doctrines and deceived by the craftiness of false teachers. The verse emphasizes the importance of acquiring settled views of truth, firmly grounding oneself in the doctrines of the gospel, and not being carried away by every changing wind or manipulated by deceitful tactics.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "But children have other characteristics besides simplicity and docility. They are often changeable...they are influenced easily by others, and led astray." 

2. "The idea is that of a vessel on the restless ocean, that is tossed about with every varying wind, and that has no settled line of sailing. So many persons are in regard to religious doctrines. They have no fixed views and principles." 

3. "No man can be useful who has not settled principles. No one who has not such principles can inspire confidence or be happy, and the first aim of every young convert should be to acquire settled views of the truth, and to become firmly grounded in the doctrines of the gospel."

### John Calvin:
1. "Those are 'children' who have not yet advanced a step in the way of the Lord, but who still hesitate, — who have not yet determined what road they ought to choose, but move sometimes in one direction and sometimes in another, always doubtful, always wavering."
2. "The distressing hesitation of those who do not place absolute reliance on the word of the Lord, is illustrated by two striking metaphors. The first is taken from small ships, exposed to the fury of the billows in the open sea, holding no fixed course, guided neither by skill nor design, but hurried along by the violence of the tempest. The next is taken from straws, or other light substances, which are carried hither and thither as the wind drives them, and often in opposite directions."
3. "By a beautiful metaphor, all the doctrines of men, by which we are drawn away from the simplicity of the gospel, are called winds... By the cunning of men. There will always be impostors, who make insidious attacks upon our faith; but, if we are fortified by the truth of God, their efforts will be unavailing."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "We be no longer children; immature, small, feeble, imperfect."
2. "Tossed as waves; like the waves, ‘fluctuating’ (Vulgate); others prefer ‘tossed to and fro,’ as a deserted ship. Excitable and unsteady, as children are."
3. "Those immature run after every new teacher; having little knowledge or stability, excitable, dependent on their surroundings, they fall a ready prey to the various teachers of error."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Some Christians are quite content to remain 'babes' in Christ and never cut their eye-teeth (Hebrews 5:11-14), the victims of every charlatan who comes along." 

2. "If not anchored by full knowledge of Christ, folks are at the mercy of these squalls." 

3. "Paul has covered the whole ground in this picture of Gnostic error."

### John Gill:
1. "They should not always remain ignorant, imprudent, or be always fed with milk, and not able to digest meat; nor be unable to go unless led, and be tender and incapable of bearing hardships for Christ and his Gospel, and of defending it, and his cause and interest."
2. "To be tossed to and fro, and carried about with false doctrine is expressive of much ignorance and want of a discerning spirit, and implies hesitation, and doubts and scruples, and shows credulity, fickleness, and inconstancy."
3. "False teachers make use of artifices and juggling tricks, to deceive the hearts of the simple, as others do to cheat men of their money."

### John Wesley:
1. "Fluctuating to and fro — From within, even when there is no wind." 
2. "And carried about with every wind — From without; when we are assaulted by others, who are unstable as the wind." 
3. "By the sleight of men — By their 'cogging the dice;' so the original word implies."
