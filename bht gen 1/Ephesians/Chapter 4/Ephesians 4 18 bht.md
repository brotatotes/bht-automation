# Ephesians 4:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This verse describes the fallen state of humanity, where our understanding is darkened and filled with ignorance due to our rebellion against God's revelation. We are alienated from the divine, spiritual life that God intended for us, and this alienation stems from the hardness and callousness of our hearts. In this state, we remain ignorant of God and His will, devoid of the light and knowledge that He offers.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Being darkened in their understanding" implies that before the fall, humans had been partakers of life and light, but they revolted from the primitive revelation.
2. The "life of God" refers to the life whereby God lives in His own people, just as He was the life and light in Adam before the irruption of death and darkness into human nature.
3. The ignorance of God, which is the beginning point of their misery, is a result of wilful ignorance and not choosing to retain God in their knowledge.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "A man who is intemperate, has no just views of the government of the appetites. A man who is unchaste, has no perception of the loveliness of purity. A man who is avaricious or covetous, has no just views of the beauty of benevolence. A man who indulges in low vices, will weaken his mental powers, and render himself incapable of intellectual effort."

2. "Nothing is more obvious than that indulgence in sin weakens the mental powers, and renders them unfit for high intellectual effort. This is seen all over the pagan world now - in the stolid, stupid mind; the perverted moral sense; the incapacity for profound or protracted mental effort, as really as it was among the pagans to whom Paul preached."

3. "Learn hence, that if a man wishes to be blessed with a clear understanding, he should be a 'good man.' He who wishes a mind well balanced and clear, should fear and love God; and had Christianity done no other good on earth than to elevate the 'intellect' of mankind, it would have been the richest blessing which has ever been vouchsafed to the race."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The life which God bestows; life in Christ."
2. "The cause of the alienation."
3. "The participle of the substantive verb expresses the deep-seated, indwelling character of the ignorance."

### John Calvin:
1. "Our ordinary life, as men, is nothing more than an empty image of life, not only because it quickly passes, but also because, while we live, our souls, not keeping close to God, are dead."
2. "There are three kinds of life in this world...and all of them are from God, so that each of them may be called the life of God."
3. "The regeneration of believers is here called, by way of eminence, the life of God, because then does God truly live in us, and we enjoy his life, when he governs us by his Spirit."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Being darkened in their understanding. The participle points to a condition which has been effected in the past, and the seat of this darkened condition was the intellectual part of our nature."
2. "Being alienated from the life of God; comp. chap. Ephesians 2:12. The participle here has the same force as that of the previous clause. ‘The life of God’ means the true spiritual life which belongs to God, and which He bestows on men."
3. "Because of the ignorance, etc. Not ‘through.’ This is an ‘ignorance’ which is now natural and peculiar to them. It is the ground of the darkening of the understanding. Against this view of the connection, it is urged that’ ignorance’ is not the cause of darkness."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Being darkened (εσκοτωμενο οντες). Periphrastic perfect passive participle of σκοτοω, old verb from σκοτος (darkness), in N.T. only here and Revelation 9:2; Revelation 16:10."

2. "In their understanding (τη διανοια). Locative case. Probably διανοια (δια, νους) includes the emotions as well as the intellect (νους)."

3. "From the life of God (της ζωης του θεου). Ablative case ζωης after απηλλοτριωμενο (Ephesians 2:12)."

4. "Because of the ignorance (δια την αγνοιαν). Old word from αγνοεω, not to know. Rare in N.T. See Acts 3:17."

5. "Hardening (πωρωσιν). Late medical term (Hippocrates) for callous hardening. Only other N.T. examples are Mark 3:5; Romans 11:25."

### John Gill:
1. "The understanding of man was at first filled both with natural and divine knowledge; but man was not content with this, and being ambitious of more, even of being as God, lost what he had."
2. "Wicked and unconverted men are alienated from [the life of God]; they are estranged from God the fountain of it; and go astray from the law, the rule of a holy life."
3. "Every unregenerate man is an ignorant man, and especially the Gentiles were very ignorant of God, and of divine things; ignorance is natural to men, it comes by sin, and is itself sinful."

### John Wesley:
1. "Having their understanding darkened, through the ignorance that is in them — So that they are totally void of the light of God, neither have they any knowledge of his will."
2. "Being alienated from the life of God — Utter strangers to the divine, the spiritual life."
3. "Through the hardness of their hearts — Callous and senseless. And where there is no sense, there can be no life."
