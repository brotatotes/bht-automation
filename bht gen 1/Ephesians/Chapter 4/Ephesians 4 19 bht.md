# Ephesians 4:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse being described portrays a state of moral apathy and hardened hearts, where individuals have lost all sensitivity towards sin and its consequences. They willingly surrender themselves to various forms of iniquity, abandoning any remorse or emotional response to their actions. The unhindered pursuit of self-indulgence, whether it be greed or sensual desires, characterizes their behavior. Despite the faint echoes of conscience, their hearts remain callous, impervious to the voice of reason and divine admonition.

### Henry Alford:
1. "The obduration described may spring in ordinary life from despair...but may also result from other reasons." 
2. "It accorded here with the hortatory object of the Apostle to bring into prominence that which happened on the side of their own free will." 
3. "πλεονεξία, the desire of having more, is obviously a wider vice than mere covetousness, though this latter is generally its prominent form. It is self-seeking, or greed: in whatever direction this central evil tendency finds its employment."

2. Their giving themselves to it was punished in kind, God giving them up to it by withdrawing His preventing grace; their sin thus was made their punishment.
3. It does not necessarily include lasciviousness; but it means intemperate, reckless readiness for it, and for every self-indulgence. "The first beginnings of unchastity."
4. The Greek implies, "with a deliberate view to the working (as if it were their work or business, not a mere accidental fall into sin) of uncleanness of every kind."

2. "He often gives an intellectual assent to the truth, but it is without emotion of any kind."

2. "The voice of God, proclaimed by an accusing conscience, still continues to be heard; but, instead of producing its proper effects, appears rather to harden them against all admonition."
3. "The gnawing of a guilty conscience, tormented by the dread of the Divine judgment, may be compared to the porch of hell; but such hardened security as this — is a whirlpool which swallows up and destroys."

1. "Being past feeling. One word in Greek, meaning to be unsusceptible of pain, and in this connection, referring to moral pain, not feeling the punishment of conscience."

3. "The term, derived from the verb meaning to overeat, refers to an unbridled course of conduct, defying public decency, not to any special sin of sensuality. As however sensuality is always implied, 'wantonness' fairly expresses the sense."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Being past feeling (απηλγηκοτες). Perfect active participle of απαλγεω, old word to cease to feel pain, only here in N.T." 

2. "To lasciviousness (τη ασελγεια). Unbridled lust as in 2 Corinthians 12:21; Galatians 5:19."
