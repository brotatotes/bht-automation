# Ephesians 4:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, commentators emphasize the importance of actively rejecting and renouncing our old sinful nature, commonly referred to as "the old man." They describe this process as putting off old habits and behaviors, like removing old clothing. While the old man's corruption and deceitful desires may promise temporary satisfaction, it is crucial to recognize their true nature and turn away from them. The commentary highlights the need for repentance, self-denial, and a transformation guided by the Holy Spirit to lead a new life in Christ.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "that ye put off...as regards your former conversation" - The act of putting off the old man is decisive and should be understood as a gradual process in the context of one's former way of life.

2. "the old man which is being corrupted" - The old man refers to one's former unconverted self, and the corruption is better understood as inward "waxing corrupt" rather than an outward destination to perdition.

3. "the lusts of deceit" - The lusts are personified as servants and instruments of deceit, emphasizing the contrast to the holiness of truth.

(Note: The commentary is quite lengthy and complex, so these quotes provide a concise summary of key points.)

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The emphasis is on the verb, which is used of throwing off garments."
2. "This putting off of the old man is indispensable, because in their former way of life this old man was, as it were, the garment in which they were clothed."

### John Gill:
1. "The putting off of the old man is not a removing him from the saints, nor a destroying him in them, nor a changing his nature; but it is a putting him off from his seat, and a putting him down from his government." 

2. "The change lies not in the old man, who can never be altered, but in the conversation; he is put off, but he is not put out."

3. "The old man, or the vitiosity of nature, has its lusts; and these are deceitful; they promise pleasure and profit, but yield neither in the end."

These quotes highlight the concept of putting off the old man, which refers to rejecting the sinful nature and its corrupt desires. It emphasizes that the change is not in the old man itself, but in one's behavior and way of life. The commentary also warns about the deceitful nature of the old man's lusts, which may promise temporary satisfaction but ultimately lead to disappointment.

### John Wesley:
1. "The old man - That is, the whole body of sin."
2. "All sinful desires are deceitful; promising the happiness which they cannot give."
3. "Sinful desires are like a cunning deceiver, luring us with false promises of happiness."
