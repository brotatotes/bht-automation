## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The distinction between ἀνακαίνωσις and ἀνανέωσις is not (as Olsh.) beside the purpose here, but important. The reference in καινός (novus) to the objective is prominent, in νέος (recens) to the subjective."
2. "The fact is, that in the N. T. the πνεῦμα of man is only then used ‘sensu proprio,’ as worthy of its place and governing functions, when it is one Spirit with the Lord."
3. "Thus then the disciples of Christ are ἀνανεούμενοι, undergoing a process of renewal in the life of God, by the agency of the πνεῦμα of their minds, the restored and divinely-informed leading principle of their νοῦς, just as the children of the world are walking in the ματαιότης of their minds."
