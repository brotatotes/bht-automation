# Ephesians 4:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse being described is about the concept of the "new man" or the transformation that occurs when someone becomes a follower of Christ. This transformation involves a complete change of heart, mind, and character, leading to a life of holiness and righteousness. It is not a limited change, but a call for all believers to live a life that reflects the image of God and is set apart from the ways of the world. The aim is to honor God and bring glory to His name through our actions and behavior.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The doctrine of the restoration to us of the divine image in Christ, as here implied, is not to be overlooked."
2. "The image of God in Christ is a far more glorious thing than Adam ever had, or could have had: but still the κατʼ εἰκόνα θεοῦ, = κατὰ θεόν, is true of both."
3. "The new birth alone leads to ἐπίγνωσις: all knowledge which proceeds not from renewal of heart, is but outward appearance."

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Put on not merely a renovated nature, but a new, that is, altogether different nature, a changed nature."
2. "God's image in which the first Adam was originally created, is restored, to us far more gloriously in the second Adam, the image of the invisible God."
3. "Holiness flowing from sincere following of 'the truth of God': opposed to 'the lusts of deceit'; compare also Ephesians 4:21, 'truth is in Jesus'."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The new man refers to the renovated nature...He has new feelings, principles, and desires."

### John Calvin:
1. "Be renewed in the spirit, or, be renewed within or completely, — beginning with the mind, which appears to be the part most free from all taint of sin."
