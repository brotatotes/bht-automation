# Ephesians 4:26 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, we are instructed to handle anger in a righteous and controlled manner. The verse advises us not to let anger lead us into sin but to maintain a sense of awe and self-control. It acknowledges that anger can be a natural reaction but cautions against allowing it to escalate into hatred or revenge. Instead, we are encouraged to address our anger in a timely manner, resolving conflicts and reconciling with others before the day is over.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Be ye angry and sin not." - The first imperative is assumptive, rather than permissive, indicating that if anger must be present, it should be controlled and not lead to sin.
2. "Let the sun not set upon your irritation." - There should be a speedy limit to one's anger towards a brother, as nature itself prescribes the solemn season when you part from that brother, possibly never to meet again in this lifetime.

1. "Anger is a passion too common to need any description. It is an excitement or agitation of mind, of more or less violence, produced by the reception of a real or supposed injury, and attended commonly with a desire or purpose of revenge."
2. "Anger may be excited against a 'thing' as well as a 'person;' as well against an act as a 'man.' We are suddenly excited by a wrong 'thing,' without any malignancy against the 'man;' we may wish to rebuke or chide 'that,' without injuring 'him.'"
3. "Do not cherish anger. Do not sleep upon it. Do not harbor a purpose of revenge; do not cherish ill-will against another. 'When the sun sets on a man’s anger, he may be sure it is wrong.'"
