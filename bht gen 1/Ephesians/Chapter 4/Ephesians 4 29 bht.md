# Ephesians 4:29 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Let your speech be uplifting and beneficial, focusing on edification and progress. Use words that are profitable and suitable for the present need, being mindful of the impact they have on others. Avoid corrupt and worthless communication, for it hinders the grace that should be conveyed through our words. Instead, let your speech minister grace and be a means of conveying God's grace to the hearts of those who hear.
