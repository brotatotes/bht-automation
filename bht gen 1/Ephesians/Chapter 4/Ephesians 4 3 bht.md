# Ephesians 4:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Bible verse encourages Christians to be united in temper and affection, to strive for unity of feeling and be filled with the same love and peace. This unity is created by the Holy Spirit and is maintained by the bond of peace. Christians should diligently work towards preserving this unity, as it is valuable for the glory of God, the comfort of believers, and requires love as its foundation. Maintaining peace and seeking things that promote unity and spiritual growth are essential in keeping the unity of the Spirit.
