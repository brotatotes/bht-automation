# Ephesians 4:30 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse encourages believers to not grieve the Holy Spirit, who is represented by commentators as a loving and sympathetic presence. This means avoiding behaviors that cause sorrow or displeasure to the Spirit, such as corrupt speech or disobedience. Instead, believers are urged to dwell joyfully with the Spirit and heed its promptings, as it acts as a seal, distinguishing them as God's children. The verse also speaks of the day of redemption, which commentators interpret as the day of judgment when believers' redemption will be fully realized.
