### Henry Alford:
1. "One Lord (as the Head of the Church: in this verse he grounds the co-existence of the ἓν σῶμα κ . ἓν πνεῦμα in the three great facts on which it rests the first objective, εἷς κύριος." 
2. "One faith (in that one Lord: the subjective medium by which that one Lord is apprehended and appropriated: not ‘fides quæ creditur,’ but ‘fides quâ creditur:’ but it is necessarily understood, that this subjective faith has for its object the One Lord just mentioned)." 
3. "One baptism (the objective seal of the subjective faith, by which, as a badge, the members of Christ are outwardly and visibly stamped with His name."

### Albert Barnes:

2. "There is no better way of promoting unity among Christians than by reminding them that they have the same Saviour... let them feel that they have one Lord and Saviour, and they will lay aside their contentions and be one again."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The principle of faith; not that which is believed - the body of Christian doctrine, which does not promote unity."
2. "Baptism is emphasized instead of the Eucharist, because the latter assumes and recognizes unity as an established fact; while faith and baptism precede that fact, and are essential to it."
3. "Baptism, moreover, is not administered to the Church as a body, but to individuals, and therefore emphasizes the exhortation to each member to be in vital union with the whole body."

### John Calvin:

3.

### John Wesley:
