# Ephesians 4:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
From various commentators, we learn that this Bible verse focuses on the distribution of gifts within the body of Christ. Each person is given a particular gift or grace from Christ, according to their individual needs and abilities. These gifts are intended not only for personal growth but also for the benefit of the whole community. While the gifts may differ from one another, their purpose is to serve the common good and maintain unity within the Church. It is through the collective use of these diverse gifts that the body of Christ is strengthened and edified.
