## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Every part of that ark, every stone of that hill, was full of spiritual meaning. Every note struck on the lyres of the sweet singers of Israel, is but part of a chord, deep and world-wide, sounding from the golden harps of redemption."
2. "The ascending in the Psalm is that of God, whose presence was symbolized by the ark, to Zion. The Apostle changes the words from the 2nd person to the 3rd; the address asserting a fact, which fact he cites."
3. "In the interpretation, they were God’s enemies, Satan and his hosts, as Chr., ποίαν αἰχμαλωσίαν φησί ; τὴν τοῦ διαβόλου . αἰχμάλωτον τὸν τύραννον ἔλαβε , τὸν διάβολον καὶ τὸν θάνατον καὶ τὴν ἀρὰν καὶ τὴν ἁμαρτίαν."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Christ ascending to heaven, who is therefore GOD."
2. "In the antitypical meaning, the foes of Christ the Son of David, the devil, death, the curse, and sin."
3. "The impartation of the gifts and graces of the Spirit depended on Christ's ascension."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "To 'prove' that, he adduces this passage from Psalms 68:18."
2. "The 'ascending on high,' therefore, in the Psalm, refers, as it seems to me, to the ascent of the symbol of the Divine Presence accompanying the ark on Mount Zion, or to the placing it 'on high' above all its foes."
3. "When Christ ascended to heaven, he triumphed ever all his foes. It was a complete victory over the malice of the great enemy of God, and over those who had sought his life. But he did more. He rescued those who were the captives of Satan, and led them in triumph."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The Psalm is Messianic, a hymn of victory in which God is praised for victory and deliverance."
2. "The captives are not the redeemed, but the enemies of Christ's kingdom, Satan, Sin, and Death."
3. "His point is the distribution of grace by Christ in varied measure to individuals."

### John Calvin:
1. "The whole Psalm may be regarded as anἐπίνικιον, a song of triumph, which David sings to God on account of the victories which he had obtained; but, taking occasion from the narrative of his own exploits, he makes a passing survey of the astonishing deliverances which the Lord had formerly wrought for his people."
2. "The flesh is apt to imagine that God remains idle and asleep, when he does not openly execute his judgments. To the view of men, when the Church is oppressed, God is in some manner humbled; but, when he stretches out his avenging arm for her deliverance, he then appears to rouse himself, and to ascend his throne of judgment."
3. "The noblest triumph which God ever gained was when Christ, after subduing sin, conquering death, and putting Satan to flight, rose majestically to heaven, that he might exercise his glorious reign over the Church."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The change to the third person is natural; the main difficulty is found in the last clause (which see). That the Psalm was prophetic is quite obvious. It was probably composed after a victory, and probably first used in bringing the ark to Mount Zion after such a victory. This gives it at once a theocratic and Messianic character." 
2. "The application here undoubtedly is to the enemies of Christ who have been overcome, either (1) men who have become His servants (comp. the correct sense of 2 Corinthians 2:14), previously prisoners of Satan; or (2) Satan, sin, and death, whom He had conquered through His death and resurrection."
3. "The gifts consist in men, His captives,’ to whom He has given gifts of grace, that they themselves may and can become gifts to men in wider circles’ (Braune)."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The quotation is from Psalms 68:18, a Messianic Psalm of victory which Paul adapts and interprets for Christ's triumph over death."
2. "He led captivity captive (ηιχμαλωτευσεν αιχμαλωσιαν). Cognate accusative of αιχμαλωσιαν, late word, in N.T. only here and Revelation 13:10."
3. "The verb also (αιχμαλωτευω) is from the old word αιχμαλωτος, captive in war (in N.T. only in Luke 4:18), in LXX and only here in N.T."

### John Gill:
1. "The Messiah's ascension to heaven... being from Mount Olivet, attended by angels, in the sight of his apostles, after he had conversed with them from the time of his resurrection forty days."
2. "Christ's conquests and triumph over sin, Satan, the world, death, and the grave; and indeed, every spiritual enemy of his and his people."
3. "The gifts of the Holy Ghost, and particularly such as qualify men for the work of the ministry; these he received in human nature, in that nature in which he ascended to heaven."

### John Wesley:
1. "Having ascended on high, he led captivity captive - He triumphed over all his enemies, Satan, sin, and death, which had before enslaved all the world."
2. "Alluding to the custom of ancient conquerors, who led those they had conquered in chains after them."
3. "And, as they also used to give donatives to the people, at their return from victory, so he gave gifts to men - Both the ordinary and extraordinary gifts of the Spirit."
