# Ephesians 4:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, it is evident that there was a prior descent before the ascension. The commentators emphasize that the descent refers to Christ's incarnation and humiliation on earth. His descent to the lowest parts of the earth, whether it be the virgin's womb or the grave, is seen as an essential step for his ultimate ascension back to heaven. This act of descending and ascending signifies Christ's fulfillment of his divine mission and his capacity to distribute gifts to humanity.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1) "The Ascension here spoken of was not a first exaltation, but a return to heaven of one who dwelt in heaven."
2) "The ascent implied a previous descent."
3) "The greater the descent, the greater the ascent: and if the αἰχμαλωσία consisted of Satan and his powers, the warfare in which they were taken captive would most naturally be contemplated in all its extent, as reaching to their habitation itself."

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Paul reasons that (assuming Him to be God) His ascent implies a previous descent; and that the language of the Psalm can only refer to Christ, who first descended, then ascended."
2. "The antithesis or contrast to 'far above all heavens,' is the argument of ALFORD and others, to show that this phrase means more than simply the earth, namely, the regions beneath it, even as He ascended not merely to the visible heavens, but 'far above' them."
3. "Christ, as Lord of all, took possession first of the earth, the unseen world beneath it, then of heaven."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It is affirmed in the Psalm that he 'ascended' - 'Thou hast ascended on high.' This implies that there must have been a previous 'descent'; or, as applicable to the Messiah, 'it is a truth that he previously descended.'"
2. "The language used here will appropriately express his descent to earth. Into the lower parts of the earth - To the lowest state of humiliation."
3. "He came not only to the earth, but he stooped to the most humble condition of humanity here; see Philippians 2:6-8; compare notes on Isaiah 44:23."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "By descending into the depths and ascending above all, He entered upon His function of filling the whole universe, in virtue of which function He distributes gifts to men." 
2. "His ascent implies a previous descent." 
3. "The reference is to Christ's descent into Hades."

### John Calvin:
1. "But neither can it be denied, that the expression bears a reference to some kind of humiliation on the part of God which had previously existed. It is this humiliation which Paul justly infers from the declaration that God had ascended."
2. "If ever there was a time when, after appearing to lay aside the brightness of his power, God ascended gloriously, it was when Christ was raised from our lowest condition on earth, and received into heavenly glory."
3. "To torture them so as to make them mean purgatory or hell, is exceedingly foolish. The argument taken from the comparative degree, 'the lower parts,' is quite untenable. A comparison is drawn, not between one part of the earth and another, but between the whole earth and heaven; as if he had said, that from that lofty habitation Christ descended into our deep gulf."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "It is assumed, since the reference in the Old Testament is to God, and here to the Messiah, that heaven is the point of departure and place of return for Him who is spoken of."
2. "This is the original dwelling place of Christ (John 3:13), and He could not ascend to give gifts to men without previously descending."
3. "But whither? Paul says, into the lower parts of the earth. It is quite grammatical to explain this as, ‘the lower parts, namely, the earth,’ and this is all that is necessarily involved in what precedes."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Paul picks out the verb αναβας (second aorist active participle of αναβαινω, to go up), changes its form to ανεβη (second aorist indicative), and points the article (το) at it." 
2. "If the αναβας is the Ascension of Christ, then the καταβας would be the Descent (Incarnation) to earth and της γης would be the genitive of apposition." 
3. "Otherwise one must think of the death of Christ (the descent into Hades of Acts 2:31)."

### John Gill:
1. "These words are a conclusion of Christ's descent from heaven, from his ascension thither; for had he not first descended from thence, it could not have been said of him that he ascended."
2. "It may rather design the whole of his humiliation, as his descent from heaven and incarnation in the virgin's womb, where his human nature was curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the earth."
3. "The spirits or souls of the patriarchs returned to God that gave them, when separated from their bodies, as the souls of men do now."

### John Wesley:
1. "He ascended, what is it, but that he descended — That is, does it not imply, that he descended first? Certainly it does, on the supposition of his being God."
2. "Otherwise it would not: since all the saints will ascend to heaven, though none of them descended thence."
3. "Into the lower parts of the earth — So the womb is called, Psalm 139:15; the grave, Psalm 63:9."
