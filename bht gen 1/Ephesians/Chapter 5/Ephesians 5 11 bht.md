# Ephesians 5:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Bible verse in question emphasizes the need for believers to distance themselves from unfruitful works and the darkness they represent. It calls for a rejection of fellowship with those who engage in wrongdoing and instead urges believers to actively reprove and confront them. This requires shining a light on the darkness through both words and deeds, holding others accountable and seeking to bring about change and correction. Merely avoiding association with those who commit sins is not enough; believers are called to take an active stand against wrongdoing by reproving it.

2. "Plants cannot bear 'fruit' in the absence of light. Sin is 'darkness,' and its parent is the prince of darkness."

### John Calvin:
1. "It is not enough that we do not, of our own accord, undertake anything wicked. We must beware of joining or assisting those who do wrong. In short, we must abstain from giving any consent, or advice, or approbation, or assistance; for in all these ways we have fellowship."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Have no fellowship with... works." - This verse emphasizes the need to avoid any partnership or association with unfruitful works. It urges believers to distance themselves from actions that do not align with their faith.

2. "Unfruitful... darkness." - The commentary draws a parallel between unfruitful works and darkness. Just as darkness lacks light and productivity, unfruitful works lack the positive impact and growth that come from living in the light of God's truth.

3. "Reprove... darkness." - The commentary highlights the importance of exposing and convicting darkness through the light of God's truth. Believers are called to shine a light on the darkness around them, bringing it to light and challenging its influence.

### John Gill:
1. "Fellowship is not to be maintained 'with the works of darkness'; which are sins, so called, because they are opposite to light... and because they are generally committed in the dark; and because the effect and consequence of them is utter darkness, and blackness of darkness." 

2. "No fellowship should be had with them, by committing the same, by assisting in them, by consenting to them, by approving of them, by receiving any worldly advantage from them, and by winking and conniving at them."

3. "Rather reprove [them]; both by words and by deeds, by an agreeable life and conversation... because it is not a brother, but such who are in darkness, and live in works of darkness; yea, not sinners, but sins are to be reproved, which can be done no other way; nor are all saints proper to reprove verbally, nor are they qualified for it; but all should, and may by facts; and the light discovers darkness, by its own splendour."

### John Wesley:
1. "Reprove them" - This implies that simply avoiding those who engage in wrongdoing is not sufficient. It is important to confront and challenge them, holding them accountable for their actions.

2. "To avoid them is not enough" - Merely distancing oneself from those who engage in wrongdoing does not address the root of the problem. It is necessary to take a proactive stance and actively reprove them, seeking to bring about change and correction.

3. "Reprove them" - This phrase emphasizes the importance of speaking up against wrongdoing. It suggests that silence or passivity in the face of evil is not acceptable, and that it is our responsibility to confront and challenge those who engage in it.
