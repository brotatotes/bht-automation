# Ephesians 5:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Bible verse in question emphasizes the power of light in exposing hidden truths and transforming lives. The light of our Christian lives, through reproof and faithful reproofs, brings to light and transforms actions that were once shrouded in darkness. This light, whether from the word of God, the preaching of ministers, or the courageous actions of believers, reveals the true nature of actions and brings them out of the category of darkness into the light. It is through this light that sins are reproved and made manifest, for everything that is made manifest is light.
