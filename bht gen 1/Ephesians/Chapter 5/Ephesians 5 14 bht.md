## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Every thing that is made manifest becomes light, is shone upon by the detecting light of Christ, objectively, it only remains that the man should be shone upon inwardly by the same Christ revealed in his awakened heart." 
2. "Awake, thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall shine upon thee." 
3. "The Apostle cites, and had a perfect right to cite, the language of prophecy in the light of the fulfilment of prophecy: and that he is here doing so, the bare word ‘Christ’ shews us beyond dispute."

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Seeing that light (spiritual) dispels the pre-existing darkness, He (God) saith..."
2. "The words are a paraphrase of Isaiah 60:1; Isaiah 60:2, not an exact quotation."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Be separate from sinners. Come out from among the pagan. Do not mingle with their abominations; do not name them. You are the children of light; and God says to you, awake from false security, rouse from the death of sin, and Christ shall enlighten you."

2. "Awake thou that sleepest - Arouse from a state of slumber and false security. 'Sleep and death' are striking representations of the state in which people are by nature. In 'sleep' we are, though living, insensible to any danger that may be near; we are unconscious of what may he going on around us; we hear not the voice of our friends; we see not the beauty of the grove or the landscape; we are forgetful of our real character and condition. So With the sinner."

3. "And arise from the dead - The state of the sinner, is often compared to death; see the notes on Ephesians 2:1. People are by nature dead in sins; yet they must rouse from this condition, or they will perish. How singular, it may be said, to call upon the dead to rise! How could they raise themselves up? Yet God speak thus to people, and commands them to rise from the death of sin."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "This use of the personal pronoun is frequent in Paul's writings." 
2. "The quotation is probably a combination and free rendering of Isaiah 60:1; Isaiah 26:19."

### John Calvin:
1. "He first exhibits Christ as speaking by his ministers; for this is the ordinary message which is every day delivered by preachers of the gospel." 
2. "The allusion, I have no doubt, is to the prophecies which relate to Christ’s kingdom; such as that of Isaiah, 'Arise, shine; for thy light is come, and the glory of Jehovah is risen upon thee.'" 
3. "All that is intended is to show that, when Christ enlightens us, we rise from death to life."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The Apostle would show by this paraphrase from the Old Testament, not only that the effect of the light is as he has described, but that this is a reason why Christians should reprove, since thus others may become light through the illumination which Christ promises."
2. "Let your light shine, so as to reprove, in the hope that Christ will shine upon the convicted heart."
3. "The figure is that of the morning sun; comp. Isaiah 60:1-2. Here we have combined the two sides of human action and Divine power."
