This verse emphasizes the importance of being mindful and intentional in our daily walk. We are called to take heed not only of the strictness of our walk, but also of the quality and direction it takes.

We are to be wise and circumspect, guided by God's Word and demonstrating consistency and righteousness in our actions.

### Henry Alford:
1. "Take heed, of what sort your ἀκριβῶς περιπατεῖν is: the implication being, 'take heed not only that your walk be exact, strict, but also of what sort that strictness is not only that you have a rule, and keep to it, but that that rule be the best one.'"
2. "Buying up for yourselves (the) opportunity: let it not pass by, but as merchants carefully looking out for vantages, make it your own."
3. "The days of your time, in which you live, are evil: therefore, buy up the opportunity to counteract the evil and use it for godliness."

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "See how ye walk," &c. The double idea is compressed into one sentence: "See (take heed) how ye walk," and "See that ye walk circumspectly." The manner, as well as the act itself, is included.
2. "See how ye are walking, with a view to your being circumspect (literally, accurate, exact) in your walk."
3. "Walk in wisdom (answering to 'as wise' here) toward them that are without" (answering to "circumspectly," that is, correctly, in relation to the unbelievers around, not giving occasion of stumbling to any, but edifying all by a consistent walk).

### Albert Barnes:
