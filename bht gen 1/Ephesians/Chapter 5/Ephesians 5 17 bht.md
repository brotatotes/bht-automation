# Ephesians 5:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, believers are exhorted to live wisely, understanding the will of the Lord and not acting foolishly. They are encouraged to discern the true nature of God's revelation, separating truth from error, and comprehending the scope of His divine plan. This understanding goes beyond mere knowledge and compels us to actively seek and do the will of the Lord in all areas of our lives, with humility and surrender. It is through this pursuit of wisdom and discernment that we triumph over the obstacles set by Satan and walk circumspectly, pleasing God in everything we do.
