This instruction highlights the importance of sincere worship from the heart, rather than mere outward expression.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The Spirit gives true eloquence; wine, a spurious eloquence."
2. "Contrast the drunken 'songs,' James 5:13- :."
3. "Let your songs be not the drinking songs of heathen feasts, but psalms and hymns; and their accompaniment, not the music of the lyre, but the melody of the heart."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Speaking among yourselves, that is, endeavoring to edify one another, and to promote purity of heart, by songs of praise."
2. "The Psalms of David were sung by the Jews at the temple, and by the early Christians, and the singing of those psalms has constituted a delightful part of public worship in all ages."
3. "An 'ode' is properly a short poem or song adapted to be set to music, or to be sung; a lyric poem. In what way these were sung, it is now vain to conjecture."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Speaking to yourselves [λαλουντες εαυτοις]. The meaning is as in Colossians 3:13, and Rev. is better."
2. "The A. V. is literally correct, but is open to the misinterpretation each one communing with himself."

### John Calvin:
1. "The Spirit means 'joy in the Holy Ghost,' (Romans 14:17;) and the exhortation, be ye filled, (ver. 18,) alludes to deep drinking, with which it is indirectly contrasted."
2. "Nor does he enjoin them to sing inwardly or alone; for he immediately adds, singing in your hearts; as if he had said, 'Let your praises be not merely on the tongue, as hypocrites do, but from the heart.'"
3. "The appellation spiritual, given to these songs, is strikingly appropriate; for the songs most frequently used are almost always on trifling subjects, and very far from being chaste."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The reciprocal influence on their hearts is meant; and that in social intercourse as well as in their public assemblies."
2. "There is no warrant for confining public praise to the use of the Old Testament psalms, or of paraphrases of other Scripture passages."
3. "The view which takes this clause as subordinate to the preceding part of the verse is open to objection. It usually explains 'in your heart' as = heartily, which is incorrect."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "To the Lord (τω Κυριω). The Lord Jesus." - This quote highlights that "the Lord" refers to Jesus, emphasizing his deity and divine nature.

2. "And by 'hymns' we are to understand, not such as are made by good men, without the inspiration of the Spirit of God; since they are placed between psalms and spiritual songs, made by men inspired by the Holy Ghost."
3. "And by 'spiritual songs' are meant the same Psalms of David, Asaph, c. and the titles of many of them are songs, and sometimes a psalm and song, and song and psalm, a song of degrees together with all other Scriptural songs, written by inspired men."

### John Wesley:
1. "By there being no inspired songs, peculiarly adapted to the Christian dispensation, as there were to the Jewish, it is evident that the promise of the Holy Ghost to believers, in the last days, was by his larger effusion to supply the lack of it."
2. "Singing with your hearts — As well as your voice."
3. "To the Lord — Jesus, who searcheth the heart."
