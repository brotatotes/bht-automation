# Ephesians 5:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, there is a call to believers to live a life characterized by love. They are encouraged to imitate God's love and the love that Christ has demonstrated towards them. Christ's sacrificial death on the cross is emphasized as the ultimate expression of love, bringing about reconciliation between God and humanity. The believers are also urged to love one another, as it is an evidence of their faith and a vital aspect of Christian living. This love encompasses their love for God, love for Christ, and love for their fellow believers.

Note: The commentary provided is quite lengthy, so I have selected three quotes that I believe capture the essence of the commentary and provide valuable insights into the verse.

1. "We ought to embrace each other with that love with which Christ has embraced us, for what we perceive in Christ is our true guide."

1. "And walk in love,.... To God; to which the saints are obliged, not only by the law of God, which requires it, but by the goodness of God, and the discoveries of his love to them."
2. "the saints should walk in love to Christ; who is to be loved fervently, constantly, in sincerity, with all the heart, and above all creatures and things; because of the loveliness of his person, the love he bears to them, and the things he has done for them, and the relations he stands in to them."
3. "and also they should walk in love to one another, which is chiefly designed; which is Christ's new commandment, and is an evidence of regeneration; and without which a profession of religion is in vain."
