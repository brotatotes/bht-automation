# Ephesians 5:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this passage, believers are called to submit themselves to one another in their relationships within the church. This submission is not meant to be a blind obedience to leaders, but rather a recognition of the respect and honor due to them. It is to be done in the fear of God, with a reverence and obedience that aligns with His will. The motivation for this submission is the love of Christ, which should compel believers to humbly serve and submit to one another.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The believer passes from under the bondage of the law as a letter, to be 'the servant of Christ' (1 Peter 5:5), which, through the instinct of love to Him, is really to be 'the Lord's freeman'; for he is 'under the law to Christ' (1 Corinthians 9:21, compare John 8:36)."
2. "Christ, not the Father (John 5:22), is to be our judge."
3. "Thus reverential fear of displeasing Him is the motive for discharging our relative duties as Christians (1 Corinthians 10:22, 2 Corinthians 5:11, 1 Peter 2:13)."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Maintaining due subordination in the various relations of life."
2. "The general meaning here is, that Christianity does not break up the relations of life, and produce disorder, lawlessness, and insubordination."
3. "Infidelity is always disorganizing; Christianity, never."

### John Calvin:
1. "God has bound us so strongly to each other, that no man ought to endeavor to avoid subjection; and where love reigns, mutual services will be rendered."
2. "It is highly proper that all should be exhorted to be subject to each other in their turn."
3. "He directs us to the fear of Christ, who alone can subdue our fierceness, that we may not refuse the yoke, and can humble our pride, that we may not be ashamed of serving our neighbors."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Submitting yourselves one to another. While this precept is expounded in several directions in the sections which follow, it stands here as a fourth qualification of being ‘filled with the Spirit’."
2. "The connection of thought is, however, not obvious. The view of Ellicott is safe: he finds here named a comprehensive duty in regard to man, the exact connecting link being ‘thanking God for all things (for sorrows as well, submitting yourselves to Him, yea) submitting yourselves to one another.’"
3. "The fear of Christ; so all the early manuscripts. This is to be the controlling sentiment in the submission. The phrase is rare, and marks the tender, reverent attitude to Him as Head of the Body, rather than as Judge."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Subjecting yourselves to one another" - This phrase emphasizes the mutual submission and humility that should characterize relationships among believers. It calls for a willingness to yield and serve one another, rather than seeking dominance or control.

2. "Present middle participle of υποτασσω" - This grammatical explanation highlights the specific form and tense of the verb used in the verse. It helps to understand the original Greek language and the intended meaning of the phrase.

3. "Coordinate with the preceding participles of praise and prayer" - This observation suggests that the call to mutual submission is closely connected to the themes of praise and prayer mentioned earlier in the passage. It implies that submitting to one another is an act of worship and a way to honor God.

### John Gill:
1. "Submitting yourselves one to another... in an ecclesiastic sense, so the Ethiopic version renders it, 'subject yourselves to your brethren': thus members of churches should be subject to their pastors, not in the same sense as they are to Christ, the head, nor are they obliged to believe or do everything they say, right or wrong; yet honour and esteem are due to them, and submission and obedience should be yielded to their doctrines, precepts, and exhortations, when they are agreeably to the word of God."
2. "Submission should be on account of the fear of God, and so far as is consistent with it; and indeed, the fear of God is that which should influence and engage to every duty; and which should be before our eyes, and in exercise in our hearts, in all concerns, civil and religious."
3. "For his sake there should be a submission to one another; the Syriac version reads, in the love of Christ, which should constrain the saints to this duty."
