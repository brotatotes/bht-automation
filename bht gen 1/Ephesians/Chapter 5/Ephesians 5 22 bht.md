# Ephesians 5:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, wives are encouraged to submit to their husbands, not only as an act of obedience to Christ, but also because the husband holds a position of authority and leadership within the marriage, just as Christ is the head of the church. This submission is rooted in the special and unique bond shared between husband and wife, emphasizing the personal relationship in which this duty is grounded. It is important for wives to honor and respect their husbands, acknowledging their role as the head of the household, while still maintaining their own individual relationship with God.
