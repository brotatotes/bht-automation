# Ephesians 5:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The husband is the head, governor, and protector of his wife, mirroring Christ's role as the head of the church. This entails providing, preserving, and protecting the family. Just as Christ is the Savior of the church, the husband is called to be a savior in a different sense, offering love, support, and salvation to his wife and family. It is through his leadership and sacrificial love that the family finds guidance, security, and spiritual growth.
