## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Let it not be even named among you, as becometh saints." 
2. "Obscenity and foolish talking...including not merely the πᾶν ῥῆμα ἀργόν of our Lord, but in good part also the πᾶς λόγος σαπρός of his Apostle."
3. "Your true cheerfulness and play of fancy will be found, not in buffoonery, but in the joy of a heart overflowing with a sense of God's mercies."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Uncleanness" and "covetousness" are taken up again from Ephesians 5:12. The two are so closely allied that the Greek for "covetousness" is used sometimes in Scripture, and often in the Greek Fathers, for sins of impurity.
2. The common principle is the longing to fill one's desire with material objects of sense, outside of God.
3. The expression, "not be even named," applies better to impurity, than to "covetousness."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The covetous man, according to Paul, is to be ranked with the sensual, and with idolaters...Is this the estimate in which the vice is held now? Is it the view which professing Christians take of it? Do we not feel that there is a 'great' difference between a covetous man and a man of impure and licentious life? Why is this? Because: (1) It is so common; (2) Because it is found among those who make pretensions to refinement and even religion; (3) Because it is not so easy to define what is covetousness, as it is to define impurity of life; and, (4) Because the public conscience is seared, and the mind blinded to the low and grovelling character of the sin."
2. "Yet, is not the view of Paul the right view? Who is a covetous man? A man who, in the pursuit of gold, neglects his soul, his intellect, and his heart. A man who, in this insatiable pursuit, is regardless of justice, truth, charity, faith, prayer, peace, comfort, usefulness, conscience; and who shall say that there is any vice more debasing or degrading than this?"
3. "The time 'may' come, therefore, when the covetous man will be regarded as deserving the same rank in the public estimation with the most vicious, and when to covet will be considered as much opposed to the spirit of the gospel as any of the vices here named."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Covetousness, or the desire for what belongs to others, is a sin that stands out on its own, separate from the other sins mentioned. It is a sin that can lead to many other sins, as it reflects a heart that is not content with what God has provided."

2. "By highlighting covetousness, the verse reminds us that all sins, whether they are listed or not, are ultimately rooted in a desire for something that is not rightfully ours. It is a reminder that our hearts need to be guarded against the temptation to envy and covet what others have."

3. "This verse serves as a warning against the dangers of covetousness, as it is a sin that can easily go unnoticed or be justified in our society. It reminds us that true contentment and satisfaction can only be found in God, and that we should strive to be grateful for what He has given us."

### John Calvin:
1. "Three things are here enumerated, which the apostle desires Christians to hold in such abhorrence, that they shall not even be named, or, in other words, shall be entirely unknown among them."
2. "By uncleanness he means all base and impure lusts; so that this word differs from fornication, only as the whole class differs from a single department."
3. "To this precept he adds the authoritative declaration, that he demands nothing from them but that which becometh saints, — manifestly excluding from the number and fellowship of the saints all fornicators, and impure and covetous persons."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Fornication; to be taken in its strict sense, since this was scarcely accounted a sin among the heathen of that time."
2. "Or covetousness. 'Or' sets this sin by itself, giving special emphasis to the prohibition, while the mention of it here indicates its close connection with sensual sins."
3. "Let it not be even named among you. 'It' refers to each of the sins mentioned. None of them should be talked about unnecessarily."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Covetousness is debasing, like sensuality, and is not fitting for a saint." 
2. "It is unbecoming for a saint to be sensual or covetous." 
3. "Saints should not engage in covetousness, as it goes against their holy nature."

### John Gill:
1. "The first of these, which is simple 'fornication', is the sin which is committed between single or unmarried persons; and is contrary to the law of God, is a work of the flesh, and is against a man's own body."
2. "'All uncleanness' takes in adultery, incest, sodomy, and every unnatural lust."
3. "'Covetousness' seems not so much to design that sin which is commonly so called, namely, an immoderate desire after worldly things, as a greedy and insatiable appetite after the above lusts."

### John Wesley:
1. "Impure love should not even be named or heard of among you." This emphasizes the importance of maintaining purity and avoiding any form of immoral or sinful love.
2. "Keep at the utmost distance from it, as becometh saints." This highlights the need for believers to distance themselves from impure love, as it goes against the standards of holiness expected of them.
3. "As becometh saints." This phrase reminds believers that their conduct should align with their identity as saints, reflecting the character and values of God in their relationships and interactions.
