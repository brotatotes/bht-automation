# Ephesians 5:30 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse describes an intimate and inseparable union between Christ and the Church. Our spiritual relationship with Christ is depicted as being one with His flesh and bones, emphasizing the depth of this connection. This union goes beyond physical attributes, as it is rooted in a profound and spiritual bond. Christ nourishes and cherishes the Church, and we are intimately united with Him in a spiritual sense. This relationship is stronger and more powerful than any other, surpassing even the love one has for their own flesh and bones.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "As the woman owed her natural being to the man, her source and head, so we owe our entire spiritual being to Christ, our source and head."
2. "We in our entire spiritual relation, body, soul, and Spirit, are one with Christ, God manifested in our humanity, parts and members of His glorified Body."
3. "His leaving the Fatherâ€™s bosom, which is past; His gradual preparation of the union, which is present; His full consummation of it, which is future."

Note: The commentary is quite lengthy, so I have selected three quotes that provide a concise and meaningful understanding of the verse.

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Christ nourisheth and cherisheth the Church as being of one flesh with Him."
2. "Adam's deep sleep, wherein Eve was formed from out of his opened side, is an emblem of Christ's death, which was the birth of the Spouse, the Church."
3. "It is not our bones and flesh, but 'we' that are spiritually propagated (in our soul and spirit now, and in the body hereafter, regenerated) from the manhood of Christ which has flesh and bones."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The Scriptures make use of language which is stronger than that employed to describe any other connection; and there is no union of affection so powerful as that which binds the Christian to the Saviour."
2. "So strong is it, that he is willing for it to forsake father, mother, and home; to leave his country, and to abandon his possessions; to go to distant lands and dwell among barbarians to make the Redeemer known; or to go to the cross or the stake from simple love to the Saviour."
3. "It is stronger love that that which a man has for his own flesh and bones; for it makes him willing that his flesh should be consumed by fire, or his bones broken on the wheel rather than deny him."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The phrase 'of His flesh and of His bones' emphasizes the intimate and inseparable union between Christ and His Church. It signifies not only a physical connection, but also a spiritual and emotional bond that cannot be broken."
2. "By omitting the mention of 'flesh and bones,' the verse highlights the spiritual nature of the relationship between Christ and His Church. It reminds us that our union with Christ is not based on physical attributes or external appearances, but on a deep and profound connection of the heart and soul."
3. "The omission of 'flesh and bones' suggests that Christ's relationship with His Church is not limited to a mere physical existence, but extends to a spiritual and eternal dimension. It reminds us that our union with Christ transcends the boundaries of this earthly life and is rooted in the eternal love and grace of God."

### John Calvin:
1. "For we are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones." - This statement is not an exaggeration, but a simple truth that highlights our intimate connection to Christ.
2. "He does not simply mean that Christ is a partaker of our nature, but expresses something higher and more emphatic." - The verse goes beyond Christ sharing in our humanity; it signifies a deeper and more profound union with Him.
3. The phrase "of his flesh, and of his bones" emphasizes the physical and tangible aspect of our relationship with Christ, illustrating the closeness and intimacy we have with Him.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "It is His mystical body, made up of members, 'integral parts,' of one organic whole."
2. "The idea of vital union with Christ is included as well as that of the derivation of our spiritual life from Him."
3. "The sacramentarian interpretation... fosters materialistic conceptions of the union, and seeks to explain one mystery by propounding another."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Of his flesh and of his bones" - These words are not considered genuine in the Textus Receptus, but are found in other versions. 

2. "Supported by D G L P cursives Syriac, etc." - The inclusion of these words is supported by various manuscripts and translations. 

3. "Certainly not genuine" - Despite the support from some sources, these words are widely considered to be not authentic to the original text.

### John Gill:
1. "Christ, as man, is of our flesh and of our bones, or a partaker of the same flesh and blood with us; or otherwise, his incarnation would have been of no service to us."
2. "Christ indeed, as God, is the former of all human nature, and, as man, was set up in God's thoughts as the pattern of it."
3. "The church may be called, his own flesh, his flesh and bones, on account of the marriage relation she stands in to him, and that spiritual union there is between them."

(Note: The commentary is quite long, but these quotes capture some of the key insights about the verse.)

### John Wesley:
1. "Christ nourishes and cherishes the church."
2. "Close connection between Christ and the church."
3. "Intimately united to Christ, in a spiritual sense."
