2. "There is no evidence that the marriage connection was originally designed to symbolize or typify this union" - This quote clarifies that while marriage may not have been originally intended to symbolize the union between believers and the Redeemer, it can be used as an illustration to understand the strength of that connection.

3. "The comparison should be confined, however, strictly to the use made of it in the New Testament" - This quote emphasizes the need to interpret the verse in the context of the New Testament, indicating that the understanding of the verse should be limited to its application in the teachings of Jesus and the apostles.

### John Calvin:
1. "As Eve was formed out of the substance of her husband, and thus was a part of himself; so, if we are the true members of Christ, we share his substance, and by this intercourse unite into one body."
2. "Those who talk about the torture exercised on this passage to make it refer to the Lord’s supper, while no mention is made of the supper, but of marriage, are egregiously mistaken."
3. "He shall leave his father and mother. As if he had said, 'Let him rather leave his father and mother than not cleave to his wife.'

### Philip Schaff:
