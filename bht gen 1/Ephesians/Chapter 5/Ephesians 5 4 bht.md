## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Filthiness—obscenity in act or gesture."
2. "Jesting... implies strictly that versatility which turns about and adapts itself, without regard to principle, to the shifting circumstances of the moment, and to the varying moods of those with whom it may deal."
3. "Not scurrile buffoonery, but refined 'persiflage' and 'badinage,' for which Ephesus was famed."
4. "Not such 'as become saints,' rather giving of thanks."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Christians should aim to have their conversation sensible, serious, sincere - remembering the words of the Lord Jesus, 'that every idle word that men shall speak, they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment.'" 
2. "The apostle would not forbid courteousness, or refinement of manners, and the reference, therefore, must be to that which is light and trifling in conversation; to that which is known among us as jesting."
3. "Christians should be grave and serious - though cheerful and pleasant. They should feel that they have great interests at stake, and that the world has too. They are redeemed - not to make sport; purchased with precious blood - for other purposes than to make people laugh."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Words obtain a new earnestness when assumed into the ethical terminology of Christ's school."
2. "Jesting: polished and witty speech as the instrument of sin; refinement and versatility without the flavor of Christian grace."
3. "Sometimes it is lodged in a sly question, in a smart answer, in a quirkish reason, in shrewd intimation, in cunningly diverting or cleverly retorting an objection."

### John Calvin:
1. "By filthiness I understand all that is indecent or inconsistent with the modesty of the godly."
2. "But as it is exceedingly difficult to be witty without becoming satirical, and as jesting itself carries in it a portion of conceit not at all in keeping with the character of a godly man, Paul very properly dissuades from this practice."
3. "All our conversations ought to be, in the true sense of the words, sweet and graceful; and this end will be gained if the useful and the agreeable are properly mingled."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Neither filthiness, or, ‘obscenity;’ whether of thought, word, or deed; in Colossians 3:8 the reference is to words."
2. "Nor foolish talking; insipid, stupid speech, perhaps including more than this: ‘the talk of fools, which is folly and sin together’ (Trench)."
3. "But rather giving of thanks. Either, thanksgiving rather is ‘fitting,’ or, let it be among you (from Ephesians 5:3). The latter is preferable. ‘Thanksgiving’ is not to be explained as ‘gracious speech,’ or ‘devout-ness,’ but means giving of thanks to God."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Filthiness (αισχροτης). Old word from αισχρος (base), here alone in N.T." - This quote explains the origin and rarity of the term "filthiness" used in the verse, highlighting its uniqueness in the New Testament.

2. "Foolish talking (μωρολογια). Late word from μωρολογος (μωροσ, λογος), only here in N.T." - This quote provides insight into the meaning and usage of "foolish talking," emphasizing its limited occurrence in the New Testament.

3. "Jesting (ευτραπελια). Old word from ευτραπελος (ευ, τρεπω, to turn) nimbleness of wit, quickness in making repartee (so in Plato and Plutarch), but in low sense as here ribaldry, scurrility, only here in N.T." - This quote delves into the definition and connotation of "jesting," clarifying its original meaning and its negative sense in the context of the verse.

### John Gill:
1. "Filthy speaking, is a verbal commission of the things that are spoken of; and it may include all impure songs and books, and the reading or hearing of them; this is what the Jews call 'filthiness of the mouth', obscene words."
2. "Foolish talking does not so much design every imprudent thing that is said, as that which is wicked, corrupt, unsavoury, light, vain, idle, and unprofitable; and takes in all fabulous stories, and mimicking of fools in words and gestures."
3. "Instead of these [filthiness, foolish talking, jesting], it is much more suitable and becoming to give thanks to God for temporal and spiritual mercies, and to speak those things which are grateful to good men; this is to use the tongue to much better purpose."

### John Wesley:
1. "Nor foolish talking — Tittle tattle, talking of nothing, the weather, fashions, meat and drink." 
2. "Or jesting — The word properly means, wittiness, facetiousness, esteemed by the heathens an half-virtue." 
3. "But how frequently even this quenches the Spirit, those who are tender of conscience know."
