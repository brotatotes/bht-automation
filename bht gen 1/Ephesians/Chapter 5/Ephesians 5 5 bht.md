# Ephesians 5:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This verse speaks about the sins that can prevent someone from inheriting the kingdom of God. The various commentators emphasize that sexual immorality, greed, and idolatry are among these sins. They highlight how the covetous person's love for wealth can lead them astray from true worship and put their trust in material possessions instead. However, the commentators also mention that it is ultimately the absence of God's grace and righteousness that determines one's exclusion from the kingdom, and not just the presence of these sins.
