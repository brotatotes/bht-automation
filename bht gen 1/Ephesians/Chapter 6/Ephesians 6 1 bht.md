## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

### Philip Schaff:

2. "The baptismal rite does not create, but signifies and seals, the relation to Christ."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The word 'right' (δικαιον) emphasizes the moral correctness and righteousness of the action being described. It conveys the idea that fulfilling this duty is not only a matter of obedience, but also of doing what is morally right and just."

2. "The use of the word 'well-pleasing' (ευαρεστον) in Colossians 3:20 suggests that fulfilling this duty brings joy and satisfaction to both God and the child. It implies that obedience is not a burden, but rather a source of delight and contentment."

3. "By using different words in Colossians 3:20 and Ephesians 6:1, the authors highlight different aspects of the parent-child relationship. While 'right' emphasizes the moral aspect, 'well-pleasing' emphasizes the relational aspect, emphasizing the mutual joy and satisfaction that comes from obedience."

### John Gill:
1. "Children should be subject and obedient in all things lawful, just, and good in everything that is not sinful and unlawful, by the word of God and in things indifferent, as much as in them lies, and even in things which are difficult to perform."
2. "This obedience should be hearty and sincere, and not merely verbal, and in show and appearance, nor mercenary."
3. "It should be 'in the Lord'; which may be considered either as a limitation of the obedience, that it should be in things that are agreeable to the mind and will of the Lord; or as an argument to it, because it is the command of the Lord, and is wellpleasing in his sight, and makes for his glory, and therefore should be done for his sake."
