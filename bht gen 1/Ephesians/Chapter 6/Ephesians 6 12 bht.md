# Ephesians 6:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Bible verse being described is a powerful reminder of the spiritual battle that Christians face. The struggle is not against other people or even against our own human nature. Rather, it is a conflict with the invisible forces of evil that seek to destroy us. These forces, described as the world-rulers of darkness, exercise dominion over the world and its depraved character. They are formidable adversaries, but we are encouraged to be strong in the Lord, putting on the whole armor of God and relying on His power to overcome them.

1. "The apostle does not mean to say that Christians had no enemies among men that opposed them, for they were exposed often to fiery persecution; nor that they had nothing to contend with in the carnal and corrupt propensities of their nature, which was true of them then as it is now; but that their main controversy was with the invisible spirits of wickedness that sought to destroy them."

It is a warfare on a large scale with the entire kingdom of darkness over the world."
