# Ephesians 6:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we are called to take up the entire armor of God, preparing ourselves for the perpetual battle against evil forces. We must be ready to withstand in times of temptation and be equipped with divine strength and defensive equipment. Each piece of armor serves a purpose - baptism as our shield, faith as our helmet, love as our spear, and patience as our whole armor. With the power of God, we can face the enemy, resist temptations, and stand firm till the end, victoriously enduring and rejoicing in the presence of Christ.
