# Ephesians 6:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The armor of the Christian is described as a girdle of truth, symbolizing the unity and consistency of character obtained through sincere convictions aligned with God's truth. It calls for readiness and preparation in facing spiritual battles. The breastplate of righteousness serves as a defense against the accusations of the enemy, representing the righteousness of Christ that guards believers and secures them from condemnation. To stand firm in the Christian faith requires both an understanding of divine truth and a heart obedient to God's righteousness, protecting against spiritual attacks.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Truth is the band and expediter of the Christian’s work in the conflict, without which all his armour would be but encumbrance."
2. "The righteousness spoken of is that of Rom 6:13, the purity and uprightness of Christian character which is the result of the work of the Spirit of Christ."
3. "The shield of faith will at all times and in all combats quench the fiery darts of the wicked one."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Standing, that is, maintaining our ground, not yielding or fleeing, is the grand aim of the Christian soldier."
2. "Truth is the band that girds up and keeps together the flowing robes, so as that the Christian soldier may be unencumbered for action."
3. "Righteousness in works, truth in words. Christ's righteousness inwrought in us by the Spirit."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The girdle was often highly ornamented, and was the place where they carried their money, their sword, their pipe, their writing instruments, etc.; see the notes on Matthew 5:38-41. The 'girdle' seems sometimes to have been a cincture of iron or steel, and designed to keep every part of the armor in its place, and to gird the soldier on every side." 

2. "Truth preserves a man from those lax views of morals, of duty and of religion, which leave him exposed to every assault. It makes the soul sincere, firm, constant, and always on its guard. A man who has no consistent views of truth, is just the man for the adversary successfully to assail."

3. "The breast-plate defended the vital parts of the body; and the idea here may be that the integrity of life, and righteousness of character, is as necessary to defend us from the assaults of Satan, as the coat of mail was to preserve the heart from the arrows of an enemy."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Truth gives unity to the different virtues, and determinateness and consistency to character. All the virtues are exercised within the sphere of truth."
2. "The loins encircled by the girdle form the central point of the physical system. Hence, in Scripture, the loins are described as the seat of power."
3. "Righteousness is used here in the sense of moral rectitude."

These quotes provide insights into the significance of truth, the power of the loins, and the meaning of righteousness in the context of the Christian armor.

### John Calvin:
1. "Paul’s design was to touch briefly on the most important points required in a Christian, and to adapt them to the comparison which he had already used."
2. "Our attention is thus directed to the fountain of sincerity; for the purity of the gospel ought to remove from our minds all guile, and from our hearts all hypocrisy."
3. "He enjoins us to be adorned, first, with integrity, and next with a devout and holy life."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Stand ready for the fight, as the description of the armor indicates; others include the thought of standing in the fight." 
2. "In the Christian, armor 'truth' is the girdle. By this is not meant the word of God, which is mentioned in Ephesians 6:17, nor sincerity, nor mere truthfulness (in the sense of telling the truth); nor does the figure suggest a mere ornament. It refers to the state of heart answering to God’s truth, the agreement of our convictions with what God has revealed."
3. "The breastplate was in many respects the most important piece of defensive armor, since it protected the heart and lungs. 'Righteousness' here cannot mean our own righteousness, but that which God provides, since the whole armor is from Him."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Take your stand therefore" - The imperative form of the verb emphasizes the urgency and importance of taking a firm stance in light of the preceding arguments.

2. "Having girded your own loins" - This imagery of girding oneself with truth signifies the readiness and preparation required to face spiritual battles.

3. "The breastplate of righteousness" - The metaphor of righteousness as a protective breastplate highlights the significance of living a righteous life as a defense against spiritual attacks.

### John Gill:
1. "Keep your ground, do not desert the army, the church of Christ, nor his cause; continue in the station in which you are placed, keep your post, be upon your watch, stand upon your guard."
2. "The Gospel...should be near and close to the saints, and never departed from; and that it is a means of keeping them close to God and Christ, and of strengthening them against the assaults and attacks of Satan."
3. "The righteousness of Christ...is a guard against, and repels the accusations and charges of Satan, and is a security from all wrath and condemnation."

### John Wesley:
1. "Not only with the truths of the gospel, but with 'truth in the inward parts;' for without this all our knowledge of divine truth will prove but a poor girdle 'in the evil day.'" 
2. "And as a girded man is always ready to go on, so this seems to intimate an obedient heart, a ready will."
3. "The righteousness of a spotless purity, in which Christ will present us faultless before God, through the merit of his own blood."
