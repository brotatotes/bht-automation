# Ephesians 6:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Bible verse describes a powerful shield called faith that covers and protects the believer from various dangers. This shield, described as "large and oblong," effectively deflects and extinguishes the enemy's attacks. It encompasses the believer with God's divine perfections and power, giving them the ability to resist and conquer the temptations of Satan. By exercising a strong and lively faith, the believer can effectively quench the fiery darts of the devil's fierce and sudden temptations.
