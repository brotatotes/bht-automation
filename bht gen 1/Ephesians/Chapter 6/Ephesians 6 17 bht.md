# Ephesians 6:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse being described speaks of the helmet of salvation, a subjective and appropriated protection that defends the head against false doctrines. This powerful armor of hope, combined with the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God, equips and empowers Christians for their battles against the adversary. With the Spirit's aid, the word of God becomes a sharp and effective weapon, able to parry the enemy's thrusts and bring victory. Through faith, the hope of salvation becomes a source of strength and endurance, enabling believers to resist and overcome temptation.
