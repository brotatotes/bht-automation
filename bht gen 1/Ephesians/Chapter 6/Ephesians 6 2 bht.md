## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The first commandment (in the decalogue, which naturally stands at the head of all God’s other commandments; and which, though not formally binding on us as Christians, is quoted, in matters of eternal obligation (not of positive enactment), as an eminent example of God’s holy will) with a promise."
2. "The fact certainly is so, and the occurrence of the description of God as ‘shewing mercy unto thousands, &c.’ after the second commandment, does not, as Jer., al., have thought, present any difficulty for that is no special promise attached to the commandment."
3. "It is surely a mistake, as Jer., Aq., Est., Olsh., to spiritualize the promise, and understand by τῆς γῆς the heavenly Canaan. The very fact of the omission of the special clause removes the words from the region of type into undoubted reality."

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Here the authority of revealed law is added to that of natural law."

### Philip Schaff:

1. "The first commandment with promise" - The fifth commandment, which is to honor one's father and mother, is unique among the Ten Commandments because it comes with a specific promise attached to it (Exodus 20:12).
