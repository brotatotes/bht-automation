# Ephesians 6:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
An ambassador, bound by chains, proclaiming the gospel with boldness and fearlessness, representing Christ's message and entrusted with the high commission of being an ambassador for Him. Paul, in his imprisonment, epitomizes the paradoxical nature of an ambassador in chains, unveiling the dignity and courage entwined within his role as a messenger of God. His plight elicits prayers and honor from believers, as they recognize the sacredness and significance of his mission, despite his physical confinement.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "An ambassador in bondsâ€”a paradox. Ambassadors were held inviolable by the law of nations, and could not, without outrage to every sacred right, be put in chains."
2. "The Romans used to bind a prisoner to a soldier by a single chain, in a kind of free custody."
3. "The term, 'bonds' (plural), on the other hand, is used when the prisoner's hands or feet were bound together."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "An ambassador is a sacred character. No greater affront can be given to a nation than to put its ambassadors to death, or even to throw them into prison."
2. "It means that in speaking the gospel he might be bold."
3. "Paul felt that the gospel ought always to be spoken with plainness, and without the fear of man."

### Marvin Vincent:

2. "In bonds, lit., in a chain: the particular word for the coupling-chain by which he was bound to the hand of his guard."
3. "See on Philippians 1:9."

### John Calvin:
1. "To proclaim the truth of the gospel as it ought to be proclaimed, is a high and rare attainment."
2. "Fear hinders us from preaching Christ openly and fearlessly, while the absence of all restraint and disguise in confessing Christ is demanded from his ministers."
3. "How consoling then must it be to each believer to learn that the care of his salvation is enjoined on all the rest, and to be informed by God himself that the prayers of others on his behalf are not poured out in vain!"

### Philip Schaff:
1. "His preaching had made him a prisoner, but even when chained to a Roman soldier, he was still an ambassador of God to proclaim the gospel mystery."
2. "In view of his office, they ought to pray for him, still more in view of his condition."
3. "That he might expound his message in a manner that became him and his high commission, that his imprisonment might have no dispiriting effect upon him, and that he might not in his addresses compromise the name and dignity of an ambassador for Christ."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Paul is now an old man and feels the dignity of his position as Christ's ambassador though 'in a chain.'" 
2. "Paul will wear a chain at the close of his life in Rome." 
3. "This is probably a second purpose, the first for utterance, this for boldness."

### John Gill:
1. "The character the apostle bore was that of an ambassador; and he was an ambassador from and for Christ, in his room and stead."
2. "He represented him, he was sent by him, and entrusted by him with the Gospel."
3. "He makes mention of them to engage persons to a regard to him as an ambassador, and to his embassy; for an ambassador, especially an ambassador of Christ, that comes with his Gospel, and more especially that is suffering for it, ought to be received, heard, and honoured."

### John Wesley:
1. "The ambassadors of men usually appear in great pomp."
2. "How differently does the ambassador of Christ appear!"
3. "An ambassador in bonds."
