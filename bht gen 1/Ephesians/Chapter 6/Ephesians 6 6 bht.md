### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Seeking to please their masters only so long as these have their eyes on them: as Gehazi was a very different man in his master's presence from what he was in his absence."
2. "Men-pleasers—not Christ-pleasers."
3. "Doing the will of God—the unseen but ever present Master: the best guarantee for your serving faithfully your earthly master alike when present and when absent."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The freeman who agrees to labor for stipulated wages may be trusted when the master is out of sight; but not the slave."
2. "This direction, moreover, is one of great importance to all who are employed in the service of others. They are bound to perform their duty with as much fidelity as though the eye of the employer was always upon them, remembering that though the eye of man may be turned away, that of God never is."
3. "We render acceptable service to God when, from regard to his will, we perform the services which are demanded of us in the situation in life where we may be placed, however humble that may be."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Eye service refers to the act of only working hard or doing a good job when someone is watching or supervising. It is a form of hypocrisy, where one's actions are solely motivated by the desire to please others rather than a genuine commitment to excellence."
2. "Men-pleasers are those who prioritize the approval and praise of others above all else. They are driven by the fear of rejection or the need for validation, which can lead to compromising their values and integrity."
3. "In this verse, Paul is urging believers to work diligently and sincerely, not just when someone is watching, but at all times. Our work should be motivated by a desire to honor God and serve others, rather than seeking the approval or recognition of men."

### Philip Schaff:

2. "But as servants (bondmen) of Christ (not ‘as men-pleasers’); doing the will of God from the heart (Greek, ‘soul’), not ‘in the way of eye-service.’"

### John Gill:
1. "Doing nothing but when under the master's eye, and then pretending a great deal of diligence and industry, in order to ingratiate themselves into his affections, and neglecting his business when he is absent."
2. "They ought to attend his service in his absence, as well as in his presence, and so seek to please him, which is commendable."
