## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "His apostolic commission needs now to be vindicated against deniers of it."
2. "The opposition between 'Christ' and 'man,' and His name being put in closest connection with God the Father, imply His Godhead."
3. "He had seen and been constituted an apostle by Him in His resurrection power."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "An Apostle, lit., messenger; here in the highest sense: one of the special messengers of Christ and witnesses of his resurrection who were (1) directly called by him, (2) inspired by the Holy Spirit, and hence infallible in their religious teaching, and (3) commissioned to all nations; hence the founders and authoritative teachers of the whole church in all ages."
2. "Not from men, nor through man. Paul’s apostleship is entirely independent of human agency, direct or indirect. The preposition ‘from’ denotes the origin or fountain, the preposition ‘through’ the instrumentality or channel."
3. "And God the Father. The immediate and frequent coordination of Christ with God the Father, especially here in contrast with the preceding men and man, proves that the Apostle regarded the Saviour as a Divine being."

### John Gill:
1. "He asserts himself to be 'an apostle', which was the highest office in the church, to which he was immediately called by Christ, and confirmed in it by signs and wonders."
2. "This is said in opposition to the false apostles, and to an unlawful investiture with the office of apostleship, and an usurpation of it, as well as to distinguish himself from the messengers and ambassadors of princes."
3. "Jesus Christ being here opposed to man, does not suggest that he was not a man, really and truly, for he certainly was; he partook of the same flesh and blood with us, and was in all things made like unto us, sin excepted; but that he was not a mere man, he was truly God as well as man."

### John Wesley:
1. "Here it was necessary for St. Paul to assert his authority; otherwise he is very modest in the use of this title."
2. "Not commissioned from them, but from God the Father."
3. "Of which it was the peculiar business of an apostle to bear witness."
