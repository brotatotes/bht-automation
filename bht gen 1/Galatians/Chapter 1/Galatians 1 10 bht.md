# Galatians 1:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the apostle Paul emphasizes that his purpose in preaching the Gospel is not to please people but to please God. He confronts the accusation of being a men-pleaser and exclaims that his message and actions are not driven by seeking the favor of others. Paul contrasts his former life of seeking human approval with his present dedication to being a servant of Christ alone. His unwavering commitment to please God rather than people serves as a crucial distinction between Christianity and the world's standards.

### Henry Alford:
1. "For (accounting for, and by so doing, softening, the seeming harshness of the last saying, by the fact which follows) am I NOW ( ἄρτι takes up the ἄρτι of the last verse, having here the principal emphasis on it, q. d. ‘in saying this,’ ‘in what I have just said;’ ‘is this like an example of men-pleasing?’)" 
2. "Nay) if I any longer (implying that such is the course of the world before conversion to Christ; not necessarily referring back to the time before his own conversion, any more than that is contained by implication in the words, but rather perhaps to the accumulated enormity of his being, after all he had gone through, a man-pleaser) were pleasing men"
3. "I were not ( ἤμην is a late form, found however in Xen. Cyr. vi. 1. 9: see Ellic. here) the (or a, but better ‘the’) servant of Christ."

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Is what I have just now said a sample of men-pleasing, of which I am accused?"
2. "Once, when a Pharisee, I was actuated only by a regard to human authority and to please men, but NOW I teach as responsible to God alone."
3. "Regard is to be had to God alone."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "His purpose was to please God; and he was not aiming in any way to gratify people."
2. "A Christian must act from higher motives than those, and he who aims supremely at the favor of his fellowmen has full evidence that he is not a Christian."
3. "One of the main differences between Christians and the world is, that others aim to please people; the Christian aims to please only God."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The emphasis is on now, which answers to now in verse 9. I have been charged with conciliating men. Does this anathema of mine look like it? Is it a time for conciliatory words now?"
2. "Persuade signifies conciliate, seek to win over. Or God. Persuade or conciliate God is an awkward phrase; but the expression is condensed, and persuade is carried forward from the previous clause."
3. "This is not uncommon in Paul's style: See Philippians 1:5; Ephesians 1:15; Philippians 2:6, where morfh form, applied to God, is probably the result of morfhn doulou form of a servant (verse 7) on which the main stress of the thought lies."

### John Calvin:
1. "Paul is speaking, not about the subject of his preaching, but about the purpose of his own mind, which could not refer so properly to men as to God."
2. "The disposition of the speaker, it must be owned, may have some influence on his doctrine."
3. "Those who resolve to serve Christ faithfully, must have boldness to despise the favor of men."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The service of the gospel is absolutely irreconcilable with the selfish service of men."
2. "A certain manly independence and fearless regard to duty seems to have characterized him even before his conversion."
3. "The Galatian heretics, under the assumed character of servants of Christ, sought not the glory of Christ and the salvation of souls, but only the favor of men and their own profit."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Conative present, trying to persuade like ζητω αρεσκειν (seeking to please) where the effort is stated plainly." 
2. "Conclusion of second class condition, determined as unfulfilled. Regular construction here (ε and imperfect indicative in the condition ηρεσκον, ουκ αν and imperfect in the conclusion)." 
3. "About pleasing men see on 1 Thessalonians 2:4. In Colossians 3:22; Colossians 6:6 Paul uses the word 'men-pleasers' (ανθρωπαρεσκο)."

### John Gill:
1. "The apostle did not teach them to hearken either to himself, or any of the other apostles, Peter, James, and John, any further than as he and they preached the pure Gospel of Christ."
2. "He did not teach human wisdom, the vain philosophy of the Gentiles, and opposition of science, falsely so called; nor the traditions of the elders, nor the commandments of men; nor the power and purity human nature, or the righteousness of man: but delivered things divine."
3. "No man pleaser can be a true faithful servant of Christ, or deserve the name of one."

### John Wesley:
1. "He adds the reason why he speaks so confidently."
2. "Is this what I aim at in preaching or writing?"
