## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Received it," implies the absence of labor in acquiring it. "Taught it," implies the labor of learning.
2. By His revealing it to me. Probably this took place during the three years, in part of which he sojourned in Arabia.
3. Ananias, his first instructor, was universally esteemed for his legal piety and so was not likely to have taught him to sever Christianity from the law.
4. Paul received it by special revelation. A vision of the Lord Jesus is mentioned, but this seems to have been subsequent to the revelation here meant.
5. Thus Paul is an independent witness to the Gospel. Though he had received no instruction from the apostles, but from the Holy Ghost, yet when he met them his Gospel exactly agreed with theirs.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He did not receive his gospel in any way from man."
2. "He was not taught it by any written account of it, or by the instruction of man in any way."
3. "He was not indebted to people for his knowledge of the gospel, but had derived it entirely from the Saviour."

### John Calvin:
1. "Shall the authority of the word be diminished, because one who has been instructed by the instrumentality of men shall afterwards become a teacher?"
2. "It was therefore necessary that Paul should state his doctrine in opposition to the whole world, and should rest it on this ground, that he had acquired it not in the school of any man, but by revelation from God."
3. "His divine instruction, communicated to him by immediate inspiration, did not render it improper that a man should be employed in teaching him, were it only to give weight to his public ministry."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "For neither did I myself receive it from man, nor was I taught it, but (it came to me) through revelation of Jesus Christ." - Paul emphasizes that his knowledge of the gospel did not come from human sources, but through direct revelation from Jesus Christ himself.

2. "Paul was man-taught as a rabbinical scholar, but God-taught as a Christian Apostle." - This highlights the distinction between Paul's previous education as a scholar and his subsequent divine instruction as an apostle.

3. "Revelation is distinguished from ordinary illumination and instruction by its divine origin, its elevation above (not against) reason, and its sudden communication and intuitive perception." - The commentary explains the unique characteristics of revelation, emphasizing its divine origin and its ability to transcend human reasoning.

These quotes provide insight into Paul's authority as an apostle and the source of his knowledge of the gospel. They also shed light on the nature of revelation and its role in Paul's understanding of Christ and the gospel message.

### John Gill:
1. "Not from Gamaliel, at whose feet he was brought up; he received the law from him, and knowledge in the Jews' religion, and in the traditions of the elders, but not a whit of the Gospel."
2. "He did not learn it of men, as men learn law, physics, logic, rhetoric, natural philosophy, and other things at school."
3. "By Christ, the revealer of it to him; and regards either the time of his rapture into the third heaven, when he heard words not to be uttered; or rather since that is not so certain when it was, the time of his conversion, when Christ personally appeared unto him, and made him a minister of his Gospel."

### John Wesley:
1. "For neither did I receive it — At once." 
2. "Nor was I taught it — Slowly and gradually, by any man." 
3. "But by the revelation of Jesus Christ — Our Lord revealed to him at first, his resurrection, ascension, and the calling of the gentiles, and his own apostleship; and told him then, there were other things for which he would appear to him."
