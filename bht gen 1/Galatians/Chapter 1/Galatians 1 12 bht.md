# Galatians 1:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse being described is a powerful declaration by Paul about the origin of his gospel. Commentators emphasize that Paul did not receive it from any human, did not learn it from any written account, and was not indebted to people for his knowledge of the gospel. Instead, he received it through a direct revelation of Jesus Christ. This revelation was not a merely human transmission or teaching, but a divine communication of truth. The profound personal encounter Paul had with Jesus compelled him to boldly proclaim the true gospel message.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Neither did I, any more than the other Apostles."
2. "Through revelation of Jesus Christ."
3. "It cannot be identical with the visions spoken of 2 Corinthians 12:1 ff., for 2 Cor. was written in A.D. 57, and fourteen years before that would bring us to A.D. 43, whereas his conversion was in 37."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Received it," implies the absence of labor in acquiring it. "Taught it," implies the labor of learning.
2. By His revealing it to me. Probably this took place during the three years, in part of which he sojourned in Arabia, in the vicinity of the scene of the giving of the law; a fit place for such a revelation of the Gospel of grace, which supersedes the ceremonial law.
3. But Paul received it by special revelation. A vision of the Lord Jesus is mentioned, but this seems to have been subsequent to the revelation here meant, and to have been confined to giving a particular command.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He did not receive his gospel in any way from man."
2. "He was not taught it by any written account of it, or by the instruction of man in any way."
3. "He was not indebted to people for his knowledge of the gospel, but had derived it entirely from the Saviour."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Para from emphasises the idea of transmission, and marks the connection between giver and receiver."
2. "In Paul only in the sense of receive, and only with para."
3. "I received the gospel by Jesus Christ's revealing it to me."

### John Calvin:
1. "We must take into account, all along, the weapons with which the false apostles attacked him, alleging that his gospel was defective and spurious; that he had obtained it from an inferior and incompetent teacher; and that his imperfect education led him to make unguarded statements."
2. "It was therefore necessary that Paul should state his doctrine in opposition to the whole world, and should rest it on this ground, that he had acquired it not in the school of any man, but by revelation from God."
3. "His divine instruction, communicated to him by immediate inspiration, did not render it improper that a man should be employed in teaching him, were it only to give weight to his public ministry."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Paul was man-taught as a rabbinical scholar, but God-taught as a Christian Apostle."
2. "Revelation is distinguished from ordinary illumination and instruction by its divine origin, its elevation above (not against) reason, and its sudden communication and intuitive perception."
3. "Paul does not mean here the outward historical information concerning the life of Christ which he could derive in part, at least, from reliable eye-witnesses, but chiefly the internal exhibition of Christ to his spiritual sense in his true character as the Messiah and the only and all-sufficient Saviour of the world."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "He did not receive it 'from man' (παρα ανθρωπων), whether Peter or any other apostle, nor was he taught it in the school of Gamaliel in Jerusalem or at the University of Tarsus."
2. "He 'received' his gospel in one way, 'through revelation of Jesus Christ' (δι' αποκαλυψεως Ιησου Χριστου)."
3. "The Lord Jesus revealed his will to Paul."

### John Gill:
1. "Not from Gamaliel, at whose feet he was brought up; he received the law from him, and knowledge in the Jews' religion, and in the traditions of the elders, but not a whit of the Gospel."
2. "He did not learn it of men, as men learn law, physics, logic, rhetoric, natural philosophy, and other things at school."
3. "By Christ, the revealer of it to him; and regards either the time of his rapture into the third heaven, when he heard words not to be uttered; or rather since that is not so certain when it was, the time of his conversion, when Christ personally appeared unto him, and made him a minister of his Gospel."

### John Wesley:
1. "For neither did I receive it — At once."
2. "Nor was I taught it — Slowly and gradually, by any man."
3. "But by the revelation of Jesus Christ — Our Lord revealed to him at first, his resurrection, ascension, and the calling of the gentiles, and his own apostleship; and told him then, there were other things for which he would appear to him."
