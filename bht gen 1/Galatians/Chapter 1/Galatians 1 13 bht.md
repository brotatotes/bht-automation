## BHT:
In this verse, the commentator quotes highlight the dramatic conversion of the apostle Paul. It emphasizes his past as a persecutor of the church, his former way of life, and the unity of the church. Paul's conversion is described as divine intervention, as his previous actions and beliefs were so vehemently opposed to the gospel message. His transformation serves as a powerful testament to the transformative power of God's grace and showcases the significance of the church as a community of believers.

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Heard - even before I came among you." 
2. "My former way of life." 
3. "The church - here singular, marking its unity, though constituted of many particular churches, under the one Head, Christ."

### John Calvin:
1. "He relates that, during his whole life, he had such an abhorrence of the gospel, that he was a mortal enemy of it, and a destroyer of the name of Christianity. Hence we infer that his conversion was divine."
2. "And indeed he calls them as witnesses of a matter not at all doubtful, so as to place beyond controversy what he is about to say."
3. "Having been strongly attached to the customs of his fathers, it would have been no easy matter to tear him from them, had not the Lord drawn him by a miracle."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Paul appeals to the well-known fact of his past career as a persecutor, which formed a part of his teaching, and conclusively proved that no mere human teaching could have converted him."
2. "All his antecedents were of such a character that nothing but a divine intervention could produce so great a change."
3. "Paul intended to annihilate Christianity, was actually employed in the attempt and carried it out as far as he could."

### John Gill:
1. "His manner and course of life, in his state of unregeneracy, how diametrically opposite his education and behaviour, his principles and practices, were to the Gospel; which show that he had not received it, nor was he taught it of men."
2. "He was born of Jewish parents, had a Jewish education, was brought up under a Jewish doctor, in all the peculiarities of the Jewish religion, and so could have received no hints, not in a notional way, of the truths of the Gospel."
3. "He was brought up in the religion of the Jews, not as it was founded and established by God, but as it was corrupted by them; who had lost the true sense of the oracles of God committed to them, the true use of sacrifices, and the end of the law."

### John Wesley:
1. "Persecution of the church of God refers to the active opposition and hostility towards the followers of Jesus Christ. It signifies the relentless efforts to suppress and harm the community of believers who were dedicated to spreading the message of the gospel."

2. "The phrase 'the church of God' emphasizes the divine origin and ownership of the church. It highlights the significance and sacredness of the community of believers who are united in their faith in God and their commitment to living out His teachings."

3. "By acknowledging his past persecution of the church, the apostle Paul demonstrates humility and repentance. His transformation from a persecutor to a proclaimer of the gospel serves as a powerful testimony to the redeeming and transformative power of God's grace."
