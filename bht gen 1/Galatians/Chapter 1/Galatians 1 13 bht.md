# Galatians 1:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This verse describes a dramatic transformation in someone's life, highlighting their past opposition to the gospel and their subsequent conversion. The individual's manner of life was once completely contrary to the teachings of Christianity, as they actively persecuted the church. However, through a divine intervention, their entire belief system shifted, leading them to become a fervent advocate for the faith. This transformation serves as a testament to the power of God's grace to reach even the most hardened hearts and to the redemptive work of Christ.

2. "for solemnity, to set himself in contrast to the Gospel, and shew how alien he then was from it."
3. "he was verily destroying the Church of God, as far as in him lay. Nor must we think of merely laying waste; the verb applies to men, not only to cities and lands."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Heard—even before I came among you."
2. "The term, 'Hebrew,' expresses the language; 'Jew,' the nationality, as distinguished from the Gentiles; 'Israelite,' the highest title, the religious privileges, as a member of the theocracy."
3. "The church—Here singular, marking its unity, though constituted of many particular churches, under the one Head, Christ."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Paul had not derived his knowledge of the Christian religion from any instruction which he had received in his early years, or any acquaintance which he had formed with the apostles."
2. "In that religion Paul proceeds to show that he had been more distinguished than most persons of his time."
3. "The phrase which Paul uses here, by hyperbole, is one which he frequently employs to denote anything that is excessive, or that cannot be expressed by ordinary language."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Conversation [αναστροφην]. Better, manner of life. See on 1 Peter 1:15."
2. "In the Jews' religion [εν τω ιουδαισμω]. Only here and verse 14. Lit. in Judaism. It signifies his national religious condition."
3. "Beyond measure [καθ υπερβολην]. P?. Lit. according to excess. The noun primarily means a casting beyond, thence superiority, excellency."

### John Calvin:
1. "He relates that, during his whole life, he had such an abhorrence of the gospel, that he was a mortal enemy of it, and a destroyer of the name of Christianity. Hence we infer that his conversion was divine."
2. "And indeed he calls them as witnesses of a matter not at all doubtful, so as to place beyond controversy what he is about to say."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Paul appeals to the well-known fact of his past career as a persecutor, which formed a part of his teaching, and conclusively proved that no mere human teaching could have converted him."
2. "All his antecedents were of such a character that nothing but a divine intervention could produce so great a change."
3. "Paul intended to annihilate Christianity, was actually employed in the attempt and carried it out as far as he could."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "My manner of life" - Late word in this sense from Polybius on from αναστρεφομα. In the older writers it meant literally "return" or "turning back." See 1 Peter 1:15.

2. "In the Jews' religion" - The word in N.T. only here and next verse, already in II Macc. 2:21; 8:1; 14:38; IV Macc. 4:26. In these passages it means the Jewish religion as opposed to the Hellenism that the Syrian Kings were imposing upon the Jews.

3. "Beyond measure" - "According to excess" (throwing beyond, υπερβολη).

### John Gill:
1. "His manner and course of life, in his state of unregeneracy, how diametrically opposite his education and behaviour, his principles and practices, were to the Gospel; which show that he had not received it, nor was he taught it of men."
2. "He was brought up in the religion of the Jews, not as it was founded and established by God, but as it was corrupted by them; who had lost the true sense of the oracles of God committed to them, the true use of sacrifices, and the end of the law."
3. "He persecuted the church of God; which he now knew, and believed to be the church of God; though then he did not, but rather a synagogue of Satan; and this he mentions, as an aggravation of his sin, under a sense of which he was humbled all his days."

### John Wesley:
1. "Persecuting the church of God refers to Saul's active opposition to the early Christian movement. It highlights his zealous commitment to upholding the Jewish religious traditions and his fervent belief that the followers of Jesus were a threat to the established order."

2. "This phrase also underscores the transformative power of Saul's conversion. It serves as a reminder that God's grace can reach even the most hardened hearts and turn persecutors into passionate advocates for the faith."

3. "By acknowledging his past actions, Paul humbly recognizes the depth of his own sin and the magnitude of God's forgiveness. It serves as a powerful testimony to the redemptive work of Christ and the transformative nature of the gospel message."
