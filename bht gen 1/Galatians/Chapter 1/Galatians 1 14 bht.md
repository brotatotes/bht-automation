# Galatians 1:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In his pursuit of Jewish education, the individual being described here made significant progress and demonstrated exceptional zeal in defending the interests of the Jewish religion. This zeal, however, was primarily directed towards the oral traditions and customs handed down through generations, rather than the written law. Although commendable, this strong attachment to unwritten traditions could sometimes lead to a distortion of the true intent of the law. It serves as a reminder that ultimate authority resides in the written word of God, rather than the traditions of men.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "I was becoming a proficient"; "I made progress."
2. "Of mine own age, among my countrymen."
3. "MY fathers," shows that it is not to be understood generally of the traditions of the nation.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Paul made advances not only in the knowledge of the Jewish religion, but he also surpassed others in his zeal in defending its interests."
2. "He surpassed those of the same age with himself. Possibly there may be a reference here to those of the same age who attended with him on the instructions of Gamaliel."
3. "Paul doubtless made this a special matter of study, and was particularly tenacious in regard to it. It was to be learned, from the very nature of it, only by oral teaching, since there is no evidence that it was then recorded."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Paul far surpassed in zeal for the Jewish religion his contemporary kinsmen or fellow-religionists."
2. "'Traditions of my fathers' are the law of Moses with all the explanations and additions of the Pharisees."
3. "Perhaps the written law is not included here. 'Tradition' (paradosis) embraces everything which is handed down orally or in writing from generation to generation."

### John Gill:
1. "He was under a very considerable master, Gamaliel, a Rabbi of great note among the Jews; and he himself a youth of uncommon natural abilities, so that his proficiency in Jewish learning was very great."
2. "He had a zeal, but, not according to knowledge; and a greater degree of it than the rest of his countrymen; and that not so much for the written law delivered to his fathers, as for the oral law, the traditions and customs of his ancestors."
3. "Now his close attachment to, and eager zeal for these traditions, put him upon using more violent measures in persecuting the saints, and further off from the Gospel of Christ."

### John Wesley:
1. "Zeal for unwritten traditions can sometimes lead to a distortion of the true intent of the law."
2. "While the written law provides a clear and objective standard, the unwritten traditions can be subject to interpretation and personal bias."
3. "It is important to remember that the ultimate authority lies in the written word of God, rather than in the traditions of men."
