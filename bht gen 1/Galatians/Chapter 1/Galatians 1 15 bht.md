# Galatians 1:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This Bible verse speaks of an act determined by God's sovereign will and grace, separating and setting apart the individual from their very birth. This calling and separation from the womb is a divine predestination, chosen by God for a specific purpose. The verse emphasizes the calling into the grace of Christ, where one is called to be both a recipient of God's blessings and an ambassador for His kingdom. This unconditional predestination reveals God's justice, mercy, and unconditional love towards the person.
