# Galatians 1:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse being described speaks of God's divine purpose and calling in the life of the speaker. From birth, God had set them apart for a specific work, as depicted by being "separated" and "called." This calling was not based on their own merits or efforts but was solely by God's grace and sovereign pleasure. It highlights the remarkable way in which God trains individuals for future usefulness and how He strategically chooses and designates them for His service.
