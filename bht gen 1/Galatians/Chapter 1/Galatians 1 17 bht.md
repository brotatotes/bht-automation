# Galatians 1:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The passage being described is a significant moment in the life of the apostle Paul after his conversion. Instead of immediately seeking the approval of the other apostles in Jerusalem, Paul chose to spend time in solitude and reflection in Arabia. This retreat allowed him to prepare for the important work that lay ahead. Ultimately, he returned to Damascus, where he likely played a role in the conversion of souls and the establishment of new churches. This period of self-reflection and growth helped shape Paul into the influential apostle that he would become.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "This journey (not recorded in Acts) was during the whole period of his stay at Damascus, called by Luke 'many [Greek, a considerable number of] days.'"
2. "He also here had that comparative retirement needed, after the first fervor of his conversion, to prepare him for the great work before him."
3. "The Lord from heaven communed with him, as He on earth in the days of His flesh communed with the other apostles."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "In that case the meaning would be went away to Jerusalem from where I then was."
2. "It is entirely impossible to decide what Paul means by this term, since the word was so loosely used and so variously applied."
3. "Many think the Sinaitic peninsula is meant (Stanley, Farrar, Matheson, Lightfoot). Others, the district of Auranitis near Damascus (Lipsius, Conybeare and Howson, Lewin, McGiffert). Others again the district of Arabia Petraea."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Paul concedes to the other Apostles no other preference but the priority of call. He knew and declared in all humility that by the grace of God he labored more in word and deed than they all."
2. "This retreat took the place of the three years’ preparation of the older Apostles in the school of Christ. The precise locality is a matter of conjecture and dispute, as ‘Arabia’ has an indefinite meaning."
3. "Here Paul could commune with the spirit of Moses the lawgiver, and Elijah the prophet, as Christ had communed with them on the Mount of Transfiguration; here he could study face to face ‘the ministration of death and condemnation,’ as he calls the old covenant, on the spot of its birth, and by contrast also ‘the ministration of the spirit and righteousness’."

### John Gill:
1. "he did not receive the Gospel from men, no not from the apostles themselves; since, upon his conversion, he did not go up to Jerusalem to see any of them, and talk with them; nor did he stand in need of any instructions from them, being immediately furnished sufficiently by Christ himself"
2. "it may be very reasonably thought it was here at his first setting out in it"
3. "where doubtless he was the instrument of converting souls, and planting churches"
