## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "They were his colleagues in the work of the Gospel, his companions in travel, and the like."
2. "Their unanimity is here stated, as Chrys., Luther, al., to show that he was not alone in his doctrine, but joined by all the brethren who were present."
3. "That we have here barely ταῖς ἐκκλ ., without any honorable adjunct, must be explained as Chrys. al.: θέα δέ μοι καὶ ἐνταῦθα τ . πολλὴν ἀγανάκτησιν."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Not that these were joint authors with Paul of the Epistle: but joined him in the sentiments and salutations."
2. "The phrase, 'all the brethren,' accords with a date when he had many travelling companions, he and they having to bear jointly the collection to Jerusalem."
3. "He does not attach any honorable title to the churches here, as elsewhere, being displeased at their Judaizing."

These quotes highlight the unity and collaboration among Paul and his companions, the purpose of their joint efforts in collecting donations, and Paul's disappointment with the churches in Galatia due to their adherence to Judaizing practices.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It was usual for Paul to associate with him the ministers of the gospel, or other Christians who were with him, in expressing friendly salutations to the churches to which he wrote, or as uniting with him, and concurring in the sentiments which he expressed."
2. "Though Paul claimed to be inspired, yet it would do much to conciliate favor for what he advanced, if others also concurred with what he said, and especially if they were known to the churches to which the epistles were written."
3. "Since we do not know where this epistle was written, of course we are ignorant who the 'brethren' were, who are here referred to. They may have been ministers with Paul, or they may have been the private members of the churches."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The brethren with me are distinguished from all the saints - the church members generally."
2. "This is a circular letter to several congregations."
3. "Note the omission of the commendatory words added to the addresses in the two Thessalonian and first Corinthian letters."

### John Calvin:
1. "His general practice is, to insert the salutations from brethren at the conclusion, instead of introducing them at the commencement as joint authors of the epistle: at least, he never mentions more than two names, and those very well known."
2. "The concurrence of so many godly persons must have had some degree of influence in softening the minds of the Galatians, and preparing them to receive instruction."
3. "Though the doctrines and practices of any society may not, in all respects, meet our wishes, we must not instantly pronounce its defects to be a sufficient reason for withholding from it the appellation of a Church."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The word ‘all’ seems to imply a considerable number. The reason why he mentions others is his strong sense of brotherly communion, rather than the desire to give additional force to his exhortations."
2. "‘Churches’ are here (as often) local congregations, which belong to the church universal. In the New Testament the word ‘church’ has only two senses: (1) the whole church; (2) a particular congregation."
3. "The Epistle was encyclical, or intended for several congregations, like the Epistle to the Hebrews and that to the Ephesians. Hence the absence of individual greetings at the close."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "All the brethren which are with me" - This phrase refers to Paul's companions who were traveling with him. It implies that Paul was not alone in his ministry, but had a supportive community around him. 

2. "The same phrase in Philippians 4:21 in distinction from the saints in verse Galatians 1:22" - This comparison highlights the difference between the brethren who were with Paul and the saints mentioned in a different context. It suggests that there may be different groups of believers with distinct roles and relationships in the church. 

3. "A circular letter therefore to all the churches in the province" - This commentary explains that the letter was intended for all the churches in the province of Galatia, indicating that Paul's message was not directed at a specific congregation but had a broader scope. It implies that the issues addressed in the letter were relevant to all the churches in that region.

### John Gill:
1. "The brethren here, whoever are meant, to show that they agreed with him in the doctrines of grace he defends, and in the charges he brought against this church, and in the reproofs and advice he gave them."

3. "The primitive churches were not national nor provincial, but congregational, consisting of persons called out of the world, and joined together in holy fellowship and who walked in the commandments and ordinances of the Lord."
