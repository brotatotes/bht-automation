## BHT:
In this verse, we encounter a speaker who is firm in asserting the truth of their message. Their limited interactions with the apostles highlight that their authority does not come from association but from a direct appointment by Jesus Christ. Their declaration of not lying is not a mere denial, but a sincere expression of their commitment to truth and the importance of accurate information. This profound earnestness is underscored by their resorting to an oath, invoking the judgment-seat of God to attest to the integrity and truthfulness of their words and actions.
