## Choicest Commentary Quotes:

2. "The word necessary to be supplied to carry on the sense from ἰδοὺ ἐνώπ . τ . θεοῦ to ὅτι, lies under the ἰδού, which here answers to such words as διαμαρτύρομαι, 1 Timothy 5:21; 2Ti 2:14; 2 Timothy 4:1, παραγγέλλω, 1 Timothy 6:13."

3. "Meyer would supply γράφω, which seems harsh: others take ὅτι as ‘for,’ which is worse still (cf. 2 Corinthians 11:21, ὁ θεὸς οἶδεν … ὅτι οὐ ψεύδομαι), and this too, understanding ἐστίν after θεοῦ (Bengel)."
