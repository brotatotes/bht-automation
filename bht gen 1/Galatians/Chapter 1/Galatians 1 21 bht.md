# Galatians 1:21 Commentary Help Text

This verse describes Paul's journey to Syria and Cilicia, where he diligently preached the Gospel of Christ. He traveled from Cæsarea to Tarsus by sea, and then spent considerable time in Cilicia, the southeasterly province of Asia Minor. Along with his intellectual background and potential influence in spreading the message of Christ, Paul was not idle, actively working and confirming the churches in those regions. This journey was significant, as it was a result of his desire to preach the gospel and also involved the support of Barnabas.
