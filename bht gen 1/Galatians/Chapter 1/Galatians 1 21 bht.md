# Galatians 1:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the apostle Paul journeys from Cæsarea to Tarsus in Cilicia by sea, followed by his ministry in Syria and Cilicia. The significance of his travels is highlighted by the fact that he was unknown to the churches in Judea due to his time spent in these regions. Paul's journey to his hometown of Tarsus in Cilicia, a place of great learning and significance, allowed him to preach the gospel in nearby areas and confirm the churches he visited.
