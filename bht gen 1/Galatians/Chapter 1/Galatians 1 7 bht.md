# Galatians 1:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, we find a warning against a perversion of the true Gospel of Christ. Commentators emphasize that there is only one Gospel and any alteration of it becomes a different gospel altogether. This distortion attempts to blend grace and works as the basis for justification, veering towards the Jewish standpoint. However, it fails to bring peace and joy, unlike the genuine Gospel which offers assurance and salvation through faith in Christ alone. Despite the efforts of those who seek to subvert and destroy it, the true Gospel remains steadfast and everlasting.

1. "There is really but one Gospel, and no other gospel."
2. "All I meant by the 'different gospel' was nothing but a perversion by 'some' of the one Gospel of Christ."
3. "They could not really pervert the Gospel, though they could pervert Gospel professors."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The gospel of Paul teaches that man is justified by grace alone through faith in Jesus Christ; the pseudo-gospel of the Judaizers teaches that man is justified by grace and works through faith in Christ and the circumcision of Moses." 
2. "The former makes good works the effect, the latter the cause, of justification; and this is thus in fact a relapse into the Jewish standpoint under a Christian name." 
3. "Only in this sense is it another gospel that it is a perversion of the true gospel of Christ by those well-known troublers of your conscience."

### John Gill:
1. "The doctrine which attributes justification to the works of the law...is no Gospel; not truly so, however it may be called; nor does it bring any solid peace and joy to distressed minds."
2. "The Gospel is single and uniform, all of a piece, has no yea and nay, or contradiction in it; this trumpet gives no uncertain sound, nor any dreadful, but a joyful one."
3. "And would pervert the Gospel of Christ...to adulterate by mixing it with the works of the law, and so, if possible, destroy it: to this they showed a good will, but were not able to effect, for the Gospel is an everlasting one."

### John Wesley:
1. "For what ye have now received is no gospel at all; it is not glad, but heavy, tidings, as setting your acceptance with God upon terms impossible to be performed."
2. "But there are some that trouble you."
3. "And would subvert or overthrow the gospel of Christ - The better to effect which, they suggest, that the other apostles, yea, and I myself, insist upon the observance of the law."
