# Galatians 1:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, various commentators illuminate the concept of a "different gospel" being preached. They emphasize that there is only one true Gospel, which is centered on faith in Jesus Christ and justification by grace alone. This "different gospel" deviates from the true Gospel, promoting a mixture of faith and works, adherence to Jewish laws, and a denial of salvation through Christ alone. It is a perversion that disrupts the true message of salvation and imposes a burden of legalistic requirements. The existence of the true Gospel is threatened by this false teaching and the troublers who spread it.

### Henry Alford:

2. "They pretend that they have come direct front the apostles at Jerusalem; that they have received their instructions from them, and that they preach the true gospel as they teach it."
