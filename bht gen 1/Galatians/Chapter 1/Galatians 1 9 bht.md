# Galatians 1:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the apostle is emphasizing the exclusivity of the true gospel, warning against accepting any other teachings or doctrines. He speaks deliberately and confidently, repeating his declaration for emphasis. The false teachers had misled the Galatians, who were at one point faithful to the true gospel. The gravity of the situation is stressed, as the apostle calls down a curse on anyone who proclaims a gospel contrary to what they had received. Paul's astonishment at their deception stems from the fact that they had known the truth of the gospel.
