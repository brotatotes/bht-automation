# Galatians 2:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, the emphasis is placed on remembering and caring for the poor Christians in Judea who have suffered for their faith. The verse not only calls for material assistance to meet their needs, but also highlights the significance of unity among all believers. By coming together and contributing to this common cause, the early Christians sought to bridge the divides between Jewish and Gentile believers. This act of charity not only demonstrated gratitude for the gospel received, but also served as a tangible expression of their faith in action.
