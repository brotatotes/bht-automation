# Galatians 2:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, we witness a significant event where two prominent apostles, Paul and Peter, clash in Antioch. Commentators note that this disagreement is not an isolated incident but a culmination of tensions that have been building up for some time. Paul's open confrontation with Peter, even though he is regarded highly by others, serves as a powerful message that apostolic authority does not exempt one from correction. This clash, while causing temporary division, ultimately does not result in a permanent split in the church.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "This visit of Peter to Antioch, not related in the Acts, will fall most naturally (for our narrative follows the order of time) in the period described, Acts 15:35, seeing that (Gal 2:13) Barnabas also was there."
2. "One of the most curious instances of ecclesiastical ingenuity on record has been afforded in the interpretation of this passage by the fathers."
3. "The instance commonly cited from Lucian de saltat., p. 952, ἀληθῶς, ἐπὶ μανίᾳ κατεγνωσμένος, is none whatever; nor is Iliad, α. 388, ὃ δὴ τετελεσμένος ἐστί: the perfect participle having in both its proper sense."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The apostles were not always inspired; but were so always in writing the Scriptures."
2. "The Christian fathers may be trusted generally as witnesses to facts, but not implicitly followed in matters of opinion."
3. "The question at Antioch was not whether the Gentiles were admissible to the Christian covenant without becoming circumcised... but whether the Gentile Christians were to be admitted to social intercourse with the Jewish Christians without conforming to the Jewish institution."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Paul says that he did not hesitate to resist him in a case where Peter was manifestly wrong, and thus showed that he was an apostle of the same standing as the others."
2. "Paul thus showed that he was equal with Peter in his apostolical authority and dignity."
3. "The first thing to be noted is, that it was done openly, and with candor. It was reproof addressed to the offender himself."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The meaning is expressed in the familiar phrase faced him down."
2. "Rather before the face, or in the face of, meaning simply in the sight or presence of."
3. "He stood condemned. Not by the body of Christians at Antioch; rather his act was its own condemnation."

### John Calvin:
1. "What reason could there now be for hesitating to receive it as certain and undoubted truth?"
2. "This is another thunderbolt which strikes the Papacy of Rome."
3. "The whole debate on those two points was nothing less than a manifest overthrow of that tyrannical primacy, which the Romanists foolishly enough allege to be founded on divine right."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The decree was framed to meet a special temporary emergency and certain specific complaints of the Jewish converts against the Gentile brethren in regard to these detested practices." 
2. "Paul considered this as a matter in itself indifferent and harmless, considering the vanity of idols, provided that no offence be given to weak brethren." 
3. "The alienation, however, was only temporary, and did not result in a split of the church."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "I stood against him face to face."
2. "In Antioch he looked him in the eye as his superior in character and courage."
3. "Because he stood condemned."

### John Gill:
1. "Our apostle first takes notice of a visit he made him, three years after his conversion, Galatians 1:18, when his stay with him was but fifteen days, and, for what appears, there was then an entire harmony between them; fourteen years after he went up to Jerusalem again, and communicated his Gospel to Peter, and the rest, when they also were perfectly agreed; but now at Antioch there was a dissension between them, which is here related."

2. "However, the Papists greedily catch at this, to secure the infallibility of the bishops of Rome, who pretend to be the successors of Peter, lest, should the apostle appear blameworthy, and to be reproved and opposed, they could not, with any grace, assume a superior character to his: but that Peter the Apostle is here designed is so manifest, that some of their best writers are obliged to own it, and give up the other as a mere conceit."

3. "not in show, and outward appearance only, as some of the ancients have thought, as if this was an artifice of the apostle's, that the Jews, having an opportunity of hearing what might be said in favour of eating with the Gentiles, might be convinced of the propriety of it, and not be offended with it: but this is to make the apostle guilty of the evil he charges Peter with, namely, dissimulation; no, the opposition was real, and in all faithfulness and integrity; he did not go about as a tale bearer, whisperer, and backbiter, but reproved him to his face, freely spoke his mind to him, boldly resisted him, honestly endeavoured to convince him of his mistake, and to put a stop to his conduct."

### John Wesley:
1. "Paul reproves Peter himself. So far was he from receiving his doctrine from man, or from being inferior to the chief of the apostles."
2. "I withstood him to the face, because he was to be blamed — For fear of man, for dissimulation, and for not walking uprightly."
3. "Peter, the chief of all the Gentile churches, was not exempt from criticism and correction when he erred in his actions."
