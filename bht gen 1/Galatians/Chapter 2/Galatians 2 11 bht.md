# Galatians 2:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, we see a disagreement between two prominent figures, Paul and Peter. It is clear that Paul stood up to Peter, showing his independence and equality as an apostle. The issue at hand was not about whether Gentiles needed to be circumcised, but about the social interaction between Jewish and Gentile Christians. Despite the disagreement, it is important to note that this conflict did not lead to a permanent division within the church. Overall, this passage emphasizes the importance of addressing conflicts and reproving others for the sake of maintaining unity and upholding truth.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "The oldest manuscripts Paul's withstanding Peter is the strongest proof that the former gives of the independence of his apostleship in relation to the other apostles, and upsets the Romish doctrine of Peter's supremacy."
2. "The question at Antioch was not whether the Gentiles were admissible to the Christian covenant without becoming circumcised... but whether the Gentile Christians were to be admitted to social intercourse with the Jewish Christians without conforming to the Jewish institution."
3. "Regarding the proceeding with prejudice, they explained away the force of the Jerusalem decision; and probably also desired to watch whether the Jewish Christians among the Gentiles violated the law, which that decision did not verbally sanction them in doing, though giving the Gentiles latitude."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Paul says that he did not hesitate to resist him in a case where Peter was manifestly wrong, and thus showed that he was an apostle of the same standing as the others."
2. "Paul thus showed that he was equal with Peter in his apostolical authority and dignity."
3. "The first thing to be noted is, that it was done openly, and with candor. It was reproof addressed to the offender himself."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The decree was framed to meet a special temporary emergency and certain specific complaints of the Jewish converts against the Gentile brethren in regard to these detested practices."
2. "Paul considered this as a matter in itself indifferent and harmless, considering the vanity of idols, provided that no offence be given to weak brethren."
3. "The alienation, however, was only temporary, and did not result in a split of the church."

### John Gill:
1. "Our apostle first takes notice of a visit he made him, three years after his conversion, Galatians 1:18, when his stay with him was but fifteen days, and, for what appears, there was then an entire harmony between them; fourteen years after he went up to Jerusalem again, and communicated his Gospel to Peter, and the rest, when they also were perfectly agreed; but now at Antioch there was a dissension between them, which is here related."
2. "However, the Papists greedily catch at this, to secure the infallibility of the bishops of Rome, who pretend to be the successors of Peter, lest, should the apostle appear blameworthy, and to be reproved and opposed, they could not, with any grace, assume a superior character to his: but that Peter the Apostle is here designed is so manifest, that some of their best writers are obliged to own it, and give up the other as a mere conceit."
3. "not in show, and outward appearance only, as some of the ancients have thought, as if this was an artifice of the apostle's, that the Jews, having an opportunity of hearing what might be said in favour of eating with the Gentiles, might be convinced of the propriety of it, and not be offended with it: but this is to make the apostle guilty of the evil he charges Peter with, namely, dissimulation; no, the opposition was real, and in all faithfulness and integrity; he did not go about as a tale bearer, whisperer, and backbiter, but reproved him to his face, freely spoke his mind to him, boldly resisted him, honestly endeavoured to convince him of his mistake, and to put a stop to his conduct."

### John Wesley:
1. "Paul reproves Peter himself. So far was he from receiving his doctrine from man, or from being inferior to the chief of the apostles."
2. "I withstood him to the face, because he was to be blamed."
3. "For fear of man, for dissimulation, and for not walking uprightly."
