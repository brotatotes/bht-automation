The verse reveals the tension between legalism and the breaking down of barriers between Jews and Gentiles, cautioning against the compromise of true beliefs for personal comfort or the approval of others.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "But the candid reader will I think at once recognize in the words a mission from James...And this mission may have been for the very purpose of admonishing the Jewish converts of their obligations, from which the Gentiles were free."
2. "συνήσθιεν...See below." (referring to Peter's action of eating with Gentiles in Acts 10 and defending it in Acts 11)
3. "The whole incident is remarkably characteristic of Peter ever the first to recognize, and the first to draw back from, great principles and truths."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "James' leanings were to legalism, and this gave him his influence with the Jewish party."
2. "Yet after all, this same Peter, through fear of man, was faithless to his own so distinctly avowed principles."
3. "An undesigned coincidence between the Gospels and the Epistle in the consistency of character as portrayed in both."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It is very evident that at Jerusalem the special rites of the Jews were observed for a long time by those who became Christian converts."

3. "He feared the effect of their opposition; he feared their reproaches; he feared the report which would be made to those at Jerusalem; and perhaps he apprehended that a tumult would be excited and a persecution commenced at Antioch by the Jews who resided there."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "A.V. misses the force of the imperfect, marking Peter's custom."
2. "Not only at church feasts, but at ordinary meals, in defiance of the Pharisaic that this prohibition was not binding."
3. "Withdrew and separated himself. Or, began to withdraw, etc. Upostellein only here in Paul."

### John Calvin:
1. "For the sake of the Jews, Peter had withdrawn himself from the Gentiles, in order to drive them from the communion of the Church, unless they would relinquish the liberty of the Gospel, and submit to the yoke of the Law."
2. "If Paul had been silent here, his whole doctrine fell; all the edification obtained by his ministry was ruined."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Certain persons from James, not simply members of his congregation at Jerusalem, but followers, and (as the word ‘from’ seems to indicate) delegates of James of Jerusalem, and invested with some authority, which they abused." 
2. "With his accustomed ardor Peter carried out his conviction which he had boldly professed in Jerusalem, and made common cause with the Gentile converts."

2. "He drew back (υπεστελλεν). Imperfect tense, inchoative action, 'he began to draw himself (εαυτον) back.' Old word υποστελλω. See middle voice to dissemble (Acts 20:20; Acts 20:27), to shrink (Hebrews 10:38)."
