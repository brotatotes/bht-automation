# Galatians 2:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this scripture, we see the tension between legalism and freedom in the early Christian community. Peter's actions of withdrawal from Gentile Christians out of fear of the Jewish party reflect his leanings towards legalism, whereas Paul's rebuke highlights his commitment to the freedom of the Gospel. The incident underscores the need to carefully navigate the opinions of others and avoid compromising the true principles of the faith. It also reveals the ongoing struggle to break down the wall of division between Jews and Gentiles, and the tension between the observance of Jewish customs and the freedom found in Christ.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "James' leanings were to legalism, and this gave him his influence with the Jewish party."
2. "Yet after all, this same Peter, through fear of man, was faithless to his own so distinctly avowed principles."
3. "An undesigned coincidence between the Gospels and the Epistle in the consistency of character as portrayed in both."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It is very evident that at Jerusalem the special rites of the Jews were observed for a long time by those who became Christian converts. They would not at once cease to observe them, and thus needlessly shock the prejudices of their countrymen."
2. "He had learned that God designed to break down the wall of partition between the Jews and the Gentiles, and he familiarly associated with them, and partook with them of their food."
3. "This is a melancholy illustration of Peter's characteristic trait of mind. We see in this act the same Peter who trembled when he began to sink in the waves; the same Peter who denied his Lord."

### John Calvin:
1. "For the sake of the Jews, Peter had withdrawn himself from the Gentiles, in order to drive them from the communion of the Church, unless they would relinquish the liberty of the Gospel, and submit to the yoke of the Law."
2. "If Paul had been silent here, his whole doctrine fell; all the edification obtained by his ministry was ruined."
3. "This shows us how cautiously we ought to guard against giving way to the opinions of men, lest an immoderate desire to please, or an undue dread of giving offense, should turn us aside from the right path."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "It would seem from this passage that, soon after the Council, James sent some esteemed brethren of his congregation to Antioch, not for the purpose of imposing the yoke of ceremonialism upon the Gentile Christians, but for the purpose of reminding the Jewish Christians of their duty and recommending them to continue the observance of the divinely appointed and time-honored customs of their fathers." 
2. "He used to eat together with the Gentiles, i.e., Gentile (uncircumcised) Christians. This is the best proof from the pen of Paul himself that Peter agreed with him in principle, and for a time even in practice." 
3. "He withdrew and separated himself. 'The words describe forcibly the cautious withdrawal of a timid person who shrinks from observation.' Characteristic for Peter, who was the first to confess Christ, and the first to deny him; the first to recognize the rights of the Gentiles, and the first to disown them practically."

### John Gill:
1. "He knew that the distinction of meats was now laid aside, and that nothing was common and unclean of itself, and that every creature of God was good, and not to be refused if received with thankfulness."
2. "In this he did well, for hereby he declared his sense of things, that the ceremonial law was abolished, that not only the Gentiles are not obliged to it, but even the Jews were freed from it, and that the observance of it was far from being necessary to salvation."
3. "His conduct did not agree with the true sentiments of his mind, which he covered and dissembled; and which must be very staggering to the believing Gentiles, to see so great a man behave in such a manner towards them, as if they were persons not fit to converse with, and as if the observance of Jewish rites and ceremonies was necessary to salvation."
