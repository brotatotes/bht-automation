# Galatians 2:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this particular Bible verse, there is a situation where some believers, including Peter and Barnabas, are led astray by hypocrisy and peer pressure. They go against their formerly inclusive behavior towards Gentile Christians and instead start to act as if they must adhere to Jewish customs for justification. The influence of these leaders on others is significant, as even those considered righteous are swayed. This episode highlights the danger of hypocrisy, the potential fracture of unity within the church, and the power of bad example to lead others astray.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "joined in hypocrisy," namely, in living as though the law were necessary to justification, through fear of man, though they knew from God their Christian liberty of eating with Gentiles, and had availed themselves of it already.
2. "It was not a question of liberty, and of bearing with others' infirmities, but one affecting the essence of the Gospel, whether the Gentiles are to be virtually 'compelled to live as do the Jews,' in order to be justified."
3. "Even Barnabas: one least likely to be led into such an error, being with Paul in first preaching to the idolatrous Gentiles: showing the power of bad example and numbers."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It is probable that they were induced to do it by the example of Peter, as they would naturally regard him as a leader."
2. "They attempted to conceal from those who had come down from James the fact that they had been in the habit of associating with the Gentiles, and of eating with them."
3. "The fact, therefore, that the conduct of Peter was exciting so unhappy an influence as even to lead so worthy and good a man as he was into hypocrisy and error, made it the more proper that Paul should publicly notice and reprove the conduct of Peter."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "A denial of the better conviction to the detriment of the Gentile Christians whom Peter acknowledged as brethren in theory, and whom he now disowned in practice."
2. "The logical tendency of this conduct was evidently to break up the communion of the two branches of the church."
3. "This shows the gravity of the crisis and the power of old Jewish habits even upon more liberal minds."

### John Gill:
1. "The Jews that were members of this church at Antioch from the beginning...concealed their true sentiments, and acted the very reverse of them, and of their former conduct." 
2. "Barnabas also was carried away with their dissimulation; so good a man as he was, full of faith, and of the Holy Ghost." 
3. "Such is the force of example in men who are had in great veneration and esteem."

### John Wesley:
1. "Dissembled with him" - This phrase suggests that the other believing Jews joined in the hypocrisy and deceit, showing that even those who were considered righteous could be swayed by the influence of others.
2. "Carried away with their dissimulation" - Barnabas, known for his integrity and encouragement, was swept up in the deception along with the others. This highlights the power of peer pressure and the potential for even the strongest individuals to be led astray.
3. "Borne away, as with a torrent" - The imagery of being carried away by a strong current emphasizes the force and speed with which Barnabas and the others were drawn into the deceit. It serves as a cautionary reminder of the need for vigilance and discernment in the face of temptation.
