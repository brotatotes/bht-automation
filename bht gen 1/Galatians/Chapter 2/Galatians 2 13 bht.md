# Galatians 2:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In a church at Antioch, a conflict arose among the believers regarding the observance of the Jewish law. A group of Jewish Christians, including Peter, began to separate themselves from the Gentile believers, contrary to the freedom found in Christ. This caused confusion and division within the community, leading even Barnabas, a respected and faithful member, to be carried away by their deception. This incident underscores the power of influence and the need for unwavering commitment to the truth, cautioning believers against the dangers of hypocrisy and succumbing to societal pressures.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1) "They were aware of the liberty in Christ which allowed them to eat with Gentiles, and had practised it: and now, being still aware of it, and not convinced to the contrary, from mere fear of man they adopted a contrary course."
2) "It was not now a question of using a liberty, but of asserting a truth, that of justification by the faith of Christ, and not by the works of the law."
3) "Besides the antagonism in which this passage represents the two great Apostles, it throws an important light on the history of the apostolic church in the following respects: 1] As exhibiting Peter’s relation to James, and his fear of those who were of the circumcision, whose leader we should have naturally supposed him to have been. 2] Also, as pourtraying the state of indecision in which all, except St. Paul, even including Barnabas, were in reference to the observance of the Jewish law."

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "The case was distinct from that in 1 Corinthians 8:1-10; Romans 14:1-23. It was not a question of liberty, and of bearing with others' infirmities, but one affecting the essence of the Gospel, whether the Gentiles are to be virtually 'compelled to live as do the Jews,' in order to be justified."
2. "Barnabas also: 'Even Barnabas': one least likely to be led into such an error, being with Paul in first preaching to the idolatrous Gentiles: showing the power of bad example and numbers."
3. "In Antioch, the capital of Gentile Christianity and the central point of Christian missions, the controversy first arose, and in the same spot it now broke out afresh; and here Paul had first to encounter the party that afterwards persecuted him in every scene of his labors."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Those who had been converted to Christianity...would naturally regard him [Peter] as a leader."
2. "They attempted to conceal from those who had come down from James the fact that they had been in the habit of associating with the Gentiles."
3. "The fact...that the conduct of Peter was exciting so unhappy an influence as even to lead so worthy and good a man as [Barnabas] was into hypocrisy and error, made it the more proper that Paul should publicly notice and reprove the conduct of Peter."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Peter's course influenced the other Jewish Christians as Antioch, who had previously followed his example in eating with Gentiles."
2. "Their act was hypocrisy, because it was a concealment of their own more liberal conviction, and an open profession of still adhering to the narrow Pharisaic view."
3. "It was 'a practical denial of their better spiritual insight' (Wieseler)."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "A duplicity and self-contradiction at the expense of truth, a denial of the better conviction to the detriment of the Gentile Christians whom Peter acknowledged as brethren in theory, and whom he now disowned in practice."
2. "The logical tendency of this conduct was evidently to break up the communion of the two branches of the church, although he himself would no doubt have deplored such a result."
3. "This shows the gravity of the crisis and the power of old Jewish habits even upon more liberal minds."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "One example in Polybius means to pretend to act a part with. That idea here would help the case of the rest of the Jews, but does not accord with Paul's presentation." 
2. "Actual result expressed by ωστε and the indicative and κα clearly means 'even.'"
3. "It was a solemn moment when Paul saw the Jerusalem victory vanish and even Barnabas desert him as they followed the timid cowardice of Peter. It was Paulus contra mundum in the cause of spiritual freedom in Christ."

### John Gill:
1. "The Jews that were members of this church at Antioch from the beginning...concealed their true sentiments, and acted the very reverse of them, and of their former conduct." 
2. "Barnabas also was carried away with their dissimulation; so good a man as he was, full of faith, and of the Holy Ghost." 
3. "Such is the force of example in men who are had in great veneration and esteem."

### John Wesley:
1. "The other believing Jews dissembled with him" - This highlights the fact that even those who were considered believers were capable of hypocrisy and deceit. It serves as a reminder that outward appearances can be deceiving and that true faith is not always reflected in one's actions.

2. "Barnabas was carried away with their dissimulation" - This shows the influence of the group mentality and the power of peer pressure. Even someone like Barnabas, known for his faith and encouragement, was not immune to being swayed by the actions of others. It serves as a cautionary tale about the importance of staying true to one's convictions.

3. "Borne away, as with a torrent, into the same ill practice" - This vivid imagery emphasizes the rapid and forceful nature of the deception that took hold of Barnabas and the other believing Jews. It highlights the danger of being swept away by the current of popular opinion or sinful behavior, urging readers to be vigilant and discerning in their choices.
