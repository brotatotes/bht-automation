# Galatians 2:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the believers are confronted by the inconsistency of their actions and their failure to uphold the truth. They waver between following God and conforming to worldly practices, causing confusion and compelling others to do the same. The example of Peter's behavior, seen as a moral compulsion even for Gentile Christians, challenges the requirement of observing ceremonial laws. This disagreement between Paul and Peter highlights the tension between remaining faithful to traditional practices and embracing spiritual freedom.
