# Galatians 2:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the commentators shed light on a situation where some individuals were not walking uprightly and were compromising the truth of the gospel. They highlight the tensions between Jews and Gentiles and the role of Peter in this conflict. It is emphasized that it is important to correct those who err and that a good man is willing to be reproved when he has erred. The reproof, though given to Peter, was also meant to address the behavior and influence of others involved.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:

2. "towards (with a view to) maintaining and propagating the truth (objectively, the unadulterated character) of the Gospel."
3. "If thou, being (by birth, originally, cf. Act 16:20 and note) a Jew, livest (as thy usual habit... as a Gentile) and not as a Jew, how (is it that) thou art compelling the Gentiles to Judaize?"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The gospel would correct all that wily policy, and would lead man in a path of entire honesty and truth."
2. "It is a duty to reprove those who err. It is a painful duty, and one much neglected; still it is a duty often enjoined in the Scriptures, and one that is of the deepest importance to the church."
3. "A good man is willing to be reproved when he has erred, and it is usually proof that there is much that is wrong when we become excited and irritable if another admonishes us of our faults."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Being a Jew [υπαρχων]. The verb means originally to begin; thence to come forth, be at hand, be in existence."
2. "The most that can be said is that it often is found simply in the sense of to be."
3. "The reference is not strictly temporal, either as referring to Peter's former intercourse with the Gentile Christians, or as indicating that he was now associating with them at table. It is rather the statement of a general principle."

### John Calvin:
1. "The proper road to the truth of the gospel was, to unite the Gentiles with the Jews in such a manner that the true doctrine should not be injured."
2. "To bind the consciences of godly men by an obligation to keep the law, and to bury in silence the doctrine of liberty, was to purchase unity at an exorbitant price."

### John Gill:
1. "They halted, as the Jews of old did, between two opinions, being partly for God, and partly for Baal; so these seemed, according to their conduct, to be partly for grace, and partly for the works of the law."
2. "Their Christian conduct was not according to the true, genuine, unmixed Gospel of Christ; which as it excludes all the works of the law, moral or ceremonial, from the business of justification and salvation."
