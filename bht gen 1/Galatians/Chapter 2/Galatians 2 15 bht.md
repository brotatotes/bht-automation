## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "We, by nature (birth) Jews and not sinners from among the Gentiles, knowing nevertheless that a man is not justified by the works of the law, except by the faith of Jesus Christ, we also believed on Christ Jesus that we might be justified by the faith of Christ, and not by the works of the law." 
2. "By the works of the law shall all flesh find no justification."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It is the most natural and obvious - usually a safe rule of interpretation. The discourse proceeds as if it were an address to Peter."
2. "As to the impropriety of Paul’s addressing Peter at length on the subject of justification, we are to bear in mind that he did not address him alone."
3. "And nothing was more pertinent or proper for him now than to report this to the Galatians as a part of his argument to them, showing that he had always, since his conversion, held and defended the same doctrine on the subject of the way in which people are to be justified in the sight of God."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Under we Paul includes himself, Peter, and the Jewish Christians of Antioch, in contrast with the Gentile Christians."
2. "There is an implied emphasis on the special prerogatives and privileges of the Jews as such."
3. "Possibly Paul here cites the very words by which Peter sought to justify his separation from the Gentile Christians, and takes up these words in order to draw from them an opposite conclusion."

### John Calvin:
1. "We, who appear to excel others, — we, who, by means of the covenant, have always enjoyed the privilege of being nigh to God, have found no method of obtaining salvation, but by believing in Christ: why, then, should we prescribe another method to the Gentiles?"
2. "For, if the law were necessary or advantageous for salvation to those who observed its enactments, it must have been most of all advantageous to us to whom it was given; but if we relinquished it, and betook ourselves to Christ, much less ought compliance with it to be urged upon the Gentiles."
3. "Since the Jews themselves, with all their advantages, were forced to betake themselves to the faith of Christ, how much more necessary was it that the Gentiles should look for salvation through faith?"

1. "Others become Jews by being proselytes to the Jewish religion: such were the Jews, devout men, out of every nation under heaven, that were dwelling at Jerusalem, when the Spirit was poured down on the apostles on the day of Pentecost." 
2. "Not but that the Jews also were sinners both by nature and practice, were involved in the guilt of sin, under the power of it, and defiled with it, as the apostle elsewhere most fully proves."
