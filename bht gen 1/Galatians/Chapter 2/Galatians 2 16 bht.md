# Galatians 2:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse under consideration reveals that justification is not attained through works but rather through faith in Jesus Christ. The law and faith, doing and believing, works and faith are presented as opposing concepts. Justification is not a mere pardon, but a declaration of righteousness in God's sight, grounded on the merits of Christ. It is the righteousness of faith that allows sinners to be regarded and treated as if they had not sinned. This truth holds firm, stating that we are justified by faith alone, not by works of the law.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The works of the law" are those which have the law for their object—which are wrought to fulfil the law.
2. "But only (in no other way save) through faith in Jesus Christ," as the MEAN and instrument of justification.
3. He rests his argument on this as an axiom in theology, referring to "Moses and Jesus Christ; The law and the promise; Doing and believing; Works and faith; Wages and the gift; The curse and the blessing—are represented as diametrically opposed."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "This rendered the conduct of Peter and the other Jews who “dissembled” with him so entirely inexcusable. They could not plead ignorance on this vital subject, and yet they were pursuing a course, the tendency of which was to lead the Gentile converts to believe that it was indispensable to observe the laws of Moses, in order to be justified and saved."
2. "It is the declared purpose of God to regard and treat those sinners who believe in the Lord Jesus Christ as if they had not sinned, on the ground of the merits of the Saviour."
3. "It is not mere pardon. The main difference between pardon and justification respects the sinner contemplated in regard to his past conduct, and to God’s future dealings with him. Pardon is a free forgiveness of past offences. Justification has respect to the Law, and to God’s future dealings with the sinner."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The meaning to declare or pronounce righteous cannot be consistently carried through Paul's writings in the interest of a theological fiction of imputed righteousness." 

2. "Why is the righteousness of faith any less a real righteousness?" 

3. "Paul means that justification is by faith alone."

### John Calvin:
1. "Not by works, but by the Gift of Christ alone."
2. "Let it therefore remain settled, that the proposition is so framed as to admit of no exception, 'that we are justified in no other way than by faith,' or, 'that we are not justified but by faith,' or, which amounts to the same thing, 'that we are justified by faith alone.'"
3. "He had already appealed to the consciences of Peter and others, and now confirms it more fully by affirming that such is the actual truth, that by the works of the law no mortal will obtain justification."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The term 'justify' means acquittal from the guilt and punishment of sin in the tribunal of the just and holy God, on the ground of Christ's atoning death and through the medium of faith by which we apprehend Christ's merits and make his righteousness our own."
2. "'By works of law,' the whole law, moral as well as ceremonial."
3. "The future tense expresses moral impossibility: such a thing can never happen."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The two ways of getting right with God are here set forth: by faith in Christ Jesus, by the works of the law." 
2. "The terms faith, righteousness, law, works occur more frequently in Galatians and Romans because Paul is dealing directly with the problem in opposition to the Judaizers who contended that Gentiles had to become Jews to be saved."
3. "We Jews believed, had to believe, were not saved or justified till we did believe."

### John Gill:
1. "By 'the works of the law' are meant, not only obedience to the ceremonial law, though this is included, but also to the moral law; for it can hardly be thought, that the men the apostle opposes could ever dream of justification by their compliance with the rituals of the ceremonial law if they believed there could be no justification by their obedience to the moral law."
2. "Men are not justified by faith, either as an habit, or an act; not by it as an habit or principle, this would be to confound justification and sanctification; nor as an act, for as such it is a man's own, and then justification would be by a man's works, contrary to the Scripture."
3. "These Jews did not believe in Christ, in order by their believing to procure their justification before God, and acceptance with him, but that they might receive, by faith, this blessing from the Lord in their own conscience, and enjoy the comfort of it, and all that spiritual peace which results from it, and which they could not find in the works of the law."

### John Wesley:
1. "Knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law — Not even of the moral, much less the ceremonial, law."
2. "And they are not always placed promiscuously; but generally in a more solemn way of speaking, the Apostle says, Christ Jesus; in a more familiar, Jesus Christ."
3. "Considering the demands of the law, and the fate of human nature, it is evident, that by the works of the law - By such an obedience as it requires - shall no flesh living — No human creature, Jew or Gentile, be justified."
