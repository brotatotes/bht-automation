# Galatians 2:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we learn that justification cannot be achieved through works of the law but only through faith in Jesus Christ. The term "justification" refers to being acquitted of sin's guilt and punishment through the atoning death of Christ and the medium of faith. The verse also highlights the opposition between the law and the promise, doing and believing, works and faith. It emphasizes that faith, not works, is the means by which one can receive this blessing and find spiritual peace.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "The works of the law" are those which have the law for their object—which are wrought to fulfil the law.
2. "But only (in no other way save) through faith in Jesus Christ," as the MEAN and instrument of justification.
3. He rests his argument on this as an axiom in theology, referring to "Moses and Jesus Christ; The law and the promise; Doing and believing; Works and faith; Wages and the gift; The curse and the blessing—are represented as diametrically opposed."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The term 'justify' means acquittal from the guilt and punishment of sin in the tribunal of the just and holy God, on the ground of Christ's atoning death and through the medium of faith by which we apprehend Christ's merits and make his righteousness our own."
2. "'By works of law,' refers to the whole law, moral as well as ceremonial."
3. "The future tense expresses moral impossibility: such a thing can never happen."

### John Gill:
1. "By 'the works of the law' are meant, not only obedience to the ceremonial law, though this is included, but also to the moral law; for it can hardly be thought, that the men the apostle opposes could ever dream of justification by their compliance with the rituals of the ceremonial law if they believed there could be no justification by their obedience to the moral law."
2. "Men are not justified by faith, either as an habit, or an act; not by it as an habit or principle, this would be to confound justification and sanctification; nor as an act, for as such it is a man's own, and then justification would be by a man's works, contrary to the Scripture."
3. "These Jews did not believe in Christ, in order by their believing to procure their justification before God, and acceptance with him, but that they might receive, by faith, this blessing from the Lord in their own conscience, and enjoy the comfort of it, and all that spiritual peace which results from it, and which they could not find in the works of the law."

### John Wesley:
1. "Knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law — Not even of the moral, much less the ceremonial, law."
2. "And they are not always placed promiscuously; but generally in a more solemn way of speaking, the Apostle says, Christ Jesus; in a more familiar, Jesus Christ."
3. "Considering the demands of the law, and the fate of human nature, it is evident, that by the works of the law - By such an obedience as it requires - shall no flesh living — No human creature, Jew or Gentile, be justified."
