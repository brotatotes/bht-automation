# Galatians 2:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In seeking justification through faith in Christ, believers acknowledge their ongoing pursuit of righteousness, recognizing the tension between their desire for holiness and the reality of sinfulness. While some may argue that this makes Christ a promoter of sin, the truth is that His purpose is not to condone sin, but to offer forgiveness and transformation to sinners. The Christian mind rejects the notion that Christ's righteousness would result in licentiousness or undermine the importance of obedience to the law.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "The Christian mind revolts from so shocking a conclusion, and so, from the theory which would result in it."
2. "The whole sin lies, not with Christ, but with him who would necessitate such a blasphemous inference."
3. "But his false theory, though 'seeking' from Christ, we have not 'found' salvation, but 'have been ourselves also (like the Gentiles) found' to be 'sinners,' by having entered into communion with Gentiles."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Sinners in the Jewish sense, i.e., lawless heathen, as in Galatians 2:15."
2. "A minister of sin, helper, promoter."
3. "Let it never be! or 'Far be it;' 'By no means;' 'Away with the thought;' 'Nay, verily.' This phrase occurs fourteen times in St. Paul, thrice in Galatians (Galatians 2:17; Galatians 2:21; Galatians 3:21), ten times in Romans (Romans 3:4; Romans 3:6; Romans 3:31; Romans 6:2; Romans 6:15; Romans 7:7; Romans 7:13; Romans 9:14; Romans 11:1; Romans 11:11), and once in 1 Corinthians 6:15."

### John Gill:
1. "We ourselves also are found sinners; that is, either we should be so, were we not to rest here, but seek to join our own works with Christ's righteousness for our justification, and so make Christ the minister of sin, of an imperfect righteousness, which cannot justify, which God forbid should ever be done by us."
2. "Or if we are still sinners, and unjustified persons, notwithstanding we seek to Christ to be justified by him, but need the law, and the works of it to justify us, then Christ, instead of being a minister of righteousness, is a minister of the law, the strength of sin, which accuses for it, and is the ministration of condemnation and death on account of it, which God forbid should ever be."
3. "This is an objection of the adversary to the doctrine of free justification by the righteousness of Christ, as if it made void the law, discouraged the performance of good works, opened a door to licentiousness that men might continue sinners, and live as they wish, being under no restraints of the law, or under obligation to obedience it, and by such doctrine make Christ the minister of sin; who hereby teaches men to live in sin, and in the neglect of duty; to which the apostle answers, God forbid."

### John Wesley:
1. "While we seek to be justified by Christ" - This phrase emphasizes the ongoing process of seeking justification through faith in Christ. It implies that justification is not a one-time event but a continual pursuit of righteousness.

2. "We ourselves are still found sinners" - This acknowledges the reality of human sinfulness even after accepting Christ. It highlights the tension between the desire to be righteous and the struggle with sin that believers face.

3. "Christ is the minister or countenancer of sin" - This phrase addresses the misconception that if believers continue to sin, it reflects poorly on Christ. It emphasizes that Christ's role is not to condone or promote sin but to offer forgiveness, grace, and transformation to sinners.
