# Galatians 2:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse under consideration addresses the question of whether seeking justification in Christ leads to a continuation of sin. Commentators highlight the ironic questioning of whether Christ becomes "the minister of sin" if believers are found to still be sinners. They emphasize that seeking righteousness in Christ does not give license to sin, but rather reveals the need for redemption. The verse raises objections to the idea that justification in Christ nullifies the law or promotes licentiousness, to which the apostle adamantly responds, "God forbid."

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "But if, seeking to be justified in Christ, we ourselves also were found to be sinners, is therefore Christ the minister of sin?" - This quote highlights the question posed by the commentary, challenging the idea that Christ's work would result in believers remaining in a state of sin.

2. "The clause must be interrogative, as μὴ γένοιτο always follows a question in St. Paul." - This quote emphasizes the grammatical structure used by Paul in his writings, supporting the interpretation of the passage as a question.

3. "The fine irony of the question, which, as it stands, presupposes the ἆρ ʼ οὐ question already asked, the inevitable answer given, and now puts the result, ‘Can we believe, are we to hold henceforth, such a consequence?'" - This quote highlights the irony in the question, suggesting that the answer is already known and the question challenges the validity of the consequence.

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "The Christian mind revolts from so shocking a conclusion, and so, from the theory which would result in it."
2. "The whole sin lies, not with Christ, but with him who would necessitate such a blasphemous inference."
3. "But his false theory, though 'seeking' from Christ, we have not 'found' salvation, but 'have been ourselves also (like the Gentiles) found' to be 'sinners,' by having entered into communion with Gentiles."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The objections are that it does not teach the necessity of the observance of the Law in order to acceptance with God."
2. "That it pronounces a man justified and accepted who is a violator of the Law."
3. "The system is not suited to produce such a freedom from restraint, and if such a freedom exists, it is to be traced to something else than the gospel."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "To seek to be justified by Christ is an admission that there is no justification by works; that the seeker is unjustified, and therefore a sinner." 
2. "The effort to attain justification by faith in Christ develops the consciousness of sin. It compels the seeker, whether Jew or Gentile, to put himself upon the common plane of sinners."
3. "Peter, by his Christian profession, had asserted that justification was by faith alone; and by his eating with Gentiles had declared that the Mosaic law was no longer binding upon him. He had thus, figuratively, destroyed or pulled down the Jewish law as a standard of Christian faith and conduct."

### John Calvin:
1. "If, in consequence of the righteousness of faith, we, who are Jews and were 'sanctified from the womb,' are reckoned guilty and polluted, shall we say that Christ makes sin to be powerful in his own people, and that he is therefore the author of sin?"
2. "Christ, who discovers the sin which lay concealed, is not therefore the minister of sin; as if, by depriving us of righteousness, he opened the gate to sin, or strengthened its dominion."
3. "Christ did not bring sin, but unveiled it; he did not take away righteousness, but stripped the Jews of a false disguise."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Were found, discovered, in the eyes of God and men, at the time of our conversion to Christ and our justification by faith in him."
2. "Sinners in the Jewish sense, i.e., lawless heathen, as in Galatians 2:15."
3. "Let it never be! or ‘Far be it;’ ‘By no means;’ ‘Away with the thought;’ ‘Nay, verily.’ This phrase occurs fourteen times in St. Paul, thrice in Galatians (Galatians 2:17; Galatians 2:21; Galatians 3:21), ten times in Romans (Romans 3:4; Romans 3:6; Romans 3:31; Romans 6:2; Romans 6:15; Romans 7:7; Romans 7:13; Romans 9:14; Romans 11:1; Romans 11:11), and once in 1 Corinthians 6:15."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Like the Gentiles, Jews who thought they were not sinners, when brought close to Christ, found that they were."
2. "Paul felt like the chief of sinners."
3. "Christ simply revealed to us our sin."

### John Gill:
1. "We ourselves also are found sinners; that is, either we should be so, were we not to rest here, but seek to join our own works with Christ's righteousness for our justification, and so make Christ the minister of sin, of an imperfect righteousness, which cannot justify, which God forbid should ever be done by us."
2. "Or if we are still sinners, and unjustified persons, notwithstanding we seek to Christ to be justified by him, but need the law, and the works of it to justify us, then Christ, instead of being a minister of righteousness, is a minister of the law, the strength of sin, which accuses for it, and is the ministration of condemnation and death on account of it, which God forbid should ever be."
3. "This is an objection of the adversary to the doctrine of free justification by the righteousness of Christ, as if it made void the law, discouraged the performance of good works, opened a door to licentiousness that men might continue sinners, and live as they wish, being under no restraints of the law, or under obligation to obedience it, and by such doctrine make Christ the minister of sin; who hereby teaches men to live in sin, and in the neglect of duty; to which the apostle answers, God forbid."

### John Wesley:
1. "Seeking to be justified by Christ does not mean that we can continue in sin without consequence. If we are found to still be sinners, it does not imply that Christ is promoting or endorsing sin."
2. "The grace of Christ does not give us a license to sin, but rather it empowers us to overcome sin and live a righteous life."
3. "Christ's role is not to justify our sinful behavior, but to justify us as sinners by offering forgiveness and redemption through his sacrifice."
