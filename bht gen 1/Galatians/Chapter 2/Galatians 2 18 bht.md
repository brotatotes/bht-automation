# Galatians 2:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the commentators highlight the danger of returning to sinful practices and neglecting the teachings of the gospel. They emphasize that such actions make oneself a transgressor of the law and undermine the message of freedom and grace. The act of rebuilding what was once destroyed by Christ is condemned as wrong and a betrayal of the gospel's intent. To profess the gospel but not live according to its teachings is to contradict its purpose and remain in sin.

2. "The objection were just, if the gospel promised justification to men continuing in sin. But it does not."
