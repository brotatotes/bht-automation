# Galatians 2:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
It is clear that this Bible verse addresses the issue of rebuilding what had been torn down. Commentators emphasize that by reintroducing the old ways or disregarding the gospel, one becomes a transgressor of the Law. The verse condemns going back from Christ to Moses and rebuilding the law of bondage instead of embracing the freedom offered by the gospel. It is crucial to live according to the teachings of the gospel and not establish sin, as the gospel promises justification only to those who live in accordance with it.
