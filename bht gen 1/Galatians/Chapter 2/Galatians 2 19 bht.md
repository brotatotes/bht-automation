# Galatians 2:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Bible verse being described showcases the transformative power of Christ and the believer's liberation from the law. Through his union with Christ, the believer becomes dead to the law and is established in righteousness and life. The law, though once instrumental in revealing sin, no longer holds power over the believer who is now justified through faith in Christ. This newfound freedom from the law empowers believers to live a life that is no longer enslaved to sin but is dedicated to righteousness and obedience to Christ.
