# Galatians 2:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse being described is a powerful declaration of the believer's freedom from the law and their new life in Christ. Through his understanding of the law, the commentator speaks of dying to its demands and finding righteousness in Christ alone. This death to the law brings about a new life, where the believer is united with Christ and lives according to the principles of grace, not the requirements of the law. It is through faith in Christ that one is set free from the condemnation and hopelessness of the law, finding newness of life in Him.

1. "He acted as though it were not; or it ceased to have influence over him. A dead man is insensible to all around him. He hears nothing; sees nothing; and nothing affects him. So when we are said to be dead to anything, the meaning is, that it does not have an influence over us." 
2. "He had higher purposes than that, and truly lived to God."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The law itself led him to Christ, so that it would be sinful and foolish to return to it again, as Peter did."
