# Galatians 2:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This verse describes the profound transformation that takes place in the life of a believer. Through faith in Christ, they are spiritually united with Him in His death and resurrection. They are no longer bound by the guilt and curse of the law but are set free. Christ becomes the source of their new life, animating and directing their thoughts, words, and actions. Their earthly existence takes on new meaning as they live in the assurance of God's love and redemption, anticipating an eternal life in Him.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "I have been crucified with Christ." This more particularizes the foregoing. "I am dead" (Galatians 2:19; Philippians 3:10).
2. "And it is no longer I that live, but Christ that liveth in me." But the plain antithesis between "crucified" and "live," requires the translation, "nevertheless."
3. "My life seems to be a mere animal life 'in the flesh,' but this is not my true life; 'it is but the mask of life under which lives another, namely, Christ, who is my true life' [LUTHER]."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "To understand the remarkable phrase, 'I am crucified with Christ,' we may remark: (1) That this was the way in which Christ was put to death. He suffered on a cross, and thus became literally dead."
2. "Paul, though he was crucified with Christ, did not wish to be understood that he felt himself to be dead. He was not inactive; not insensible, as the dead are, to the appeals which are made from God, or to the great objects which ought to interest an immortal mind."
3. "True religion never made one lazy man; it has converted many a man of indolence, and effeminacy and self-indulgence to a man actively engaged in doing good."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The statement explains how a believer dies to the law by means of the law itself."
2. "Ethically, a believer is crucified with Christ...and thus the demand of the law is fulfilled in him likewise."
3. "The new life of Christ followed his crucifixion...He who is crucified with Christ repeats this experience."

### John Calvin:
1. "Being then crucified with him, we are freed from all the curse and guilt of the law. He who endeavors to set aside that deliverance makes void the cross of Christ." 
2. "Christ lives in us in two ways. The one life consists in governing us by his Spirit, and directing all our actions; the other, in making us partakers of his righteousness; so that, while we can do nothing of ourselves, we are accepted in the sight of God."
3. "The life, therefore, which we attain by faith is not visible to the bodily eye, but is inwardly perceived in the conscience by the power of the Spirit; so that the bodily life does not prevent us from enjoying, by faith, a heavenly life."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Paul means the past act which took place in his conversion. It is an explanation of the word 'died,' Galatians 2:19."
2. "But it is Christ that liveth in me, Christ, the crucified and risen Redeemer, who is the resurrection and the life, is the indwelling, animating, and controlling principle of my life."
3. "The life-union with Christ does not destroy the personality of the believer. Even his natural mortal life continues in this world, but as the earthen vessel containing the heavenly treasure of the imperishable life of Christ who dwells in him and transforms even the body into a temple of the Holy Spirit."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Paul died to the law and was crucified with Christ." 
2. "So complete has become Paul's identification with Christ that his separate personality is merged into that of Christ." 
3. "Paul has the closest personal feeling toward Christ. 'He appropriates to himself, as Chrysostom observes, the love which belongs equally to the whole world.'"

### John Gill:
1. "Christ sustained the persons of all his people, and what he did and suffered was in their name, and on their account, and so they were crucified and suffered with him."
2. "The believer is a mere paradox, he is dead to the law, and 'yet lives' to God; he is crucified with Christ, and yet lives by him; yea, a crucified Christ lives in him."
3. "The life which I now live in the flesh; in the body, whilst in this mortal state, whereby he distinguishes that spiritual life he had from Christ, and through Christ's living in him, both from the natural life of his body, and from that eternal life he expected to live in another world."

### John Wesley:
1. "I am crucified with Christ — Made conformable to his death; 'the body of sin is destroyed.'" Romans 6:6.
2. "But Christ liveth in me — Is a fountain of life in my inmost soul, from which all my tempers, words, and actions flow."
3. "And the life that I now live in the flesh — Even in this mortal body, I live by faith in the Son of God - I derive every moment from that supernatural principle; from a divine evidence and conviction, that 'he loved me, and delivered up himself for me.'"
