# Galatians 2:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this powerful biblical verse, the commentator interpretations reveal a profound understanding of the believer's relationship with Christ. The verse portrays a crucifixion alongside Christ, symbolizing spiritual death to sin and conformity to Christ's sacrifice. It further emphasizes the paradoxical existence of the believer, dead to the law yet living to God. Christ's indwelling presence serves as a life-giving force, shaping thoughts, language, and behavior. This life, lived amidst mortal existence, is sustained through unwavering faith in the Son of God's sacrificial love and deliverance.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "I am crucified with Christ." This more particularizes the foregoing. "I am dead" (Galatians 2:19; Philippians 3:10).
2. "And it is no longer I that live, but Christ that liveth in me." But the plain antithesis between "crucified" and "live," requires the translation, "nevertheless."
3. "My life seems to be a mere animal life 'in the flesh,' but this is not my true life; 'it is but the mask of life under which lives another, namely, Christ, who is my true life' [LUTHER]."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Paul means the past act which took place in his conversion. It is an explanation of the word 'died,' Galatians 2:19."
2. "But it is Christ that liveth in me, Christ, the crucified and risen Redeemer, who is the resurrection and the life, is the indwelling, animating, and controlling principle of my life."
3. "The life-union with Christ does not destroy the personality of the believer. Even his natural mortal life continues in this world, but as the earthen vessel containing the heavenly treasure of the imperishable life of Christ who dwells in him and transforms even the body into a temple of the Holy Spirit."

### John Gill:
1. "Christ sustained the persons of all his people, and what he did and suffered was in their name, and on their account, and so they were crucified and suffered with him."
2. "The believer is a mere paradox, he is dead to the law, and 'yet lives' to God; he is crucified with Christ, and yet lives by him; yea, a crucified Christ lives in him."
3. "The life which I now live in the flesh; in the body, whilst in this mortal state, whereby he distinguishes that spiritual life he had from Christ, and through Christ's living in him, both from the natural life of his body, and from that eternal life he expected to live in another world."

### John Wesley:
1. "I am crucified with Christ — Made conformable to his death; 'the body of sin is destroyed.' Romans 6:6."
2. "But Christ liveth in me — Is a fountain of life in my inmost soul, from which all my tempers, words, and actions flow."
3. "And the life that I now live in the flesh — Even in this mortal body, I live by faith in the Son of God - I derive every moment from that supernatural principle; from a divine evidence and conviction, that 'he loved me, and delivered up himself for me.'"
