# Galatians 2:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, the apostle Paul stands firm against the pressure to impose circumcision on both himself and his companion, Titus. The refusal to require circumcision affirms Paul's independence as an apostle and validates his ministry among the Gentiles. This demonstrates the unity and acceptance within the early Christian community, where the gospel message transcends cultural and religious boundaries. The apostles recognized that Jewish customs were not essential to Christianity and that imposing them on Gentile believers would distort the true essence of the faith.
