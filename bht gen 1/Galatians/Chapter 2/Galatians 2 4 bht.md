# Galatians 2:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, the apostle Paul addresses the presence of false brethren who were deceptive and had infiltrated the Christian community. These individuals, often referred to as Judaizers, sought to spy out and undermine the liberty and freedom believers had in Christ. Their intention was to impose the requirements of the Mosaic law, including circumcision, upon the Gentile converts. Despite their efforts, Paul stood firm in defending the truth of the Gospel and resisting any attempt to subject believers to the bondage of legalism.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "To connect this with Galatians 2:2, supposing Gal 2:3 to be parenthetical, as Mr. Bagge, seems harsh, and unnecessary."
2. "Men who crept in to spy out our freedom which we have in Christ Jesus, with intent to enslave us utterly."
3. "To whom not even for one hour did we yield with the subjection required of us, that the truth of the Gospel might abide with you."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "What I did concerning Titus (namely, by not permitting him to be circumcised) was not from contempt of circumcision, but 'on account of the false brethren' who, had I yielded to the demand for his being circumcised, would have perverted the case into a proof that I deemed circumcision necessary."
2. "Unawares, in an underhand manner brought in."
3. "If they had found that we circumcised Titus through fear of the apostles, they would have made that a ground for insisting on imposing the legal yoke on the Gentiles."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Paul met such adversaries everywhere 2 Corinthians 11:26; and it required all his tact and skill to meet their plausible representations."
2. "In this way he could more easily counteract the influence of the false brethren. He could make a full statement of his doctrines. He could meet their inquiries, and anticipate the objections of his enemies."
3. "Their object in spying out the liberty which Paul and others had, was, undoubtedly, to be witnesses of the fact that they did not observe the special rites of the Mosaic system; to make report of it; to insist upon their complying with those customs, and thus to secure the imposition of those rites on the Gentile converts."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The false brethren...Christians in name only; Judaisers; anti-Paulinists." 
2. "Brought in, not from Jerusalem into the church at Antioch, nor into the Pauline churches generally, but into the Christian brotherhood to which they did not rightfully belong." 
3. "Came in privily...indicating the earlier intrusion of these persons into the Christian community."

### John Calvin:
1. "Paul purposely did not circumcise him, because he saw that they would immediately make it an occasion of slander."
2. "Either he would treat with open scorn the ceremonial law, and then they would rouse the indignation of the Jews against him; or he would refrain entirely from the exercise of his liberty, and in that case they would exult over him among the Gentiles as one who, overwhelmed with shame, had retracted his doctrine."
3. "Circumcision is not condemned as a bad thing in itself, but that the obligation to observe it was the subject of dispute."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Paul would have respected the scruples of weak brethren (comp. Romans 14:15); while he was inflexible in resisting the demands of false brethren."
2. "But (δέ in the adversative sense) on account of the false brethren (i.e., to appease the Judaizers) the leading Apostles RECOMMENDED the circumcision of Titus as a charitable concession to their prejudices to whom, however (i.e., the false brethren), we (Paul and Barnabas) did not yield for a single hour."
3. "From these false brethren who were intolerant Judaizers of the malignant type and bitter haters of freedom, we should carefully distinguish the weak brethren whom Paul treats with great indulgence (Romans 14:1; Romans 15:1-3)."
