# Galatians 2:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this passage, there are false brethren who infiltrated the community, not out of genuine intentions but to spy on and undermine the freedom that believers had in Christ. These deceitful individuals aimed to impose the necessity of circumcision, falsely claiming it as necessary for salvation. Their goal was to bring the believers back into the bondage of the ceremonial law, but through his unwavering resistance, Paul ensured that their attempts were unsuccessful. The presence of these false brethren serves as a reminder to remain vigilant against those who seek to undermine our freedom in Christ.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "What I did concerning Titus (namely, by not permitting him to be circumcised) was not from contempt of circumcision, but 'on account of the false brethren' who, had I yielded to the demand for his being circumcised, would have perverted the case into a proof that I deemed circumcision necessary."
2. "They [the false brethren] came in unawares, in an underhand manner brought in, stealthily, to spy out, as foes in the guise of friends, wishing to destroy and rob us of our liberty."
3. "If they had found that we circumcised Titus through fear of the apostles, they would have made that a ground for insisting on imposing the legal yoke on the Gentiles."
4. "The Greek future implies the certainty and continuance of the bondage as the result."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Paul would have respected the scruples of weak brethren (comp. Romans 14:15); while he was inflexible in resisting the demands of false brethren."
2. "But (δέ in the adversative sense) on account of the false brethren (i.e., to appease the Judaizers) the leading Apostles RECOMMENDED the circumcision of Titus as a charitable concession to their prejudices to whom, however (i.e., the false brethren), we (Paul and Barnabas) did not yield for a single hour."
3. "From these false brethren who were intolerant Judaizers of the malignant type and bitter haters of freedom, we should carefully distinguish the weak brethren whom Paul treats with great indulgence (Romans 14:1; Romans 15:1-3)."

### John Gill:
1. "These men insisted upon it as necessary to salvation; they were sly, artful, designing men; could they have gained their point in such an instance; could they have got such a precedent at such a time, when this matter was canvassing, they would have made great use of it in the Gentile churches."
2. "Their views, aims, and ends were, to spy out our liberty which we have in Christ Jesus; by which is meant, not a liberty to sin, but a liberty from sin; not the being of it, but the dominion and damning power of it."
3. "The design of these false teachers getting in privily among the apostles, elders, and brethren, was to make their remarks upon this liberty, to object to it, and, if possible, to break in upon it, and destroy it, and so gain another point, which follows: that they might bring us into bondage."
