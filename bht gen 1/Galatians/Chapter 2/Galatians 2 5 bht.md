# Galatians 2:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, we see the apostle Paul and his companions facing a situation where they are being tempted to compromise the truth of the gospel. Despite pressure from false brethren, they refuse to yield and submit to their demands. Their refusal is not due to a lack of love or humility, but rather a steadfast commitment to uphold the truth and liberties of the faith. The apostle's actions demonstrate a remarkable wisdom, using his Christian liberty to defend the genuine gospel and protect the privileges of believers.
