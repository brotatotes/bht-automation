# Galatians 2:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the apostle Paul addresses the highly esteemed apostles and leaders of the early Christian church. Though these individuals were revered and influential, Paul asserts his independence and authority as an apostle, emphasizing that their reputation or rank had no bearing on his own message and calling. This highlights the impartiality of God, who does not show favoritism based on external factors such as status or wealth. Paul's focus remains on upholding the integrity of his own doctrine and practice, unaffected by any perceived differences in stature among his fellow apostles.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The Apostle begins with ἀπὸ δὲ ῶν δοκούντων εἶναί τι, having it in his mind to add οὐδὲν προσελαβόμην or the like: but then, going off into the parenthesis ὁποῖοί ποτε ἦσαν &c., he entirely loses sight of the original construction, and proceeds with ἐμοὶ γάρ &c., which follows on the parenthesis, the γάρ rendering a reason (this is still my view, against Ellic. whose note see) for the οὐδέν μοι διαφέρει &c."
2. "The emphasis is on μοι, and is again taken up by the ἐμοὶ γάρ below."
3. "προσανέθεντο as in ch. Galatians 1:16, imparted. As I, at my first conversion, did not impart it to flesh and blood, so they now imparted nothing to me: we were independent the one of the other."

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "they . . . added nothing to me" - Paul emphasizes that the other apostles did not contribute anything significant to his understanding of the gospel. This highlights his independence as an apostle and reinforces the idea that his authority and message come directly from God.

2. "accepteth...respecteth no man's person" - Paul asserts that God does not show favoritism or partiality. This implies that the acceptance of the gospel is not based on external factors such as social status or personal connections, but solely on one's faith and relationship with God.

3. "they seemed to be somewhat" - Although Paul acknowledges that the other apostles were esteemed and considered important, he does not question their legitimacy or authority. This statement clarifies that his intention is not to undermine their position, but to emphasize his own unique calling and revelation from God.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The word used here (δοκούντων dokountōn) denotes those who were thought to be, or who were of reputation; that is, men who were of note and influence among the apostles."
2. "Paul means to say that whatever was their real rank and standing, it did not in the least affect his authority as an apostle, or his argument."
3. "God is not influenced in His judgment by a regard to the rank, or wealth, or external condition of anyone."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "To be something from (at the hands of) those who were of repute, whatever they were, matters nothing to me." 
2. "God accepteth not man's person." 
3. "They imposed on me no new requirements; no conditions or limitations of my missionary work."

### John Calvin:
1. "If he had yielded this point to his opponents, that he had profited under the apostles, he would have furnished them with two charges against him. They would immediately have said, 'And so you made some progress; you corrected your past errors, and did not repeat your former rashness.' Thus, in the first place, the whole doctrine which he had hitherto taught would have fallen under suspicion; and, secondly, he would ever afterwards have possessed less authority, because he would have been reckoned but an ordinary disciple."
2. "Paul simply means, that the honorable rank which the apostles had attained did not prevent him from being called by God, and raised, all at once, from the lowest condition to be their equal. The difference between them, though great, is of no value in the sight of God, who does not accept persons, and whose calling is not influenced by any prejudices."
3. "When the apostles had heard Paul’s gospel, they did not on the other side bring forward their own, but were satisfied with his explanation, and simply and unhesitatingly embraced his doctrine, so that not even on the most doubtful point did a single word of debate pass between them."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The expression may be depreciatory (comp. Galatians 6:3), according to the context. He does not, as already remarked, depreciate his colleagues, but disapproves the extravagant overestimate put upon them by the Judaizers in behalf of their own narrow and exclusive system and in opposition to Paul."
2. "Paul made no account of the knowledge of Christ ‘after the flesh’ (2 Corinthians 5:16), which was of no benefit to the Jews without faith."
3. "God accepteth not man’s person, or God is no regarder of person. A Hebraizing expression for impartiality. To regard a man’s person, his face, wealth, rank, and external condition, as distinct from his intrinsic merits, is partiality, and this God never exercises."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Paul refers to the Big Three (Cephas, James, and John). He seems a bit embarrassed in the reference. He means no disrespect, but he asserts his independence sharply in a tangled sentence with two parentheses."
2. "The use of δε (but) in verse Galatians 2:6 seems to make a contrast between the three leaders and the pleaders for compromise in verses Galatians 2:4."
3. "They added nothing in the conference to me. The compromisers tried to win them, but they finally came over to my view."

### John Gill:
1. "They were ministers of Christ, and stewards of the mysteries of grace; they were the Lord's ambassadors, and the apostles of the Lamb."
2. "God accepteth no man's person."
3. "He knew that God was no respecter of persons, nor was he influenced by any such external circumstances, but chose whom he pleased to such a high office."

### John Wesley:
1. "And they who undoubtedly were something — Above all others." 
2. "It is no difference to me — So that I should alter either my doctrine or my practice." 
3. "God accepteth no man's person — For any eminence in gifts or outward prerogatives."
