James, as a prominent figure, held a leadership role and exerted influence in the early Church.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "To each apostle was assigned the sphere best suited to his temperament: to James, who was tenacious of the law, the Jerusalem Jews; to Peter, who had opened the door to the Gentiles but who was Judaically disposed, the Jews of the dispersion; to Paul, who, by the miraculous and overwhelming suddenness of his conversion, had the whole current of his early Jewish prejudices turned into an utterly opposite direction, the Gentiles."
2. "Not separately and individually, but collectively the apostles together represented Christ, the One Head, in the apostleship."
3. "John had got an intimation in Jesus' lifetime of the admission of the Gentiles."

These quotes provide insights into the roles and dynamics among the apostles, emphasizing their diverse assignments and collective representation of Christ. They also highlight John's prior knowledge of the inclusion of Gentiles.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The grace implies here the call, the spiritual outfit and the success, all of which Paul regards as a free gift of God in Christ."
2. "James stood at the head of the congregation and he probably presided also over the Apostolical Council, or at all events exerted the controlling influence there and led to the final decision."
3. "The right hands of fellowship. A pledge of brotherhood and fidelity. This fact, based as it was, on sincere esteem and love, refutes the conclusion of some modern critics that there was a serious discord between Paul and the older Apostles."

### John Wesley:
1. "James, Cephas, and John, who undoubtedly were pillars, knew the grace of apostleship which was given me." 
2. "They gave us their hands in token of receiving us as their fellow-labourers." 
3. "They should go to the Gentiles, and they chiefly to the circumcision - the Jews."
