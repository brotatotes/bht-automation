# Galatians 3:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Depending on works to receive God's blessings leads to being under the curse, for perfect obedience in all things is impossible for anyone to achieve. Salvation is not obtained through the works of the law, but rather through receiving God's grace as a gift and accepting it. No one can render the perfect, uninterrupted obedience that the law requires, highlighting the need for a Savior who can fulfill the law on our behalf.
