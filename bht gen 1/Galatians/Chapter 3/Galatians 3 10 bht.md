# Galatians 3:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Those who depend on their own obedience to the law for justification find themselves under a curse, alienated from God. Trusting in works of the law is futile because it demands perfect, continuous obedience, which no one can achieve. Failure to adhere to every aspect of the law exposes individuals to its penalty and curse. This highlights the need for an alternative path to salvation beyond relying on human effort alone.
