# Galatians 3:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, it is emphasized that no one can be justified by their obedience to the law in the sight of God. Instead, justification comes through faith, which is the chosen way of God. The contrast is made between living by faith, wherein the righteous find acceptance, life, and salvation, and living by works, which cannot truly justify anyone. This scripture is a testament to the primacy of faith as the means of justification before God.
