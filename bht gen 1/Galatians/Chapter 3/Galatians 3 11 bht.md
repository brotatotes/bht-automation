# Galatians 3:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the sight of God, no one is justified by the law; our justification before God is not based on our own efforts, but on faith. As Habakkuk 2:4 says, "the just shall live by faith," highlighting the importance of faith in our relationship with God. It is through faith, not works or obedience to the law, that we experience acceptance, life, and salvation in our ongoing journey of righteousness before God.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The law is not of faith, but of doing, or works... Therefore 'in,' or 'by the law, no man is justified before God'... the Scripture element and conditional mean of justification is faith."

2. "The just shall live by faith."

3. "The contrast is between 'live by faith'... and 'live in them,' namely, in his doings or works, as the conditional element wherein he is justified."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It is impossible that a man should be justified by the Law, because God has appointed another way of justification."

### Marvin Vincent:

2. "The law justifies him who fulfils all its precepts, while faith justifies those who are destitute of the merit of works, and who rely on Christ alone."

### Archibald T Robertson:

### John Gill:
1. "No one is justified by the law; it is in the Greek text, 'in the law'; there were many justified before the law was given, as Noah, Job, Abraham, and all the Ante-Mosaic believers; and there were many justified 'in', or under the legal dispensation; but none of them were justified by their obedience to the law, but by the righteousness they believed they had in the Lord." 

2. "Especially no man is justified in the sight of God; who sees the heart, knows the spring of actions, and whose judgment is according to truth; that is, by the law and the deeds of it, however they may before men."

3. "The just shall live by faith; which may be read either, 'the just by faith, shall live': that is, the man who is just by faith, or justified by faith, not by it as a principle or act, or as the cause or matter of his justification, but by the object of his faith, Christ and his righteousness apprehended by faith, and so not just or justified by works."

### John Wesley:
1. "None is justified by his obedience to the law in the sight of God." This quote highlights the futility of trying to earn righteousness through obedience to the law. It emphasizes that our justification before God is not based on our own efforts, but on something else.

2. "The just shall live by faith." This quote references Habakkuk 2:4 and emphasizes the importance of faith in our relationship with God. It suggests that true righteousness and life come through faith, rather than through our own works or obedience to the law.

This quote expands on the previous quote and explains that faith is not just a one-time event, but an ongoing state of being. It implies that faith is the key to experiencing acceptance, life, and salvation in our relationship with God.
