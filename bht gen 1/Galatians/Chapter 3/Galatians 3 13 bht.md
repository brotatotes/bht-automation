# Galatians 3:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we see the joyful contrast presented abruptly without any connecting particle. Christ, out of infinite love and agreement with the Father's plan, willingly became a curse for us, taking upon himself the curse of the law to free us from its grip. He redeemed us at a high price, buying us out from the curse and becoming the object of the Father's wrath in our place. Through his death on the cross, Christ abolished the curse and secured our redemption, allowing the blessing of justification by faith to flow freely to both Jews and Gentiles.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The joyful contrast is introduced abruptly, without any connecting particle."
2. "They only were under the curse of Galatians 3:10, and they being by Christ redeemed from that curse, the blessing of Abraham (justification by faith), which was always destined by God to flow through the Jews to the Gentiles, was set at liberty thus to flow out to the Gentiles."
3. "The form of the idea is, the Law (personified) held us (Jews) under its curse; (out of this) Christ bought us, BECOMING (emphatic, standing first) a curse (not ἐπικατάρατος, concrete, but κατάρα, abstract, to express that he became not only accursed, but the curse, coextensive with the disability which affected us) for us (the JEWS again. Not, as many older Commentators, and Rück., Olsh., Peile, &c., ‘instead of us,’ but ‘on our behalf.’ It was in our stead; but that circumstance is not expressed by ὑπέρ used of Christ’s death for us see reff. and Ellic.’s note; and Usteri, Paulin. Lehrbegriff, p. 115 ff.)."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Christ," who "has redeemed us from its curse."
2. "The curse of its non-fulfilment affects the Gentiles through the Jews."
3. "The curse had to be removed from off the heathen, too, as well as the Jews, in order that the blessing, through Abraham, might flow to them."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Christ hath redeemed us - The word used here ἐξηγόρασεν exēgorasen is not that which is usually employed in the New Testament to denote redemption. That word is λυτρόω lutroō. The difference between them mainly is, that the word used here more usually relates to a purchase of any kind; the other is used strictly with reference to a ransom."
2. "Being made a curse for us - This is an exceedingly important expression. Tyndale renders it, 'And was made a curse for us.' The Greek word is κατάρα katara, the same word which is used in Galatians 3:10; see the note at that verse. There is scarcely any passage in the New Testament on which it is more important to have correct views than this; and scarcely anyone on which more erroneous opinions have been entertained."
3. "It was by such substituted sorrows that we are saved; and he consented to die the most shameful and painful death, as if he were the vilest criminal, in order that the most guilty and vile of the human race might be saved."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Christ was in no sense accursed by God in his crucifixion."
2. "The law satisfied its demand upon him, and thus thrust him out of the pale of the legal economy."
3. "The cross is regarded as a tree, and Christians as its fruit."

### John Calvin:
1. "Christ hath redeemed us... If we are saved, because we have been freed from the curse of the law, then righteousness is not by the law."
2. "But it is certain that he did not suffer that punishment on his own account. It follows, therefore, either that he was crucified in vain, or that our curse was laid upon him, in order that we might be delivered from it."
3. "He could not cease to be the object of his Father’s love, and yet he endured his wrath. For how could he reconcile the Father to us, if he had incurred his hatred and displeasure?"

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Christ, out of infinite love and in full agreement with the Father’s eternal plan of redemption, voluntarily assumed, bore and abolished, by His death on the cross, the whole curse of the outraged law in the stead and in behalf of sinners."
2. "The curse is transferred from the guilty sinner to the innocent victim (as in the case of the typical scape-goat Leviticus 16:5. ff.)."
3. "For Christ was not Himself accursed of God, but only in a vicarious sense, that is, by the voluntary self-assumption of the curse of others, and in full harmony with the Father’s wish and will."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Christ purchased us from the curse of the law." 
2. "He bought us out and we are free from the curse which he took on himself." 
3. "The allusion was to exposure of dead bodies on stakes or crosses."

### John Gill:
1. "The Redeemer is Christ, the Son of God; who was appointed and called to this work by his Father, and which he himself agreed to."
2. "The blessing obtained for them is redemption; a buying of them again, as the word signifies; they were his before by the Father's gift, and now he purchases them with the price of his own blood."
3. "The manner in which this was done was by being made a curse for us; the sense of which is, not only that he was like an accursed person, looked upon as such by the men of that wicked generation, but was even accursed by the law; becoming the surety of his people, he was made under the law, stood in their legal place and stead and having the sins of them all imputed to him, and answerable for them, the law finding them on him, charges him with them, and curses him for them."

### John Wesley:
1. "Christ — Christ alone. The abruptness of the sentence shows a holy indignation at those who reject so great a blessing."
2. "Hath redeemed us — Whether Jews or gentiles, at a high price."
3. "Being made a curse for us — Taking the curse upon himself, that we might be delivered from it, willingly submitting to that death which the law pronounces peculiarly accursed."
