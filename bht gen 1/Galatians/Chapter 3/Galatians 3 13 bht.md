# Galatians 3:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse being described is a powerful portrayal of Jesus Christ's sacrificial act of redemption. Commentators highlight how Christ willingly took upon Himself the curse of the law, becoming a representative for both Jews and Gentiles. Through His death on the cross, Christ bore the weight of the curse and freed believers from its grip. His precious blood served as the ransom price, purchasing our redemption. This verse emphasizes Christ's ultimate love and fulfillment of legal requirements, highlighting the remarkable blessing obtained through His sacrifice.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "The curse of its non-fulfilment affects the Gentiles through the Jews; for the law represents that righteousness which God requires of all, and which, since the Jews failed to fulfil, the Gentiles are equally unable to fulfil."
2. "The ransom price He paid was His own precious blood."
3. "Christ's bearing the particular curse of hanging on the tree, is a sample of the 'general' curse which He representatively bore."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Christ, out of infinite love and in full agreement with the Father's eternal plan of redemption, voluntarily assumed, bore and abolished, by His death on the cross, the whole curse of the outraged law in the stead and in behalf of sinners."
2. "The curse is transferred from the guilty sinner to the innocent victim."
3. "Our Saviour fulfilled the legal curse by hanging dead on the cross."

### John Gill:
1. "The Redeemer is Christ, the Son of God; who was appointed and called to this work by his Father, and which he himself agreed to."
2. "The blessing obtained for them is redemption; a buying of them again, as the word signifies; they were his before by the Father's gift, and now he purchases them with the price of his own blood."
3. "The manner in which this was done was by being made a curse for us; the sense of which is, not only that he was like an accursed person, looked upon as such by the men of that wicked generation, but was even accursed by the law; becoming the surety of his people, he was made under the law, stood in their legal place and stead and having the sins of them all imputed to him, and answerable for them, the law finding them on him, charges him with them, and curses him for them."

### John Wesley:
1. "Christ — Christ alone. The abruptness of the sentence shows an holy indignation at those who reject so great a blessing."
2. "Hath redeemed us — Whether Jews or gentiles, at an high price."
3. "Being made a curse for us — Taking the curse upon himself, that we might be delivered from it, willingly submitting to that death which the law pronounces peculiarly accursed."
