# Galatians 3:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The passage being described highlights the unchanging and steadfast nature of God's covenant. Drawing from relatable examples, the author emphasizes that if even human covenants are binding and unalterable once legally confirmed, then how much more so is God's covenant, which is established by His own word and oath. This description emphasizes the lasting and unwavering nature of God's promises, contrasting them with the temporary and limited nature of human agreements.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "But (see 1Co 15:32) the expression refers not only to the character of the example chosen, but to the temporary standing-point of him who speaks: I put myself for the time on a level with ordinary men in the world."

2. "ὅμως is out of its logical place, which would be after οὐδείς; see on ref. 1 Cor. To make it ‘even’ and take it with ἀνθρώπου, is contrary to its usage."

3. "A (mere) man’s covenant (not ‘testament,’ as Olsh., after Aug., al.; for there is here no introduction of that idea: the promise spoken to Abraham was strictly a covenant, and designated διαθήκη in the passages which were now in the Apostle’s mind, see Genesis 15:18; Genesis 17:7. On the general meaning, see Mr. Bagge’s note) when ratified (reff.), no one notwithstanding (that it is merely a human covenant) sets aside or supplements (with new conditions, Jos. Antt. xvii. 9. 4 describes Archelaus as ὁ ἐν ταῖς ἐπιδιαθήκαις ὑπὸ τοῦ πατρὸς ἐγγεγραμμένος βασιλεύς, ‘in his father’s subsequent testament:’ and again says of Antipas, B. J. ii. 2. 3, ἀξιῶν τῆς ἐπιδιαθήκης τὴν διαθήκην εἶναι κυριωτέραν, ἐν ᾗ βασιλεὺς αὐτὸς ἐγέγραπτο. Nothing is implied as to the nature of the additions, whether consistent or inconsistent with the original covenant: the simple fact that no additions are made, is enounced)."

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "The law is here, by personification, regarded as a second person, distinct from, and subsequent to, the promise of God."
2. "The promise is everlasting, and more peculiarly belongs to God."
3. "So legal Judaism could make no alteration in the fundamental relation between God and man, already established by the promises to Abraham."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The main design of the argument and the illustration here is to show that the promise made to Abraham was by no means made void by the giving of the Law."
2. "The argument here is, that such a covenant or agreement must be much less important than a promise made by God. But even that could not be annulled."
3. "No one can change it. No new conditions can be annexed; nor can there be any drawing back from its terms. It binds the parties to a faithful fulfillment of all the conditions."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "According to human analogy; reasoning as men would reason in ordinary affairs."
2. "Yet a man's covenant confirmed no one disannulleth, etc."
3. "The doctrine of the Judaisers, while virtually annulling the promise, was apparently only the imposing of new conditions."

### John Calvin:
1. "It is highly disgraceful and base that the testimony of God should have less weight with us than that of a mortal man."
2. "In demanding that the sacred covenant of God shall receive not less deference than is commonly yielded to ordinary human transactions, he does not place God on a level with men."
3. "The apostle appears to reason from human bargains to that solemn covenant into which God entered with Abraham. If human bargains be so firm that they can receive no addition, how much more must this covenant remain inviolable?"

### Philip Schaff:
1. "There is a touch of tenderness in the appeal here, as if to make amends for the severity of the foregoing rebuke." 
2. "If even changeable men keep legal contracts sacred, how much more the unchangeable God."
3. "The designation of the 'Old and New Testament' (instead of 'Covenant') arose from this mistranslation, and is especially improper in the case of the Old Covenant (since God cannot die), but has become so well established that it must be retained."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "After the custom and practice of men, an illustration from life."
2. "Yet a man's covenant ratified."
3. "Both parties can by agreement cancel a contract, but not otherwise."

### John Gill:
1. "I speak after the manner of men; agreeably to a Talmudic form of speech in use among the Jews, 'the law speaks according to the language of the children of men', or 'after the manner of men', when they argue from any Scripture, in which a word is repeated, and the latter word seems to point out something peculiar."
2. "If a covenant made between men, or a man's will and testament, be confirmed, signed, sealed, and witnessed, in a proper manner, no other man can make them void, or take anything from them, or add anything to them, only the parties concerned by their own will and consent."
3. "If this be the case among men, much less can the covenant of God, confirmed by two immutable things, his word and oath, or his will and testament, or any branch of it, be ever disannulled, or be capable of receiving any addition thereunto."

### John Wesley:
1. "I speak after the manner of men" - The author uses a relatable example to help readers understand the concept being discussed.
2. "Though it be but a man's covenant, yet, if it be once legally confirmed, none - No, not the covenanter himself" - Once a covenant is legally established, even the person who made the covenant cannot change or add conditions to it.
3. "unless something unforeseen occur, which cannot be the case with God" - Unlike human covenants, there are no unforeseen circumstances that can alter God's covenant.
