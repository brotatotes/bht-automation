# Galatians 3:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the promise of an everlasting covenant with God is discussed, which is unchangeable and firmly established. The commentators emphasize the importance of keeping God's covenant sacred, even more so than ordinary human transactions. The covenant is described as having a tender appeal and being legally confirmed, with no one, not even God Himself, able to alter its terms. The verse uses familiar examples to help readers understand the significance of the unalterable nature of the covenant, illustrating that once established, it cannot be nullified or modified.
