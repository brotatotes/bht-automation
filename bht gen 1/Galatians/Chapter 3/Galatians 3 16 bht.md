## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The covenant was not merely nor principally made with Abraham, but with Abraham and HIS SEED, and that seed referred, not to the Jewish people, but to CHRIST."
2. "The central point of the Apostle’s argument is this: The seed to whom the promises were made, was Christ."
3. "Christ contains His people, and the mention even of the personal Christ would bring with it, in the Apostle’s mind, the inclusion of His believing people."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The covenant of promise was not 'spoken' (so Greek for 'made') to Abraham alone, but 'to Abraham and his seed'; to the latter especially; and this means Christ." 
2. "In the spiritual seed there is no distinction of Jew or Greek; but to the literal seed, the promises still in part remain to be fulfilled." 
3. "The promise that in Him 'all the families of the earth shall be blessed' joins in this one Seed, Christ, Jew and Gentile, as fellow heirs on the same terms of acceptability, namely, by grace through faith."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The promise here referred to was that which is recorded in Genesis 22:17-18. 'In blessing I will bless thee, and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of heaven, and as the sand which is upon the sea-shore; and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed.'"
2. "He does not use the plural term, as if the promise extended to many persons, but he speaks in the singular number, as if only one was intended; and that one must be the Messiah."
3. "The promise was indeed at first general, and the term used was of the most general nature; but it was shown from time to time that God intended that it should be applied only to one branch or portion of the family of Abraham; and that limitation was finally so made as to terminate in the Messiah."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The main point is that the promises to Abraham continue to hold for Christian believers."
2. "Even a man's covenant remains uncancelled and without additions. Similarly, God's covenant - promises to Abraham remain valid."
3. "The original promise referred to the posterity of Abraham generally, and therefore applies to Christ individually only as representing these: as gathering up into one all who should be incorporated with him."

### John Calvin:
1. "But if Christ be the foundation of the bargain, it follows that it is of free grace; and this too is the meaning of the word promise."
2. "Paul does not make his argument rest on the use of the singular number. He merely shews that the word seed must denote one who was not only descended from Abraham according to the flesh, but had been likewise appointed for this purpose by the calling of God."
3. "We have ascertained, then, that we are all cursed by nature, and that the blessing of Abraham has been promised to all nations. Do all indiscriminately reach it? Certainly not, but those only who are 'gathered' to the Messiah; for when, under His government and direction, they are collected into one body, they then become one people."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The promised inheritance refers evidently in its next and literal sense to the land of Canaan, but in its deeper spiritual sense to the kingdom of Christ."
2. "The main point is that the collective word seed is used instead of children or descendants, and that this word seed denotes an organic unity of true spiritual Abrahamites, and not all the carnal descendants of Abraham, as the Jews imagined."
3. "The seed includes, therefore, all true believers who are vitally united to Christ."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "But the promise to Abraham uses σπερμα as a collective substantive and applies to all believers (both Jews and Gentiles) as Paul has shown in verses Galatians 3:7-14."
2. "Here Paul uses a rabbinical refinement which is yet intelligible."
3. "The people of Israel were a type of the Messiah and he gathers up the promise in its special application to Christ."

### John Gill:
1. "The promises design the promises of the covenant of grace mentioned in the next verse, which are exceeding great and precious, better than those of any other covenant."
2. "The promises here intended principally are such as these, that God will be their God, and they shall be his people, the promise of Christ as a Saviour and Redeemer of them; of the Spirit as their sanctifier, and the applier of all grace unto them; of justification by Christ's righteousness, and pardon by his blood; of adoption through free rich grace; of perseverance in grace, and of the eternal inheritance."
3. "Christ mystical, the church, which is the body of Christ, of which he is the head, and is called by his name, 1 Corinthians 12:12 and designs all Abraham's spiritual seed, both Jews and Gentiles; who are all one in Christ, and so Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise."
