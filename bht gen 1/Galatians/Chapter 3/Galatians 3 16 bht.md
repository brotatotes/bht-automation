# Galatians 3:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This Bible verse captures the promise made to Abraham and his descendants, namely Christ. The promise encompasses both earthly blessings for Abraham's literal children and spiritual blessings for his spiritual children. Furthermore, the promise extends beyond the descendants of Abraham to include all believers, both Jew and Gentile, who are united to Christ and share in the blessings through faith. The inheritance mentioned in the verse holds both a literal sense, referring to the land of Canaan, and a deeper spiritual sense, signifying the kingdom of Christ.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "The covenant of promise was not 'spoken' (so Greek for 'made') to Abraham alone, but 'to Abraham and his seed'; to the latter especially; and this means Christ."
2. "The promises involved many things; earthly blessings to the literal children of Abraham in Canaan, and spiritual and heavenly blessings to his spiritual children; but both promised to Christ, 'the Seed' and representative Head of the literal and spiritual Israel alike."
3. "The promise that in Him 'all the families of the earth shall be blessed' joins in this one Seed, Christ, Jew and Gentile, as fellow heirs on the same terms of acceptability, namely, by grace through faith."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The promised inheritance refers evidently in its next and literal sense to the land of Canaan, but in its deeper spiritual sense to the kingdom of Christ."
2. "The main point is that the collective word seed is used instead of children or descendants, and that this word seed denotes an organic unity of true spiritual Abrahamites, and not all the carnal descendants of Abraham, as the Jews imagined."
3. "The seed includes, therefore, all true believers who are vitally united to Christ."

### John Wesley:
1. "The chief promise made to Abraham was that of the blessing through Christ."
2. "The promise was not made to several kinds of seed, but to one kind of seed, one posterity, one kind of sons."
3. "The blessing belongs to all who believe in Christ."
