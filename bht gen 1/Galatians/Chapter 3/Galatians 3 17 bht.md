# Galatians 3:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This verse speaks of a covenant confirmed by God before the giving of the Law, one that promises blessings to all nations. The Law, which came much later, cannot nullify or invalidate this promise. The covenant, fulfilled through Christ, remains in effect and is not superseded by the Law. It is a covenant of grace and redemption, offering blessings not dependent on works but freely given by God.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "the covenant (better than a covenant, as most Commentators; even Meyer and De W.: the emphatic substantive is often anarthrous: cf. the different arrangement in Gal 3:15) which was previously ratified by God (εἰς χρ. being inserted by some to complete the correspondence with Galatians 3:16; the fact was so, it was ‘to Christ,’ as its second party, that the covenant was ratified by God), the Law, which took place (was constituted) four hundred and thirty years after, does not abrogate, so as to do away the promise." 

2. "But in the LXX (and Samaritan Pentateuch) we read, Exodus 12:40, ἡ δὲ κατοίκησις (παροίκ., A.) τῶν υἱῶν Ἰσραήλ, ἣν κατῴκησαν (παρῴκ., A.) ἐν γῇ Αἰγύπτῳ καὶ ἐν γῇ Χαναάν (A. adding αὐτοὶ καὶ οἱ πατέρες αὐτῶν) ἔτη τετρακόσια τριάκοντα: and this reckoning St. Paul has followed."

3. "Thus it will appear that the LXX, Samaritan Pent., and St. Paul, have the right chronology, and as stated above, the difficulty lies in Gen 15:13 and Acts 7:6, and in the Hebrew text of Exodus 12:40."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The dispensation of 'the promise' began with the call of Abraham from Ur into Canaan, and ended on the last night of his grandson Jacob's sojourn in Canaan, the land of promise."
2. "It is from the end, not from the beginning of the dispensation of promise, that the interval of four hundred thirty years between it and the law is to be counted."
3. "The promise would become [of none effect], if the power of conferring the inheritance be transferred from it to the law."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The covenant which was confirmed before of God - By God, in his promise to Abraham. It was confirmed before the giving of the Law. The confirmation was the solemn promise which God made to him."
2. "In Christ - With respect to the Messiah; a covenant relating to him, and which promised that he should descend from Abraham."
3. "The argument is, that a law given after the solemn promise which had been made and confirmed, could not make that promise void. It would still be binding according to the original intention; and the Law must have been given for some purpose entirely different from that of the promise."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Now I mean this. Not strictly the conclusion from vv. 15, 16, since Paul does not use this phrase in drawing a conclusion."
2. "It is rather the application, for which the way was prepared in verse 16, of the analogy of verse 15 to the inviolable stability of God's covenant."
3. "The greatness of the interval increases the authority of the promise."

### John Calvin:
1. "The ceremonies themselves are not so much considered by him as something higher, — the effect of justification which was attributed to them by false apostles, and the obligation on the conscience."
2. "If the point in dispute had no connection with obtaining righteousness, with the merit of works, or with ensnaring the conscience, ceremonies would be quite consistent with the promise."
3. "Paul took into account what was certainly true, that, except by a covenant with God, no reward is due to works."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "It is impossible that the law should cancel the promise which was given repeatedly at least four hundred and thirty years earlier to the patriarchs, and which looked from the beginning to Christ as the proper end, so that the law is only an intervening link between the promise and its fulfilment."
2. "The starting-point with him was the close of the patriarchal age, during which the promise was repeatedly given to Isaac and Jacob as well as to Abraham."
3. "Paul means to say, the older an agreement the stronger is its authority."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Now I mean this. He comes back to his main point and is not carried afield by the special application of σπερμα to Christ."
2. "The point is in προ and υπο του θεου (by God) and in μετα (after) as Burton shows."
3. "It is immaterial to Paul's argument which chronology is adopted except that 'the longer the covenant had been in force the more impressive is his statement' (Burton)."

### John Gill:
1. "The covenant that was confirmed before of God in Christ, the law, which was four hundred and thirty years after, cannot disannul." - This quote emphasizes that the covenant made with Abraham, which was confirmed by God, predates the giving of the law and cannot be nullified by it.

2. "A covenant confirmed of God in Christ...the covenant of grace and redemption; because the articles of redemption and reconciliation, of eternal life and salvation, by the free grace of God, are the principal things in it." - This quote highlights that the covenant in question is the covenant of grace and redemption, which includes the promise of eternal life and salvation through God's free grace.

3. "The law, which was so long after the confirming of the covenant to Abraham, could not make it null and void: or that it should make the promise of none effect." - This quote emphasizes that the law, given 430 years after the covenant with Abraham, does not nullify or invalidate the promise made in the covenant. The promise remains in effect despite the introduction of the law.

### John Wesley:
1. "The covenant which was before confirmed of God... concerning the blessing all nations." 
2. "Through Christ, the law... Doth not disannul, so as to make the promise of no effect." 
3. "With regard to all nations, if only the Jewish were to receive it; yea, with regard to them also, if it was by works, so as to supersede it, and introduce another way of obtaining the blessing."
