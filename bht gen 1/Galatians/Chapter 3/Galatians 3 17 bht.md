# Galatians 3:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this passage, commentators discuss the significance of the dispensation of promise and its relationship to the law. They emphasize that the promise, which began with Abraham and ended with Jacob, cannot be nullified by the law. The promise, given hundreds of years before the law, looks to Christ as its fulfillment. The law, introduced after the promise, does not supersede it but serves as an intervening link. This covenant, confirmed by God, prevails and remains effective, ensuring the inheritance and blessing for all nations.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "The dispensation of 'the promise' began with the call of Abraham from Ur into Canaan, and ended on the last night of his grandson Jacob's sojourn in Canaan, the land of promise."
2. "It is from the end, not from the beginning of the dispensation of promise, that the interval of four hundred thirty years between it and the law is to be counted."
3. "The promise would become so, if the power of conferring the inheritance be transferred from it to the law."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "It is impossible that the law should cancel the promise which was given repeatedly at least four hundred and thirty years earlier to the patriarchs, and which looked from the beginning to Christ as the proper end, so that the law is only an intervening link between the promise and its fulfilment." 
2. "The law which came (so long a time as) four hundred and thirty years after (the promise). This is the exact time of the sojourn of the Israelites in Egypt, according to the historical statement in Exodus 12:40." 
3. "Paul means to say, the older an agreement the stronger is its authority. The Hebrew text would strengthen the argument."

### John Wesley:
1. "The covenant which was before confirmed of God — By the promise itself, by the repetition of it, and by a solemn oath, concerning the blessing all nations."
2. "Through Christ, the law which was four hundred and thirty years after — Counting from the time when the promise was first made to Abraham, Genesis 12:2,3."
3. "Doth not disannul, so as to make the promise of no effect — With regard to all nations, if only the Jewish were to receive it; yea, with regard to them also, if it was by works, so as to supersede it, and introduce another way of obtaining the blessing."
