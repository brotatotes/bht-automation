# Galatians 3:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse in question speaks of the inheritance promised to Abraham, which includes both physical and spiritual blessings. Commentators emphasize that this inheritance is obtained not by fulfilling the law, but through the promise made to Abraham and his Seed, who is Christ. They stress the dichotomy between the law and the promise, highlighting that salvation cannot be based on both. The eternal inheritance is a gift of God's grace, received by faith, and not achieved through works or observance of the law.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "For if the inheritance is of the law, it is no more of promise." 
2. "The inheritance, the blessings promised to Abraham, is summed up in his Seed who was to inherit the land, in other words, for the Kingdom of Christ."
3. "To Abraham by promise hath God granted it (the inheritance), and therefore it is not of the Law."

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "The inheritanceâ€”all the blessings to be inherited by Abraham's literal and spiritual children, according to the promise made to him and to his Seed, Christ, justification and glorification."
2. "But to Abraham it was by promise that God hath given it."
3. "Therefore the inheritance is not of, or from the law."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The sum of the promise was, that 'he should be the heir of the world;'... To that heirship or inheritance Paul refers here, and says that it was an essential part of it that it was to be in virtue of the promise made to him, and not by fulfilling the Law." 
2. "But if so, says Paul, then it could not be by the promise made to Abraham, since there could not be two ways of obtaining the same blessing." 
3. "That promise was confirmed and ratified hundreds of years before the Law was given, and the giving of the Law could not affect it."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The Judaisers insisted on addition; since, while they preached faith in the promise and in its fulfillment in Christ, they made the inheritance of the promise dependent upon the fulfilling of the law."
2. "Paul, on the other hand, holds that the Judaistic addition involves invalidation. Salvation must rest either upon the promise or upon the law."
3. "Hence, if the inheritance be of the law it is no more of the promise."

### John Calvin:

3. "The reason is, that the promise has respect to faith, and the law to works."

2. "Law and works are inseparably connected, and so are promise (or grace) and faith."

3. "Hath freely given, bestowed it as a free gift 'The perfect tense marks the permanence of the effect' (Lightfoot)."

### John Wesley:
