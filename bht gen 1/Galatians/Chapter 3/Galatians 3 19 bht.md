## BHT:
The Bible verse being described focuses on the purpose and role of the law in relation to transgressions, the fulfillment of promises, and the coming of Christ. Commentators highlight that the law was given to bring awareness and conviction of transgressions, emphasizing the need for a promised Savior, and to restrain and deter sin. It reveals the true nature of sin, declaring its penalty, and pointing towards the future redemption through Christ. Both the moral and ceremonial aspects of the law play a significant role in the overall plan and preparation for the fulfillment of the promise.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The law, though misunderstood by the Judaizers as doing so, was really added for a different purpose, namely, 'because of (or as the Greek, 'for the sake of') the transgressions,' that is, to bring out into clearer view the transgressions of it (Romans 7:7-9); to make men more fully conscious of their 'sins,' by being perceived as transgressions of the law, and so to make them long for the promised Saviour." 

2. "The law rather stimulates the corrupt heart to disobey it." 

3. "The law was a preparatory dispensation for the Jewish nation, intervening between the promise and its fulfillment in Christ."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The Law was not useless, but that it was given by God for great and important purposes, and especially for purposes closely connected with the fulfillment of the promise made to Abraham and the work of the Mediator."
2. "The Law was given to show the true nature of transgressions, or to show what was sin. It was not to reveal a way of justification, but it was to disclose the true nature of sin; to deter people from committing it; to declare its penalty; to convince people of it, and thus to be 'ancillary' to, and preparatory to the work of redemption through the Redeemer."
3. "The whole arrangement of the Mosaic economy, including all his laws, was with reference to the Messiah. It was a part of a great and glorious whole. It was not an independent thing. It did not stand by itself. It was incomplete and in many respects unintelligible until he came - as one part of a tally is unmeaning and useless until the other is found."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "What is its meaning and object? A natural question of an objector, since, according to Paul's reasoning, salvation is of promise and not of law."
2. "Its office was, in revealing sin as positive transgression, to emphasize the objective, actual, contrary fact of righteousness according to the divine ideal, and to throw sin into contrast with that grand ideal."
3. "The agency of angels indicates the limitations of the older dispensation; its character as a dispensation of the flesh."

### John Calvin:
1. "The law was published in order to make known transgressions, and in this way to compel men to acknowledge their guilt."
2. "Its instruction tends only to increase transgressions, until the Spirit of regeneration come, who writes it on the heart."
3. "The law was given in order to rouse men to the expectation of Christ."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "It was superadded because of the transgressions. It was not the original scheme, but a subsequent addition to the promise for an interimistic educational purpose to prepare the way for the fulfilment of the promise in Christ by the development of the disease of sin which is necessary to its cure."
2. "The disease of sin must reach the crisis before the restoration could take place, and so far we may say that God willed the development of sin with the view to its complete suppression by the future redemption."
3. "Being ordained (or enacted) by angels (by the ministry of angels). According to Josephus and the Jewish tradition, the angels acted as the ministers and organs of God in the promulgation of the Mosaic law."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "The law is no part of the covenant, but a thing apart 'in no way modifying its provisions'." 
2. "It may be causal or telic here, not in order to create transgressions, but rather 'to make transgressions palpable'." 
3. "About angels and the giving of the law."

### John Gill:
1. "The law was given, to lay a restraint on men, by forbidding such and such things, on pain of death; and also for the detecting, discovering, and making known transgressions, what they are, their nature and consequences; these the law charges men with, sets them before them, in their true light and proper colours; and convicts them of them, stops their mouths, and pronounces them guilty before God."
2. "The law was given for the punishing of transgressions, for which it curses, and threatens with death, and inflicts it on Christless sinners."
3. "The law was to continue in the form in which, and the use for which it was added, and then to cease as the ministration of Moses; for through the coming of Christ it received its full accomplishment, and came to an end; the ceremonial law was utterly abolished, and the moral law ceased to be a covenant of works, though it continues a rule of walk and conversation."

### John Wesley:
1. "The ceremonial law was inflicted as a punishment for the national sin of idolatry, at least the more grievous parts of it; and the whole of it was a prophetic type of Christ."
2. "The moral law was added to the promise to discover and restrain transgressions, to convince men of their guilt, and need of the promise, and give some check to sin."
3. "The ceremonial law was only introduced till Christ, the seed to or through whom the promise was made, should come."
