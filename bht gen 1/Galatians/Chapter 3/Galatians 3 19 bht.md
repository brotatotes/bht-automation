# Galatians 3:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Bible verse in question highlights how the law was added for a specific purpose, namely, to bring out the transgressions and make people aware of their sins. It was meant to stimulate the heart to disobey and act as a punishment for idolatry. Both the ceremonial and moral laws were intended to reveal the need for the promised Savior and act as a preparatory stage before the fulfillment in Christ. Ultimately, the law served as a temporary measure until the arrival of the promised seed, Jesus Christ.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "The law, though misunderstood by the Judaizers as doing so, was really added for a different purpose, namely, 'because of (or as the Greek, 'for the sake of') the transgressions,' that is, to bring out into clearer view the transgressions of it (Romans 7:7-9); to make men more fully conscious of their 'sins,' by being perceived as transgressions of the law, and so to make them long for the promised Saviour." 
2. "The law rather stimulates the corrupt heart to disobey it." 
3. "The law was a preparatory dispensation for the Jewish nation, intervening between the promise and its fulfillment in Christ."

### John Wesley:
1. "The ceremonial law was inflicted as a punishment for the national sin of idolatry, at least the more grievous parts of it; and the whole of it was a prophetic type of Christ."
2. "The moral law was added to the promise to discover and restrain transgressions, to convince men of their guilt, and need of the promise, and give some check to sin."
3. "The ceremonial law was only introduced till Christ, the seed to or through whom the promise was made, should come."
