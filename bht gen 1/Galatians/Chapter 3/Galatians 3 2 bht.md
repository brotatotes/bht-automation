2. "Did you receive the Spirit from the works of the Law or from the hearing of faith?"

"Now the apostle asks, whether they received this Spirit 'by the works of the law'; meaning, either whether they could imagine, that they by their obedience to the law had merited and procured the Spirit of God; or whether they thought that the Spirit came to them, and into their hearts, through the doctrine or preaching of the law."
