# Galatians 3:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Bible verse being described emphasizes the concept of mediation between two parties. It distinguishes between the Law, which introduced a mediator, and God's promise, which was made directly to Abraham without a middleman. It also highlights the unity of God as a singular party involved in the promise. The verse prompts us to consider the role of Christ as the ultimate Mediator between God and humanity, standing between the two and bridging the gap.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "God is one" - God's essential unity does not allow for an intervening party between Him and those to be blessed. He is the sovereign, giving blessings directly without the need for a mediator or conditions.
2. "The law, with its inseparable appendage of a mediator, cannot be the normal way of dealing of God" - The law, which introduced a mediator and conditions between man and God, was an exceptional state limited to the Jews and was preparatory to the Gospel, which is God's normal mode of dealing with all nations united by faith in Christ.
3. "Jesus is not a mediator separating the two parties in the covenant of promise or grace, but ONE in both nature and office with both God and man" - Jesus, as the mediator, represents the whole universal manhood and bears the fullness of the Godhead. His mediatorial office will cease when its purpose of reconciling all things to God is accomplished.

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The very idea of mediation supposes two parties."
2. "The law is of the nature of a contract between God and the Jewish people."
3. "His promise depends on his own individual decree."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "The law is in the nature of a contract between God and the Jewish people with Moses as the mediator or middleman." 
2. "But God is one. There was no middleman between God and Abraham. He made the promise directly to Abraham." 
3. "Over 400 interpretations of this verse have been made!"

### John Gill:
1. "A mediator supposes two parties he stands between, and these at a distance from, or disagreeing with each other."
2. "Christ is the Mediator between God and men, the daysman, Job 9:33, that lays his hands upon them both."
3. "God is one; not in person, for there are three persons in the Godhead, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost, and these three are one, in nature and essence."

These quotes highlight the role of a mediator, the unique position of Christ as the mediator between God and humanity, and the unity of God despite the existence of three persons in the Godhead.

### John Wesley:
1. "There must be two parties, or there can be no mediator between them."
2. "God who made the free promise to Abraham is only one of the parties."
3. "The law, wherein he was concerned, was a transaction of quite another nature."
