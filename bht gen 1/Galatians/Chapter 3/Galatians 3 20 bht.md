# Galatians 3:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, it emphasizes the concept of a mediator between two parties. The law, being a separate transaction, does not negate the promise made by God to Abraham. God, who is unified in nature, made the free promise Himself, making Him the sole party involved. The role of a mediator is crucial in understanding the distinct nature of the law and the promise.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Clearly, ὁ μεσίτης and ὁ θεός are opposed."
2. "The proposition ὁ θεὸς εἷς ἐστιν would carry to the mind of every reader much more than the mere numerical unity of God viz. His Unity as an essential attribute, extending through the whole divine Character."
3. "The law, administered by the μεσίτης, belonging to a state of οὐχ εἷς, two at variance, is apparently opposed to the ἐπαγγελίαι, belonging entirely to ὁ εἷς, the one (faithful) God."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "God is one" - His essential unity does not allow for an intervening party between Him and those to be blessed. He is the sovereign, giving blessings directly without the need for a mediator or conditions.
2. "The law, with its inseparable appendage of a mediator, cannot be the normal way of dealing of God" - The law, which interposed a mediator and conditions between man and God, was an exceptional state limited to the Jews and was preparatory to the Gospel, God's normal mode of dealing.
3. "Jesus is not a mediator separating the two parties in the covenant of promise or grace, but ONE in both nature and office with both God and man" - Jesus represents the whole universal manhood and bears in Him all the fullness of the Godhead. His mediatorial office will cease when its purpose of reconciling all things to God is accomplished.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The very idea of a mediator supposes that there are two parties or persons between whom the mediator comes either to reconcile them or to bear some message from the one to the other."
2. "The design of the apostle is, to show that the giving of the Law could not abrogate or affect the promise made to Abraham; and to show at the same time what is its true object."
3. "A mediator always supposes two parties. In all the transactions, therefore, where a mediator is employed, there is supposed to be two parties."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The conception of mediator does not belong to an individual considered singly." 
2. "The very idea of mediation supposes two parties." 
3. "God does not need a mediator to make his promise valid."

### John Calvin:
1. "There may, perhaps, be an Anticipation (πρόληψις) of some wicked thought that might arise about a change of the divine purpose."
2. "Christ is not the Mediator of one, because, in respect of outward character, there is a diversity of condition among those with whom, through his mediation, God enters into covenant."
3. "God is one, because he always continues to be like himself, and, with unvarying regularity, holds fixed and unalterable the purpose which he has once made."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The God who gave both the promise and the law is one and the same, consistent in all his dealings, and cannot contradict himself, therefore the law cannot set aside the promise."
2. "The law is a covenant between two parties and is conditioned by the obedience of the people; but the promise is the free gift of God alone, and man is merely the recipient; the law may be broken by sinful men, the promise of God is unconditional and irrevocable."
3. "The sentence is an attack upon the law and the Judaizers. A mediator, and consequently also the law which was given by mediators (angels and Moses), does not appertain to the promise which proceeds from God alone."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The law is in the nature of a contract between God and the Jewish people with Moses as the mediator or middleman." 
2. "But God is one. There was no middleman between God and Abraham. He made the promise directly to Abraham." 
3. "Over 400 interpretations of this verse have been made!"

### John Gill:
1. "A mediator supposes two parties he stands between, and these at a distance from, or disagreeing with each other."
2. "Christ is the Mediator between God and men, the daysman, Job 9:33, that lays his hands upon them both."
3. "God is one; not in person, for there are three persons in the Godhead, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost, and these three are one, in nature and essence."

These quotes highlight the role of a mediator, the unique position of Christ as the Mediator between God and humanity, and the unity of God despite the existence of three persons in the Godhead.

### John Wesley:
1. "There must be two parties, or there can be no mediator between them."
2. "God who made the free promise to Abraham is only one of the parties."
3. "The law, wherein he was concerned, was a transaction of quite another nature."
