# Galatians 3:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Bible verse being described is one that explores the relationship between the law and the promises of God. Commentators highlight that while the law is incapable of imparting spiritual life or justifying individuals, it does not contradict the promises. The law serves the purpose of bringing sin to light, preparing the way for the fulfillment of the promise of righteousness through the Gospel of grace. Emphasizing the futility of seeking justification through the law, the verse underscores the vital role of the promise and the need for spiritual life through Christ.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "The law, as an externally prescribed rule, can never internally impart spiritual life to men naturally dead in sin, and change the disposition."
2. "If the law had been a law capable of giving life, 'verily (in very reality, and not in the mere fancy of legalists) righteousness would have been by the law.'"
3. "Righteousness can only come through the promise to Abraham, and through its fulfillment in the Gospel of grace."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The object of the apostle in asking this question is, evidently, to take an opportunity to deny in the most positive manner that there can be any such clashing or contradiction."
2. "The Law of Moses is as good as a law can be. It is pure, and truly, and good. It is not the design to insinuate anything against the Law in itself, or to say that as a law it is defective."
3. "The fact, therefore, that no one can be justified by the pure law revealed on Mount Sinai, forever settles the question about the possibility of being justified by law."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Does it follow from the difference between the law and the promises that they are in antagonism?"
2. "If the law is against the promises, and makes them invalid, it follows that life must come through the law."
3. "The meaning is substantially the same with either reading: in the one case proceeding from, in the other residing in the law."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "If the law had the power to break sin and to impart righteousness and life, it would indeed be a rival of the promise and enter into conflict with it."
2. "But this is not the aim of the law at all; on the contrary it is intended merely to bring sin to its proper crisis and thereby to prepare the fulfilment of the promise."
3. "Paul maintains, in opposition to the vain conceit of the self-righteous Jews and Judaizing Christians, that the law condemns all alike."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Against the promises" - This phrase raises a pertinent question about the contradiction between the promises of God and the idea of justification by the law.
2. "Which could make alive" - This highlights the power of the gospel to bring spiritual life, both in the present and in the future.
3. "Verily" - This word emphasizes the truthfulness and certainty of the condition and conclusion being discussed, reinforcing the argument that Christ's death would be in vain if justification came through the law.

### John Wesley:
1. "The law is not against the promises of God, but they are well consistent." 
2. "The law cannot give life, unlike the promise which brings life." 
3. "If there had been a law that could give life, God would not have needed to send His Son."
