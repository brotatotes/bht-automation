# Galatians 3:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse being described emphasizes the relationship between the law and the promises of God. Commentators assert that there is no contradiction or rivalry between them, but rather a consistency and harmony. While the law has its purpose, it is incapable of imparting spiritual life or righteousness. On the other hand, the promises of God, fulfilled in the Gospel of grace, offer life and justification. The verse challenges the idea that the law can nullify or overpower God's promises, affirming the necessity of the promise to bring about true righteousness and salvation.
