# Galatians 3:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Scripture, personified as the author, demonstrates through the law that all are under the power of sin. This universal condition is likened to being imprisoned, with humanity helpless under the sentence of death. However, the purpose of the law is not to bring justification, but to point people towards faith in the promise of God. It is through this recognition of our need for salvation that the promise is freely given to all who believe.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "So far is righteousness from being of the law, that the knowledge of sin is rather what comes of the law."
2. "The written letter was needed so as permanently to convict man of disobedience to God's command."
3. "Beautifully contrasted with 'the liberty wherewith Christ makes free,' which follows."
4. "The whole world, man, and all that appertains to him, under sin."
5. "That it might be a free gift; not something earned by the works of the law."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The Scripture, the whole Old Testament, including the law. It is here personified as in Galatians 3:8, and stands for the author of the Scripture."
2. "Shut up all (things) under sin... the whole history of men, the mystery of the fall cleared up by the greater mystery of redemption."
3. "God wills sin only as something to be overcome and destroyed; He permitted the fall of Adam only in view of the redemption by Christ which more than made up for all the loss of the fall."

### John Gill:
1. "By the 'Scripture' is meant, either the writing of the law in particular, the killing letter, or the whole Scripture, or God in it; and who by and in it has shown, declared, and proved, that all the individuals of human nature, Jews and Gentiles, and all that is in them, and done by them, are under the power and dominion of sin, defiled by it, and involved in the guilt of it."
2. "Now the Spirit of God, discovering to men this their wretched and desperate condition, under the law and sin, reveals Christ and his righteousness to them, and enables and encourages them to believe in him, by whom only they can be justified from all things."
3. "Thus the law is so far from being against the promises of God, that it is subservient to them; for though the law has no tendency in itself to bring persons to Christ, and to believe in him for righteousness, yet this concluding men under sin, showing them their desperate, and hopeless, and helpless condition, the Spirit of God takes occasion from hence to reveal Christ unto them, and to enable them as perishing creatures to venture on him, and lay hold on the hope set before them in the Gospel."

### John Wesley:
1. "The scripture wherein that law is written hath concluded all under sin" - This verse emphasizes that the purpose of the law is to show that everyone is guilty of sin, highlighting the universal need for salvation.
2. "Hath shut them up together, as in a prison, under sentence of death" - This imagery portrays the law as a prison, highlighting the hopeless state of humanity under the condemnation of sin.
3. "To the end that all being cut off from expecting justification by the law, the promise might be freely given to them that believe" - This quote reveals that the purpose of the law is to lead people to recognize their need for salvation through faith in the promise of God, rather than relying on their own efforts to be justified.
