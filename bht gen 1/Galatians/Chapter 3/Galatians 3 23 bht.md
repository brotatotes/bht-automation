# Galatians 3:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Before faith came, we were kept under the law, implying a state of confinement and restriction. The Mosaic law acted as a custodian, holding us in anticipation for the faith that was to be revealed. This faith, characterized by trust in Christ, marks the arrival of the gospel dispensation, a divine plan reserved and prepared for the redemption of humanity. Through faith, we are released from the confines of the law, finding freedom and salvation in Christ.
