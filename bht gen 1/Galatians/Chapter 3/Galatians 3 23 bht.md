# Galatians 3:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Before the arrival of faith in Jesus Christ, we were kept under the confines of the Mosaic law, awaiting the unveiling of the saving faith found in the gospel dispensation. This period of confinement was a necessary preparation for the faith that was to be revealed, as we were morally compelled to find refuge in faith alone. The Mosaic law served as a temporary measure until the arrival of the all-encompassing faith in Jesus Christ, which became our ultimate object of trust.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "faith—namely, that just mentioned (Galatians 3:22), of which Christ is the object."
2. "kept—Greek, 'kept in ward': the effect of the 'shutting up' (Galatians 3:22; Galatians 4:2; Romans 7:6)."
3. "We were, in a manner, morally forced to it, so that there remained to us no refuge but faith."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Before the faith came, the faith in Jesus Christ just mentioned (Galatians 3:22), which under the legal dispensation existed only as a latent element of life."
2. "We were shut up and kept in ward under the law for the faith about to be revealed, i.e., in order to be prepared for the free state of the Christian faith."
3. "The word 'faith' usually means the subjective state of the heart, the exercise of trust; but in Galatians 3:22-23 it seems to pass over into the objective sense, i.e., the dispensation of faith, the gospel, hence the verbs 'came' and 'to be revealed'."
