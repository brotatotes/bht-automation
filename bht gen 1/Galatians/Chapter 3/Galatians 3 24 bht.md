# Galatians 3:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse being described emphasizes the role of the law as a guide and teacher leading us to Christ. The law lays out what we should do and exposes our inability to fulfill it. However, it is not a direct path to the divine promise, but rather a roundabout way that ultimately leads us to Christ. Through the law, we learn our need for Christ's atonement and the ceremonies of the law serve as symbols that point us towards Him. The law's purpose is fulfilled in leading us to righteousness and peace found in Christ.

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "So that the law hath been our schoolmaster to guide us unto Christ." 
2. "The moral law shows us what we ought to do, and so we learn our inability to do it."
3. "Thus the law at last leads us to Christ, with whom we find righteousness and peace."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The way of the law was not, as the Jews supposed, a direct way to the fulfillment of the divine promise. At the same time, it did not utterly lead away from the true goal. It was a roundabout way to it." 

2. "The law is neither absolutely identical with the promise, nor absolutely opposed to it. It is not the negation of the promise, but is distinct from it and subordinate to it. Its final purpose lies in the promise itself."

3. "Why did not God open the way of faith leading to the inheritance of the promise immediately after the promise was given? The answer to this was indicated in Galatians 3:24-26. It is now given more fully."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "This sentence expresses in a few words the true philosophy of the law in its relation to Christ."
2. "The discipline of law and authority is still the school of moral freedom, and reaches its proper end in self-government which is true freedom."
3. "Christ represents here the result of the educational process, i.e., the state of evangelical freedom and independent, self-governing manhood."

### John Gill:
1. "The law performed this office of a schoolmaster until the coming of Christ; which shows that till that time the church was in its minority, that the Jews were but children in knowledge and understanding."
2. "The ceremonial law gave them some hints of the Gospel scheme, and the way of salvation by Christ, but in a manner suited to their estate of childhood."
3. "The law being called a schoolmaster, shows that the use of it was but temporary, and its duration but for a time; children are not always to be under, nor designed to be always under a schoolmaster, no longer than till they are come to a proper age for greater business and higher exercises of life."

### John Wesley:
