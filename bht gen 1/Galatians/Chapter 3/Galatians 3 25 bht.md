# Galatians 3:25 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The commentator quotes highlight the transition from the old Mosaic law to the gospel dispensation characterized by faith. The law, represented by Moses, brings people to the border of the heavenly Canaan, but it is through Jesus, represented by Joshua, that true salvation and inheritance are obtained. The law's role is to lead us to Christ, after which it ceases, and we are free from its burdensome ceremonies and condemnation. With the coming of Christ, we are no longer under the law, but under the gospel dispensation of faith, where we are justified and saved.
