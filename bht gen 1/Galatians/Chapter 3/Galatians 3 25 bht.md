# Galatians 3:25 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the context of the verse, the law given by Moses acted as a schoolmaster, leading God's people to the borders of the heavenly Canaan. However, it is superseded by Joshua/Jesus, who leads believers into their inheritance. Faith, the gospel dispensation, liberates believers from the burdensome rituals and condemnation of the Mosaic law. Now, under Christ's reign, believers no longer need the law as a schoolmaster, as faith in Him becomes their guide and principle.
