# Galatians 3:27 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Through baptism, believers publicly declare their faith and commitment to Christ, putting on His righteousness and becoming sons of God. This act symbolizes a new identity and signifies a union with Christ that goes beyond a mere ritual. By being baptized into Christ, believers receive forgiveness of sins, are made righteous in God's sight, and are embraced into His family as His children. The inward transformation is visually represented through baptism, as believers are clothed with Christ and become partakers of His divine nature.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "By baptism ye have put on Christ; and therefore, He being the Son of God, ye become sons by adoption, by virtue of His Sonship by generation."
2. "This proves that baptism, where it answers to its ideal, is not a mere empty sign, but a means of spiritual transference from the state of legal condemnation to that of living union with Christ, and of sonship through Him in relation to God."
3. "Christ alone can, by baptizing with His Spirit, make the inward grace correspond to the outward sign."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The baptized is surrounded by Christ and covered with his merits, as the soldier is surrounded by his equipment."
2. "To understand this passage, we should remember that in the Apostolic age the baptism of adults presupposed or implied, as a rule, actual conversion and regeneration in consequence of preaching and instruction."
3. "If baptism of believers on personal profession of faith means anything, it means the death of the old man of sin and the birth of the new man of righteousness."

### John Gill:
1. "Not that it is to be imagined that these churches of Galatia, or any of the primitive churches, consisted of baptized and unbaptized persons; for this would be acting contrary to the commission of Christ and the order of the Gospel."
2. "But this way of speaking supposes that there might be some of them, who though baptized in water, yet not into Christ; and that those who are truly and rightly baptized, who are proper subjects of it, and to whom it is administered in a proper manner, are baptized into Christ."
3. "And such have put on Christ; both before and at baptism: before it they put him on as the Lord their righteousness; his righteousness is compared to a garment, is called the best robe, the wedding garment, fine linen, clean and white, the robe of righteousness, a garment down to the feet."

### John Wesley:
1. "Being baptized in the name of Christ" signifies a public declaration of faith, a testimony that one has chosen to identify with Christ. It is an act of putting on Christ, symbolizing a new identity and a commitment to live in accordance with His teachings.

2. By putting on Christ, believers receive Him as their righteousness. This means that their sins are forgiven, and they are made righteous in God's sight through their faith in Christ. It is through this righteousness that they become sons of God, adopted into His family and given the privilege of calling Him Father.

3. The act of baptism is not merely a ritual or an empty symbol, but a powerful demonstration of the believer's union with Christ. It is a visible representation of the inward transformation that has taken place, as they have been clothed with Christ and become partakers of His divine nature.
