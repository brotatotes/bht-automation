## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "There is in this sonship by faith in Christ, no class privileged above another."
2. "Difference of sex makes no difference in Christian privileges."
3. "Males alone had in their body circumcision, the sign of the covenant (contrast baptism applied to male and female alike); they alone were capable of being kings and priests, whereas all of either sex are now 'kings and priests unto God'."

### John Calvin:
1. "There is neither Jew nor Greek. The meaning is, that there is no distinction of persons here, and therefore it is of no consequence to what nation or condition any one may belong."
2. "Nor is circumcision any more regarded than sex or civil rank. And why? Because Christ makes them all one."
3. "The apostle's object is to show that the grace of adoption, and the hope of salvation, do not depend on the law, but are contained in Christ alone, who therefore is all."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The great idea of freedom, fraternity, and equality, then, is to be traced to Christianity, although it is often carnally misunderstood and caricatured by men."
2. "The gospel makes all men equal before God, both as sinners, and as subjects of redeeming grace; it has broken down the national, social, and sexual partition walls of the ancient world, and raised women and slaves to the true dignity and the enjoyment of the rights of man."
3. "For ye all are one (man) in Christ Jesus, one moral person in Jesus Christ the head."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "There can be neither" - a statement of a fact rather than a possibility, as Burton rightly shows against Lightfoot.
2. "One moral personality" - in Christ Jesus, race or national distinctions do not exist, class differences vanish, sex rivalry disappears.
3. "This radical statement marks out the path along which Christianity was to come" - we are on the road and there is no hope on any way than on "the Jesus Road."

### John Gill:
1. "There is no difference between them, the middle wall of partition being broken down...in the business of justification and salvation, it signified nothing whether a man was a Jew or a Greek."
2. "God, in calling, justifying, and saving men, is no respecter of persons...he calls, justifies, and saves men of every station and condition of life."
3. "Now under the Gospel dispensation there is no distinction made between male and female as to divine things; as they are alike called by the grace of God, they have the same right to Gospel ordinances, baptism and the Lord's supper, and to every spiritual privilege."

### John Wesley:
1. "There is neither Jew nor Greek" - This phrase emphasizes the equality of all believers, regardless of their ethnic background. It highlights the inclusive nature of faith, where distinctions based on nationality or ethnicity hold no significance.

2. "They are equally accepted through faith" - This quote underscores the idea that salvation is not dependent on one's cultural or ethnic identity. Instead, it is based on faith in God. It emphasizes that all believers, regardless of their background, are equally accepted by God.

3. "There is neither male nor female" - This statement suggests that gender distinctions are no longer relevant in the context of faith. It implies that both men and women have equal access to salvation and are on equal footing in their relationship with God. It challenges traditional gender roles and highlights the inclusive nature of the Christian faith.
