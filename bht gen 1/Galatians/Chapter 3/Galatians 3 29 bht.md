# Galatians 3:29 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Believers in Christ, united to him in a covenant relationship, and living under his authority and teachings, are considered as Abraham's seed, heirs by promise. This declaration is substantiated by deep, comprehensive reasoning and emphasizes that being "Christ's" is not based on blood or pride of race, but on faith and spiritual descent. By being in Christ, believers inherit the blessings promised to Abraham and partake in the felicity he looked forward to, securing the inheritance of all Messianic blessings by promise.
