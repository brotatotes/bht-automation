# Galatians 3:29 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Believers in Christ are identified as belonging to him, being united with him in a profound and intimate way. Being Christ's means being part of his body, the church, and having a personal relationship with him as our Savior and Lord. To be Christ's is to be transformed by his love and grace, living a life that reflects his character and teachings. This unity with Christ as the seed of Abraham enables believers to inherit the blessings promised to Abraham and partake in the felicity he looked forward to, securing the inheritance of all the Messianic blessings by promise.
