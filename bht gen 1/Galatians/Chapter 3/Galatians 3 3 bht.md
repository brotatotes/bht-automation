## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Having begun in the Spirit, that is, the Holy Spirit ruling your spiritual life as its 'essence and active principle'." 
2. "Having begun your Christianity in the Spirit, that is, in the divine life that proceeds from faith, are ye seeking after something higher still (the perfecting of your Christianity) in the sensuous and the earthly, which cannot possibly elevate the inner life of the Spirit, namely, outward ceremonies?" 
3. "No doubt the Galatians thought that they were going more deeply into the Spirit; for the flesh may be easily mistaken for the Spirit, even by those who have made progress, unless they continue to maintain a pure faith."

### John Gill:
1. "Is it possible you should be so stupid? and do you, or can you continue so?"
2. "They set out in a profession of religion in the light, under the influence, and by the assistance of the Spirit."
3. "This is a third aggravation of their folly, that whereas they begun their Christian race depending upon the Spirit and grace of God, now they seemed to be taking a step as if they thought to finish it in the mere strength of nature."

### John Wesley:
1. "Having begun in the Spirit - Having set out under the light and power of the Spirit by faith, do ye now, when ye ought to be more spiritual, and more acquainted with the power of faith, expect to be made perfect by the flesh?" 

2. "Do you think to complete either your justification or sanctification, by giving up that faith, and depending on the law, which is a gross and carnal thing when opposed to the gospel?" 

3. "Are ye so thoughtless - As not to consider what you have yourselves experienced?"
