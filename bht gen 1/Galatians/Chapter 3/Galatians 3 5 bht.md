## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Is it the Apostle? or is it not rather GOD, and is not this indicated by the reference to Abraham’s faith in the next verse, and the taking up the passive ἐλογίσθη by δικαιοῖ ὁ θεός in Gal 3:8?"
2. "The ἐπί does not imply addition, but as so often with prepositions of motion in composition, the direction of the supply."
3. "δυνάμεις are the wonders wrought by divine Power in you, viz. at your conversion and since."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "He who supplied and supplies to you the Spirit still, to the present time."
2. "These miracles do not prove grace to be in the heart."
3. "He speaks of these miracles as a matter of unquestioned notoriety among those addressed; an undesigned proof of their genuineness."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The gift of the Holy Spirit to them was not imparted in consequence of the observance of the Law of Moses, but in connection with the preaching of the gospel."
2. "The obvious reference, it seems to me, is to God, who had furnished or imparted to them the remarkable influences of the Holy Spirit."
3. "If, however, it refers to Paul, it means that he had been made the agent or instrument in imparting to them those remarkable endowments."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The gift of the Spirit, and the bestowment of miraculous powers, is a purely divine operation in believers, which is not merited by legal works, but can be received and experienced only through the message of faith."
2. "He that ministereth [ο επιχορηγων] . Or supplieth. See 2 Corinthians 9:10; Colossians 2:19; 2 Peter 1:5. The idea of abundant supply (Lightfoot), if conveyed at all, resides, not in the preposition ejpi, which indicates direction, but in the simple verb, which is used of abundant, liberal supply."
3. "Miracles [δυναμεις] . See on Matthew 11:20. Either miracles, as Mark 6:2; 1 Corinthians 12:10, or miraculous powers, as 1 Corinthians 12:6; Philippians 2:13; Ephesians 2:2. The analogy of these latter passages favors the second meaning."

### John Calvin:
1. "He warns them that all the gifts of the Holy Spirit, in which they excelled, are the fruits of the gospel, of that gospel which had been preached among them by his own lips."
2. "Their new teachers deprived them of those gifts when they left the gospel, and fled to another kind of doctrine."
3. "In proportion to the value which they attached to those gifts, to which the apostle here adds miracles, they ought the more carefully and resolutely to adhere to the gospel."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The present tense ministereth and worketh is used to indicate the continued communication and abundant supply of the spiritual gifts."
2. "Powers, miraculous powers, 1 Corinthians 12:10; 1 Corinthians 12:28-29."
3. "In you, i.e., in your heart and will; comp. Matthew 14:2. Paul probably means the moral miracles of regeneration and conversion."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Supplieth (επιχορηγων). It is God." 
2. "Worketh miracles (ενεργων δυναμεις). On the word ενεργεω see 1 Thessalonians 2:13; 1 Corinthians 12:6. It is a great word for God's activities (Philippians 2:13)." 
3. "The principal verb for 'doeth he it' (ποιε) is not expressed. Paul repeats the contrast in verse Galatians 3:2 about 'works of the law' and 'the hearing of faith.'"

### John Gill:
1. "He therefore that ministereth to you the Spirit...either God or Christ who had ministered, and still continued to minister the grace of the Spirit through the preaching of the Gospel."
2. "They had seen the Gospel confirmed by the extraordinary gifts, signs, and wonders of the Holy Ghost, and which were still among them."
3. "These extraordinary gifts of the Spirit...did not attend the preaching of the law, or the doctrine of justification by works, taught by the false apostles, but the doctrine of faith, of justification by faith in the righteousness of Christ."

### John Wesley:
1. "Doth he that ministereth the gift of the Spirit to you, and worketh miracles among you, do it by the works of the law?" - This question highlights the contrast between the works of the law and the gift of the Spirit.
