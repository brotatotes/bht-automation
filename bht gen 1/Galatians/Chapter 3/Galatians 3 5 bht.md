# Galatians 3:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
He who supplied and supplies the Spirit to you, speaks of the miracles as unquestionable, a proof of their genuineness. The gifts of the Spirit are fruits of the gospel, and their abundance shows the continued communication of grace. The miraculous works provoke questions about the role of the law, and whether they confirm justification by works or justification by faith. Such reflections prompt us to discern the true source of salvation and the message aligned with the ministry of the Spirit.
