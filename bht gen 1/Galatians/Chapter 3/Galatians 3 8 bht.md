# Galatians 3:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Scripture, with prescient wisdom, foresaw that God would justify the Gentiles through faith, not works. The distinction is made between those justified by faith and those seeking justification through works of the law, regardless of their background. The promise to Abraham, fulfilled in Christ, extends blessings to all the Gentiles, not just a specific group. This truth, revealed in the Scripture, is a key part of the Gospel preached to Abraham and passed down through generations.
