# Galatians 3:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse emphasizes that faith, not works of the law, is the key to sharing in Abraham's blessing. Believers are united with Abraham in faith, personally characterized by their belief. By having faith, believers become partakers of the same blessings of eternal life and justification as Abraham. This close and intimate relationship with the faithful is sealed by their union in faith, making them heirs to the promises of God and beneficiaries of a justifying righteousness in Christ.
