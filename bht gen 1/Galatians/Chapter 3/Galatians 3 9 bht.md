# Galatians 3:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse being described here emphasizes that only those who truly believe, who have faith, are the ones who will be blessed. It highlights the importance of faith, as it was the prominent characteristic of Abraham, who received the blessings through his belief. Believers are regarded as being in fellowship with Abraham, sharing in the same blessings that he received by faith. Faith is the key that unlocks the promises of God and unites believers with Christ, making them heirs of God's promises and recipients of eternal life.
