# Galatians 4:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse being described highlights the transition from the old legal system to the new Christian dispensation. It emphasizes that the heir, as long as they are still considered a child, does not fully possess their inheritance and remains bound by restrictions. However, despite not yet having full control, the heir is acknowledged as the rightful owner of all that is to come. This portrayal showcases the divine plan of God's redemption, where we are deemed heirs according to His promise, receiving blessings that surpass any earthly inheritance.
