# Galatians 4:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, the commentators describe the condition of an heir who is still a child and therefore under the control and direction of others. They emphasize that even though the heir is legally the owner of everything, he is not yet able to exercise his full authority. Just as an heir must wait until coming of age to fully enjoy their inheritance, the verse illustrates the idea that the condition of the Jews before the coming of the Messiah was inferior, but would be elevated with the arrival of Christ.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The fact is, the antitype breaks through the type, and disturbs it: as is the case, wherever the idea of inheritance is spiritualized."
2. "The supposition in our text is, that a father has preordained a time for his son and heir to come of age, and till that time, has subjected him to guardians and stewards."
3. "κύριος πάντων ὤν must be understood essentially, rather than prospectively. It is said of him in virtue of his rank, rather than of his actual estate: in posse, rather than in esse."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The fact of God's sending His Son to redeem us who were under the law, and sending the Spirit of His Son into our hearts, confirms the conclusion that we are 'heirs according to the promise.'" 
2. "It is not, as in earthly inheritances, the death of the father, but our Father's sovereign will simply that makes us heirs." 
3. "He is not at his own disposal. Lord of all—by title and virtual ownership."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "As long as he is a child - Until he arrives at the age. The word rendered 'child' properly means an infant... and hence, a child or babe, but without any definite limitation." 
2. "He differs in his prospects of inheriting the property, and in the affections of the father, and usually in the advantages of education, and in the respect and attention shown him. but in regard to property, he does not differ, and he is like a servant, under the control and direction of others."
3. "The idea which this is designed to illustrate is, that the condition of the Jews before the coming of the Messiah was inferior in many respects to what the condition of the friends of God would be under him - as inferior as the condition of an heir was before he was of age, to what it would be when he should enter on his inheritance."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The heir. See on inheritance, 1 Peter 1:4. The article is generic as in the mediator, chapter Galatians 3:20."
2. "A child. A minor. Used by Paul in contrast with teleiov full grown."

### John Calvin:
1. "The elect, though they are the children of God from the womb, yet, until by faith they come to the possession of freedom, remain like slaves under the law; but, from the time that they have known Christ, they no longer require this kind of tutelage."
2. "We learn from it that our hope at the present day, and that of the fathers under the Old Testament, have been directed to the same inheritance; for they were partakers of the same adoption."
3. "Notwithstanding their outward slavery, their consciences were still free. The obligation to keep the law did not hinder Moses and Daniel, all the pious kings, priests, and prophets, and the whole company of believers, from being free in spirit."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "To long as the heir is an infant (a minor), he differeth nothing from a slave, though he is lord of all." 
2. "In human relations the taking possession of the inheritance is conditioned by the death of the parent, or at all events by a corresponding loss; while God gives to his children at the appointed time all the blessings of salvation without losing anything."
