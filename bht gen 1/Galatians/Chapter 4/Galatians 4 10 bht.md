The discussion highlights the cultural context and the shift towards a more spiritual and freedom-oriented observance of holy days.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Wishing to shew to them in its most contemptible light the unworthiness of their decadence, he puts the observation of days in the forefront of his appeal, as one of those things which they already practised."
2. "Notice how utterly such a verse is at variance with any and every theory of a Christian sabbath, cutting at the root, as it does, of ALL obligatory observance of times as such."
3. "To observe periods then, now in the fulness of time, is to deny the perfection of the Christian dispensation, the complete and finished nature of Christ’s work: to forsake Him as the great spiritual teacher of His brethren, and to return to carnal pædagogues."

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "To regard the observance of certain days as in itself meritorious as a work, is alien to the free spirit of Christianity."
2. "The whole life alike belongs to the Lord in the Gospel view, just as the whole world, and not the Jews only, belong to Him."
3. "But as in Paradise, so now one portion of time is needed wherein to draw off the soul more entirely from secular business to God."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It is not a fair interpretation of this to suppose that the apostle refers to the Sabbath, properly so called, for this was a part of the Decalogue; and was observed by the Saviour himself, and by the apostles also."
2. "There is as real servitude in the observance of the numerous festivals, and fasts in the papal communion and in some Protestant churches, as there was in the observance of the days in the Jewish ecclesiastical calendar."
3. "We should observe as seasons of holy time what it can be proved God has commanded us, and no more."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The word denotes careful, scrupulous observance, an intent watching lest any of the prescribed seasons should be overlooked." 
2. "A merely legal or ritual religion always develops such scrupulousness." 
3. "Tisri, being the seventh or sabbatical month, was peculiarly sacred, and the fourth, fifth, and tenth were distinguished by special fasts."

### John Calvin:
1. "No condemnation is here given to the observance of dates in the arrangements of civil society."
2. "The civil observation of days contributes not only to agriculture and to matters of politics, and ordinary life, but is even extended to the government of the church."
3. "The observance of days among us is a free service, and void of all superstition."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The Apostle means a Judaistic, slavish, and superstitious observance which ascribes an intrinsic holiness to particular days and seasons."
2. "The polemic of Paul is equally applicable to a Judaizing, that is, slavish, superstitious, and self-righteous observance of Sunday or any other Christian festival."
3. "But there is also a free, evangelical, and spiritual observance of holy days and seasons, which is essential to proper order in social worship."

Note: The commentary is quite long, so I have selected three quotes that provide a good overview of the main points.

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "The meticulous observance of the Pharisees Paul knew to a nicety."
2. "It hurt him to the quick after his own merciful deliverance to see these Gentile Christians drawn into this spider-web of Judaizing Christians, once set free, now enslaved again."
3. "Paul does not object to these observances for he kept them himself as a Jew. He objected to Gentiles taking to them as a means of salvation."

### John Gill:
1. "By 'days' are meant their seventh day sabbaths... These were peculiar to the Israelites, and not binding on others; and being typical of Christ, the true rest of his people, and he being come, are now ceased."
2. "By 'months' are designed their new moons... and were typical of that light, knowledge, and grace, the church receives from Christ, the sun of righteousness; and he, the substance, being come, these shadows disappeared."
3. "By 'years' are to be understood their sabbatical years... all which were typical of rest, payment of debts, and spiritual liberty by Christ and which having their accomplishment in him, were no longer to be observed."

### John Wesley:
1. "Ye observe days — Jewish sabbaths." - This quote highlights the practice of observing the Jewish sabbaths, emphasizing the importance of honoring the sacred day of rest.

2. "And months — New moons." - This quote points out the significance of observing the new moons, which were considered important times for worship and celebration in the Jewish calendar.

3. "And times — As that of the passover, pentecost, and the feast of tabernacles." - This quote highlights the observance of specific festivals and feasts, such as the Passover, Pentecost, and the Feast of Tabernacles, which held great religious and cultural significance for the Jewish people.

These quotes provide insights into the various religious observances and traditions practiced by the Jewish community during biblical times, shedding light on the cultural context of the verse.
