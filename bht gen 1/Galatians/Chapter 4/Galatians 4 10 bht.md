# Galatians 4:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the commentator quotes stress the cessation of certain religious practices in Christianity. The verse refers to the Judaistic observance of specific days, months, and times. It highlights the understanding that these observances, such as the Jewish sabbaths, new moons, and specific feasts, served as types and shadows of Christ, and with his coming, these rituals are no longer necessary. The verse discourages a legalistic and superstitious approach to religious observances and emphasizes the freedom found in the gospel.

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "To regard the observance of certain days as in itself meritorious as a work, is alien to the free spirit of Christianity."
2. "The whole life alike belongs to the Lord in the Gospel view, just as the whole world, and not the Jews only, belong to Him."
3. "But as in Paradise, so now one portion of time is needed wherein to draw off the soul more entirely from secular business to God."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It is not a fair interpretation of this to suppose that the apostle refers to the Sabbath, properly so called, for this was a part of the Decalogue; and was observed by the Saviour himself, and by the apostles also."
2. "There is as real servitude in the observance of the numerous festivals, and fasts in the papal communion and in some Protestant churches, as there was in the observance of the days in the Jewish ecclesiastical calendar."
3. "We should observe as seasons of holy time what it can be proved God has commanded us, and no more."

### Philip Schaff:

2. "The polemic of Paul is equally applicable to a Judaizing, that is, slavish, superstitious, and self-righteous observance of Sunday or any other Christian festival."

### John Gill:
1. "By 'days' are meant their seventh day sabbaths... These were peculiar to the Israelites, and not binding on others; and being typical of Christ, the true rest of his people, and he being come, are now ceased."
2. "By 'months' are designed their new moons... and were typical of that light, knowledge, and grace, the church receives from Christ, the sun of righteousness; and he, the substance, being come, these shadows disappeared."
3. "By 'years' are to be understood their sabbatical years... all which were typical of rest, payment of debts, and spiritual liberty by Christ and which having their accomplishment in him, were no longer to be observed."
