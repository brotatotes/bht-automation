## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The only rendering which seems to answer the requirements of the construction and the context, is that which understands εἰμι or γέγονα after ἐγώ , and refers it to the Apostle having in his own practice cast off Jewish habits and become as the Galatians: i.e. a Gentile."
2. "The key to rightly understanding these words is, their apposition with ἐξουθενήσατε , … ἐξεπτύσατε … ἐδέξασθε below. To that period they refer: viz. to the time when he first preached the Gospel among them, and the first introduction of this period seems to be in the words, ὅτι κἀγὼ ὡς ὑμεῖς ."
3. "Then I became as you: and at that time you did me no wrong, but on the contrary shewed me all sympathy and reverence. Then comes in the inference, put in the form of a question, at Galatians 4:16 , I must then have since become your enemy by telling you the truth."
