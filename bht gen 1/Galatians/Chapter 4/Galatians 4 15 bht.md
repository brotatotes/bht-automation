## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Where is then the blessedness ye spake of?" (E. V.) is perhaps as good a rendering as the words will bear.
2. "Would not the Apostle have more naturally written, 'You would, if possible, have pulled out your own eyes, and have given them to me'?"
3. "The inference then of any ocular disease from these words themselves seems to me precarious."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Of what value was your congratulation of yourselves, on account of your having among you me, the messenger of the Gospel, considering how entirely you have veered about since?"
2. "Once you counted yourselves blessed in being favored with my ministry."
3. "You would have plucked out your own eyes—one of the dearest members of the body—so highly did you value me: a proverbial phrase for the greatest self-sacrifice."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "What blessedness you had then! How happy was that moment! What tenderness of affection! What overflowing joy!"
2. "How happy were ye then!"
3. "No higher proof of attachment could have been given. They loved him so much, that they would have given to him anything, however dear; they would have done anything to contribute to his welfare."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "What had become of your self gratulation on my presence and teaching?"

### John Calvin:

3. "They throw away, of their own accord, the blessedness which they had obtained, and draw down upon themselves the destruction in which their unhappy career must terminate."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Where is now your self-congratulation? What has become of the boasting of your blessedness, of your rejoicing in my teaching, since you turned away from the freedom of the gospel to the slavery of the law?"

2. You no longer felicitate yourselves on my presence with you. (Quote 2)
3. It is strong language and is saved from hyperbole by "if possible" (ε δυνατον). Did Paul not have at this time serious eye trouble? (Quote 3)

### John Gill:
1. "When the Gospel was first preached to them by him; when Christ was revealed to them as God's salvation; when the doctrines of free justification by the righteousness of Christ, and full pardon by his atonement and satisfaction by his sacrifice, were published among them; when the love of God was shed abroad in their hearts, and the Spirit of Christ was sent thither, crying 'Abba', Father."
2. "They were happy persons while under the ministry of the apostle; as a Gospel ministry is a great happiness to any that enjoy it; for this is the way to find eternal life, to have spiritual peace and pleasure, joy and comfort, light and liberty."
3. "They thought themselves the happiest persons in the world, and that they could not have been more so, unless they had had Christ himself in person among them; so beautiful were the feet of this bringer of glad tidings to them."

### John Wesley:
1. "The blessedness spoken of here refers to the state of being blessed or happy. The believers in this context were rejoicing and congratulating each other on experiencing this blessedness, which likely came from their faith in God and the blessings they received from Him."

2. "This verse implies that the believers had previously discussed and acknowledged the blessedness they were experiencing. It suggests a sense of community and shared joy among the believers, as they recognized and celebrated the blessings they had received."

3. "The use of the word 'then' indicates that there may have been a shift or change in the believers' circumstances. It could be that they were no longer experiencing the same level of blessedness or that they were facing challenges that made them question the blessedness they had previously spoken of."
