# Galatians 4:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, a tense situation arises where someone speaking the truth becomes viewed as an enemy. The commentator suggests that this change in perception may stem from a decline in love or gratitude. The difficulty lies in accepting the truth from someone who faithfully speaks it but in a way that may be painful. The use of a question instead of an assertion emphasizes the delicate nature of this relationship. The truth spoken holds great importance as it comes from the God of truth and the Spirit of truth, even though it may bring about enemies.
