# Galatians 4:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
False teachers are zealously courting the Galatians, but their motives are dishonorable and self-serving. They seek to exclude the Galatians from the true grace of Christ through their promotion of ceremonial observances. These deceivers aim to gain control over the Galatians and separate them from their true spiritual shepherds. However, genuine zeal is marked by sound doctrine that proves its worth, not by deceptive words and selfish ambitions.
