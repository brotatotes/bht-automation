# Galatians 4:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Bible verse being described is a warning against the false teachings of the Judaizers, who seek to manipulate and deceive the Galatians. These Judaizers are driven by selfish motives, desiring to disconnect the Galatians from the true gospel of Christ and instead become devoted followers of themselves. Their zeal is not based on sincere love or sound doctrine, but rather on gaining control and exerting influence over the Galatians. The verse urges the Galatians to be discerning and not to give in to the deceitful tactics of these false teachers.
