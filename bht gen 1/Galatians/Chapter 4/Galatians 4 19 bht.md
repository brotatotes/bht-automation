# Galatians 4:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse under consideration is a passionate expression of love and concern from the apostle Paul to the Galatian converts. Being compared to both a loving father and a distressed mother, Paul deeply desires for Christ to be fully formed within them. This formation involves embracing Christ's teachings, embodying His spirit, and living a life completely centered on Him. Paul, like a parent, yearns for the Galatians to experience a new birth and to be completely transformed by Christ.

3. "I again (a second time; the former was ἐν τῷ παρεῖναί με, Gal 4:18) travail with (bear, as a mother, with pain and anxiety, till the time of birth) until Christ shall have been fully formed within you (for Christ dwelling in a man is the secret and principle of his new life, see ch. Gal 2:20)"

### Marvin Vincent:

2. "The metaphor of begetting children in the gospel is found in 1 Corinthians 4:15; Philippians 1:10. It was a Jewish saying: 'If one teaches the son of his neighbor the law, the Scripture reckons this the same as though he had begotten him.'"
3. "The forming of Christ in them, their attainment of the complete inner life of Christians, is the object of the new birth."

### John Calvin:

### John Gill:
