# Galatians 4:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, commentators explain the allegorical nature of the story of Hagar and Sarah, highlighting the figurative meanings hidden within the literal or historical narrative. The two covenants mentioned symbolize different administrations of the same covenant, not the covenant of works and the covenant of grace. The children of the free covenant of promise, compared to Sarah, are free, while those under the legal covenant of bondage remain enslaved. Ultimately, the verse emphasizes the deeper spiritual significance behind these figures and their relevance in understanding the moral law.
