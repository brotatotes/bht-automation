# Galatians 4:25 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Bible verse being described in this paragraph is Galatians 4:25. Mount Sinai, situated in Arabia, is used as a representation of the law, inspiring fear and bondage, contrasting with the freedom found in the promised land. Similarly, the present-day Jerusalem is compared to Mount Sinai, signifying its bondage to the law. The city is also in a state of subjugation, both legally and under Roman rule. This verse serves as a reminder that true inheritance and freedom are not found in the law, but rather in the gospel.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Sinai, with its rugged rocks, far removed from the promised land, was well suited to represent the law which inspires with terror, and the spirit of bondage."
2. "Jerusalem which now is, that is, the Jerusalem of the Jews, having only a present temporary existence, in contrast with the spiritual Jerusalem of the Gospel, which in germ, under the form of the promise, existed ages before, and shall be forever in ages to come."
3. "As Hagar was in bondage to her mistress, so Jerusalem that now is, is in bondage to the law, and also to the Romans: her civil state thus being in accordance with her spiritual state."

### John Gill:
1. "Sinai was in Arabia, out of the land of promise, where the law was given, and seems to be mentioned by the apostle with this view, that it might be observed, and teach us that the inheritance is not of the law."
2. "Agar, I rather think the woman is meant: and that the sense is, that this same Agar signifies Mount Sinai, or is a figure of the law given on that mount."
3. "Agrees with and resembles the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and of all the cities and towns in Judea; and she, being a bondwoman, represented that state of bondage the Jews were in, when the apostle wrote this, who were in a state of civil, moral, and legal bondage."

### John Wesley:
1. "For this is mount Sinai in Arabia" - The mention of Mount Sinai in Arabia refers to the physical location where Moses received the law. It serves as a symbol or type of the bondage of the law.
2. "Resembles Jerusalem that now is, and is in bondage" - The commentary draws a parallel between Mount Sinai and Jerusalem, suggesting that just as Mount Sinai represents bondage to the law, Jerusalem in the present time is also in a state of bondage.
3. "Like Agar, both to the law and to the Romans" - The comparison to Agar, the servant of Abraham, implies that Jerusalem is not only in bondage to the law but also to the Romans, signifying a lack of freedom and autonomy.
