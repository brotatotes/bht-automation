### John Wesley:
1. "For this is mount Sinai in Arabia" - The mention of Mount Sinai in Arabia highlights the historical significance of this location as the place where God gave the law to Moses. It serves as a symbol of the old covenant and the bondage of the law.

"And answereth to - Resembles Jerusalem that now is" - The comparison between Mount Sinai and Jerusalem emphasizes that just as Mount Sinai represented the old covenant, Jerusalem in its current state is also in bondage. It signifies the spiritual state of the people who are still under the law.

3. "Like Agar, both to the law and to the Romans" - The reference to Agar, the slave woman in the story of Abraham, further emphasizes the bondage and servitude that Jerusalem is experiencing. It signifies the subjugation of the people not only to the law but also to the oppressive rule of the Romans.
