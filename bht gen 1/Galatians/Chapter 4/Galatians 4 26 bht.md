# Galatians 4:26 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Bible verse being described is one that contrasts two covenants, one from Mount Sinai (representing the old covenant) and the other from the heavenly mount above (representing the new covenant). The heavenly Jerusalem is mentioned, symbolizing the true or spiritual city to which all true Christians belong. This spiritual city is not an actual material city in heaven, but a kingdom of heaven, the Messianic theocracy, where believers find freedom and become citizens. Through faith in Christ, believers are part of a new covenant that grants them the status of free citizens in the heavenly Jerusalem.
