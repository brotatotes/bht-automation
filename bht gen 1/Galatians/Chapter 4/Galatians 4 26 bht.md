# Galatians 4:26 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The heavenly Jerusalem, represented by the Church, is the mother of believers, the true and spiritual city above. It is the source of freedom and the dwelling place of God. Believers, born again through the Church, find their true citizenship in the heavenly Jerusalem, where they experience the transformation and liberation from sin and bondage. As children of the Church, they partake in the spiritual inheritance and enjoy the freedom offered by the Spirit of God.

1. "The other covenant, that which is represented by Sarah and her believing offspring, is the true or heavenly Jerusalem, that is not (as the rabbinical teachers imagined) an actual material city in heaven, but a spiritual city, the Messianic theocracy, the kingdom of heaven, to which all true Christians belong, even here on earth."
