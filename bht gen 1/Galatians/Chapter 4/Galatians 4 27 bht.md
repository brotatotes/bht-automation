This verse from Isaiah is directly Messianic, portraying the revival of Israel after calamity. St. Paul interprets it as an illustration of the barrenness of Sarah and the fruitfulness of Hagar.

The allegory points to the Gentile Christian church as the fruitful one, bringing forth many souls to Christ.
