# Galatians 4:28 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Believers, like Isaac, are children of promise, not just children according to the flesh. Their identity and inheritance are not based on physical lineage, but on the supernatural power of God's promise. Christians, both Jews and Gentiles, are united in their faith and share in the same unique and elevated status as Isaac and Melchizedek. They are heirs of the promises made to believing Abraham, born again by virtue of God's free will and pleasure, and recipients of all spiritual blessings.
