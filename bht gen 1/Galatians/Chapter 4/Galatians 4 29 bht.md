## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "And Sarah saw the son of Hagar... מְצַחֵק" - It has been thought that there is nothing in the Hebrew text to justify so strong a word as "he mocked." But certainly it does: see Genesis 19:14. (Commentary on Galatians 4:29)
2. "The spirit of persecution was begun." - So that we need not refer to tradition, as many have done, to account for St. Paul's expression. (Commentary on Galatians 4:29)
3. "There is nothing that should wound our souls more deeply than contempt for God and mockery against His grace." - There is no form of persecution more deadly than when the salvation of souls is hindered. (Commentary on Galatians 4:29)

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "His mocking was probably directed against Isaac's piety and faith in God's promises."
2. "Being the older by natural birth, he haughtily prided himself above him that was born by promise: as Cain hated Abel's piety."
3. "The Jews persecuted Paul, not for preaching Christianity in opposition to heathenism, but for preaching it as distinct from Judaism."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The phrase, 'after the Spirit,' here, is synonymous with 'according to the promise' in the previous verse."
2. "It stands opposed to the phrase 'after the flesh,' and means that his birth was by the special or miraculous agency of God."
3. "The persecution here referred to, was the injurious treatment which Isaac received from Ishmael, or the opposition which subsisted between them."

### John Calvin:
1. "No persecution ought to distress us so much as to see our calling attempted to be undermined by the reproaches of wicked men."
2. "Nothing ought to wound our minds so deeply as contempt of God, and reproaches cast upon His grace: nor is there any kind of persecution more deadly than when the salvation of the soul is assailed."
3. "The diabolical conspiracy which I see in operation to extinguish all fear and worship of God, to root out the remembrance of Christ, or to abandon it to the jeers of the ungodly, cannot but rack my mind with greater anxiety, than if a whole country were burning in one conflagration."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The history of Isaac and Ishmael was typical also in another respect, inasmuch as it foreshadowed the hostility of the carnal, unbelieving Judaism against Christianity."
2. "This insolence was repeated in the aggressions of the Arab tribes, especially the Hagarenes on the Israelites, and on a still grander scale in the persecutions of the Mohammedans against Jews and Christians."

### John Gill:
