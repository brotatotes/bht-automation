In this verse, the commentator notes that the Jews, as representatives of all humanity, were bound by the law of Moses, indicating the broader applicability of the verse. Additionally, it is mentioned that even Gentiles were under bondage until Christ's arrival.

The commentators highlight the contrast between these earthly, sensual forms of religion and the spiritual and rational worship brought by Christianity.
