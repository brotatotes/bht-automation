# Galatians 4:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Before the revelation of faith, we, both Jews and Gentiles, were under the law, like children in need of correction and discipline. The Jewish and Gentile Christians were held in a permanent state of bondage, under the elementary lessons and rudimentary instructions of the Jewish and pagan religions. These lessons, like the first principles of grammar, served as a pedagogue, guiding and instructing us until the time of Christ, when we were set free from this earthly, sensuous form of worship and entered into a deeper understanding of truth.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "He regards the Jews as, for this purpose, including all mankind."
2. "ὅτε ἦμεν νήπιοι refers, not to any immaturity of capacity in us, but to the lifetime of the church."
3. "It is more natural to take στοιχεῖα in its simpler meaning, that of letters or symbols of the alphabet, and τοῦ κόσμου not in its worst sense, but as in Hebrews 9:1, ‘belonging to the unspiritual outer world.’"

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "The Jews in their bondage to the law of Moses, as the representative people of the world, include all mankind virtually amenable to God's law."
2. "Even the Gentiles were under 'bondage,' and in a state of discipline suitable to nonage, till Christ came as the Emancipator."
3. "The elements, or rudiments, refer to the elementary lessons of outward things, such as the legal ordinances."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "We who were Jews - for so I think the word here is to be limited, and not extended to the pagan, as Bloomfield supposes."
2. "The word is not υἱοι huioi, 'sons;' but the idea is, that they were in a state of non-age; and though heirs, yet were under severe discipline and regimen."
3. "The phrase 'the elements of the world,' occurs also in Colossians 2:8, Colossians 2:20. In Galatians 4:9, Paul speaks of these lessons as 'beggarly elements,' referring to the same thing as here."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "For the word stoiceia in N. T. see Colossians 2:8, Colossians 2:20; Hebrews 5:12; 2 Peter 3:10, 2 Peter 3:12. See on 2 Peter 3:10. Interpretations differ."
2. "The Jewish economy was of the world as appealing to the senses, and affording only the first elements of a spiritual system."

2. "The elementary substances of the external world or physical universe...the Jewish festivals...the heathen worship of the stars and other material substances...religion of earthly, sensuous forms and rites generally."
3. "The elementary lessons, rudimentary instruction, the alphabet of learning...Paul represents here the religion before Christ, especially the Jewish, as an elementary religion or a religion of childhood."

### Archibald T Robertson:
