# Galatians 4:30 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This scripture passage reveals the consequences of relying on the law for justification. It alludes to the expulsion of Hagar and Ishmael from Abraham's household as a symbol of separating those who do not align with God's plan. The verse warns that, just as God cast out Hagar and Ishmael, He will also reject those who seek righteousness through the law. Additionally, it emphasizes that those who persecute believers will face the same fate of being cast out by God.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The Apostle is allegorizing the whole history, and thus every part of it assumes a significance in the allegory."
2. "The distinction drawn by Hermann on Œd. Col. 853, between οὐ μή with future indicative (duration or futurity) and with aorist subjunctive (speedy occurrence), is not applicable to the N. T."
3. "The obvious prevalence of the use of the subjunctive over the future, both in the N. T. and 'fatiscens Græcitas:’ see Lobeck, Phryn. p. 722."

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "But what was there said literally, is here by inspiration expressed in its allegorical spiritual import, applying to the New Testament believer, who is antitypically 'the son of the free woman.'" 
2. "Cast out—from the house and inheritance: literally, Ishmael; spiritually, the carnal and legalists." 
3. "The Greek is stronger, 'must not be heir,' or 'inherit.'"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "What saith the Scripture? - What does the Scripture teach on the subject? What lesson does it convey in regard to the bondman?" 

2. "Cast out the bondwoman and her son - This was the language of Sarah, in an address to Abraham, requesting him to cast out Hagar and Ishmael; Genesis 21:10. That was done. Paul uses it here as applicable to the case before him. As used by him the meaning is, that everything like servitude in the gospel is to be rejected, as Hagar and Ishmael were driven away."

3. "Paul cannot here mean that the passage in Genesis 21:10, originally had reference to the gospel, for nothing evidently was further from the mind of Sarah than any such reference; nor can it be shown that he meant to approve of or vindicate the conduct of Sarah; but he finds a passage applicable to his purpose, and he conveys his ideas in that language as exactly expressing his meaning."

### John Calvin:
1. "Let believers cheer themselves with this consolation, that the tyranny of the Ishmaelites will not last for ever."
2. "Let us be instructed by this beautiful passage, 'not to fret ourselves because of evil-doers, neither be envious against the workers of iniquity,' when they hold a temporary habitation and rank in the Church, but patiently to look for the end which awaits them."
3. "The casting out of Ishmael was nothing else than the consequence and the accomplishment of that promise, 'In Isaac shall thy seed be called,' — not in Ishmael."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The Apostles were no slavish literalists, but used the Bible freely in the very Spirit which gave it."
2. "Judaism and Christianity, bondage and freedom, cannot exist together: the one must exclude the other."
3. "The Apostle thus confidently sounds the death-knell of Judaism at a time when one half of Christendom clung to the Mosaic law with a jealous affection little short of frenzy."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "The law and the gospel cannot co-exist. The law must disappear before the gospel" (Lightfoot).
2. "Shall not inherit (ου μη κληρονομησε). Strong negative (ου μη and future indicative)." 
3. "Paul gives allegorical warning thus to the persecuting Jews and Judaizers."

### John Gill:
1. "The casting of Hagar and Ishmael out of Abraham's family was a type and emblem of the rejection of the carnal and self-righteous Jews from the Gospel church state."
2. "Nor ought any carnal persons, any that are after the flesh, unregenerate ones, or that trust to their own righteousness, to be in a Gospel church."
3. "The reason assigned for non-inheritance in the text implies that the children of the free woman, the spiritual seed of Abraham, shall inherit the privileges of God's house, the blessings of grace, and eternal glory."

### John Wesley:
1. "Showing the consequence of this." - This quote highlights that the scripture is about to reveal the outcome or result of a particular situation or action.
2. "Cast out the bondwoman and her son." - This quote refers to the expulsion of Hagar and Ishmael from Abraham's household, emphasizing the separation and rejection of those who do not align with God's plan.
3. "In like manner will God cast out all who seek to be justified by the law." - This quote suggests that anyone who relies on their own efforts to be righteous before God will ultimately be rejected by Him.
4. "Especially if they persecute them who are his children by faith." - This quote highlights that those who mistreat or persecute believers in Christ will face the same fate of being cast out by God.
