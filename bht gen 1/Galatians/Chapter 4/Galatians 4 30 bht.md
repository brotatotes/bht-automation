# Galatians 4:30 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Bible verse being described conveys the idea of spiritual allegory, where the story of the free woman and her son has a deeper meaning for the believers in the New Testament. The verse emphasizes the need to separate oneself from legalism and bondage, highlighting that Judaism and Christianity cannot coexist. It also declares that those who seek justification through the law will be cast out by God, particularly if they persecute those who have faith. This verse serves as a confident affirmation of the end of Judaism's influence during a time when many still clung to it.
