## BHT:
We, who believe, are not children of the bondwoman, but of the free. This distinction is significant, as it separates those who have faith from those who do not. Believers are made free from the servile Mosaic dispensation and are no longer bound by its obligations. Through faith in Christ, they are liberated from the curse of the law and the power of sin and Satan, entering into a state of freedom and grace.
