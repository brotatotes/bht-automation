### Henry Alford:
1. "For that we are κληρονόμοι, is an acknowledged fact, established before." 
2. "And if we are, we are not the children of the handmaid, of whom it was said οὐ μὴ κληρονομ., but of the free-woman, of whose son the same words asserted that he should inherit." 
3. "Observe in the first clause παιδίσκης is anarthrous: most likely because emphatically prefixed to its governing noun (cf. ἐθνῶν ἀπόστολος, Rom 11:13): but possibly, as indefinite, q. d. we are the children of no bondwoman, but of the freewoman."
