### Henry Alford:
1. "Because moreover ye are sons...God sent forth the Spirit of His Son into our hearts, crying Abba Father." - The emphasis here is on the believers' identity as sons of God and the sending of the Spirit as a consequence of this sonship.

2. "The Spirit being the main subject, is regarded as the agent, and the believer merely as His organ." - This highlights the role of the Holy Spirit in the believer's cry of "Abba Father," emphasizing the Spirit's work in enabling the believer to address God as a loving Father.

3. "ὁ πατήρ is not a mere Greek explanation of Ἀββᾶ, but an address by His name of relation, of Him to whom the term Ἀββᾶ was used more as a token of affection than as conveying its real meaning of 'my father.'" - This clarifies that "Abba Father" is not just a linguistic explanation, but a heartfelt address to God as a loving and intimate Father.

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The Holy Spirit which animated Jesus in his human life, and which, in the risen Christ, is the life-principle of believers."
2. "The Spirit of Jesus Christ... He is fully endowed with the Spirit... he sends the Spirit from the Father to the disciples."
3. "The believer cries under the power of the Spirit. Abba, Father. O pathr the Father, is not added in order to explain the Aramaic Abba for Greek readers. Rather the whole phrase Abba oJ pathr had passed into the early Christian prayers."

### John Calvin:
1. "In venturing, he says, to call God your Father, you have the advice and direction of the Spirit of Christ; therefore it is certain that you are the sons of God."
2. "Paul’s language does not relate to idle boasting, or to the proud opinion of himself which any man may entertain, but to the testimony of a pious conscience which accompanies the new birth."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The communication of the Spirit is not confined to a single act, but goes on increasing with the spiritual growth of the children of God."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Because ye are sons (οτ εστε υιο). This is the reason for sending forth the Son (Galatians 4:4 and here). We were 'sons' in God's elective purpose and love."

2. "The Spirit of his Son (το πνευμα του υιο αυτου). The Holy Spirit, called the Spirit of Christ (Romans 8:9), the Spirit of Jesus Christ (Philippians 1:19). The Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father and from the Son (John 15:26)."

3. "Crying, Abba, Father (κραζον Αββα ο πατηρ). The participle agrees with πνευμα neuter (grammatical gender), not neuter in fact. An old, though rare in present as here, onomatopoetic word to croak as a raven (Theophrastus, like Poe's The Raven), any inarticulate cry like 'the unuttered groanings' of Romans 8:26 which God understands."

### John Gill:
1. "It is more to be a child of God, than to be redeemed, pardoned, and justified; it is great grace to redeem from slavery, to pardon criminals, and justify the ungodly; but it is another and an higher act of grace to make them sons."
2. "The Spirit of God not only regenerates them, which is an evidence of their sonship, but as a spirit of adoption manifests it to them, works faith in them to receive it, and frequently witnesses to the truth of it; all which show how any come and are known to be the sons of God."
3. "The work he does there is various, and consists of divers parts; as convincing of sin, and righteousness, working faith, and acting the part of a comforter; but what is here referred to, is the discharge of his office as a spirit of adoption, 'crying Abba, Father'."

### John Wesley:
1. "God hath sent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts likewise, crying, Abba, Father" - This verse highlights the intimate relationship between believers and God, as they are enabled to call upon Him with the confidence and affection of dutiful children.
2. "Enabling you to call upon God both with the confidence, and the tempers, of dutiful children" - The presence of the Spirit in believers' hearts not only gives them the assurance to approach God, but also shapes their attitudes and dispositions to reflect the qualities of obedient and reverent children.
3. "The joint cry of the Jews and gentiles" - The use of both Hebrew and Greek words emphasizes the unity of believers from different backgrounds, as they together cry out to God as their loving Father.
