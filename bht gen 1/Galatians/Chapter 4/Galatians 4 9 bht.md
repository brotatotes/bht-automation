## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The Galatians did not so much acquire the knowledge of God, as they were taken into knowledge, recognized, by Him."
2. "And this made their fall from Him the more matter of indignant appeal, as being a resistance of His will respecting them."
3. "No change of the meaning of γνωσθ. must be resorted to, as 'approved,' 'loved': cf. Matthew 25:12; 2 Timothy 2:19."

2. "God's great grace in this made their fall from it the more heinous."
3. "It is as if a schoolmaster should go back to learning the A, B, C's."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Since they had been made free from their ignoble servitude in the worship of false gods, and had been admitted to the freedom found in the worship of the true God, it was absurd that they should return again to that which was truly slavery or bondage."
2. "The sense is, 'Or, to speak more accurately or precisely, are known by God.' The object of this correction is to avoid the impression which might be derived from the former phrase that their acquaintance with God was owing to themselves."

### Marvin Vincent:

2. "If God knows a man, that fact implies an activity of God which passes over to the man, so that he, as the subject of God's knowledge, comes into the knowledge of God."

1. "Formerly the Galatians were left to themselves and, as it were, ignored by God. Then their knowledge of God was not their own merit, but a free gift of God, who condescended to dwell in them and to enlighten their minds and hearts."
2. "Man’s knowledge of God is very imperfect and has no value except as far as it flows from God’s perfect knowledge and recognition of man."
3. "Even Judaism is merely a poor elementary school and a system of slavery, as compared with the riches and freedom of the gospel."

### Archibald T Robertson:
