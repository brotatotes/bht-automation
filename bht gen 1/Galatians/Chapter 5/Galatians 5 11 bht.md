# Galatians 5:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the face of persecution, the apostle Paul defended his preaching of Christ crucified, which offended the Jews by suggesting the abolition of the law. The connection between Paul's insistence on salvation through Christ and his opposition from those who advocated for circumcision is evident. While Paul did not condemn those who adhered to the ceremonial law out of weakness, he vehemently denounced those who taught its necessity for justification. The conflict between the offense of the cross and the demands of Jewish legalism is at the heart of Paul's enduring persecution.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The first ἔτι is best understood, as referring, not to any change in his preaching as an Apostle, but to the change since his conversion, before which he was a strenuous fautor of Judaism." 
2. "What further excuse is there for my being persecuted? For, if I still preach circumcision, then is brought to nought the OFFENCE of the cross because, if circumcision, and not faith in Christ crucified, is the condition of salvation, then the Cross has lost its offensive character to the Jew." 
3. "For, if this is so, if I still preach circumcision, then is brought to nought, is done away, the OFFENCE of the cross."

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "The fact that I am still persecuted by the Jews shows plainly that I do not preach circumcision; for it is just because I preach Christ crucified, and not the Mosaic law, as the sole ground of justification, that they persecute me."
2. "Circumcision, or uncircumcision, are things indifferent in themselves: their lawfulness or unlawfulness depends on the animus of him who uses them."
3. "If justification in any degree depended on legal ordinances, Christ's crucifixion in that degree was unnecessary, and could profit nothing."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He had never enjoined circumcision as necessary to salvation; and had never complied with Jewish customs where there was danger that it would be understood that he regarded them as at all indispensable, or as furnishing a ground of acceptance with God."
2. "The fact that he was persecuted by the Jews settled the question, and showed that he did not preach the necessity of circumcision in any such sense as to satisfy them, or in any such sense as was claimed by the false teachers in Galatia."
3. "The very thing that I have so much insisted on, and that has been such a stumbling-block to the Jews, that conformity to their rites was of no avail, and that they must be saved only by the merits of a crucified Saviour, would be done away with."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "He that troubleth you by preaching circumcision shall bear his judgment; but I am not a disturber - not your enemy (chapter Galatians 4:16), for I do not preach circumcision." 
2. "If I preached circumcision, there would be no offense, and therefore no disturbance; for the cross would cease to be an offense, if, in addition to the cross, I preached just what the Judaisers assert, the necessity of circumcision."
3. "If Paul had preached circumcision as necessary to salvation, the preaching of the cross would have ceased to be an offense, because, along with the cross, Paul would have preached what the Judaisers demanded, that the Mosaic law should still be binding on Christians."

### John Calvin:

2. "Proper feelings and pure conscience, when manifested by a teacher, have no small share in obtaining confidence."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Then hath the offence (or stumbling block) of the cross been done away."

3. "The false teachers had probably spread the malicious report that Paul himself preached circumcision, because he practiced it in the case of Timothy who had a Jewish mother; but this was exceptional and a measure of expediency and charity, not a surrender of the principle."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Persecution is often a sign that we are on the right path. Just as Paul faced opposition from those who sought to undermine his influence, we too may encounter slander and persecution when we stand firm in our beliefs and convictions."

2. "The slanderous accusations against Paul reveal the lengths to which some will go to discredit and undermine the work of God. It serves as a reminder that even in the face of false accusations, we must remain steadfast in our faith and trust in God's plan."

3. "The persecution faced by Paul highlights the ongoing battle between the truth of the Gospel and the world's opposition. It is a reminder that as followers of Christ, we should not be surprised when we face opposition, but rather, we should take comfort in knowing that we are in good company with those who have gone before us."

### John Gill:
1. "Why do I yet suffer persecution?...had he [preached circumcision], persecution from this quarter would not have followed him; and he could have done it with a good conscience." 
2. "Why am I so warm and violent an opposer of those that submit to it?...these things are so opposite that there is no reconciling them."
