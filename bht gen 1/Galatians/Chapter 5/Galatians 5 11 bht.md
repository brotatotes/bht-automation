# Galatians 5:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we see the Apostle Paul facing persecution and false accusations due to his preaching of the crucified Christ. The opposition he faced underscores the importance of discernment and testing the authenticity of teachings. Paul's endurance serves as a powerful example for believers, highlighting the need to stay steadfast in faith despite opposition. The offense of the cross lies not in Paul preaching Christ crucified, but in the implication that the law has been abolished.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "The fact that I am still persecuted by the Jews shows plainly that I do not preach circumcision; for it is just because I preach Christ crucified, and not the Mosaic law, as the sole ground of justification, that they persecute me."
2. "Circumcision, or uncircumcision, are things indifferent in themselves: their lawfulness or unlawfulness depends on the animus of him who uses them."
3. "If justification in any degree depended on legal ordinances, Christ's crucifixion in that degree was unnecessary, and could profit nothing."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Then hath the offence (or stumbling block) of the cross been done away." 
2. "If circumcision is preached as a condition of salvation, then the cross, that is, the crucifixion, the doctrine of salvation by the atoning death of Christ, has lost its offensive character to the Jews."
3. "The false teachers had probably spread the malicious report that Paul himself preached circumcision, because he practiced it in the case of Timothy who had a Jewish mother; but this was exceptional and a measure of expediency and charity, not a surrender of the principle."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "The persecution that Paul faced was not only physical, but also included slander and false accusations. This reminds us that opposition to the Gospel can take various forms and may come from unexpected sources." 
2. "The slander against Paul highlights the importance of discernment and the need to test the teachings we encounter. It is crucial to verify the authenticity of the message and not be swayed by false claims." 
3. "Paul's endurance in the face of persecution serves as a powerful example for believers today. It reminds us to stay steadfast in our faith, even when faced with opposition, knowing that God is with us and will sustain us."

### John Gill:
1. "The apostle was traduced by the false teachers, as a preacher of circumcision himself in some places; and this they did partly to show him to be a variable and inconsistent man, who preached one doctrine in one place, and another in another place, and so not to be attended to."
2. "The last mentioned version reads it, 'the cross of Christ'; and so the Alexandrian copy; meaning not the cross of affliction, reproach, and persecution, which Christ has enjoined every follower of his to take up and bear for his sake, and is offensive to the carnal man; nor the cross on which he suffered, or the sufferings of the cross; but the doctrine of salvation by a crucified Christ, which was an offence and a stumblingblock to the Jews."
3. "Moreover, the Jews that believed would not have been so offended as they were at his preaching, had he preached the one as well the other; their offence was not that he preached Christ crucified, but that he preached, that, by the cross of Christ, circumcision and the other rituals of the ceremonial law were now abolished."

### John Wesley:
1. "The grand reason why the Jews were so offended at his preaching Christ crucified, and so bitterly persecuted him for it, was, that it implied the abolition of the law."
2. "Yet St. Paul did not condemn the conforming, out of condescension to the weakness of any one, even to the ceremonial law."
3. "He did absolutely condemn those who taught it as necessary to justification."
