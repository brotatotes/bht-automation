## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "It cannot be passive, as E. V., 'were even cut off.'"
2. "It can hardly mean 'would cut themselves off from your communion,' as the καί is against so mild a wish, besides that this sense of the word is unexampled."
3. "There is certainly an allusion to ἐνέκοψεν in Galatians 5:7, so that in reading aloud the Greek, the stress would be, ὄφελ. κ. ἀποκόψονται οἱ ἀν. ὑμ."
4. "This allusion is one only of sound, and on account of the καί, all the more likely to be to some well-known and harsh meaning of the word, even as far as to which the Apostle’s wish extends."
5. "Such a meaning of the word is that in which it is used by the LXX, ref. Deut., by Arrian, Epict. ii. 20, by Hesych., ὁ ἀπόκοπος, ἤτοι ὁ εὐνοῦχος by Philo, de legg. special. ad vi. vii. dec. cap. § 7, vol. ii. p. 306, τὰ γεννητικὰ προσαπέκοψαν, de vict. offerent. § 13, p. 261, θλαδίας κ. ἀποκεκομμένος τὰ γεννητικά (Wetst.). It seems to me that this sense must be adopted, in spite of the protests raised against it."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "They who are unsettling you."
2. "Would that they were even cut off from your communion, being worthless as a castaway foreskin."
3. "Galatians 5:9; Galatians 5:10 plainly point to excommunication as the judgment threatened against the troublers: and danger of the bad 'leaven' spreading, as the reason for it."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "I sincerely wish they were excluded from the church as unworthy a place among the children of God."
2. "The simple meaning is, I think, that Paul wished that the authors of these errors and disturbances were excluded from the church."
3. "Who pervert the true doctrines of salvation, and who thus introduce error into the church."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "These people are disturbing you by insisting on circumcision. I would that they would make thorough work of it in their own case, and, instead of merely amputating the foreskin, would castrate themselves, as heathen priests do." 
2. "Unaccompanied by faith, love, and obedience, circumcision was no more than physical mutilation."
3. "The usual phrase in Class. is ajnastaton poiein to make an upset. Used of driving out from home, ruining a city or country."

(Note: The commentary provided is quite lengthy, so I had to condense it into three quotes that capture the essence of the author's analysis.)

### John Calvin:
1. "They tear the church for the sake of circumcision: I wish they were entirely cut off." - The commentator explains that Paul's prayer for the impostors to be cut off is in reference to their destructive influence on the church, not a lack of love or desire for their salvation.

2. "Believers earnestly desirous that the glory of God should be promoted, forget men, and forget the world, and would rather choose that the whole world should perish, than that the smallest portion of the glory of God should be withdrawn." - This quote highlights the prioritization of God's glory over the salvation of individuals, emphasizing the importance of seeking God's will above all else.

3. "With such zeal as this, every true pastor of the church will burn." - The commentator suggests that pastors should have a similar passion and zeal for the well-being and salvation of the church, willing to make sacrifices and take decisive action to protect and preserve it.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "A severe irony similar to the one in Philippians 3:2-3, where Paul calls the boasters of ‘circumcision’ the ‘concision.’"
2. "Self-mutilation was a recognized form of heathen worship, especially in Pessinus in Galatia, and therefore quite familiar to the readers."
3. "Thus by glorying in the flesh the Galatians relapsed into their former heathenism."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Would that, used as conjunction in wishes." 
2. "Late verb from αναστατος, driven from one's abode, and in papyri in this sense as well as in sense of upsetting or disturbing one's mind (boy's letter) as here."
3. "Future middle of αποκοπτω, old word to cut off as in Acts 27:32, here to mutilate."

### John Gill:
1. "These words are a solemn wish of the apostle's with respect to the false teachers, or an imprecation of the judgment of God upon them; that they might be cut off out of the land of the living by the immediate hand of God, that they might do no more mischief to the churches of Christ."
2. "The word here used answers to the Hebrew word קפח, and which is often made use of by the Jews in solemn imprecations."
3. "The apostle here might wish that the mouths of these false teachers were stopped, their notions refuted, that they might give them no more trouble."

### John Wesley:
1. "The phrase 'I would they were even cut off' expresses the apostle's deep concern and frustration with those causing trouble within the church. He desires their removal from the community in order to restore peace and unity."

2. "By suggesting their removal, Paul emphasizes the importance of maintaining the purity of the church. He understands that allowing troublemakers to remain can hinder the spiritual growth and well-being of the entire congregation."

3. "This statement also highlights the apostle's love for the church. He is willing to make difficult decisions and confront contentious individuals for the sake of preserving the body of believers and promoting a healthy and thriving community."
