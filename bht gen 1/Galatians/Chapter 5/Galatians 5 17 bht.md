# Galatians 5:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we are presented with a vivid depiction of a profound inner conflict. Commentators explain that there is a constant struggle between the flesh and the Spirit, with each opposing and striving against the other. This clash prevents the full realization of both good and evil desires. This conflict is not merely an abstract concept, but an intense battle between reason and appetite, conscience and depravity, and between higher and lower aspirations. This struggle signifies the believer's state of constant conflict but also holds the promise of ultimate triumph for the Spirit over the flesh.
