# Galatians 5:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, there is a clear contrast and conflict depicted between the desires of the flesh and the promptings of the Spirit. The desires of the flesh are contrary to the leading of the Spirit, creating a tug-of-war within us. This battle between the flesh and the Spirit is an inherent part of the believer's journey, with the Spirit opposing and opposing the inclinations and works of the flesh. Ultimately, this verse highlights the inability for both the desires of the flesh and the desires of the Spirit to be fully realized and accomplished.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "If ye walk by the Spirit, ye shall not fulfil the lusts of the flesh." - This verse highlights the connection between walking by the Spirit and resisting the desires of the flesh.

2. "The necessity of supposing an ecbatic meaning for ἵνα in theology is obviated by remembering, that with God, results are all purposed." - This quote emphasizes that God's purposes and intentions are behind the outcomes and results in our lives.

3. "So that our verse requires expansion, both in the direction of Romans 7:15-20, and in the other direction, οὐ γὰρ ὃ θέλω (after the natural man) ποιῶ κακόν · ἀλλ ʼ ὃ οὐ θέλω ἀγαθόν, τοῦτο ποιῶ, to make it logically complete." - This quote suggests that to fully understand the verse, it needs to be expanded and connected to other passages in Romans, specifically addressing the struggle between the desires of the flesh and the desires of the Spirit.
