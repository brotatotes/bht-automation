# Galatians 5:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Bible verse is a powerful reminder of the ongoing battle between our fleshly desires and the Spirit's work in us. It sheds light on the nature of the "works of the flesh," which include not only external sins but also inward lusts and divisions that stem from a corrupt nature. On the other hand, we see that the "fruit of the Spirit" is a unified and consistent display of godly qualities that are contrary to our sinful inclinations. This passage highlights that these contrasting works and fruits are clearly evident and leave no doubt about their origin.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "The hidden fleshly principle betrays itself palpably by its works, so that these are not hard to discover, and leave no doubt that they come not from the Spirit."
2. "The 'fruit of the Spirit' is singular, because, however manifold the results, they form one harmonious whole."
3. "This passage shows that 'the flesh' does not mean merely sensuality, as opposed to spirituality: for 'divisions' in the catalogue here do not flow from sensuality."

### John Gill:
1. "By 'flesh' is meant corrupt nature, as before, and by the works of it, not only external acts of sin, but inward lusts."
2. "These are said to be 'manifest' not that they are all, and always publicly done, and are open to the sight of men; for they are works of darkness, and often done in secret, though they are always manifest to God the searcher of hearts."
3. "A clear case it is, that they are contrary to the Spirit, both to the Spirit of God, and to the principle of grace he forms in the heart."

### John Wesley:
1. "Works are mentioned in the plural because they are distinct from, and often inconsistent with, each other."
2. "But 'the fruit of the Spirit' is mentioned in the singular, Galatians 5:22, as being all consistent and connected together."
3. "Lasciviousness â€” The Greek word means anything inward or outward that is contrary to chastity, and yet short of actual uncleanness."
