# Galatians 5:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this passage, the commentator highlights the contrast between the works of the flesh and the fruit of the Spirit. The works of the flesh are plainly evident, reflecting corrupt human nature expressed through both external acts of sin and inward lusts. These works are not hidden but are manifest before God. On the other hand, the fruit of the Spirit is described as singular, harmonious, and consistent. It is not a list of separate virtues but a connected whole. The passage also emphasizes the destructive nature of certain vices such as lasciviousness, which includes anything contrary to chastity.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "plain to all, not needing, like the more hidden fruits of the Spirit, to be educed and specified: and therefore more clearly amenable to law"
2. "almost = 'for example:' 'qualia sunt'"
3. "It does not seem to include necessarily the idea of lasciviousness...The best word for it seems to be wantonness, 'protervitas'"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The hidden fleshly principle betrays itself palpably by its works, so that these are not hard to discover, and leave no doubt that they come not from the Spirit."
2. "The 'fruit of the Spirit' is singular, because, however manifold the results, they form one harmonious whole."
3. "This passage shows that 'the flesh' does not mean merely sensuality, as opposed to spirituality: for 'divisions' in the catalogue here do not flow from sensuality."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The word σὰρξ sarx, 'flesh,' is used to denote corrupt human nature, and not merely the body."
2. "If the word, therefore, is used to denote human nature, the passage furnishes a sad commentary on its tendency, and on the character of man."
3. "They are not so rare as not to be well known, and the meaning of the words requires little exposition."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "You have a clearly defined standard by which to decide whether you are led by the Spirit or by the flesh."
2. "Each exhibits its peculiar works or fruits."
3. "Uncleanness. See on 1 Thessalonians 2:3. Lasciviousness. See on Mark 7:22."

### John Calvin:
1. "If men knew themselves, they would not need this inspired declaration, for they are nothing but flesh; but such is the hypocrisy belonging to our natural state, we never perceive our depravity till the tree has been fully made known by its fruits."
2. "Paul declares both [emulation and envy] to be diseases of the flesh."
3. "He says that these works are manifest, so that no man may think that he will gain anything by evading the question; for what avails it to deny that the flesh reigns in us, if the fruit betrays the quality of the tree?"

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "He makes the two lists in explanation of the conflict in verse Galatians 5:17 to emphasize the command in verses Galatians 5:13."
2. "There are four groups in Paul's list of manifest vices: (I) Sensual sins like fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness. (2) Idolatry and witchcraft. (3) Personal relations expressed by eight words, sins of the spirit. (4) Drunkenness and revellings."
3. "And such like. And the things like these. It is not meant to be exhaustive, but it is representative."

### John Gill:
1. "By 'flesh' is meant corrupt nature, as before, and by the works of it, not only external acts of sin, but inward lusts."
2. "These are said to be 'manifest' not that they are all, and always publicly done, and are open to the sight of men; for they are works of darkness, and often done in secret, though they are always manifest to God the searcher of hearts."
3. "It is a clear case that they are contrary to the Spirit, both to the Spirit of God, and to the principle of grace he forms in the heart."

### John Wesley:
1. "Works are mentioned in the plural because they are distinct from, and often inconsistent with, each other."
2. "But 'the fruit of the Spirit' is mentioned in the singular, Galatians 5:22, as being all consistent and connected together."
3. "Lasciviousness — The Greek word means anything inward or outward that is contrary to chastity, and yet short of actual uncleanness."
