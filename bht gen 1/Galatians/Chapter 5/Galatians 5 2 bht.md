# Galatians 5:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this passage, the commentators reveal that the verse addresses the danger of relying on external rituals and religious practices, such as circumcision, for justification or salvation. They emphasize that such reliance negates the sufficiency of Christ's sacrifice and righteousness. By seeking to earn righteousness through their own efforts, individuals disclaim Christ and render His death and grace ineffective. Overall, the verse warns against the futile pursuit of justification apart from faith in Christ alone.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "ἴδε, not ἰδέ, in later Greek: see Winer, § 6. 1. a: it draws attention to what follows, as a strong statement."
2. "The present, ἐὰν περιτέμνησθε, implies the continuance of a habit, q. d. if you will go on being circumcised."
3. "Nothing can be more directly opposed than this verse to the saying of the Judaizers, Acts 15:1."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "I Paul—Though you now think less of my authority, I nevertheless give my name and personal authority as enough by itself to refute all opposition of adversaries."
2. "Circumcision here is not regarded simply by itself, but as the symbol of Judaism and legalism in general. If this be necessary, then the Gospel of grace is at an end."
3. "For righteousness of works and justification by faith cannot co-exist. 'He who is circumcised [for justification] is so as fearing the law, and he who fears, disbelieves the power of grace, and he who disbelieves can profit nothing by that grace which he disbelieves.'"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He is to be 'a whole Saviour.' No one is to share with him in the honor of saving people; and no rite, no custom, no observance of law, is to divide the honor with his death."
2. "If it was done, as it was then, for prudential considerations, and with a wish not necessarily to irritate the Jews, and to give one a more ready access to them, it was not to be regarded as wrong."
3. "Rites and ceremonies in religion may be in themselves well enough, if they are held to be matters not essential; but the moment they are regarded as vital and essential, that moment they begin to infringe on the doctrine of justification by faith alone, and that moment they are to be rejected."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Behold [ιδε]. Imperative singular, appealing to each individual reader."
2. "Circumcision is the sign of subjection to the Jewish 'yoke' - the economy of the law."
3. "The choice of the law involved the relinquishment of Christ."

### John Calvin:
1. "He could not have pronounced a severer threatening than that it would exclude them entirely from the grace of Christ."
2. "Paul’s reasoning is directed not so properly against the outward rite or ceremony, as against the wicked doctrine of the false apostles."
3. "The apostle contends that Christ cannot be divided in this way, and that he 'profiteth nothing,' unless he is wholly embraced."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "A circumcised man may become a Christian, but a Christian who deliberately undergoes circumcision, becomes a Jew and virtually trusts to the law for salvation, and not to Christ." 
2. "‘If ye be circumcised,’ or ‘submit to circumcision,’ as a term of salvation; some had probably done so already." 
3. "‘Christ will profit you nothing;’ the future marks the certain result of this Judaizing course."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "I Paul (εγω Παυλος). Asserts all his personal and apostolic authority." 
2. "For both words see also 1 Thessalonians 2:16; 2 Corinthians 10:1; Colossians 1:23; Ephesians 3:1." 
3. "If ye receive circumcision (εαν περιτεμνησθε). Condition of third class and present passive subjunctive, a supposable case, but with terrible consequences, for they will make circumcision a condition of salvation. In that case Christ will help them not at all."

### John Gill:
1. "Circumcision submitted to on this consideration, and with this view rendered Christ unprofitable, made his death to be in vain, his sacrifice of no effect, and his righteousness useless."
2. "Christ is a whole Saviour, or none at all; to join anything with him and his righteousness, in the business of justification and salvation, is interpreted by him as a contempt and neglect of him."
3. "Trusting to [works and righteousness] renders Christ unprofitable to them."

These quotes highlight the central message of the commentary, emphasizing that relying on circumcision or any other works for salvation undermines the sufficiency of Christ's sacrifice and righteousness.

2. "Seek to be justified thereby" - This quote underscores the commentary's focus on the misguided belief that one can earn salvation or righteousness through their own efforts.
