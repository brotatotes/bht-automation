## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "I Paul—Though you now think less of my authority, I nevertheless give my name and personal authority as enough by itself to refute all opposition of adversaries."
2. "Circumcision here is not regarded simply by itself, but as the symbol of Judaism and legalism in general. If this be necessary, then the Gospel of grace is at an end."
3. "For righteousness of works and justification by faith cannot co-exist. 'He who is circumcised [for justification] is so as fearing the law, and he who fears, disbelieves the power of grace, and he who disbelieves can profit nothing by that grace which he disbelieves."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "A circumcised man may become a Christian, but a Christian who deliberately undergoes circumcision, becomes a Jew and virtually trusts to the law for salvation, and not to Christ." 
2. "'Behold' rouses attention. 'I, Paul' interposes the apostolic authority, in opposition to the Judaizing teachers who taught that circumcision was necessary to make them full Christians and to insure salvation." 
3. "The future marks the certain result of this Judaizing course. Luther: 'If St. Paul can venture to pass so terrible a judgment against the law and circumcision which God himself has given, what kind of judgment would he utter upon the chaff and the dross of men's ordinances?'"

### John Gill:
1. "Circumcision submitted to on this consideration, and with this view rendered Christ unprofitable, made his death to be in vain, his sacrifice of no effect, and his righteousness useless."
2. "Christ is a whole Saviour, or none at all; to join anything with him and his righteousness, in the business of justification and salvation, is interpreted by him as a contempt and neglect of him."
3. "Trusting to these [works and righteousness] renders Christ unprofitable to them."

These quotes highlight the importance of not relying on external rituals or works for salvation, but rather placing full trust in Christ alone. It emphasizes that any attempt to add to or supplement Christ's work on the cross diminishes its power and renders it ineffective.
