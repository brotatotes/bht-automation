### Henry Alford:
1. "εἰδωλ, in its proper meaning of idolatry: not, as Olsh., 'sins of lust,' because of the unclean orgies of idolatry."
2. "φαρμ., either 'poisonings,' or 'sorceries.' The latter is preferable, as more frequently its sense in the LXX and N. T., and because (Mey.) Asia was particularly addicted to sorceries."
3. "θυμοί] passionate outbreaks. θυμὸς μέν ἐστι πρόσκαιρος, ὀργὴ δὲ πολυχρόνιος μνησικακία, Ammonius. διαφέρει δὲ θυμὸς ὀργῆς, τῷ θυμὸν μὲν εἶναι ὀργὴν ἀναθυμιωμένην κ. ἔτι ἐκκαιομένην, ὀργὴν δὲ ὄρεξιν ἀντιτιμωρήσεως."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Seditions" refers to divisions or factions within a group, and it is important to note that this term is linked to the idea of causing discord and strife among believers. (Romans 16:17)
2. The term "heresies" is connected to the concept of false teachings or doctrines that deviate from the truth of the Gospel. It highlights the danger of spreading beliefs that contradict the core principles of Christianity. (Acts 5:17; 1 Corinthians 11:19)
3. These terms serve as warnings against the potential harm caused by divisions and false teachings within the community of believers, emphasizing the need for unity and adherence to the true teachings of the Bible.

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Witchcraft [φαρμακια] . Or sorcery. Elsewhere only Revelation 18:23. From farmakon a drug."
2. "Strife [εριθιαι] . More correctly, factions. From eriqov a hired servant."
3. "Heresies [αιρεσεις] . In Paul only here and 1 Corinthians 11:19. See on 2 Peter 2:1. Parties, into which divisions crystallize."

### John Gill:
1. "Idolatry... means the worshipping of other gods, or of graven images."

### John Wesley:
1. "Idolatry, witchcraft — That this means witchcraft, strictly speaking, (not poisoning,) appears from its being joined with the worship of devil-gods, and not with murder."
2. "To deny therefore that there is, or ever was, any such thing, is, by plain consequence, to deny the authority both of the Old and New Testament."
3. "Divisions — In domestic or civil matters. Heresies are divisions in religious communities."
