# Galatians 5:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Love is the leader of the band of graces, the root of all the rest, and the fruit of divine influence and bounty. Gentleness, conciliatory to others, extends compassion and kindness even towards ignorant and wicked men. Goodness, with its soft and tender nature, brings about acts of moral, spiritual, and evangelic significance for the benefit of both soul and body. These graces, exemplified in faithfulness and trustfulness towards God and man, make up the beautiful tapestry of the Bible verse.

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Love is the leader of the band of graces." 
2. "Gentleness is conciliatory to others, while goodness is ready to do good but lacks suavity of manner." 
3. "Faith is faithfulness, opposed to heresies, and includes trustfulness towards God and man."

### John Gill:
1. "The graces of which are called 'fruit', and not 'works', as the actions of the flesh are; because they are owing to divine influence efficacy, and bounty, as the fruits of the earth are, to which the allusion is."
2. "Moreover, joy in the good of others, of fellow creatures and fellow Christians, in their outward and inward prosperity, in their temporal, spiritual, and eternal good, which, as it is a grace of the Spirit, may well enough be thought to be at least part of the sense of the word here."
3. "To which is added goodness; and what else can come from the good Spirit of God, the author of the good work of grace upon the soul? And which disposes it to acts of goodness unto men, in a natural, civil, moral, spiritual, and evangelic way, for the benefit both of soul and body."
