# Galatians 5:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This verse highlights the importance of temperance, self-restraint, and meekness. It emphasizes the need to control our desires and lusts, while acknowledging the strength that lies in holding our emotions and passions in balance. These fruits of the Spirit are contrasted with the works of the flesh, as they enable us to respond with gentleness, humility, and grace in the face of life's challenges. Ultimately, these virtues are in alignment with the law of God and are not opposed to it.
