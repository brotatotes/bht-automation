# Galatians 5:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse describes the fruits of the Spirit, including meekness and temperance. Meekness is displayed through humility, gratitude, and dependence on God, as well as behaving modestly and humbly towards others. Temperance involves self-restraint, controlling desires and lusts. These virtues are in line with the law and are not condemned by it. The Holy Spirit enables believers to exhibit these qualities, allowing them to exercise self-control and respond to others with kindness and gentleness, even in difficult circumstances.
