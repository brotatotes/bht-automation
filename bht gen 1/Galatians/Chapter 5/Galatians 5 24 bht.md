# Galatians 5:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Believers in Christ have crucified their flesh, separating themselves from sinful desires and corrupt passions. By nailing their flesh to the cross, they demonstrate their commitment to a new life in communion with Christ. This crucifixion of the flesh is a result of becoming Christ's, accomplished through baptism. In this state, believers are dead to their former sinful lives and rise to a new life of righteousness and fellowship with God.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "They who are Christ's crucified the flesh, with its passions and desires." 
2. "They are entirely severed from and dead to the law, which is for the fleshly."
3. "This crucifixion of the flesh is a result of becoming Christ's, at their baptism."

Note: The commentary seems to be discussing the idea that those who belong to Christ have crucified their fleshly desires and are no longer bound by the law.

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "They that are of Christ Jesus"; they that belong to Christ Jesus; being "led by (His) Spirit" have crucified the flesh—They nailed it to the cross once for all when they became Christ's, on believing and being baptized (Romans 6:3; Romans 6:4): they keep it now in a state of crucifixion (Romans 6:6): so that the Spirit can produce in them, comparatively uninterrupted by it, "the fruit of the Spirit" (Romans 6:6- :)." 

2. "Man, by faith, is dead to the former standing point of a sinful life, and rises to a new life (Romans 6:6- :) of communion with Christ (Romans 6:6- :)." 

3. "We are to be executioners, dealing cruelly with the body of sin, which has caused the acting of all cruelties on Christ's body."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "All who are true Christians have crucified the flesh, the corrupt passions of the soul have been put to death."
2. "They are as though they were dead, and have no power over us."
3. "True Christians have also crucified the affections, the corrupt desires, and lusts."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "They that are Christ's... Belong to him." 
2. "Have crucified the flesh... The line of thought as regards death to sin is the same as in Romans 6:2-7, Romans 6:11."
3. "Affections... Often sufferings, as Romans 8:18; 2 Corinthians 1:5, 2 Corinthians 1:6, 2 Corinthians 1:7; Philippians 3:10; Hebrews 2:9."

### John Calvin:
1. "The word crucified is employed to point out that the mortification of the flesh is the effect of the cross of Christ."
2. "By the grace of Christ 'we have been planted together in the likeness of his death' (Romans 6:5,) that we no longer might live unto ourselves."
3. "If we are buried with Christ, by true self-denial, and by the destruction of the old man, we shall then enjoy the privilege of the sons of God."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Union with Christ is a complete separation from sin; hence the baptismal formula of renunciation of the flesh, the world, and the devil, and devotion to the service of Christ."
2. "Conversion is death of the old man and birth of the new."
3. "The destruction of the old man of sin is an imitation of the crucifixion, as the birth of the new man of righteousness corresponds to the resurrection of Christ."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Crucified the flesh (την σαρκα εσταυρωσαν). Definite event, first aorist active indicative of σταυροω as in Galatians 2:19 (mystical union with Christ)."

2. "Paul uses σαρξ here in the same sense as in verses Galatians 5:16; Galatians 5:17; Galatians 5:19, 'the force in men that makes for evil' (Burton)."

3. "With (συν). 'Together with,' emphasizing 'the completeness of the extermination of this evil force' and the guarantee of victory over one's passions and dispositions toward evil."

### John Gill:
1. "Not all as yet that are secretly so, who are chosen in him, and by him, are given by the Father to him in covenant, and whom he has purchased by his blood, and considers as his people, his sheep, and his children, though as yet they are not called by his grace; of these, as yet, what follows cannot be said, and therefore must mean such as are openly Christ's." 

2. "By the flesh is meant, not the natural body to be macerated and afflicted with fastings, watchings, c. but the corruption of nature, the old man and carnal heart."

3. "And in consequence of this crucifixion of the body of sin, with Christ upon the cross, when he finished and made an end of it, sin, with its passions and lusts, is crucified by the Spirit of God in regeneration and sanctification; so that it loses its governing power, and has not the dominion it had before."

### John Wesley:
1. "They that are Christ's - True believers in him."
2. "Have thus crucified the flesh - Nailed it, as it were, to a cross."
3. "With its affections and desires - All its evil passions, appetites, and inclinations."
