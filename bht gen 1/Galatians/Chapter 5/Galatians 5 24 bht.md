# Galatians 5:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Those who belong to Christ Jesus have completely renounced their old sinful nature and have surrendered themselves to the lordship of Christ. They have crucified their flesh and are dead to the old ways of the world. Through their union with Christ, they experience a death to their sinful past and a birth into a new life of communion with Him. The old man of sin is destroyed, imitating the crucifixion of Christ, and the new man of righteousness is born, corresponding to the resurrection of Christ.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "They who are Christ's crucified the flesh, with its passions and desires." 
2. "They are entirely severed from and dead to the law, which is for the fleshly." 
3. "This signifies a complete renunciation of the old nature and a total surrender to the lordship of Christ."

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "They that are of Christ Jesus"; they that belong to Christ Jesus; being "led by (His) Spirit" have crucified the fleshâ€”They nailed it to the cross once for all when they became Christ's, on believing and being baptized."
2. "Man, by faith, is dead to the former standing point of a sinful life, and rises to a new life of communion with Christ."
3. "We are to be executioners, dealing cruelly with the body of sin, which has caused the acting of all cruelties on Christ's body."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Union with Christ is a complete separation from sin; hence the baptismal formula of renunciation of the flesh, the world, and the devil, and devotion to the service of Christ."
2. "Conversion is death of the old man and birth of the new."
3. "The destruction of the old man of sin is an imitation of the crucifixion, as the birth of the new man of righteousness corresponds to the resurrection of Christ."

### John Gill:
1. "Not all as yet that are secretly so, who are chosen in him, and by him, are given by the Father to him in covenant, and whom he has purchased by his blood, and considers as his people, his sheep, and his children, though as yet they are not called by his grace; of these, as yet, what follows cannot be said, and therefore must mean such as are openly Christ's, whom he has laid hold on as his own in the effectual calling, who have his Spirit as a spirit of regeneration and sanctification, who have truly believed in Christ, and have given up themselves unto him."

2. "By the flesh is meant, not the natural body to be macerated and afflicted with fastings, watchings, c. but the corruption of nature, the old man and carnal heart. The Vulgate Latin version reads, 'their own flesh' and so do the Syriac and Ethiopic versions; their concern lying with their own, and not with the corruptions, affections, and lusts of others."

3. "And in consequence of this crucifixion of the body of sin, with Christ upon the cross, when he finished and made an end of it, sin, with its passions and lusts, is crucified by the Spirit of God in regeneration and sanctification; so that it loses its governing power, and has not the dominion it had before."

### John Wesley:
1. "True believers in him."
2. "Nailed it, as it were, to a cross."
3. "All its evil passions, appetites, and inclinations."
