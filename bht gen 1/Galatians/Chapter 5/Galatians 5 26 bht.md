# Galatians 5:26 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, we are cautioned against falling into the trap of vaingloriousness and pride. The commentators emphasize that seeking worldly honor or desiring the praise and esteem of others is not in line with the teachings of Paul. The consequences of vainglory can lead to provoking and stirring up strife, envy towards others, as well as a departure from true glory and humility. Therefore, we are encouraged to cultivate contentment, gratitude, and a recognition of our equal standing in the eyes of God, avoiding the destructive cycle of comparison and self-exaltation.
