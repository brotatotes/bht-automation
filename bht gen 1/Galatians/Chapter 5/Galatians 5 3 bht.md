# Galatians 5:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
By undergoing circumcision, a person enters into a binding agreement to keep the entire Jewish law, both moral and ritual. It is a symbol of commitment and obligation. The verse emphasizes that fulfilling the whole law is impossible for any person, highlighting the contradictory nature of relying on the law for justification. Christ's grace is necessary because no one can satisfy the law. Rejecting Christ renders His sacrifice and righteousness of no profit.
