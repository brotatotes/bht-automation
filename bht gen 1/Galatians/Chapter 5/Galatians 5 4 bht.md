# Galatians 5:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, we see a stern warning against seeking justification through adherence to the law. Commentators warn that by doing so, individuals sever their connection with Christ and fall away from His grace. The verse emphasizes the futility and emptiness of relying on one's own efforts for salvation, rather than embracing the transformative power of Christ's sacrifice. It urges believers to recognize and accept the grace and mercy bestowed upon them through their relationship with Christ, rather than renouncing it for a legalistic approach.
