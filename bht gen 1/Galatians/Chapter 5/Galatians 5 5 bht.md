# Galatians 5:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse being described focuses on the distinction between Christians who rely on faith in Christ for righteousness and those who seek justification through the law. It emphasizes the role of the Holy Spirit in inspiring faith and guiding believers' hope for righteousness. The hope expressed is not a diminishing one, but rather a growing anticipation for future salvation. Through faith in Christ, Christians confidently await the fulfillment of their hope in eternal glory and felicity. This hope is not based on works of the law but on the righteousness obtained through faith.
