# Galatians 5:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse being described in these commentaries is one that speaks of Christians waiting for the hope of righteousness that comes from faith. This hope is not just about justification, but the full consummation of salvation that true Christians expect. It is a hope that grows and increases until it is fully realized in the future glory and felicity of eternal life. This hope is obtained and sustained through the work of the Holy Spirit and is a confident expectation that is rooted in the righteousness received by faith in Jesus Christ.

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "We wait for the (realization of the) hope (which is the fruit) of the righteousness (that is, justification which comes) by (literally, 'from-out of') faith." 
2. "This is a farther step than being 'justified'; not only are we this, but 'wait for the hope' which is connected with it, and is its full consummation."
3. "Righteousness, in the sense of justification, is by the believer once for all already attained: but the consummation of it in future perfection above is the object of hope to be waited for."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "We who are Christians. It is a characteristic of the true Christian."

### John Gill:
1. "Christians...did not look for, and expect heaven and happiness through circumcision, or any of the works of the law, but through the righteousness of Christ received by faith, under the influence and testimony of the Spirit of God." 
2. "Eternal glory and felicity is here intended, called 'hope'; because it is the object of hope, or is what is hoped for; it is unseen, as what is hoped for is: it is future, and what is to be enjoyed hereafter, and therefore hoped for."
3. "The manner in which they wait is, 'through the Spirit', and 'by faith'; believers look and wait for heaven, under the influence and encouragement of the Spirit of God; who is the author of the faith by which they look for it, and of the hope which is concerned with it."

### John Wesley:
1. "Through the Spirit - Without any of those carnal ordinances."
