# Galatians 5:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the commentators highlight the significance of being "in Christ" and the abolition of rituals and ceremonies. They emphasize that true faith is revealed through love and that love fulfills the essence of the law. The commentators also assert that faith alone justifies, but when accompanied by love, it produces good works that exemplify our relationship with God and others. They affirm that in the Christian covenant, circumcision or any external identity does not determine one's standing in Christ. Rather, what matters is the transformative power of faith, which is demonstrated by love and holiness.
