# Galatians 5:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, faith and love are intimately connected, working hand in hand to shape the Christian life. While the differences between circumcision and uncircumcision do not affect one's place in the Church, the central focus lies in faith and its reception of the righteousness of Christ. This genuine faith is not merely a belief, but a transformative force that manifests through acts of love, reflecting the true and genuine nature of a believer's faith. In Christ Jesus, faith is the principle that unites believers from diverse backgrounds, bridging the gap between law and grace.
