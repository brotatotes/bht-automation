This passage, brought to life by various commentators, highlights the theme of restoration and meekness in addressing those who have fallen into sin within the church. It emphasizes the unexpected nature of these falls, and the importance of treating fallen members with tenderness and love. It calls for a demonstration of spiritual action, such as charity, meekness, and modesty, as a reflection of one's spiritual life. The goal is to gently restore those who have stumbled, recognizing our own vulnerability to temptation and the need for unity and support within the body of believers.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "If a man even be overtaken" (that is, caught in the very act) - BEFORE he expects: unexpectedly. 
2. "If another has really been overtaken in a fault the first; for often he who is first to find fault, is the very one who has first transgressed."
3. "Such is the tenderness with which we should treat a fallen member of the Church in restoring him to a better state."
4. "Meekness is that temper of spirit towards God whereby we accept His dealings without disputing; then, towards men, whereby we endure meekly their provocations, and do not withdraw ourselves from the burdens which their sins impose upon us."
5. "When congregations are addressed collectively, each individual should take home the monition to himself."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Spiritual life must show itself in spiritual action, especially in charity, meekness, and modesty."
2. "Brethren. A word of love more potent than argument."
3. "True charity is a test of spirituality. True strength and freedom show themselves in bearing and forbearing."

### John Gill:
1. "The apostle here addresses the brethren in general, the several members of the church, even all but those that were fallen: nor does he mean such as have more spiritual knowledge than others, in opposition to babes; nor regenerate persons, and such as had the Spirit of God, in distinction from carnal men; but such as live and walk in the Spirit, and are strong, and stand by the power and grace of the Spirit of God, as opposed to the weak, and who were fallen through the prevalency of the flesh, and force of temptation."
2. "Professors fallen into sin are like broken and dislocated bones; they are out of their place, and lose both their comfort and usefulness, and are to be restored by gently telling them of their faults, and mildly reproving them for them; and when sensible of them, and troubled for them, by speaking comfortably to them, and by bringing them again, and resettling them in their former place in the church, and restoring them to their former usefulness and good conduct."
3. "A spiritual man should consider himself as in the body, and as carrying about with him a body of sin, a corrupt and treacherous heart, that is full of deceitful lusts, by which he may be tempted also, and drawn away and enticed; and as being liable to the temptations of Satan, and of being overcome by them, against which he should watch and pray; and should think with himself what he would choose, and should desire to be done to him in such a case, and do the like to others that are in it."

### John Wesley:
1. "Ye who are spiritual — Who continue to live and walk by the Spirit."
2. "Restore such an one — By reproof, instruction, or exhortation. Every one who can, ought to help herein; only in the spirit of meekness."
3. "Lest thou also be tempted — Temptation easily and swiftly passes from one to another; especially if a man endeavours to cure another without preserving his own meekness."
