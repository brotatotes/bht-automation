# Galatians 6:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, addressed to the spiritually mature and strong members of the church, we are reminded of the importance of restoring those who have fallen into sin. We are called to gently and lovingly bring them back to a place of spiritual health and usefulness. Understanding our own vulnerabilities and weaknesses, we approach this task with meekness, taking care not to be tempted ourselves. The goal is to exemplify charity, bearing with one another and promoting the edification of the brethren, as we recognize that true strength is demonstrated in our ability to mend and restore souls.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Christians were not perfect; and it was possible that they who were true Christians might be surprised by temptation, and fall into sin."

Usually by Paul metaphorically as here. The idea of amendment is prominent : set him to rights : bring him into line."

### John Gill:
1. "The apostle here addresses the brethren in general, the several members of the church, even all but those that were fallen: nor does he mean such as have more spiritual knowledge than others, in opposition to babes; nor regenerate persons, and such as had the Spirit of God, in distinction from carnal men; but such as live and walk in the Spirit, and are strong, and stand by the power and grace of the Spirit of God, as opposed to the weak, and who were fallen through the prevalency of the flesh, and force of temptation; whose duty it is, and on whom it lies, to restore such an one, that is overtaken and fallen."
2. "Professors fallen into sin are like broken and dislocated bones; they are out of their place, and lose both their comfort and usefulness, and are to be restored by gently telling them of their faults, and mildly reproving them for them; and when sensible of them, and troubled for them, by speaking comfortably to them, and by bringing them again, and resettling them in their former place in the church, and restoring them to their former usefulness and good conduct."
3. "A spiritual man should consider himself as in the body, and as carrying about with him a body of sin, a corrupt and treacherous heart, that is full of deceitful lusts, by which he may be tempted also, and drawn away and enticed; and as being liable to the temptations of Satan, and of being overcome by them, against which he should watch and pray; and should think with himself what he would choose, and should desire to be done to him in such a case, and do the like to others that are in it."

### John Wesley:
1. "Ye who are spiritual — Who continue to live and walk by the Spirit."
2. "Restore such an one — By reproof, instruction, or exhortation. Every one who can, ought to help herein; only in the spirit of meekness - This is essential to a spiritual man; and in this lies the whole force of the cure."
3. "Lest thou also be tempted — Temptation easily and swiftly passes from one to another; especially if a man endeavors to cure another without preserving his own meekness."
