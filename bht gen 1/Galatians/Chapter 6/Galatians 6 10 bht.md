# Galatians 6:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This verse encourages believers to seize the opportunities presented to them to do good deeds. These opportunities may arise throughout their lifetime, both in general and in specific circumstances. It reminds them that Satan is active in causing harm, so they should counteract it by being diligent in their acts of kindness and benevolence. The verse emphasizes the importance of doing good to all individuals, regardless of their relationship to the believer, including friends, enemies, and even strangers. However, it particularly highlights the responsibility to care for and support fellow believers, as they are part of the same spiritual family.
