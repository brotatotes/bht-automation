# Galatians 6:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we are urged to seize every opportunity to do good, for these opportunities may not always be available to us. Our actions should begin within our own families and extend to the broader community of believers. Just as farmers eagerly take advantage of the proper season for planting, we should make the most of the time we have been given to sow seeds of kindness and love. By doing so, we fulfill the purpose of our lives and contribute to the well-being of both our immediate circles and the world at large.
