# Galatians 6:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, there is a contrast between the zeal of certain individuals who sought to please themselves and maintain a fair character, and the zeal of others who sought to blend Judaism and Christianity in order to escape opposition. These individuals attempted to induce others to conform to the external rituals of the Mosaic law, believing that it was necessary for salvation. However, their true motive was to avoid persecution and maintain their reputation, rather than having a genuine faith in Christ's sacrifice for justification.
