# Galatians 6:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, some commentators explain that there are certain individuals who are driven by the desire to make a good impression in the flesh, seeking to display their zeal for external or carnal ordinances. These individuals aim to please men rather than God and Christ and avoid persecution for their faith. They try to blend Judaism and Christianity to escape opposition, forcing others to conform to their beliefs. Ultimately, their actions reveal a lack of genuine love for the cause of religion and a prioritization of their own image rather than true righteousness.
