# Galatians 6:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
These quotes from commentators shed light on a Bible verse that exposes the hypocrisy and insincerity of those advocating for circumcision. The verse reveals that their adherence to circumcision is not driven by a genuine zeal for the law, but rather by personal gain, recognition, and the desire to boast about their influence over others. It highlights their lack of commitment to upholding the entire law, as they selectively focus on circumcision while disregarding other aspects of the law. Ultimately, it paints a picture of individuals who prioritize outward appearances and personal gratification over true spiritual transformation.
