# Galatians 6:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse focuses on the cross of Christ, which was a stumbling block and foolishness to many. Commentators highlight that the cross is both a source of shame and glory, and it signifies death to the flesh, the world, and the devil. Through the cross, Christ destroyed all kinds of death and brought about redemption. By embracing the crucified Christ and crucifying the world, believers overcome self-righteousness, boasting, and worldly pursuits, finding true spirituality and salvation in the power of Christ's death.
