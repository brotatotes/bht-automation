1. "A new creature" refers to the transformation that takes place in a person's life when they become a follower of Christ. It is not simply a superficial change, but a complete renewal of the inner being.

2. This transformation is described as a "new creation" because it is a work of God's power and grace. It is not something that can be achieved through human effort or self-improvement.

3. The phrase "a new creature" also implies that the old way of life has passed away. It signifies a break from the past and a new beginning in Christ.

1. "Baptism is of no avail in the business of salvation, yet it cannot be said of it, as of circumcision, that it avails not anything as a command; for it is a standing ordinance of Christ."

3. "A new creature is an internal principle of grace, a good work of God begun in the soul... it consists of new principles and actions, of new light, life, love, desires, joys, comforts, and duties."

Note: The commentary also mentions the phrase "but a creature" and the phrase "new creature" but these do not provide significant enrichment to the understanding of the verse.
