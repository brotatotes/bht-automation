### Henry Alford:
1. "τὸ λοιπόν continuum et perpetuum tempus significat, ut apud Xen. Cyr. viii. 5. 24; τοῦ λοιποῦ autem repetitionem ejusdem facti reliquo tempore indicat, ut apud Aristoph. in Pace, v. 1684 (1050 Bekk.).” Hermann ad Viger., p. 706. But the above example from Herod. hardly seems to bear this out. Rather is a thing happening in time regarded as belonging to the period including it, and the genitive is one of possession." 
2. "ἐγὼ γάρ] for it is I (not the Judaizing teachers) who carry (perhaps as in Galatians 6:5, and ch. Galatians 5:10, bear, as a burden: but Chrys.’s idea seems more adapted to the ‘feierlich’ character of the sentence: οὐκ εἶπεν, ἔχω, ἀλλά, βαστάζω, ὥσπερ τις ἐπὶ τροπαίοις μέγα φρονῶν ἢ σημείοις βασιλικοῖς: see reff. (2)) in (on) my body the marks of Jesus."
3. "τὰ στίγματα, the marks branded on slaves to indicate their owners. So Herod. vii. 233, τοὺς πλεῦνας αὐτέων, κελεύσαντος Ξέρξεω, ἔστιζον στίγματα βασιλήϊα: and in another place (ii. 113) is a passage singularly in point: ὅτεῳ ἀνθρώπων ἐπιβάληται στίγματα ἱρά, ἑωϋτὸν διδοὺς τῷ θεῷ, οὐκ ἔξεστι τούτου ἅψασθαι. See many more examples in Wetst. These marks, in St. Paul’s case, were of course the scars of his wounds received in the service of his Master cf. 2 Corinthians 11:23 ff."
