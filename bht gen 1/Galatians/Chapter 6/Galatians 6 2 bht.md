# Galatians 6:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, believers are encouraged to support and assist each other in their struggles and weaknesses, showing love and compassion. By bearing each other's burdens, they fulfill the law of Christ, which emphasizes love as the distinguishing mark of His disciples. This law of Christ is not a legalistic set of rules, but rather a call to sympathize, forgive, and offer support, following Christ's example of sacrificial love. Through this, believers live out Christ's teachings and express their genuine care and concern for one another.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Bear one another's burdens," literally, "weights." Distinguished by BENGEL from "burden," Galatians 6:4: "weights" exceed the strength of those under them; "burden" is proportioned to the strength.
2. "So fulfil" or "so ye will fulfil," Greek, "fill up," "thoroughly fulfil."
3. "The law of Christ," namely, "love" (Galatians 5:14). Fulfill the law of Christ, which is not made up of various minute observances, but whose sole "burden" is "love."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Bear with each other; help each other in the divine life."
2. "We should aid each other in regard to [temptations and besetting sins], and help one another to overcome them."
3. "The law of Christ would not allow us to reproach the offender, or to taunt him, or to rejoice in his fall. We should help him to take up his load of infirmities, and sustain him by our counsels, our exhortations, and our prayers."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Sin and error should be resisted and rebuked in a spirit of charity and meekness."
2. "With all our faults we ought to esteem and love one another as brethren in Christ."
3. "And thus ye shall (completely) fulfil the law of Christ, namely, the law of love."

### John Gill:
1. "Christ is only able to bear these burdens, so as to remove them and take them away, which he has done by his blood, sacrifice, and satisfaction."
2. "Saints bear one another's burdens by gently reproving them, by comforting them when overpressed with guilt, by sympathizing with them in their sorrow, by praying to God for to manifest his pardoning grace to them, and by forgiving them themselves."
3. "This is a law or doctrine which Christ has clearly taught, and recovered from the false glosses of the Pharisees; it is his new commandment, which he has strengthened and enforced by his own example in dying for his people."

### John Wesley:
1. "Bear ye one another's burdens" - Sympathize with, and assist, each other, in all your weaknesses, grievances, trials.
2. "And so fulfil the law of Christ" - The law of Christ is the law of love: this our Lord peculiarly recommends; this he makes the distinguishing mark of his disciples.
3. "The law of Christ (an uncommon expression)" - The law of Christ is not a legalistic set of rules, but rather a call to love and care for one another.
