# Galatians 6:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, believers are called to bear one another's burdens by helping and supporting each other in their weaknesses, trials, and grievances. By doing so, they fulfill the law of Christ, which emphasizes love as the distinguishing mark of His disciples. This law of Christ is not a burden, but rather a call to show compassion, forgiveness, and support to fellow believers. In fulfilling this law, believers exemplify Christ's own sacrifice and love for His people.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Bear ONE ANOTHER’S burdens, and thus fulfil the law of Christ, a far higher and better law, whose only burden is love."
2. "The position of ἀλλήλων I conceive fixes this meaning, by throwing τὰ βάρη into the shade, as a term common to the two laws."
3. "The more general the meaning we give to βάρη, the better it will accord with the sense of the command."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Bear one another's burdens," literally, "weights." Distinguished by BENGEL from "burden," Galatians 6:4: "weights" exceed the strength of those under them; "burden" is proportioned to the strength.
2. "So fulfil," or as other old manuscripts read, "so ye will fulfil," Greek, "fill up," "thoroughly fulfil."
3. "The law of Christ," namely, "love" (Galatians 5:14). Since ye desire "the law," then fulfil the law of Christ, which is not made up of various minute observances, but whose sole "burden" is "love."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Bear with each other; help each other in the divine life."
2. "We should aid each other in regard to these [temptations and besetting sins], and help one another to overcome them."
3. "Christians, conscious of their infirmities, have a right to the sympathy and the prayers of their brethren."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The emphasis is on one another's, in contrast with the selfishness which leaves others to take care of themselves."
2. "The primary reference in burdens is to moral infirmities and errors, and the sorrow and shame and remorse which they awaken in the offender."
3. "The verb denotes, not the filling up of a perfect vacancy, as the simple plhroun, but the supplying of what is lacking to fulness; the filling up of a partial void."

### John Calvin:
1. "The weaknesses or sins, under which we groan, are called burdens... He enjoins us to bear the burdens. We must not indulge or overlook the sins by which our brethren are pressed down, but relieve them, — which can only be done by mild and friendly correction."
2. "There are many adulterers and thieves, many wicked and abandoned characters of every description, who would willingly make Christ an accomplice in their crimes. All would choose to lay upon believers the task of bearing their burdens."
3. "He who has not this has nothing. On the other hand, he tells us, that, when every one compassionately assists his neighbor, the law of Christ is fulfilled; by which he intimates that every thing which does not proceed from love is superfluous."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Sin and error should be resisted and rebuked in a spirit of charity and meekness; but with all our faults we ought to esteem and love one another as brethren in Christ." 
2. "And thus ye shall (completely) fulfil the law of Christ, namely, the law of love." 
3. "The E. V. is based on another reading which expresses the imperative, instead of the future. The authorities are almost equally divided."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Bear ye one another's burdens" - This verse emphasizes the importance of supporting and helping each other in times of difficulty and struggle. It calls for a willingness to carry the weight of others' burdens, just as Jesus carried His own cross. (Quote 1)

2. "Keep on bearing" - The present active imperative form of the verb used here suggests that this act of bearing one another's burdens is an ongoing and continuous responsibility. It is not a one-time action, but a consistent practice of offering assistance and support. (Quote 2)

3. "Fulfil" - This imperative form of the verb urges believers to not only bear the burdens of others but also to fully complete the act of helping and supporting them. It implies a sense of commitment and dedication to providing the necessary assistance until the burden is relieved. (Quote 3)

### John Gill:
1. "Christ is only able to bear these burdens, so as to remove them and take them away, which he has done by his blood, sacrifice, and satisfaction."
2. "Saints bear one another's burdens... by gently reproving them, by comforting them when overpressed with guilt, by sympathizing with them in their sorrow, by praying to God for to manifest his pardoning grace to them, and by forgiving them themselves."
3. "This is a law or doctrine which Christ has clearly taught, and recovered from the false glosses of the Pharisees; it is his new commandment, which he has strengthened and enforced by his own example in dying for his people."

### John Wesley:
1. "Bear ye one another's burdens" - Sympathize with, and assist, each other, in all your weaknesses, grievances, trials.
2. "And so fulfil the law of Christ" - The law of Christ is the law of love: this our Lord peculiarly recommends; this he makes the distinguishing mark of his disciples.
3. "The law of Christ is the law of love" - It is through bearing one another's burdens and showing love to one another that we fulfill the law of Christ.
