## BHT:
In this verse, the commentators emphasize the importance of self-reflection and introspection. They urge individuals to focus on their own actions and character rather than comparing themselves to others. True joy and fulfillment come from living a righteous life and aligning with God's will, not from seeking validation through the superiority of our achievements. This verse calls us to examine our hearts, to find glory and contentment within ourselves, and to value the testimony of a good conscience over worldly comparisons.
