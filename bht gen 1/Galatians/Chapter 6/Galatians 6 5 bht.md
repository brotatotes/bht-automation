2. "Self-examination will make a man feel he has enough to do with 'his own load' of sin, without comparing himself boastfully with his neighbor."
3. "Instead of 'thinking himself to be something,' he shall feel the 'load' of his own sin: and this will lead him to bear sympathetically with his neighbor's burden of infirmity."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Every man shall have his proper reward. If he is a virtuous man, he will be happy; if a vicious man, he will be miserable."

3. "Let a man feel that he is soon to stand at the judgment-seat, and it will do much to keep him from an improper estimate of his own importance; let him feel that he must give an account to God, and that his great interests are to be determined by the estimate which God will affix to his character, and it will teach him that the opinion of the world is of little value."
