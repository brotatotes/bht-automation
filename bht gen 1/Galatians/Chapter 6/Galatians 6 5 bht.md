# Galatians 6:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, every person is urged to bear their own burdens and to take responsibility for their own actions. It emphasizes the importance of self-examination and the recognition of our individual shortcomings. It reminds us that we should not compare ourselves boastfully to others or judge them, but rather focus on our own personal growth and relationship with God. Ultimately, we will all face the judgment of God where we will be held accountable for our own lives and actions, without the ability to rely on others or compare ourselves to them.

1. "Each man shall bear his own 'burden,' or rather, 'load' (namely, of sin and infirmity), the Greek being different from that in Galatians 6:2. This verse does not contradict Galatians 6:2.

2. "Instead of 'thinking himself to be something,' he shall feel the 'load' of his own sin: and this will lead him to bear sympathetically with his neighbor's burden of infirmity."

3. "ÆSOP says a man carries two bags over his shoulder, the one with his own sins hanging behind, that with his neighbor's sins in front."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Every man shall have his proper reward. If he is a virtuous man, he will be happy; if a vicious man, he will be miserable."
2. "If a virtuous man, he will have the source of happiness in himself; if a sinner, he must bear the proper penalty of his sin."
3. "Let a man feel that he is soon to stand at the judgment-seat, and it will do much to keep him from an improper estimate of his own importance."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "No one will have occasion to claim moral superiority to his neighbor, for each man's self-examination will reveal infirmities enough of his own." 
2. "His own burdens will absorb his whole attention, and will leave him no time to compare himself with others." 
3. "Originally barh emphasizes the weight of the burden, fortion simply notes the fact that it is something to be born, which may be either light or heavy."
