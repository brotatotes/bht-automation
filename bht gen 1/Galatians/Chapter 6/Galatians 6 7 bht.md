# Galatians 6:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, it is emphasized that God cannot be deceived or mocked by human actions. There are people who attempt to belittle or undermine God's authority, but they will not escape unpunished. Those who think they can sow one thing and reap another are mistaken in their understanding of cause and effect. God's judgment is based on works, and there are consequences for both good and evil actions.
