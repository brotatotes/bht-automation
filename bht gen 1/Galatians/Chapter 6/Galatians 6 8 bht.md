## BHT:
"He who indulges in selfish desires and worldly pursuits will ultimately reap corruption and destruction, while those who invest in spiritual growth, obey God, and pursue righteousness will reap the reward of eternal life.

By following the guidance of the Holy Spirit in all aspects of life, one can experience a transformative and fruitful existence."

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "He that soweth unto his own flesh," with a view to fulfilling its desires. He does not say, "His spirit," as he does say, "His flesh." For in ourselves we are not spiritual, but carnal. The flesh is devoted to selfishness.
2. The use of the term "corruption" instead, implies that destruction is not an arbitrary punishment of fleshly-mindedness, but is its natural fruit; the corrupt flesh producing corruption, which is another word for destruction: corruption is the fault, and corruption the punishment.
3. Men cannot mock God because they can deceive themselves. They who sow tares cannot reap wheat. They alone reap life eternal who sow to the Spirit.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He who makes use of his property to give indulgence to licentiousness, intemperance, and vanity."
2. "The punishment of licentiousness and intemperance in this life is commonly loathsome and offensive disease."
3. "But if the punishment does not follow in this life, it will be sure to overtake the sensualist in the world to come."
4. "Everything in hell is debased and corrupt; and the whole harvest of sensuality in this world and the world to come, is degradation and defilement."
5. "He who follows the leadings and cultivates the affections which the Holy Spirit would produce."
6. "Shall of the Spirit - As the result of following the leadings of the Spirit."
7. "Reap life everlasting."
