# Hebrews 1:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Bible verse being described is a revelation of God's truth that stands in contrast to the imperfect and fragmented revelations of the past. It is a progressive revelation that unfolded throughout different periods and to various individuals. This final and complete revelation comes from God Himself, who speaks to us directly through His Son, Jesus Christ. The Son is seen as the perfect reflection of God's nature and the culmination of God's communication to humanity.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "This revelation in portions, by fragments, in and by various persons, was necessarily an imperfect revelation, to which the one final manifestation in and by One Person is properly and logically opposed." 
2. "The days of the Messiah were regarded as a period of transition from the former to the latter, His appearance, as the ushering in of the termination of αἱ ἡμέραι αὗται, the beginning of the end, and His second coming in glory as the συντέλεια τῶν ἡμερῶν τούτων or τοῦ αἰῶνος (τούτου)." 
3. "We may say, that Jesus is ‘the Son of God:’ by this is definitely enough expressed the fact, and the distinction from other sons of God implied: but we may also say that He is ‘Son of God:’ and we thus give the predicate all fulness of meaning and prominence, and even more emphatically and definitely express the exclusive character of His Sonship."

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "All was not revealed to each one prophet; but one received one portion of revelation, and another another."
2. "The Old Testament revelations were fragmentary in substance, and manifold in form; the very multitude of prophets shows that they prophesied only in part."
3. "The Son is the last and highest manifestation of God; not merely a measure, as in the prophets, but the fulness of the Spirit of God dwelling in Him bodily."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He was not an infidel. He was not disposed to call in question the divine origin of the books which were regarded as given by inspiration. He fully admitted all that had been held by the Hebrews on that heart, and yet showed that the new revelation had more important claims to their attention."

2. "The contrast here is between the numerous separate parts of the revelation given by the prophets, and the oneness of that given by his Son."

3. "In contradistinction from these, God had now spoken by his Son. He had addressed us in one uniform manner. It was not by dreams, or visions; it was a direct communication from him."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The truth as a whole never comes to light in the O. T. It appears fragmentarily, in successive acts, as the periods of the Patriarchs, Moses, the Kingdom, etc."
2. "The revelation differed according to the faithfulness or unfaithfulness of the covenant - people."
3. "Fitly, therefore, did the apostle call the wisdom of God many - tinted, as showing its power to benefit us in many parts and in many ways."

### John Calvin:
1. "We ought not only reverently to receive it, but also to be satisfied with it alone."
2. "The Son of God is set in opposition to the prophets."
3. "He still sets before us but one God, that no one might think that the Law militates against the Gospel."

### John Gill:
1. "The author of this revelation is God, not essentially, but personally considered, even God the Father, as distinguished from his Son in the next verse; for the revelation under the Old Testament is divine, as well as that under the New." 
2. "This revelation was made at several times, at different seasons, and to different persons; and consisted of a variety of things relating to doctrine and worship, and concerning the Messiah, his person and office." 
3. "The apostle suggests, by this way of speaking, that it was a long time since God spake to this people; for prophecy had ceased ever since the times of Malachi, for the space of three hundred years."

### John Wesley:
1. "Both these are opposed to the one entire and perfect revelation which he has made to us by Jesus Christ."
2. "The very number of the prophets showed that they prophesied only 'in part.'"
3. "The Son spake by the apostles. The majesty of the Son of God is proposed, 1. Absolutely, by the very name of Son, verse 1, and by three glorious predicates."
