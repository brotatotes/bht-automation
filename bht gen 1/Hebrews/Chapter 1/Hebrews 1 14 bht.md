## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The idea of 'angels of service' or 'of the ministry,' is familiar to the Rabbis."
2. "The διακονία is not a waiting upon men, but a fulfilment of their office as διάκονοι of God."
3. "Those spoken of are the elect of God, they who love Him, and for whom all things work together for good, even the principalities and powers in heavenly places."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "They are incorporeal spirits, as God is, but ministering to Him as inferiors."
2. "Angels are sent forth on ministrations to God and Christ, not primarily to men, though for the good of 'those who are about to inherit salvation.'"
3. "So the superiority of the Son of God to angels is shown. They 'all,' however various their ranks, 'minister'; He is ministered to. They 'stand' before God, or are 'sent forth' to execute the divine commands on behalf of them whom He pleases to save; He 'sits on the right hand of the Majesty on high.' He rules; they serve."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The main point here is, that the angels are employed in a much more humble capacity than the Son of God; and, therefore, that he sustains a far more elevated rank."
2. "Why may not the angels be employed in this service? They are pure, benevolent, powerful; and as man was ruined in the fall by the temptation offered by one of an angelic, though fallen nature, why should not others of angelic, unfallen holiness come to assist in repairing the evils which their fallen, guilty brethren have inflicted on the race?"
3. "Assuredly, if anywhere heavenly aid is needed, it is when the spirit leaves the body. If anywhere a guide is needed, it is when the ransomed soul goes up the unknown path to God. And if angels are employed on any messages of mercy to mankind, it is proper that it should be when life is closing, and the spirit is about to ascend to heaven."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Ministering spirits [λειτουργικα πνευματα]. Summing up the function of the angels as compared with Christ." 
2. "Christ's is the highest dignity. He is co-ruler with God." 
3. "The angels are servants appointed for service to God for the sake of [δια] the heirs of redemption."

### John Calvin:
1. "The service which God allots to angels is indeed honorable; but the very fact that they serve, shows that they are far inferior to Christ, who is the Lord of all." 
2. "The faithful receive no small consolation; for they hear that celestial hosts are assigned to them as ministers, in order to secure their salvation." 
3. "Well then has God provided for our infirmities by giving us such assistants to oppose Satan, and to put forth their power in every way to defend us!"

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The play upon the words ‘ministering spirits sent forth to minister’ is not in the Greek. The original is simply ‘ministering spirits continually sent forth on (or for) service.’" 
2. "The word here rendered ‘ministering’ is used in N. T. to express the temple service; and the word rendered ‘ministry’ or service is a form of the word that expresses deaconship or subordinate service generally."
3. "The worship and the work of angels is carried on in the great temple of nature and grace, and their service originates in the needs and claims of those who are soon to possess complete salvation."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "The word is made from λειτουργια (Luke 1:23; Hebrews 8:6; Hebrews 9:21)."
2. "Sent forth (αποστελλομενα). Present passive participle of αποστελλω, sent forth repeatedly, from time to time as occasion requires."

3. "They are sent forth by Christ, the Lord and Creator of them, who therefore must be superior to them."
