# Hebrews 1:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, we see the culmination of God's promise to the seed of Abraham and the inheritance of the world. The Sonship of our Lord is emphasized as the reason for His appointment as the heir of all things. Through Christ, God made the universe, both in its primordial conditions and in all material objects and events. This Gospel revelation, made in the last days, is the superior and final revelation that God has given to humanity. Though spoken to us in these last days, the glory of the Son reaches from everlasting to everlasting.
