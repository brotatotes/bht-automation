## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The Son of God now becomes Himself the subject...expressing as it does the purification of mankind from sin, wrought by the incarnate Son of God, as one individual historical event, as the antecedent of that exaltation of Him to the right hand of God, which the main sentence enounces." 
2. "The 'verbum finitum' belonging to the relative ὅς is not found till ἐκάθισεν at the end of the verse. But the intermediate participial clauses do not stand in the same relation to the main sentence."
3. "The Son of God is, in this his essential majesty, the expression, and the sole expression, of the divine Light, not, as in his Incarnation, its reflexion."

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Who is so senseless as to doubt concerning the eternal being of the Son? For when has one seen light without effulgence?" [ATHANASIUS, Against Arius, Orations, 2].
2. "The Sun of God in glory beams, Too bright for us to scan; But we can face the light that streams For the mild Son of man." (2 Corinthians 3:18)
3. "Sin was the great uncleanness in God's sight, of which He has effected the purgation by His sacrifice [ALFORD]. Our nature, as guilt-laden, could not, without our great High Priest's blood of atonement sprinkling the heavenly mercy seat, come into immediate contact with God."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He was the embodied representation of the Deity. He was pure - like God. He was benevolent - like God. He spake to the winds and storms - like God. He healed diseases - like God. He raised the dead - like God. He wielded the power which God only can wield, and he manifested a character in all respects like what we should suppose God would evince if he appeared in human flesh, and dwelt among people and this is saying much."
2. "There are not two Gods - as there are not two suns when the sun shines. It is the one God, in a mysterious and incomprehensible manner shining into the world in the face of Jesus Christ."
3. "He upholds or sustains all things - that is, the universe. It is not merely the earth; not only its rocks, mountains, seas, animals and human beings, but it is the universe - all distant worlds. How can he do this who is not God? He does it by his word - his command."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The Son is the outraying of the divine glory, exhibiting in himself the glory and majesty of the divine Being."
2. "The Son bears the exact impress of the divine nature and character."
3. "In his exalted state, he will still be bearing on all things toward their consummation, still dealing with sin as the great high priest in the heavenly sanctuary."

### John Calvin:
1. "We must allow that there is a degree of impropriety in the language when what is borrowed from created things is transferred to the hidden majesty of God. But still the things which are indent to our senses are fitly applied to God, and for this end, that we may know what is to be found in Christ, and what benefits he brings to us."
2. "When, therefore, thou hear that the Son is the brightness of the Father’s glory, think thus with thyself, that the glory of the Father is invisible until it shines forth in Christ, and that he is called the impress of his substance, because the majesty of the Father is hidden until it shows itself impressed as it were on his image."
3. "He shows besides a difference between him and the Levitical priests; for they also were said to expiate sins, but they derived this power from another. In short, he intended to exclude all other means or helps by stating that the price and the power of purgation were found only in Christ."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The brightness, the effulgence of the divine glory, with allusion probably to the visible glory of the Shekinah over the mercy-seat, though the meaning is deeper." 
2. "The express image, the impress or stamp wherein and whereby the divine essence is made manifest: and all this He is in His own nature, so the Greek implies." 
3. "And bearing, upholding and directing all things by the word, the fiat of His power, when he had made purification of sins, sat down, etc."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "The writer is using metaphors which had already been applied to Wisdom and the Logos" (Moffatt).
2. "The meaning 'effulgence' suits the context better, though it gives the idea of eternal generation of the Son" (John 1:1).

3. "Christ upholds all creatures he has made, preserves every creature in its being, and supports it, and supplies it with the necessaries of life; rules and governs all, and providentially orders and disposes of all things in the world, and that by his all-powerful will."

### John Wesley:
