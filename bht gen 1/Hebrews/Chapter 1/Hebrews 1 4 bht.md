# Hebrews 1:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we discover that Jesus, through His incarnation and exaltation, surpasses the angels in greatness. His divine nature was temporarily veiled during His time on earth, but He obtained the name "Son" and all its glory through His obedience and suffering. The comparison with angels not only highlights His superiority but also establishes His preeminence over the entire created order. This exaltation signifies the surpassing excellence of the Gospel over the Old Testament economy, which was mediated by angels.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The Scriptures teach us, that He who was with God before the creation, from love to men put on flesh, and took the form of a servant, not all the while having on Him the whole fulness of his divine nature and divine glory, but having really and actually emptied himself of this fulness and glory, so that there was not only a hiding, but an absolute κένωσις, a putting off, of it."
2. "The whole O. T. dispensation is related to the N. T. dispensation, as the angels to the Son. In the former, mankind, and Israel also, stands separated from God by sin; and angels, divine messengers (cf. “the angel of the covenant”), stand as mediators between man and God."
3. "The argument of the Writer necessarily then leads him to shew how both Mediators, the angel of the O. T. covenant, and Moses, found their higher unity in Christ."

### John Wesley:
1. "Being — By his exaltation, after he had been lower than them." 
2. "So much higher than the angels — It was extremely proper to observe this, because the Jews gloried in their law, as it was delivered by the ministration of angels. How much more may we glory in the gospel, which was given, not by the ministry of angels, but of the very Son of God!"
3. "His inheriting that name is more ancient than all worlds; his inheriting all things, as ancient as all things."
