## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The Psalm belongs to the reign of David...regarded as a type and foretaste of the ultimate ideal dominion of the ‘Son of David’ over the kings of the earth."
2. "The words must...be taken...to the neglect and almost the obliteration of their supposed lower reference."
3. "The eternal generation of the Son of God...is to be taken only declaratively, and that declaration to be made in His resurrection, and exaltation over all, that ensued thereon."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Christ has a fourfold right to the title 'Son of God'; (1) By generation, as begotten of God; (2) By commission, as sent by God; (3) By resurrection, as 'the first-begotten of the dead'; (4) By actual possession, as heir of all." 
2. "The triumph of David over Hadadezer and neighboring kings is a type of God's ultimately subduing all enemies under His Son, whom He sets on His 'holy hill of Zion,' as King of the Jews and of the whole earth."
3. "He had been always Son, but now first was manifested as such in His once humbled, now exalted manhood united to His Godhead."


### Albert Barnes:
1. "The name 'sons of God,' is applied in the Scriptures to saints, and may have been given to the angels. But the argument here is, that the name, my 'Son' has never been given to any one of them particularly and by eminence."
2. "The sense is, 'he is more than human.' He is more than angelic. He has been addressed and treated as a Son - which none of the angels have. They are regarded simply as ministering spirits."
3. "The promise, therefore, which is here made is, that God would be to him, in a special sense, a Father, and he should be a Son. It does not, as I suppose, pertain originally exclusively to the Messiah, but included him as a descendant of David."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The writer proceeds to establish the superiority of the Son to the angels by O. T. testimony."
2. "The quotations present difficulty in that they appear, in great part, to be used in a sense and with an application different from those which they originally had."
3. "The Psalm is addressed as a congratulatory ode to a king of Judah, declaring his coming triumph over the surrounding nations, and calling on them to render homage to the God of Israel."

### John Calvin:
1. "But still the argument of the Apostle seems not to be well-grounded; for how does he maintain that Christ is superior to angels except on this ground, that he has the name of a Son? As though indeed he had not this in common with princes and those high in power... They are indeed everywhere called children or sons. Besides, David calls angels the sons of God... When it is said so exclusively of Christ, 'Thou art my Son,' it follows that this honor does not belong to any of the angels."
2. "It is hence evident that the argument derived from the term Son is well grounded."
3. "Solomon is here referred to, and though he was inferior to the angels, yet when God promised to be his Father, he was separated from the common rank of all others; for he was not to be to him a Father as to one of the princes, but as to one who was more eminent than all the rest... And further, we may easily gather from many passages in the Prophets, that that promise was never understood otherwise than of Christ; so that no one can evade by saying that this is a new comment."

2. "The foundation of which relation lies in the begetting of him; which refers not to his nature, either divine or human, but to his divine person."
