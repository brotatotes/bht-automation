## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:

2. "The phrase 'the firstborn' emphasizes Christ's preeminence and superiority over all creation."
3. "The angels are commanded to worship Christ, highlighting His divine nature and authority."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Not only this proves His superiority, BUT a more decisive proof is Psalms 97:7, which shows that not only at His resurrection, but also in prospect of His being brought into the world as man, in His incarnation, nativity, temptation, resurrection, and future second advent in glory, angels were designed by God to be subject to Him."
2. "The fullest realization of His Lordship shall be at His second coming."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The proper construction of this sentence probably is, 'But when, moreover, he brings in,' etc. The word 'again' refers not to the fact that the Son of God is brought 'again' into the world, implying that he had been introduced before; but it refers to the course of the apostle’s argument, or to the declaration which is made about the Messiah in another place."
2. "Christ is called the 'first-begotten,' with reference to his resurrection from the dead... As the first-born was the principal heir, and had special privileges, so the Lord Jesus Christ sustains a similar rank in the universe of which God is the Head and Father."
3. "The fair interpretation of the passage then would be, to refer it to 'angelic beings' - and the command in Psalms 97:1-12 is for them to do homage to the Being there referred to... The passage proves that the Son of God is divine."
