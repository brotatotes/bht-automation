This passage highlights the subordination of angels and exalts the divine greatness of the Son.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "He makes his messengers winds, i. e. He causes his messengers to act in or by means of the winds; his servants flames of fire, i. e. commissions them to assume the agency or form of flames for His purposes."
2. "Thy throne, O God (ὁ θεός is probably vocative), for ever and ever."
3. "Thou lovedst righteousness, and hatedst lawlessness, for this cause God, thy God, anointed thee with the oil of rejoicing beyond thy fellows."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "He maketh His angelic ministers the directing powers of winds and flames, when these latter are required to perform His will."
2. "English Version, 'maketh His angels spirits,' means, He maketh them of a subtle, incorporeal nature, swift as the wind."
3. "The translation, 'maketh winds His messengers, and a flame of fire His ministers (!),' is plainly wrong."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He gives to them an inferior name, and assigns to them a more humble office."
2. "The one serves him passively, as being wholly under his control; the other acts as a Sovereign, as Lord over all, and is addressed and regarded as the equal with God."
3. "The attending retinue of God, when he manifests himself with great power and glory, is like the winds and the lightning. His angels are like them. They are prompt to do his will - rapid, quick, obedient in his service; they are in all respects subordinate to him."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The thought is according to the rabbinical idea of the variableness of the angelic nature. Angels were supposed to live only as they ministered."
2. "The emphasis, therefore, is not on the fact that the angels are merely servants, but that their being is such that they are only what God makes them according to the needs of their service, and are, therefore, changeable, in contrast with the Son, who is ruler and unchangeable."
3. "There would be no pertinency in the statement that God makes his angels spirits, which goes without saying. The Rabbis conceived the angels as perishable."

### John Calvin:
1. "David compares winds to angels, because they perform offices in this world similar to what the angels do in heaven; for the winds are, as it were, visible spirits."
2. "As Moses, describing the creation of the world, mentioned only those things which are subject to our senses, and yet intended that higher things should be understood; so David in describing the world and nature, represented to us on a tablet what ought to be understood respecting the celestial orders."
3. "The meaning would be thus more apparent, — 'Who maketh like his angels the winds, and like his ministers the flaming fire,' that is, the winds are subject to him as the angels are, and also the flaming fire as his ministers or attendants."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "They are spirits, not sons; and His servants or ministers, a ‘flame of fire.’" 
2. "They do His will, as do the tempest and the lightning." 
3. "The angels are expressly called ‘ministering spirits’ a name that recalls both the names given in Hebrews 1:7, spirits and ministers."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The meaning apparently is one that can reduce angels to the elemental forces of wind and fire."
2. "Lunemann holds that the Hebrew here is wrongly rendered and means that God makes the wind his messengers (not angels) and flaming fire his servants."
3. "Preachers also are sometimes like a wind-storm or a fire."

### John Gill:
1. "They are 'spirits', created ones, and so differ from God the Creator: they are incorporeal ones, and so differ from men; they are immaterial, and so die not; they are spiritual substances subsisting in themselves." 
2. "These are the same with the angels, for they are ministers to God; they attend his presence; are ready to perform any service for him; they sing his praise, and are his chariots in which he rides."
3. "And they are as a flame of fire, so called from their great power, force, and swiftness; and from their burning love, and flaming zeal, hence named seraphim; and because they are sometimes the executioners of God's wrath, and will descend in flaming fire, when Christ shall be revealed from heaven."
