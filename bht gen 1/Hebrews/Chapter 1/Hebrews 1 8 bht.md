1. "O God" - This quotation is from Psalms 45:7, a Hebrew nuptial ode for a king treated here as Messianic. It is not certain whether "O God" is the vocative or nominative form, but either way, it makes good sense. 

2. "God is thy throne" - This phrase could be interpreted as the subject or predicate with "is" understood. It emphasizes the divine nature of the king's throne, highlighting the exalted position he holds. 

3. "Sceptre" - This word refers to an old term for a walking stick or staff. In this context, it signifies the authority and power wielded by the king. It adds to the imagery of the king's regal position and the respect he commands.
