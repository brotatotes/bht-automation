# Hebrews 10:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Bible verse being described is about the contrast between the law and the gospel. The commentators emphasize that the law, with its sacrifices and ceremonies, was a mere shadow or outline of the good things to come in the gospel. While the law repeatedly offered sacrifices, it testified to its inability to perfect and cleanse from sin. In contrast, the gospel brings forth the heavenly realities themselves and offers true fulfillment and salvation. The sacrifices of the law could never provide the perfect expiation of sin, in contrast to the sacrifice of Christ in the gospel.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The law, having a shadow of the good things to come, not the very image of the things." 
2. "The law had no such εἰκών constructed out of the heavenly realities themselves, 'ipsas res, certa sua forma et effigie præditas,' as Stier: it had merely σκιάν, merely a rough sketch or outline."
3. "The law, year by year, by the repetition of the same offerings, testified its inability to perfect, &c., viz. on the day of atonement, on which the same expiatory offerings were always repeated, being necessary, notwithstanding the many offerings brought throughout the year, and after which the same round of offerings again began anew."

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "The Gospel is the very setting forth by the Word and Spirit of the heavenly realities themselves, out of which it (the Gospel) is constructed."
2. "The law was a continual process of acted prophecy, proving the divine design that its counterparts should come; and proving the truth of those counterparts when they came."
3. "Good things in part made present by faith to the believer, and to be fully realized hereafter in actual and perfect enjoyment."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The whole of the Mosaic economy was a shadow... an imperfect representation; a dim outline of the blessings which the gospel would impart to people."
2. "Such a rude outline; such a mere sketch, or imperfect delineation, could no more answer the purpose of saving the soul than the rough sketch which an architect makes would answer the purpose of a house."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The legal system was a shadow. Skia is a rude outline, an adumbration, contrasted with eijkwn, the archetypal or ideal pattern."

3. "They can never at any time or anyhow with the same sacrifices year by year which they offer continually make perfect those who are ever drawing nigh to God."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "The contrast here between σκια (shadow, shade caused by interruption of light as by trees, Mark 4:32) and εικων (image or picture) is striking."
