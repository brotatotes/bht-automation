# Hebrews 10:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the commentators highlight the contrast between the imperfect Jewish high-priesthood and the perfect priesthood of our Lord. The Jewish high-priesthood, represented by many priests due to their mortality, offered numerous sacrifices that were incapable of stripping away guilt or taking away sins. In contrast, Jesus, as the High Priest, offered Himself as the one sufficient sacrifice, once for all. Through His sacrifice, He stands as the mediator and representative head, fulfilling His duties with humility, constant presence, and unwavering commitment to intercede on behalf of the people.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The High-priesthood of our Lord is to be compared with that of the Jewish legal high priests. On the one side is Jesus, alone in the glory of his office and virtue of his sacrifice; on the other is the Jewish high-priesthood, not one man but many, by reason of death; represented in all its acts, personal or delegated, by its holder for the time, by πᾶς ἀρχιερεύς, offering not one, but many sacrifices." 

2. "In treating of the Head of so compact a system as the Jewish priesthood it is clearly allowable, if any where, to bring in the principle, 'qui facit per alterum, facit per se.'"

3. "The sacrifice might bring sense of partial forgiveness: but it could never denude the offerer of sinfulness strip off and take away his guilt."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Though he did not in person stand 'daily' offering sacrifices, he did so by the subordinate priests of whom, as well as of all Israel, he was the representative head." 
2. "So 'daily' is applied to the high priests." 
3. "Legal sacrifices might, in part, produce the sense of forgiveness, yet scarcely even that; but entirely to strip off one's guilt they never could."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The object of the apostle is to prove that under the Jewish economy sacrifices were repeated constantly, showing their imperfection, but that under the Christian economy the great sacrifice had been offered once, which was sufficient for all."
2. "The same sacrifices were offered morning and evening every day."
3. "Which can never take away sins."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Standeth [εστηκεν] . Servile attitude, contrasted with that of the exalted Savior." 
2. "The wearisome round of daily offerings, always the same, contrasted with the one offering, once for all." 
3. "The verb literally means to strip off all round."

### John Calvin:
1. "The conclusion then is, that the ancient priesthood, which is inconsistent with this, has ceased; for all the saints find a full consecration in the one offering of Christ."
2. "By saying, them who are sanctified, he includes all the children of God; and he reminds us that the grace of sanctification is sought elsewhere in vain."
3. "If then our faith seeks Christ sitting on God’s right hand, and recumbs quietly on him as there sitting, we shall at length enjoy the fruit of his victory; yea, when our foes, Satan, sin, death, and the whole world are vanquished, and when corruption of our flesh is cast off, we shall triumph for ever together with our head."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Standeth (εστηκεν). Perfect active indicative of ιστημ (intransitive), vivid picture."
2. "Ministering and offering (λειτουργων κα προσφερων). Present active participles graphically describing the priest."
3. "Take away (περιελειν). Second aorist active infinitive of περιαιρεω, old verb to take from around, to remove utterly as in Acts 27:20."

### John Gill:
1. "The apostle passes from the anniversary sacrifices offered by the high priest on the day of atonement, having shown the insufficiency and imperfection of them, to the lambs of the daily sacrifice, which were offered morning and evening, and whatsoever else might be daily offered on other accounts; and which he also shows are equally ineffectual to take away sin."
2. "Almost every word he uses shows the imperfection of the priesthood of Aaron, and serves to illustrate the priesthood of Christ."
3. "And offering oftentimes the same sacrifices; as a lamb in the morning, and another at evening; and if it was a burnt offering, or a sin offering, or an offering for the purification of a woman, or for the cleansing of the leper, they were always the same: and this frequent offering, and the offering of the same things, show that they were such which can never take away sins."

### John Wesley:
1. "The image of a priest standing conveys the idea of a servant who is ready and available to fulfill his duties. It emphasizes the humility and readiness of the priest to serve."

2. "The act of standing also symbolizes the priest's constant presence and accessibility to the people. It signifies his role as a mediator between God and humanity, always ready to intercede and offer sacrifices on behalf of the people."

3. "By standing, the priest demonstrates his commitment and dedication to his role. It shows his willingness to bear the responsibility of representing the people before God and carrying out the rituals and ceremonies of worship."
