# Hebrews 10:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse being described highlights the concept of God's promise of non-remembrance of sin as a crucial aspect of the new covenant. It emphasizes the abolishment of legal sacrifices and the sufficiency of a single sacrifice for the forgiveness of sins. The citation serves to prove that there is no need for further sacrifices to atone for sins, establishing the integral role of the prophecy in the introduction of the new and spiritual covenant.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The reason for this, alleged by the later Commentators, is, the harshness of understanding ὕστερον λέγει, or the like, inserted in some unimportant mss. at the beginning of Hebrews 10:17, as inconsistent with the concinnity of our Writer’s style."
2. "But still more cogent reasons for making the apodosis begin at Heb 10:17 are, 1. that there the εἰρημένον ends, not at λέγει κύριος: there a hiatus in the citation occurs, and the Writer first passes on to that which is said after: 2. that Heb 10:17 itself carries the whole burden of the citation with it."
3. "This is the object of the citation, to prove that there needs no more sacrifice for sins. And the previous portion of it is adduced to shew that this, τῶν ἁμαρτ. αὐτ. κ. τῶν ἀνομ. αὐτ. οὐ μὴ μνησθήσομαι ἔτι, does form an integral part of the prophecy of the introduction of the new and spiritual covenant."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Here again the writer adds 'their iniquities' to 'sins' of Hebrews 8:12." 
2. "It is uncertain also whether the writer means verse Hebrews 10:17 to be the principal clause with Hebrews 10:15; Hebrews 10:16 as subordinate or the whole quotation to be subordinate to μετα το ειρηκενα of verse Hebrews 10:15." 
3. "At any rate verse Hebrews 10:17 in the quotation does not follow immediately after verse Hebrews 10:16 as one can see in Hebrews 8:10-12."

### John Gill:
1. "The principal thing for which they are cited here, is to observe God's promise of non-remembrance of sin; which is no other than remission of sin."
2. "This new covenant has taken place, legal sacrifices must be abolished."
3. "These words, 'then he said', which seem necessary to answer to the last clause of Hebrews 10:15."
