# Hebrews 10:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Believers are granted the privilege to boldly enter into the holiest, a symbol of the divine realm, through the blood of Jesus. With this boldness, they can approach God with confidence and assurance, for the earthly intermediaries have been replaced by Christ, the only mediating Priest. The access to heaven, which was unattainable under the Law, is now open to believers through their faith in Christ's sacrifice. It is crucial for believers to recognize this freedom and not neglect the opportunity to draw near to God.
