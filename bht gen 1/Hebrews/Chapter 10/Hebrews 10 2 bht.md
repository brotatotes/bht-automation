# Hebrews 10:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The commentators collectively bring to light the insufficiency of the sacrifices under the law to fully cleanse worshippers from sin. The offerings were repeated repeatedly, indicating their temporary nature and symbolic value. If these sacrifices were truly effective, there would be no need for continuous offerings, and the worshippers would no longer have a consciousness of sin. The verse raises the question of why sacrifices would continue if they were able to completely purify, pointing towards the need for a more perfect and permanent solution to the guilt and power of sin.
