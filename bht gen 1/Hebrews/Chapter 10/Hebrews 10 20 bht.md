The Bible verse being described is about a new and living way opened by Jesus for believers to approach God freely and intimately. Through His incarnation and sacrifice, Christ inaugurated a way that is fresh, vital, and always accessible. His flesh acted as a veil, but His body became the temple, leading us to enjoy the blessings of God. This new way surpasses the old way of the law, providing constant access to God's presence and glory.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "None before Him trod this way: no believer under the O. T. dared or could, though under a dispensation of preparatory grace, approach God so freely and openly, so fearlessly and joyfully, so closely and intimately, as we now, who come to the Father by the blood of Jesus, His Son." 
2. "This entrance is a real, living and working entrance; the animated substance of what is imported, not the dead shadow."
3. "The Flesh of Christ is here spoken of as the veil hung before the holiest place; that weak human mortal flesh was the state through which He had to pass before He could enter the holiest in heaven for us."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "which (entering) He has consecrated...as a new and living way" - The way to God that Jesus opened is not a lifeless way through the law, but a real, vital, and perpetually effective way because Jesus Himself is the living and life-giving Savior.
2. "Christ's ascension is our promotion; and whither the glory of the Head hath preceded, thither the hope of the body, too, is called" - Just as Christ ascended to glory, our hope as believers is also to be called to that same glory.
3. "His weak suffering flesh was the veil; His body was the temple" - The flesh of Christ, which veiled His divinity, had to be passed through in order for Him to enter the heavenly holiest place for us. His body, on the other hand, was the temple.

### Albert Barnes:

2. "The way by Christ was, however, always open. His blood was, as it were, always warm, and as if it had been recently shed."
3. "The idea is, that there is by means both of the veil of the temple, and of the body of Jesus, a medium of access to God."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Having boldness for the entrance which he has inaugurated (or opened) for us - a way new and living."
2. "The contrast is not between a new and an old way, but between a new way and no way."

### John Gill:
1. "Christ is a 'new' way, not in terms of invention or use, but in contrast to the old way of life by the covenant of works. It is always new, never old, and there will never be another way." 

2. "Christ is a 'living' way, in opposition to the dead carcasses of slain beasts and the killing letter of the law. He gives life to all who walk in Him, and none in this way ever die."

3. "The human nature of Christ, compared to the vail of the tabernacle, signifies the holiness, strength, and purity of His human nature. The colors of the vail represent the sufferings of Christ's human nature, the preciousness of His blood, and the dignity of His person and royalty."

### John Wesley:
1. "By a living way — The way of faith, whereby we live indeed."
2. "Which he hath consecrated — Prepared, dedicated, and established for us."
3. "Through the veil, that is, his flesh — As by rending the veil in the temple, the holy of holies became visible and accessible; so by wounding the body of Christ, the God of heaven was manifested, and the way to heaven opened."
