# Hebrews 10:27 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This verse describes a terrifying and inescapable judgment awaiting those who have knowingly turned away from their faith. The imagery of fire symbolizes the wrath of God and the fierce punishment that awaits the apostates. This fiery indignation represents the ultimate consequence for those who have rejected grace and chosen to stand against Christ. The anticipation of this judgment instills a deep sense of fear and apprehension, as the ungodly face the torment of an evil conscience and the burning dread of divine wrath.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The indefiniteness makes the declaration more awful) fearful (objective, ‘tremendus,’ not ‘timidus,’ surchtbar, not surchtsam: fearful to think of, frightful."
2. "The fire of God’s presence, identified with Himself, exactly as in ch. Hebrews 12:29, ὁ θεὸς ἡμῶν πῦρ καταναλίσκον: and it is the zeal, the fervour, the excandescence of this consuming fire, which awaits the apostate from Christ."
3. "The same expression is found in Il. ψ. 182, τοὺς ἅμα σοι πάντας πῦρ ἐσθίει) the adversaries (some have supposed the sense of secret enemies to be conveyed by ὑπεναντίους. But as Bl. remarks, the word is good Greek, and is constantly found, without any such further sense, representing merely an enemy."

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "The indefiniteness, as of something peculiar of its kind, makes the description the more terrible."
2. "The transition is easy from 'giving a reception to' something or someone, to 'looking for.'"
3. "Fire is personified: glow or ardor of fire, that is, of Him who is 'a consuming fire.'"

### Albert Barnes:

2. "The 'fearful apprehension' or expectation here does not refer so much to what would be in the mind itself, or what would be experienced, as to what must follow."

1. "The only thing left is a fearful award, an awful reservation, of judgment and fiery indignation."
