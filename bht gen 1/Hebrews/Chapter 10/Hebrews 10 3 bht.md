# Hebrews 10:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the sacrifices in the Old Testament are depicted as a constant reminder of sins, preventing the conscience from being free from guilt. They were an acknowledgment of guilt and a means of temporary atonement for sins year after year. However, these sacrifices were insufficient to fully cleanse the conscience and bring lasting forgiveness. The sacrifices served as reminders of the ongoing need for repentance and the insufficiency of human efforts to obtain true absolution.
