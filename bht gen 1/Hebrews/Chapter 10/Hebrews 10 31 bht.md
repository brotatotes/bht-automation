# Hebrews 10:31 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
To fall into the hands of the living God is both a fearful and blessed prospect. For the faithful, it signifies a trust in God's love and protection, while for the unfaithful, it evokes the dread of divine judgment. God's hands represent His power, whether in love or wrath, and falling into His hands carries weight because He is the living God, capable of eternal punishment. It is a reminder of the consequences of rejecting God's mercy and despising His salvation, as well as a call to accountability and a warning against wrongdoing.
