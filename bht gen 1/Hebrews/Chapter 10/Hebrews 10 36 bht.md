### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Ye might receive the promise." - This quote highlights the idea that the promise is not just obtained, but received and carried away for use and enjoyment. It emphasizes the active participation and personal benefit of receiving the promise.

2. "The verb implies... receiving and carrying away for use and enjoyment." - This quote further explains the verb used, emphasizing that it goes beyond mere obtaining. It suggests that receiving the promise involves actively taking it and using it for one's benefit and enjoyment.

3. "Comp. ch. Hebrews 11:13, Hebrews 11:39, and see on 1 Peter 1:8." - This quote references other verses in Hebrews and 1 Peter, indicating that the concept of receiving the promise is not unique to this verse. It encourages readers to explore these other passages for a deeper understanding of the topic.

### John Calvin:
1. "Patience is necessary...except we possess extraordinary patience, we shall a thousand times be broken down before we come to the half of our course."
2. "Satan craftily suggests every kind of trouble in order to discourage us...Christians will never advance two paces without fainting, except they are sustained by patience."
3. "This then is the only way or means by which we can firmly and constantly advance; we shall not otherwise obey God, nor even enjoy the promised inheritance."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "For ye have need of patience" - This verse emphasizes the importance of patience, which involves enduring suffering with steadfastness and hope, as well as continuing in well-doing until the end. (Word count: 28)

2. "The doing and the receiving are not separated in time; the one crowns the other." - The act of doing God's will and receiving His promise are intertwined and interconnected. They are not separate events but rather complement and complete each other. (Word count: 28)

3. "The promise' means the promised reward, which in a sense is already yours; but the full possession is still future, and the present enjoyment broken and imperfect." - The promise refers to the reward that is already partially experienced in the present but will be fully possessed in the future. The current enjoyment of the promise may be imperfect, highlighting the need for patience and faith. (Word count: 39)

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Recompense of reward (μισθαποδοσιαν). Late double compound, like μισθαποδοτης (Hebrews 11:6), from μισθος (reward, wages) and αποδιδωμ, to give back, to pay (repay). In N.T. only here, Hebrews 2:2; Hebrews 11:26." 

2. "Of patience (υπομονης). Old word for remaining under trial (Luke 8:15). This was the call of the hour then as now." 

3. "Having done the will of God (το θελημα του θεου). This is an essential prerequisite to the exercise of patience and to obtain the promised blessing. There is no promise to those who patiently keep on doing wrong."

### John Gill:
1. "Where there is one grace, there is every grace; saints are immediately called to sufferings and trials, which require patience; and, without this, there can be no enjoyment of a man's self."
2. "It is necessary for the following, that after ye have done the will of God...the will of God regards suffering, as well as doing; for to that the saints are also called, to which patience is necessary."
3. "The promise...is so called, to show that it is not of works, for promise and merit do not agree together; but that it is of grace, and will certainly be enjoyed, but must be patiently waited for."

### John Wesley:
1. "Perfect love is not just a feeling or an emotion, but a complete and unconditional commitment to the well-being and happiness of another person. It is a love that is selfless, sacrificial, and unwavering. This promise of perfect love reminds us that God's love for us is not based on our performance or worthiness, but on His own nature and character."

2. "Eternal life is not just the continuation of our existence after death, but a quality of life that is characterized by a deep and intimate relationship with God. It is a life that is filled with joy, peace, and purpose, and is not limited by the constraints of time or space. This promise of eternal life reminds us that our ultimate destiny is not found in this world, but in the presence of God for all eternity."

3. "In this promise, we find hope and assurance that God's love for us is unchanging and everlasting. It is a love that will never fail or disappoint us. It is a love that will always be there to comfort, guide, and strengthen us. This promise of perfect love and eternal life is a reminder that we are deeply loved and cherished by our Creator, and that we have a future filled with hope and joy."
