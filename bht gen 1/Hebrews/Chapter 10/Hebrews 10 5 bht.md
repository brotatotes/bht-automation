## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The more any son of man approaches, in position, or office, or individual spiritual experience, the incarnate Son of God, the more directly may his holy breathings in the power of Christ’s Spirit be taken as the utterances of Christ Himself."
2. "To refer these words thus to his maturing purpose, seems far better than to understand them as Erasmus, 'veluti mundum ingressurus,' from the O. T. point of time."
3. "The difficulty is, how such a clause can be rendered by σῶμα κατηρτίσω μοι, as it is in the LXX."

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Christ's voluntary self-offering, in contrast to those inefficient sacrifices, is shown to fulfill perfectly 'the will of God' as to our redemption, by completely atoning 'for (our) sins.'"

2. "Christ's assuming a human body, in obedience to the Father's will, in order to die the death of a slave, was virtually the same act of voluntary submission to service as that of a slave suffering his ear to be bored by his master."

3. "The preparing, or fitting of a body for Him, is not with a view to His mere incarnation, but to His expiatory sacrifice, as the contrast to 'sacrifice and offering' requires."

These quotes highlight the significance of Christ's voluntary sacrifice and the purpose of His incarnation in fulfilling God's will for our redemption.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Nothing could be more opposite to the prevailing Jewish opinions about the efficacy of sacrifice, than what he had just said. It was, therefore, of the highest importance to defend the position which he had laid down by authority which they would not presume to call in question."
2. "The apostle was writing to those who had been Jews, and whom he was desirous to convince of the truth of what he was alleging in regard to the nature of the Hebrew sacrifices. For this purpose it was necessary to appeal to the Scriptures of the Old Testament, but it cannot be supposed that he would adduce a passage for proof whose relevancy would not be admitted."
3. "The sentiment here expressed occurs more than once in the Old Testament. Thus, 1 Samuel 15:22. 'Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of rams,' Hosea 6:6, 'For I desired mercy and not sacrifice; and the knowledge of God more than burnt-offerings;'"

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Deliverance from sin is not obtained by animal sacrifices, but by fulfilling God's will."
2. "The obedience to the divine will... consists in Christ's offering once for all."
3. "Christ did not yield to God's will as authoritative constraint. The constraint lay in his own eternal spirit."

### John Calvin:
1. "The whole of what is said, no doubt, rightly accords with David; but as it is well known that David was a type of Christ, there is nothing unreasonable in transferring to Christ what David declared respecting himself."
2. "The Prophets, then, rejected sacrifices, not as they were instituted by God, but as they were vitiated by wicked men, and profaned through unclean consciences."
3. "We must, then, necessarily come to the kingdom of Christ, in order that the truth of God’s unwillingness to receive sacrifice may fully appear."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "The writer of Hebrews argues that the Son's offering of himself is the true and final offering for sin, because it is the sacrifice, which, according to prophecy, God desired to be made." 

2. "A body didst thou prepare for me. Using σωμα (body) for ωτια (ears) does not change the sense, for the ears were the point of contact with God's will."

3. "The text of the LXX is followed in the main which differs from the Hebrew chiefly in having σωμα (body) rather than ωτια (ears). The LXX translation has not altered the sense of the Psalm, 'that there was a sacrifice which answered to the will of God as no animal sacrifice could'."

### John Gill:
1. "This was said by David, not of himself, and his own times, for sacrifice and offering were desired and required in his times; nor was he able to do the will of God; so as to fulfil the law, and make void legal sacrifices." 
2. "And this is to be understood, not of his coming into Judea, or the temple at Jerusalem; or out of a private, into a public life; nor of his entrance into the world to come, into heaven, into life eternal, as the Targum on Psalms 40:7 paraphrases it, after he had done his work on earth, for the other world is never expressed by the world only; nor did Christ go into that to do the will of God, but to sit down there, after he had done it."
3. "This was prepared, in the book of God's purposes and decrees, and in the council and covenant of grace; and was curiously formed by the Holy Ghost in time, for the second Person, the Son of God, to clothe himself with."

### John Wesley:
1. "When he cometh into the world" - The Messiah's coming into the world is significant, as it represents his sacrifice that is of interest to all the world, not just a specific group of people.
2. "A body hast thou prepared for me" - This phrase emphasizes the purpose of the Messiah's coming, which is to offer up himself as a sacrifice. It highlights the intentionality and preparation behind his mission.
3. "That I may offer up myself" - This statement underscores the selflessness and willingness of the Messiah to give himself as a sacrifice. It reveals his ultimate purpose and the depth of his love for humanity.
