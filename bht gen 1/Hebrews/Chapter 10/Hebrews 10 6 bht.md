# Hebrews 10:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, it is highlighted that God did not approve of the whole burnt-offerings and sacrifices for sin. These offerings and rituals were not intrinsically efficacious or capable of atoning for sin. They symbolized obedience and the need for forgiveness, but they fell short in comparison to Christ's sacrifice. The focus should not be solely on the physical act of offering, but rather on one's heart and attitude behind the worship. Christ's sacrifice became the perfect and final offering for sin, bringing forgiveness, redemption, and reconciliation with God.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "whole burnt-offerings and sacrifices for sin thou didst not approve" - The commentary highlights that the offering of burnt-offerings and sacrifices for sin was not favored or approved by God. This suggests that there is a deeper meaning or significance to these offerings that goes beyond their external observance.

2. "our Writer may have used the word, as a stronger one than ᾔτησας or ἐζήτησας" - The commentary suggests that the use of the word "approve" (εὐδοκήσας) by the writer may have been intentional to convey a stronger sense of God's disapproval towards these offerings. This emphasizes the need for a different approach or understanding of worship and sacrifice.

3. "The construction of εὐδοκέω with an accus. is not unfrequent in the LXX and Hellenistic Greek" - The commentary points out that the construction of εὐδοκέω (approve) with an accusative is not uncommon in the Septuagint (LXX) and Hellenistic Greek. This linguistic observation provides further support for the interpretation of God's disapproval of the offerings mentioned in the verse.

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "God had pleasure in them, in so far as they were an act of obedience to His positive command under the Old Testament, but not as having an intrinsic efficacy such as Christ's sacrifice had."
2. "These burnt offerings could not in themselves atone for sin."
3. "Contrast: Christ's sacrifice had an intrinsic efficacy that the burnt offerings lacked."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The idea is, that God had no pleasure in them as compared with obedience."
2. "He preferred the latter, and they could not be made to come in the place of it, or to answer the same purpose."
3. "Such offerings would not answer the end for which he was sent into the world, for that end was to be accomplished only by his being 'obedient unto death'."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The burnt offering and the sin offering were both important rituals in the Old Testament, symbolizing the need for atonement and forgiveness of sins. The burnt offering was a voluntary act of worship, expressing complete surrender and dedication to God. The sin offering, on the other hand, was a mandatory offering to make amends for specific sins committed unintentionally or unknowingly."

2. "The burnt offering reminds us of the costly nature of true worship. It required the offering of a valuable animal, representing the giving of oneself entirely to God. It was a tangible expression of devotion and gratitude, acknowledging God's sovereignty and provision."

3. "The sin offering, on the other hand, highlights the reality of human sinfulness and the need for reconciliation with God. It served as a means of seeking forgiveness and restoration, acknowledging the brokenness and separation caused by sin."

4. "These offerings foreshadowed the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ on the cross, who became the perfect and final offering for sin. Through His sacrifice, we can find forgiveness, redemption, and reconciliation with God, without the need for continual animal sacrifices."

5. "While we no longer offer burnt offerings and sin offerings in the same way as in the Old Testament, the principles behind them still hold true. We are called to offer ourselves as living sacrifices, wholly devoted to God, and to seek His forgiveness and restoration when we fall short. It is through Christ's sacrifice that we can approach God with confidence, knowing that our sins are forgiven and our relationship with Him is restored."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "God took no pleasure in the animal offering, the meal-offering, the burnt-offering, the sin-offering." 
2. "God's good pleasure was not found in these external rituals and sacrifices." 
3. "The focus should not be on the physical act of offering, but on the heart and attitude behind it."

### John Gill:
1. "Not only in comparison of moral duties, or spiritual sacrifices, such as those of praise and thanksgiving." 
2. "These could not satisfy his justice, appease his anger, or expiate sin."
3. "They were no otherwise well pleasing to God, than as they were types of, and had respect unto the sacrifice of his Son."
