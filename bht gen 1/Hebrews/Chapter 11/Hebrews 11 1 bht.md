# Hebrews 11:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Faith is the assurance that makes unseen things present and gives reality to things hoped for, as it grasps the truth of what is not revealed to the senses. It is the firm foundation on which we plant our feet, upholding us against all contradictions, and sustains hope by exhibiting unseen things. Faith acts as a title-deed, a conviction that goes beyond mere proof, providing assurance and steadiness of mind. It is a confident persuasion, expectation, and assurance of the promises of God, bringing substance to what is hoped for and enabling the believer to live by faith.

### John Calvin:
1. "Faith is the substance of things hoped for, etc. It is hence also evident, that greatly mistaken are they who think that an exact definition of faith is given here; for the Apostle does not speak here of the whole of what faith is, but selects that part of it which was suitable to his purpose, even that it has patience ever connected with it."
2. "Faith, he says, is the hypostasis, the prop, or the foundation on which we plant our foot, — the prop of what? Of things absent, which are so far from being really possessed by us, that they are far beyond the reach of our understanding."
3. "Faith sustains hope, and exhibits to view things unseen: it is the basis on which the objects of hope rest, and the demonstration or manifestation of what is not seen."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Faith means the belief of things still future; such belief as makes them realities to us: and the evidence of things unseen, such evidence as answers objections and produces conviction."

1. "Faith is the title-deed of things hoped for." 
2. "Hupostasis...the sense of assurance, that steadiness of mind which holds one firm." 
3. "Faith is the proving of things not seen, a conviction that goes beyond mere proof."

### John Gill:
1. "The 'faith' here spoken of is not a mere moral virtue, which is a branch of the law; nor a bare assent to anything revealed, declared, and affirmed in the Gospel; nor a faith of doing miracles; nor an implicit one; nor a mere profession of faith, which sometimes is but temporary; nor the word or doctrine of faith; but that which is made mention of in the preceding chapter, by which the just man lives, and which has the salvation of the soul annexed to it."
2. "Now faith is the 'substance' of these things; it is the ground and foundation of them, in which there is some standing hope; in which sense the word υποστασις is used by Septuagint in Psalms 69:2."
3. "The word of promise is principal ground and foundation of hope; and faith, as leaning on the word, is a less principal ground; it is a confident persuasion, expectation, and assurance of them."

### John Wesley:
1. "But here is no mention of him as the object of faith; and in several of the instances that follow, no notice is taken of him or his salvation, but only of temporal blessings obtained by faith. And yet they may all be considered as evidences of the power of justifying faith in Christ."
2. "Now faith is the subsistence of things hoped for, the evidence or conviction of things not seen — Things hoped for are not so extensive as things not seen."
3. "The subsistence of things hoped for - Giving a kind of present subsistence to the good things which God has promised: the divine supernatural evidence exhibited to, the conviction hereby produced in, a believer of things not seen, whether past, future, or spiritual; particularly of God and the things of God."
