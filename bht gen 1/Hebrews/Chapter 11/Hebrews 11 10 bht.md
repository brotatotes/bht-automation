### Albert Barnes:
1. "Phrases like that of 'the city of God,' 'a city with foundations,' 'the new Jerusalem,' and 'the heavenly Jerusalem' in the time of the apostle, appear to have acquired a kind of technical signification. They referred to 'heaven' - of which Jerusalem, the seat of the worship of God, seems to have been regarded as the emblem." 

2. "It is remarkable that Moses does not mention this as an object of the faith of Abraham, and it is impossible to ascertain the degree of distinctness which this had in his view. It is probable that the apostle in speaking of his faith in this particular did not rely on any distinct record, or even any tradition, but spoke of his piety in the language which he would use to characterize religion of any age, or in any individual."

3. "This passage seems to me to prove that Abraham had an expectation of future happiness after death. There is not the slightest evidence that he supposed there would be a magnificent and glorious capital where the Messiah would personally reign, and where the righteous dead, raised from their graves, would dwell in the second advent of the Redeemer. All that the passage fairly implies is, that while Abraham expected the possession of the promised land for his posterity, yet his faith looked beyond this for a permanent home in a future world."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Passing over the immediate subject of God's promise to Abraham - his inheritance of the land in which he sojourns - the writer fastens the patriarch's faith upon the heavenly fulfillment of the promise - the perfected community of God, which, he assumes, was contained in the original promise."
2. "By the city he means the heavenly Jerusalem, and his statement is that Abraham's faith looked forward to that."
3. "In ascribing to the patriarchs an assured faith in heaven as the end and reward of their wanderings, the writer oversteps the limits of history; but evidently imports into the patriarchal faith the contents of a later and more developed faith - that of himself and his readers."

### John Calvin:
1. "This was indeed to see things invisible."
2. "He calls heaven a city that has foundations, because of its perpetuity."
3. "Moreover, the Apostle teaches us that all weariness is relieved by expectation, so that we ought never to be weary in following God."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "For (the reason of his being a sojourner only) he looked, or waited, for a city which hath foundations, whose Builder and Maker is God." - This quote highlights Abraham's faith in looking forward to a permanent home, a city with foundations, built and made by God.

2. "The contrast here is first between tents, which are easily removed, and a permanent home, and then between an earthly tent and the city of the living God." - This quote emphasizes the contrast between the temporary nature of tents and the everlasting nature of the city of God.

3. "Abraham’s faith looked forward to a home for himself and his descendants in Canaan, in the earthly Jerusalem, with its foundations in the holy mountains; and then, beyond Canaan and his mortal life, to the heavenly reality." - This quote highlights Abraham's faith in both the earthly Jerusalem as a type of the heavenly reality and his hope for a future beyond his mortal life.

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "His steady and patient waiting in spite of disappointment." 
2. "Abraham set his steady gaze on heaven as his real home, being a mere pilgrim on earth." 
3. "Builder, craftsman, artificer."

### John Gill:
1. "Not the city of Jerusalem, nor the Gospel church state; but either the city of the new Jerusalem, said to have twelve foundations... or else the ultimate glory of the saints in heaven, where God dwells, and keeps his palace."
2. "The 'foundations' of which are the everlasting love of God, eternal election, the covenant of grace, the promise and preparation of it by God, from the foundation of the world, and the Lord Jesus Christ, his blood and righteousness."
3. "Abraham was 'looking' by faith; he looked through, and above temporal things, to spiritual things; he went through difficulties with cheerfulness, did not greedily covet earthly things, but looked with disdain upon them, and to heaven with faith, affection, and earnest desire."

### John Wesley:
1. "He looked for a city which hath foundations — Whereas a tent has none." This quote highlights the contrast between a temporary dwelling (a tent) and a permanent city with solid foundations. It emphasizes the longing for stability and permanence that the author is expressing.

2. "Whose builder and former is God — Of which God is the sole contriver, former, and finisher." This quote emphasizes the divine origin and construction of the city being sought. It underscores the belief that God is the ultimate creator and architect of the desired city, reinforcing the idea of divine providence and guidance.

3. "Of which God is the sole contriver, former, and finisher." This quote further emphasizes the exclusive role of God in the construction and completion of the city. It highlights the belief that human efforts alone are insufficient, and it is only through God's intervention and work that the desired city can be realized.
