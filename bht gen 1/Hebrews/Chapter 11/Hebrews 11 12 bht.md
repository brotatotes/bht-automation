# Hebrews 11:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we see the remarkable outcome of Abraham and Sarah's faith, as they defied the odds and became the ancestors of an entire nation. Abraham, in his old age, was as good as dead, yet from him sprung forth a multitude of descendants. Their faith in God's promise, against all human probabilities, led to the fulfillment of that promise and the eventual birth of a great nation. The miraculous nature of their offspring, symbolized by the imagery of stars and sand, emphasizes the vastness and multitude of God's blessings.
