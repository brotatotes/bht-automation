# Hebrews 11:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This verse speaks of individuals who died in faith, not having received the promised blessings, but having seen them from afar. They embraced these promises with joy, like a seaman waving a greeting to a distant land on the horizon. They confessed that they were strangers and sojourners on earth, living with a deep assurance of future rest. In death, their faith burned brightly, and they welcomed the promises to their hearts like a dear friend.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "In faith died these all, not having received the promises, but having seen them from afar." 
2. "From afar they saw the promises in the reality of their fulfillment, from afar they greeted them as the wanderer greets his longed-for home even when he only comes in sight of it at a distance."
3. "They confessed that they were strangers and sojourners upon the earth."

Note: The commentary is quite lengthy and includes various references and explanations. The selected quotes capture the essence of the commentary by highlighting the faith of those who died without receiving the promises, their longing for the fulfillment of those promises, and their acknowledgment of their temporary status as strangers and sojourners on earth.

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "They were true to this principle of faith even unto, and especially in, their dying hour."
2. "This promise of eternal redemption is the inner essence of the promises made to Abraham."
3. "Christ, as the Word, was preached to the Old Testament believers, and so became the seed of life to their souls, as He is to ours."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "These all died in faith" - The phrase used here does not mean that they died in the exercise or possession of religion, but more strictly that they died not having possessed what was the object of their faith. They had been looking for something future, which they did not obtain during their lifetime, and died believing that it would yet be theirs.

2. "Not having received the promises" - That is, not having received the fulfillment of the promises; or the promised blessings. The promises themselves they had received, but they had not yet seen them fully come to pass.

3. "And embraced them" - This word implies more than our word "embrace" frequently does; that is, to receive as true. It means properly "to draw to oneself;" and then to embrace as one does a friend from whom he has been separated. It then means to greet, salute, welcome, and here means a joyful greeting of those promises; or a pressing them to the heart as we do a friend. It was not a cold and formal reception of them, but a warm and hearty welcome.

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "They died under the regimen of faith, and not of sight."
2. "Having seen them from afar and greeted them: as seamen wave their greeting to a country seen far off on the horizon, on which they cannot land."
3. "They admitted and accepted the fact with the resignation of faith, and with the assurance of future rest."

### John Calvin:
1. "They despised all that was in the world; and they never forgot the taste of them, however small it was either in life or in death."
2. "Though God gave to the fathers only a taste of that grace which is largely poured on us, though he showed to them at a distance only an obscure representation of Christ, who is now set forth to us clearly before our eyes, yet they were satisfied and never fell away from their faith."
3. "If the land of Canaan did not engross their attention, how much more weaned from things below ought we to be, who have no promised habitation in this world?"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "According to faith, either for literary variety or to suggest faith as the sphere and standard of their characters." 
2. "He received the promise of the Messiah, but did not live to see the Messiah come as we have done. It is in this sense that we have 'better promises.'"
3. "Abraham rejoiced to see Christ's day in the dim distance."
4. "To reside abroad carried with it a certain stigma, but they 'confessed' it."
5. "A sojourner from another land."

### John Gill:
1. "They died in faith, having the grace itself, which being once implanted, can never be lost; and sometimes in the exercise of it, as these believers did." 
2. "They had a full assurance of faith, that what was promised would be fulfilled; and they took a kind of possession of them beforehand."
3. "They confessed themselves to be strangers and pilgrims on the earth, nor are believers ashamed to own and confess their mean estate in this world."

### John Wesley:
1. "In death faith acts most vigorously."
2. "Not having received the promises - The promised blessings."
3. "Embraced - As one does a dear friend when he meets him."
