# Hebrews 11:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In a remarkable display of faith, Abraham offered up his son Isaac, not only through his obedient will but also in his heart, with full intention to carry out God's command. Abraham's unwavering trust in God is seen in his readiness to sacrifice his beloved son, as if the act had already been completed. This act of obedience reflects the magnitude of Abraham's faith, as he was willing to offer up the very son through whom God's promises would be fulfilled.

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The apostle had stated one strong instance of the faith of Abraham, and he now refers to one still more remarkable - the strongest illustration of faith, undoubtedly, which has ever been evinced in our world."
2. "The meaning here is, that Abraham was placed in circumstances which showed what was the real strength of his confidence in God."
3. "So far as the intention of Abraham was concerned, the deed was done, for he had made every preparation for the offering, and was actually about to take the life of his son."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The meaning is that while the trial is yet in progress, Abraham hath already offered up his son, before the trial has come to an issue, by the act of his obedient will, through faith in God." 
2. "Accounting: See on 1 Peter 5:12; Romans 4:5; Romans 8:18. From whence: Rend. wherefore: because of his faith in God's power and truthfulness." 
3. "Since the sacrifice did not take place as a literal slaughter, there could not be a literal restoration from death. There was a real offering in Abraham's will, but not a real death of Isaac. Isaac's death took place symbolically, in the sacrifice of the ram: correspondingly, the restoration was only a symbolic restoration from the dead."

### John Calvin:
1. "The sacrificing of Isaac is to be estimated according to the purpose of the heart: for it was not owing to Abraham that he did not actually perform what he was commanded to do. His resolution to obey was then the same, as though he had actually sacrificed his son."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The test was still going on."
2. "The act was already consummated so far as Abraham was concerned when it was interrupted and it stands on record about him."
3. "It seemed the death of his hopes."

### John Gill:
1. "This temptation or trial respects the command given by God to Abraham, to offer up his son Isaac; which lays no foundation for a charge against God, either of sin or cruelty; for God's will is the rule of justice and goodness, and whatever he requires is just and good."
2. "The secret will of God was not that Isaac should die, but a command was given to Abraham to offer him up, for the trial of his faith and love; this was a temptation of probation, not of seduction, or to sin, as are the temptations of Satan; for God tempts no man with sin."
3. "He showed great readiness to do it; as soon as he had the command given him, he travelled three days' journey in order to it; took the wood of the burnt offering, and laid it on his son; took fire, and a knife in his hand, with the one to burn the wood, with the other to slay his son; he built an altar, laid the wood in order on it; and bound his son, and laid him on that; and took the knife, and stretched forth his hand to slay him, and fully intended to do it, had he not been prevented."

3. "He that had received the promises... offered up - This very son" - This underscores the magnitude of Abraham's sacrifice, as Isaac was the fulfillment of God's promise to make Abraham's descendants numerous. Abraham's faith was tested to the extreme, yet he remained faithful.
