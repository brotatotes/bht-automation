# Hebrews 11:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the individual, who is commonly believed to be Moses, demonstrates a powerful act of faith. Through their deliberate refusal to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter, they reject their previous identity and worldly honor in favor of a new calling aligned with God's purposes. This act represents a radical break from societal expectations and a commitment to embracing a new identity in alignment with God's promises. By choosing to be identified with the people of God, this individual boldly declares their allegiance to and trust in the promises of God over any earthly pleasures or status.
