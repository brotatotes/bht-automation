# Hebrews 11:28 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Through faith, the believer celebrates the Passover, in anticipation of the unseen promise of God's protection. The act of sprinkling the blood with a bunch of hyssop, a symbol of sacrifice, serves as a sign of faith and obedience. As the destroying angel passes over, the blood of the lamb, a type of Christ, purifies the hearts and consciences of the people, protecting them from harm.
