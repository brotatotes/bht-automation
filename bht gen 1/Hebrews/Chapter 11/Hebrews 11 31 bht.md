# Hebrews 11:31 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This verse speaks of a woman named Rahab, who was once a harlot, but through her faith and hospitality, she became part of the body of believers. Despite her past, she showed strong faith and received the spies with peace, risking her own life for them. Her story demonstrates that faith can surpass personal character and previous separation from the covenant people, and that God's grace can transform even the most unlikely individuals into instruments of His purpose.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "By faith...Rahab the harlot did not perish with them who were disobedient." 
2. "Clement of Rome devotes to her a whole chapter of his Epistle to the Corinthians, and has no idea of her other than as an harlot." 
3. "Having received the spies with peace, so that they had nothing hostile to fear from her."

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Rahab showed her 'faith' in her confession, Joshua 2:9; Joshua 2:11, 'I know that Jehovah hath given you the land; Jehovah your God, is God in heaven above, and in earth beneath.'" 
2. "Her former life adds to the marvel of her repentance, faith, and preservation (Matthew 21:31; Matthew 21:32)." 
3. "Thus Paul, quoting the same examples (Hebrews 11:17; Hebrews 11:31) for the power of faith, as James (James 2:21; James 2:25) does for justification by works evidentially, shows that in maintaining justification by faith alone, he means not a dead faith, but 'faith which worketh by love' (James 2:25)."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The apostle seems to have selected this case as illustrating the nature of faith, partly because it occurred at Jericho, of which he had just made mention, and partly to show that strong faith had been exercised not only by the patriarchs, and by those who were confessed to be great and good, but by those in humble life, and whose earlier conduct had been far from the ways of virtue." 

2. "This case - supposing that she had been a woman of bad character, but now was truly converted - does not stand alone. Other females of a similar character have been converted, and have subsequently led lives of piety; and though the number is not comparatively great, yet the truth of God has shown its power in renewing and sanctifying some at least of this, the most abandoned and degraded class of human beings."

3. "There is no need of supposing that the apostle in commending this woman approved of all that she did. That she was not perfect is true. That she did some things which cannot be vindicated is true also - and who does not? But admitting all that may be said about any imperfection in her character, it was still true that she had strong faith - and that is all that the apostle commends."



### John Calvin:
1. "He now teaches us, that an alien woman, not only of a humble condition among her own people, but also a harlot, had been adopted into the body of the Church through faith." 
2. "It hence follows, that those who are most exalted, are of no account before God, unless they have faith; and that, on the other hand, those who are hardly allowed a place among the profane and the reprobate, are by faith introduced into the company of angels."
3. "The evidence of her faith was, that she received the spies at the peril of her life: then, by means of faith, she escaped safe from the ruin of her own city."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Nor does previous personal character hinder its power, or previous separation from the covenant people." 
2. "Her faith showed its reality in her receiving and protecting the spies, and found its reward in her preservation, and finally in her becoming an ancestress of our Lord." 
3. "A careful attention to the tenses, and to the absence of the article whereby this clause is closely connected with the preceding, would be sufficient of itself to reconcile the teaching of Paul and James."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Having received the spies with peace" - This phrase highlights the welcoming and peaceful attitude of the recipient towards the spies. It suggests a sense of hospitality and openness.

2. "First aorist middle participle of δεχομα, to welcome" - This explanation clarifies the grammatical structure of the phrase, emphasizing the act of welcoming and receiving the spies.

3. "κατασκοπος is an old compound... used of scout or spy" - This information provides insight into the meaning of the word "κατασκοπος," indicating that it refers to someone who acts as a scout or spy. This adds context to the verse and helps to understand the role of the individuals being received.

### John Gill:
1. "This woman was a wonderful and singular instance of the free, sovereign, distinguishing, powerful, and efficacious grace of God; being one that sprung from Canaan, and was of the nations that were abhorred; but, being called by grace, became an eminent believer."
2. "Her temporal salvation was an emblem and type of her spiritual salvation; her receiving the spies was an emblem of a soul's receiving the Gospel, and the ministers of it; the scarlet thread, that was hung out, was an emblem of the blood of Christ, by which sins, though as scarlet, are made white as wool."
3. "The saving of her whole family is an emblem of the complete salvation of all the elect, soul and body, by Christ."

### John Wesley:
1. "Rahab, though formerly one not of the fairest character, was now an example of faith and obedience."
