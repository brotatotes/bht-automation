# Hebrews 11:39 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The individuals described in this passage are commended for their unwavering faith, which was recognized and acknowledged by God and others. Although they did not personally witness the fulfillment of the ultimate promise during their lives, their hope was centered around a heavenly inheritance—a reward that extended beyond the temporal realm. Their faith serves as an example for believers today, encouraging us to trust in Christ and endure hardships for the sake of the promises we have received.
