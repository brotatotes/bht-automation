## BHT:
In this verse, the commentators highlight the contrast between the offerings of Abel and Cain. Abel's sacrifice was an excellent one, offered with faith and a genuine desire for atonement. It was a type of Christ's sacrifice, symbolizing the righteousness obtained through faith. God Himself testified to the acceptability of Abel's sacrifice. Though Abel is long gone, his faith still speaks to us, reminding us that salvation comes through faith in the ultimate sacrifice.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The more excellence must be looked for then rather in the disposition with which the sacrifice was offered than in the nature of the sacrifice itself."
2. "That Abel’s consisted of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof the first and the best, whereas Cain’s was merely an offering of the fruit of the ground, perfunctory and common-place, may be a circumstance not without weight in appreciating the term πίστει."
3. "That Abel’s was an offering of slain animals, God’s own appointed way, so soon after, of the sinner’s approach to Him, whereas Cain’s was only a gift, as if he could approach God without shedding of blood, this may also be an important element in the term πίστει."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The revelation in this case was doubtless God's command to sacrifice animals...as a type of the promised bruiser of the serpent's head."
2. "A coat of skin put on Adam from a sacrificed animal typified the covering or atonement resulting from Christ's sacrifice."
3. "Faith causes the believer's person to be accepted, and then his offering."
4. "His blood crying from the ground to God, shows how precious, because of his 'faith,' he was still in God's sight, even when dead."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Men have speculated much as to the reason why the offering of Abel was accepted, and that of Cain rejected; but such speculation rests on no certain basis, and the solution of the apostle should be regarded as decisive and satisfactory, that in the one case there was faith, in the other not."
2. "The belief that he was inspired will, however, relieve the subject of this difficulty, for according to such a belief all his statements here, whether recorded in the Old Testament or not, are founded in truth."
3. "It is equally impossible to tell with 'certainty' what was the nature of the faith of Abel. It has been commonly asserted, that it was faith in Christ - looking forward to his coming, and depending on his sacrifice when offering what was to be a type of him."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "A more excellent sacrifice...greater in value in God's eyes." 
2. "The difference between the offerings of Abel and Cain...is largely a matter of speculation."
3. "God bore witness by his acceptance of the gifts."
4. "By his faith he still speaks to us in the O. T. Scriptures, though dead."

### John Calvin:
1. "The Apostle’s object in this chapter is to show, that however excellent were the works of the saints, it was from faith they derived their value, their worthiness, and all their excellences."
2. "He confirms what I have already stated, that no works, coming from us can please God, until we ourselves are received into favor...no works are deemed just before God, but those of a just man."
3. "To faith he also ascribes this, — that God testified that Abel was no less the object of his care after his death, than during his life...it hence appears, that he was one of God’s saints, whose death is precious to him."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Cain expressed at most his thankfulness, and that not hearty or profound; Abel’s faith showed itself in acknowledging his sin and in laying hold of the Divine mercy in the midst of what he felt to be deserved wrath; and thus his offering was a true sacrifice."
2. "God himself testifying of his gifts, probably as God testified in other cases, by consuming and accepting the sacrifice."
3. "Through his faith he still speaks to God; even as Enoch still lives, who never died at all."

### Archibald T. Robertson:

2. "He had Witness borne to him" - Abel was testified to as righteous, indicating his faithfulness. (Quote 2)
3. "God bearing witness" - God Himself testified to Abel's righteousness through his sacrifice. (Quote 3)

### John Gill:
1. "The superior excellency of Abel's sacrifice to Cain's, lay both in the matter, and in the manner of it; the one was offered heartily to the Lord, the other only in show; the one was offered in faith, the other not." 

2. "Abel looked through his sacrifice to the sacrifice of Christ, not so Cain. Abel's sacrifice was a lamb, a type of Christ, the Lamb of God; a firstling, a figure of him who is the firstborn of every creature; one of the fattest of his flock, expressive of the excellency of Christ."

3. "By which he obtained witness that he was righteous; not righteous by his offering, nor by his faith, but by the righteousness of Christ, which his faith in his sacrifice looked unto."

4. "God testifying of his gifts: not of his own gifts, temporal or spiritual, but of Abel's gifts, which he offered to the Lord; that is, his sacrifices; of these he testified, when he showed respect either by an audible voice, declaring his acceptance of them; or by sending down fire from heaven, upon his sacrifice, which in later times was a symbol of acceptance."

5. "And by it, he being dead, yet speaketh; good men die, and some of them die a violent death, as did Abel, yet he speaks in the Scriptures, which have a voice in them, or by his blood, which calls for vengeance; or rather by, or because of his faith, though he is dead, 'he is yet spoken of', as the word may be rendered."

### John Wesley:
1. "Abel offered a more excellent sacrifice... implying both a confession of what his own sins deserved, and a desire of sharing in the great atonement."
2. "By which faith he obtained both righteousness and a testimony of it: God testifying - Visibly that his gifts were accepted."
3. "Being dead, he yet speaketh - That a sinner is accepted only through faith in the great sacrifice."
