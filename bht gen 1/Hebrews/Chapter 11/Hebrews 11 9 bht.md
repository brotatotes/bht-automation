In doing so, he exemplified the importance of faith in the face of uncertainty and displayed a detachment from earthly possessions. Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob were united as joint heirs, receiving their blessings solely by God's grace and faithfulness, highlighting that their inheritance was not based on human lineage or merit.
