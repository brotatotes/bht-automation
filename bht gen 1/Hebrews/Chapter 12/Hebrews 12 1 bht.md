# Hebrews 12:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the author urges us, as Christians, to run our race with patience, surrounded by a multitude of witnesses who have gone before us. Like athletes in a stadium, we are encouraged to lay aside any burdens, hindrances, or easily entangling sins that may impede our progress. By doing so, we can be inspired by the noble testimonies of the saints and strive towards the heavenly prize, with our eyes fixed on Christ, who holds it for us.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Whoever denies such reference, misses, it seems to me, the very point of the sense."
2. "The motive, as far as this clause supplies one, is gone."
3. "The best note on the whole idea and imagery is that of Schlichting: 'Introducit nos veluti in theatrum quoddam amplissimum, in quod magna spectatorum turba confluxerit, quæ, omnibus locis et subselliis repletis, veluti nubes quædam densa in medio certantibus circumfusa videatur.'"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The 'witnesses' answer to the spectators pressing round to see the competitors in their contest for the prize."
2. "Those 'witnessed of' become in their turn 'witnesses' in a twofold way: attesting by their own case the faithfulness of God to His people, and witnessing our struggle of faith."
3. "Carnal and worldly lusts, and all, whether from without or within, that would impede the heavenly runner, are the spiritual weight to be laid aside."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The apostle represents Christians as encompassed with the multitude of worthies to whom he had referred in the previous chapter. It cannot be fairly inferred from this that he means to say that all those ancient worthies were actually looking at the conduct of Christians, and saw their conflicts. It is a figurative representation, such as is common, and means that we ought to act as if they were in sight, and cheered us on."
2. "As applied to Christians it means that they should remove all which would obstruct their progress in the Christian course. Thus, it is fair to apply it to whatever would be an impediment in our efforts to win the crown of life."
3. "The sins to which we are most exposed. Such sins are appropriately called 'easily besetting sins.' They are those to which we are particularly liable. They are such sins as the following: (1) Those to which we are particularly exposed by our natural temperament, or disposition. (2) Those in which we freely indulged before we became Christians. (3) Sins to which we are exposed by our profession, by our relations to others, or by our situation in life. (4) Sins to which we are exposed from some special weakness in our character."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Therefore let us also (as they did) run our appointed race with patience."
2. "The writer's picture is that of an arena in which the Christians whom he addresses are contending in a race, while the vast host of the heroes of faith who, after having born witness to the truth, have entered into their heavenly rests watches the contest from the encircling tiers of the arena, compassing and overhanging it like a cloud, filled with lively interest and sympathy, and lending heavenly aid."
3. "So the readers are exhorted to lay aside every worldly hindrance or embarrassment to their Christian career."

### John Calvin:
1. "The virtues of the saints are so many testimonies to confirm us, that we, relying on them as our guides and associates, ought to go onward to God with more alacrity." (242)
2. "Whosoever, then, would run in the course prescribed by Christ, must first disentangle himself from all these impediments, for we are already of ourselves more tardy than we ought to be, so no other causes of delay should be added." (242)
3. "By this word patience, we are ever reminded of what the Apostle meant to be mainly regarded in faith, even that we are in spirit to seek the kingdom of God, which is invisible to the flesh, and exceeds all that our minds can comprehend." (243)

### Archibald T Robertson:

3. "No trailing garment to hinder or trip one."

2. "Likewise the rites and ceremonies of Moses's law were a weight and burden, a yoke of bondage, and an intolerable one, and with which many believing Jews were entangled and pressed, and which were a great hinderance in the performance of evangelical worship."

3. "The stadium, or race plot, in which the Christian race is run, is this world; the prize run for is the heavenly glory; the mark to direct in it, is Christ; many are the runners, yet none but the overcomers have the prize; which being held by Christ, is given to them."

### John Wesley:

2. "Let us lay aside every weight - As all who run a race take care to do." This quote encourages us to identify and remove anything that hinders our spiritual progress, reminding us to let go of burdens that weigh us down and hinder our spiritual growth.

3. "And the sin which easily besetteth us - As doth the sin of our constitution, the sin of our education, the sin of our profession."
