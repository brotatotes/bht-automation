# Hebrews 12:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Bible verse being described is one that highlights the difference between earthly parents and our heavenly Father in their approach to discipline. Earthly parents may chastise us based on their own imperfect judgment and with varied motives, but God's chastisement is always for our ultimate good. He disciplines us to make us more holy, to conform us to His own image, and to prepare us for eternal life. His discipline is far superior to that of earthly parents, as it has everlasting significance and produces eternal life and spiritual growth.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "For they indeed (our earthly parents) chastised us after their own pleasure, but He in order to that which is profitable, in order to our partaking of His holiness." 
2. "The becoming partakers of God’s holiness is manifestly to be taken subjectively: becoming holy like Him." 
3. "Surely the true antithesis is that pointed out by the order of the clauses themselves, and by their correspondence: 1. πρὸς ὀλίγας ἡμέρας and ἐπὶ τὸ συμφέρον: 2. κατὰ τὸ δοκοῦν αὐτοῖς and εἰς τὸ μεταλ. τ. ἁγ. αὐτοῦ."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Their rule of chastening is what may seem fit to their own often erring judgment, temper, or caprice."
2. "The two defects of human education are: (1) the prevalence in it of a view to the interests of our short earthly term of days; (2) the absence in parents of the unerring wisdom of our heavenly Father."
3. "To become holy like God is tantamount to being educated for passing eternity with God."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Much more cheerfully ought we to submit to that discipline from the hand of our heavenly Father which is designed to extend its benefits through eternity."
2. "We submitted to our earthly parents, though their correction was sometimes passionate, and was designed to gratify their own pleasure rather than to promote our good."
3. "It is, that he may make us more pure and holy, and thus promote our own best interest."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Subjection to the Father of spirits, the source of all life, has an eternal significance. Subjection to his fatherly discipline means, not only the everlasting life of the future, but present life, eternal in quality, developed even while the discipline is in progress." 
2. "The discipline of the human father is brief in duration, and its significance is confined to the present life. In other words, the offset to 'for a few days' is in ver. 9." 
3. "The human parents were shortsighted, fallible, sometimes moved by passion rather than by sound judgment, and, therefore, often mistaken in their disciplinary methods. What seemed good to them was not always best for us."

### John Calvin:
1. "God’s chastisements are appointed to subdue and mortify our flesh, so that we may be renewed for a celestial life."
2. "The fruit or benefit [of God's chastisements] is to be perpetual; but such a benefit cannot be expected from men, since their discipline refers to civil life."
3. "The spiritual holiness conferred by God far exceeds the advantages which belong to the body."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The contrast here is perfect between seeming and reality between their pleasure and God’s noble purpose between the few days of our youth, whether it succeed or not, and the continuance which is unbroken till the result is achieved."
2. "'His holiness' is, no doubt, a holiness completely like His own."
3. "The word rendered 'share' or, in the English version, 'be partakers of,' is not the same word as in Hebrews 12:8. It means rather to share in what is not within our reach; it implies willing acceptance rather than personal acquisition, though shared with others, even with the blessed God Himself."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Chastened as seemed good to them." 
2. "For our profit, that we may be partakers." 
3. "Of his holiness."

### John Gill:
1. "Saints are no losers by afflictions; they lose nothing but their dross and tin; they do not lose the love of God; nor their interest in the covenant of grace; nor the presence of God; nor grace in their own hearts; nor spiritual peace and comfort."
2. "On the contrary, they are real gainers by them; their graces gain by them fresh lustre and glory; they obtain a greater degree of spiritual knowledge; and a larger stock of experience; and are hereby restored to their former state, duty, and zeal; and become more conformable to Christ."
3. "Afflictions are designed as means to bring persons to this end; to bring them to a sense of sin, an acknowledgment of it, an aversion to it, and to a view of pardon of it; to purge it away; to wean the saints from this world; to increase their grace, and lead them on to a perfect state of glory, where there will be no more sin, and no more sorrow."

### John Wesley:
1. "For they verily for a few days — How few are even all our day on earth!"
2. "Chastened us as they thought good - Though frequently they erred therein, by too much either of indulgence or severity."
3. "But he always, unquestionably, for our profit, that we may be partakers of his holiness - That is, of himself and his glorious image."
