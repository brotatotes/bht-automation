# Hebrews 12:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Bible verse speaks of the purpose and outcome of chastisement or discipline. It emphasizes that while chastening may be painful and grievous in the present, it ultimately yields a peaceable fruit of righteousness. Commentators point out that chastening is not meant to be enjoyable, but rather to teach and discipline. It is an opportunity for growth, leading to a more devoted and pure life. Those who are exercised by chastisement are encouraged to embrace it and seek to improve according to God's will.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "All chastisement, divine as well as human...all παιδεία properly so called, and answering its proper purpose."
2. "All chastisement for the time present seems not to be matter of joy, but of grief: but afterwards it yields peaceable fruit of righteousness."
3. "And this fruit, thus considered, is the practical righteousness which springs from faith, not the forensic righteousness which comes by faith."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The objection that chastening is grievous is here anticipated and answered. It only seems so to those being chastened, whose judgments are confused by the present pain." 

2. "The real object of the fathers in chastening is not that they find pleasure in the children's pain. Gratified wishes, our Father knows, would often be our real curses." 

3. "Fruit of righteousness—righteousness (in practice, springing from faith) is the fruit which chastening, the tree yields. 'Peaceable' (compare James 3:18): in contrast to the ordeal of conflict by which it has been won. 'Fruit of righteousness to be enjoyed in peace after the conflict' [THOLUCK]."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The Christian feels the loss of a child, or physical suffering, as keenly as anyone. But while religion does not render him insensible to suffering, it does two things: (1) It enables him to bear the pain without complaining; and, (2) It turns the affliction into a blessing on his soul."

2. "The effect is seen in a pure life, and in a more entire devotedness to God. We are not to look for the proper fruits of affliction while we are suffering, but 'afterward.' It yieldeth the peaceable fruit of righteousness."

3. "There is no Christian who is not ultimately benefited by trials, and who is not able at some period subsequently to say, 'It was good for me that I was afflicted. Before I was afflicted I went astray; but now have I kept thy word.'"

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Not merely during the present, but for the present regarded as the time in which its application is necessary and salutary."
2. "It yieldeth the peaceable fruit of righteousness."
3. "Who have been subjected to the severe discipline of suffering, and have patiently undergone it."

### John Calvin:
1. "We are like children who dread the rod and shun it as much as they can, for owing to their age they cannot yet judge how useful it may be to them."
2. "Chastisements cannot be estimated aright if judged according to what the flesh feels under them, and that therefore we must fix our eyes on the end."
3. "We shall thus receive the peaceable fruit of righteousness, which means the fear of the Lord and a godly and holy life, of which the cross is the teacher."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Now no chastening (either God’s or any other) seemeth for the present to be joyous, but grievous... nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of righteousness." 

2. "The figure of a struggle is still continued... 'Tis conflict here below, 'Tis triumph there and peace."

3. "The chapter is a striking lesson on 'analogy'... Christ Himself, human institutions, the common relationship of life, are all introduced to strengthen the argument, and most impressive lessons are drawn from them all."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Not joyous, but grievous." 
2. "Peaceable fruit." 
3. "Exercised thereby."

### John Gill:
1. "No affliction 'seemeth' to be joyous, in outward appearance to flesh and blood, and therefore how should they be for profit and advantage?"
2. "They [afflictions] really are [joyous], when viewed by faith, and judged of by sanctified reason; for they are tokens of the love of God and Christ; are evidences of sonship; and work together either for the temporal, or spiritual, or eternal good of the saints."
3. "They [afflictions] always issue to such in eternal peace and everlasting happiness; and this peace arises from the 'righteousness' of Christ, laid hold upon by faith, which produces a true conscience peace, and entitles to that everlasting joy and rest which remains for the people of God."

### John Wesley:

2. "Chastening, whether from our earthly or heavenly Father, is for the present grievous." 
3. "To them that are exercised thereby...improve it according to his will."
