# Hebrews 12:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Esau, the tragic example of an apostate, sought in vain for a reversal of the consequences resulting from his impulsive decision to sell his birthright. He found no opportunity to repair his mistake, as the blessing pronounced by his father could not be revoked. His remorseful tears did not constitute genuine repentance, but rather regret for the loss incurred. This serves as a warning to those tempted to forsake their faith, emphasizing the importance of valuing and preserving their spiritual privileges.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "For he found not place of repentance...to understand by μετανοίας, repentance not in the subject of εὗρεν, but in someone else. And thus referred to Esau himself, it will mean...that he found no way open to reverse what had been done, by repentance: the sin had been committed and the consequence entailed, irrevocably."
2. "μετάνοιας τόπος is, in fact, μετάνοια. He found no place for μετάνοια: if he had found one, μετάνοια would have been secured: this was what he sought."
3. "It is obvious, that our passage, rightly understood, cannot by any means favour the exclusion of any sinner from repentance. In Esau’s case the μετανοίας τόπος was closed, by circumstances themselves: the blessing had been given and could not be recalled. And this is our warning."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "As in the believer's case, so in the unbeliever's, there is an 'afterwards' coming, when the believer shall look on his past griefs, and the unbeliever on his past joys, in a very different light from that in which they were respectively viewed at the time." 
2. "He that will not when he may, when he will, shall have nay." 
3. "Had he sought real repentance with tears he would have found it. But he did not find it because this was not what he sought. His were tears of vain regret and remorse, not of repentance."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The 'blessing' here referred to was not that of the birth-right, but that pronounced by the father Isaac on him whom he regarded as his first-born son." 
2. "Isaac firmly declared that he had 'pronounced' the blessing, and though it had been obtained by fraud, yet as it was of the nature of a divine prediction, it could not now be changed." 
3. "If we should despise our privileges as Esau did his birth-right, and renounce our religion, it would be impossible to recover what we had lost."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The words place of repentance mean an opportunity to repair by repenting. He found no way to reverse by repentance what he had done."
2. "The penalty could not be reversed in the nature of the case. This is clear from Isaac's words, Genesis 27:33."
3. "Sought it carefully [εκζητησας]. See on 1 Peter 1:10. Comp. Hebrews 11:6. See also on questionings, 1 Timothy 1:4."

### John Calvin:
1. "Thus they who are led away by the allurements of this world alienate themselves from God, and sell their own salvation that they may feed on the morsels of this world, without thinking that they lose anything, nay, they flatter and applaud themselves, as though they were extremely happy."
2. "When too late their eyes are opened, so that being warned by the sight of their own wickedness, they become sensible of the loss of which they made no account."
3. "The word 'rejected' means that he was repulsed, or denied his request. For he found no place of repentance, etc.; that is, he profited nothing, he gained nothing by his late repentance, though he sought with tears the blessing which by his own fault he had lost."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "He was rejected, by his father and by God... for he found no place of repentance, though he sought it carefully and with tears." 
2. "He is regarded as a type of the hopeless apostate, who throws away his birthright through sensual indulgence or love of the world, and who, too late, finds the door of repentance closed to him, because repentance itself, in its true and deep sense, is impossible."
3. "There is a striking sermon of Melvill’s on the text as thus interpreted. In favour of referring ‘it’ to the blessing rather than to repentance, is the historical fact; and in favour of the deeper sense of repentance (not merely a change of his father’s mind, or a cancelling of the result) is the uniformly ethical meaning of the word."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "He sought it (the blessing) with tears, but in vain. There was no change of mind in Isaac." 
2. "Esau is a tragic example of one who does a wilful sin which allows no second chance." 
3. "The author presses the case of Esau as a warning to the Christians who were tempted to give up Christ."

### John Gill:
1. "After he had sold his birthright for it, and the blessing with it; after his father had blessed Jacob: this the apostle relates to the Hebrews, as a thing well known to them." 

2. "Tears are not an infallible sign of repentance: men may be more concerned for the loss and mischief that come by sin, than for the evil that is in it; and such repentance is not sincere."

3. "He could not prevail upon him to change his mind; to revoke the blessing he had bestowed on Jacob, and confer it on him... for he plainly saw it was the mind of God, that the blessing should be where it was; whose counsel shall stand, and he will do all his pleasure."

### John Wesley:
1. "He was rejected — He could not obtain it." 
2. "For he found no place for repentance — There was no room for any such repentance as would regain what he had lost." 
3. "Diligently with tears — He sought too late. Let us use the present time."
