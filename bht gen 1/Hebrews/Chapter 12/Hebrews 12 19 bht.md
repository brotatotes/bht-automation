# Hebrews 12:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the people, overwhelmed by the terrifying sound of a trumpet amidst the tempest, pleaded against hearing God's own voice directly. Instead, they sought the mediation of Moses, who would convey the divine message. The trumpet, symbolizing the divine presence and angelic ministry, heralded God's approach and captured the attention of the people. The voice of words refers to the Decalogue, spoken by God Himself, and held immense awe and power. The people's fear and apprehension compelled them to request the familiar voice of Moses, rather than experiencing the overwhelming voice of the Deity.
