# Hebrews 12:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, we are encouraged to fix our gaze solely on Jesus, the pioneer and captain of our faith. Like the martyrs and witnesses who embody the athlete spirit, we are to continuously look to Jesus, who endured a bitter death and despised shame. He is the author and finisher of our faith, the originator who walked the path of faith before us and the one who leads us towards salvation. Through his example and sacrifice, he became the source of eternal salvation and the ultimate object of our faith.
