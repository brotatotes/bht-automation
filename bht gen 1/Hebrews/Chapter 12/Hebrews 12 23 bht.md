# Hebrews 12:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Bible verse describes a powerful sense of unity and belonging among Christians. It speaks of the church as the gathering of God's chosen ones, both Jews and Gentiles, from all times and places. These believers are called the "firstborn" and are enrolled in heaven as citizens, sharing a special relationship with God. They are united with holy souls who have gone before them, and they eagerly await the righteous judgment of God. The verse emphasizes the heavenly inheritance that all Christians possess and the assurance that God is the ultimate Judge of all.

2. "He adds, which are written in heaven, because God is said to have all the elect enrolled in his book or secret catalogue, as Ezekiel speaks."
3. "The spirits of just men, etc. He adds this to intimate that we are joined to holy souls, which have put off their bodies, and left behind them all the filth of this world; and hence he says that they are consecrated or 'made perfect', for they are no more subject to the infirmities of the flesh, having laid aside the flesh itself."

2. "The church catholic, or universal, which consists only of God's elect, and of all of them, in all times and places; and reaches even to the saints in heaven: this church is invisible at present, and will never fail; of which Christ is the head, and for which he has given himself."
