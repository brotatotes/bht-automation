## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "That Christ is the mediator of the new covenant, is a theological truth: that Jesus is, is a glorious token of God’s love manifested to us men." 
2. "By that Blood we live, wherever it is: but as here it is mentioned separately from the Lord Himself, as an item in the glories of the heavenly city, and as 'yet speaking,' it seems to require some such view to account for the words used." 
3. "The blood of Christ is called αἷμα ῥαντισμοῦ, inasmuch as, like that sacrificial blood of old materially, it is spiritually sprinkled on the conscience of those who come unto God by Him."

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "The mention of Jesus, the Perfecter of our faith, and Himself perfected through sufferings and death, in His resurrection and ascension, is naturally suggested by the mention of 'the just made perfect' at their resurrection."
2. "His blood was entirely 'poured out' of His body by the various ways in which it was shed, His bloody sweat, the crown of thorns, the scourging, the nails, and after death the spear, just as the blood was entirely poured out and extravasated from the animal sacrifices of the law."
3. "The blood itself, therefore, continues still in heaven before God, the perpetual ransom price of 'the eternal covenant.' Once for all Christ sprinkled the blood peculiarly for us at His ascension."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The highest consideration which can be urged to induce anyone to persevere in a life of piety is the fact that the Son of God has come into the world and died to save sinners."
2. "The blood of Jesus speaks better things than Abel did; that is, that the blood of Jesus is the 'reality' of which the offering of Abel was a 'type.'"
3. "The object here is to compare the Redeemer with Abel, not in the sense that the blood shed in either case calls for vengeance, but that salvation by blood is more clearly revealed in the Christian plan than in the ancient history."

### John Calvin:
1. "He alone through whom the Father is reconciled to us, and who renders his face serene and lovely to us, so that we may come to him without fear."
2. "Christ becomes our Mediator, even through his own blood...our souls must be now cleansed by it through faith."

### John Gill:
1. "Coming to Christ is by faith; and is different from a corporeal coming to him in the days of his flesh; and from an outward attendance on ordinances; it is a coming to him under a sense of want, and upon a sight of fulness; and is the produce of God's efficacious grace." 
2. "They can want no good thing, for all are theirs; they have free access to God through him, and a right to all privileges."
