# Hebrews 12:25 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Take heed that you do not turn away from the one who speaks, for if even those who rejected the message on earth did not escape punishment, how much worse will it be for those who reject the voice that speaks from heaven? The word spoken from heaven carries greater weight than the law given on Sinai, and the consequences of refusing it are severe. Do not be among those who despise the Gospel, for their guilt is great in rejecting the message delivered by the Son himself.
