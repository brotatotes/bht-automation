### Henry Alford:
1. "The great final shaking which is to introduce the accomplished kingdom of God is at all events that after which there shall be no other." 
2. "The scope of Creation has been, the establishing of the kingdom of Redemption: that it, the transitory and baseless, may pass away when its work is fulfilled, and give place to that which shall never pass away."
3. "Creation was made but to subserve Redemption: the things removeable, to give place to the things unremoveable."

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "In saying 'once more,' the Spirit implies that something has already passed, and something else shall be which is to remain, and is no more to be changed to something else; for the once is exclusive, that is, not many times."
2. "As the shaking is to be total, so shall the removal be, making way for the better things that are unremovable."
3. "The new abiding heaven and earth are also made by God, but they are of a higher nature than the material creation, being made to partake of the divine nature of Him who is not made."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The effect of the gospel would be to overturn everything which was of a temporary character in the previous system, and everything in morals which was not founded on a solid basis, and to set up in the place of it principles which no revolution and no time could change."
2. "The Christian religion gives permanence and stability to the one and causes the other to disappear."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The shaking of the ‘heavenly things’ has created some difficulty. But, in fact, the new covenant affected both earth and heaven."
2. "The Word made flesh, the complete forgiveness of sin, eternal life through the blood of Christ, the introduction of sinners of all nations into the Church of God, the changing of the Church itself from an earthly into a spiritual fellowship, Christ exalted as Priest and King: these are changes that affect both worlds, but cannot themselves be changed."
3. "The shaking, therefore, here spoken of is not now future, as some suppose. It began at the incarnation (and so the ‘I will shake’ of the prophecy is here changed into ‘I am shaking’), and it is only the complete realization of it that is still to come."

### John Gill:
1. "And this word yet once more,.... Or as it is in Haggai 2:6 'yet once it is a little while'; which suggests, that as something had been done already, so in a very little time, and at once, something very marvellous and surprising would be effected."
2. "But rather this is to be understood of Christ's coming to the destruction of Jerusalem; when there was an entire removal of the Jewish state, both political and ecclesiastical; and of the whole Mosaic economy; and of things appertaining to divine worship, which were made with hands, as the temple, and the things in it; and which were made to be removed."
3. "That those things which cannot be shaken may remain: the kingdom and priesthood of Christ, which are everlasting; and the good things which come by him, as remission of sins, justification, adoption, sanctification, and the heavenly inheritance; as also the Gospel, and the doctrines and ordinances of it, baptism, and the Lord's supper, and the mode of Gospel worship; all which are to continue until Christ's second coming."

### John Wesley:
1. "The things which are shaken - Namely, heaven and earth." This quote highlights the temporary nature of the physical world and emphasizes that it is subject to change and instability.

2. "As being made - And consequently liable to change." This quote further emphasizes the impermanence of the physical world, emphasizing that it was created and therefore susceptible to alteration.

3. "That the things which are not shaken may remain - Even 'the new heavens and the new earth,' Revelation 21:1." This quote points to the hope of a future, unshakable reality that will endure, referencing the promise of a new heavens and earth in the book of Revelation.
