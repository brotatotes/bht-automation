# Hebrews 12:28 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
We are partakers of a kingdom that cannot be shaken, where thankfulness and grace thrive in our Christian state of privilege. This kingdom, unchanging and unmovable, is a testament to the firmness and permanency of God's reign. As we serve God with reverent submission and fear, we hold fast to the grace that enables us to serve Him in every aspect of our lives, with an awareness of our own unworthiness and a tender, godly fear of offending His gracious majesty.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "receiving as we do a kingdom which cannot be shaken...being partakers of, coming into possession of, 'regnum capessere.'

2. "let us have thankfulness...ἀλγωμεν μηδὲ δυσπετῶμεν, ἀλλ ʼ εὐχαριστῶμεν τῷ τοιαῦτα καὶ ἤδη δόντι καὶ μελλοντι δώσειν"
3. "by which (thankfulness) let us serve God well-pleasingly with reverent submission and fear"

"In a government where nothing is settled; where all policy is changing, and where there are constantly vacillating plans, there is no inducement to enter on any enterprise demanding time and risk. But where the policy is settled; where the principles and the laws are firm; where there is evidence of permanency, there is the highest encouragement."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Thankfulness, not discontent, is the becoming feeling."
