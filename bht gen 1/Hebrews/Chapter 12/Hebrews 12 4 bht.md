### Henry Alford:
1. "Not yet have ye resisted unto blood" - The author suggests that this phrase may mean that the readers have not yet sacrificed their lives for their faith. However, the author prefers to interpret it as a pugilistic figure, emphasizing the intensity and perseverance required in the struggle against sin.

2. "The resisting that sin of unfaithfulness which would lead them to spare their blood, would if carried far enough, lead to the shedding of it." - The author explains that resisting the temptation to compromise their faith would ultimately lead to the shedding of blood. This highlights the high stakes and potential consequences of remaining faithful.

3. "The sin in their persecutors, which they were to resist, would, if yielded to, spare their blood by seducing them into apostasy." - The author emphasizes that the readers should also resist the sin in their persecutors, as giving in to that sin would spare their own blood by tempting them to abandon their faith. This highlights the importance of standing firm in the face of external pressures.
