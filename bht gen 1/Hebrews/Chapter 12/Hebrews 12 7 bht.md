# Hebrews 12:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, we are reminded that the afflictions and trials we endure are not without purpose. They serve as a form of discipline and correction from God, who treats us as beloved sons. Just as a wise father guides his children through chastisement, God's loving correction demonstrates His care for us and our relationship as His children. Through these challenges, we learn important lessons, grow in character, and discover our true identity as sons of God.
