# Hebrews 12:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we see the consequences of not experiencing discipline and the importance of it in demonstrating our true identity as children of God. Chastisement is not a punishment, but rather a loving discipline that distinguishes the legitimate sons from the bastards. It is a mark of sonship, an indication that we belong to God's family and that He cares for us. Without this discipline, we are like illegitimate children, lacking the true inheritance and identity of being God's sons and daughters.
