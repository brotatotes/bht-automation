# Hebrews 12:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, we are called to submit and be in subjection to the Father of spirits, recognizing His authority as the Creator and sustainer of our spirits. God's discipline and correction, far surpassing that of earthly parents, aims to prepare us for eternal life. In light of this, we should show reverence and meekness, acknowledging that our earthly parents are only the parents of our bodies, whereas God is the ultimate source of our souls. This verse reminds us of the importance of submitting to God's wisdom and sovereignty, trusting in His perfect discipline and guidance.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Shall we not much rather be in subjection to the Father of spirits and live?" - This quote highlights the call to submit to God as the Father of spirits, emphasizing the importance of recognizing His authority and seeking eternal life.

2. "To deal with the latter first: several explanations have been given. Understanding ἡμῶν, some have taken it as, the Creator of human souls." - This quote acknowledges the different interpretations of God being the Father of spirits, including the idea that He is the Creator of human souls.

3. "But, though this latter sense must not be excluded, being as it is manifestly operative in inducing present submission, to remember present dependence, so neither must the idea of origination be excluded, for it is from that fact that all a father’s rights and loving-kindnesses spring." - This quote emphasizes the importance of recognizing both the role of God as the upholder and cherisher of spirits, as well as the idea that He is the originator of all things.

Note: The commentary is quite lengthy, so I have provided three quotes that capture the main ideas discussed in the passage.

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "We had the fathers of our flesh as correctors."
2. "As 'Father of spirits,' He is both the Originator, and the Providential and Gracious Sustainer, at once of animal and spiritual life."
3. "God is a spirit Himself, and the Creator of spirits like Himself, in contrast to men who are flesh, and the progenitors of flesh."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "In God everything is without any intermingling of passion or any improper feeling."
2. "The effect of such discipline, properly administered, is to produce real veneration for a parent."
3. "Since God’s government is so much more perfect; since he has so much better right to control us; and since his administration is free from all the defects which attend parental discipline on earth, there is a much higher reason for bowing with submission and reverence to him."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Up to this point the suffering of Christians has been explained by God's fatherly relation to them. Now the emphatic point is that their fathers, with whom God is compared, were only earthly, human parents."
2. "The comparison is between the respect paid to a fallible, human parent, which may grow out of the natural relation, or may be due to fear, and the complete subjection to the divine Father."
3. "Their relation to us is limited; his is universal. They are related to us on the fleshly side; he is the creator of our essential life. Our relation to him is on the side of our eternal being."

### John Calvin:
1. "If we showed so much reverence to the fathers from whom we have descended according to the flesh, as to submit to their discipline, much more honor is due to God who is our spiritual Father."
2. "The discipline which fathers use as to their children is only useful for the present life, but God looks farther, having in view to prepare us for an eternal life."
3. "God regulates his discipline in the best manner, and with perfect wisdom, so that there is nothing in it but what is duly ordered."

### John Gill:
1. "Earthly parents; who are so called, because they are the immediate causes and instruments of the generation of their children, and of their fleshly bodies and worldly beings; and to distinguish them from the Father of spirits."
2. "Shall we not much rather be in subjection to the Father of spirits, and live? that is, to God, who is so called; not because he is the Creator of angels, who are spirits; but because he is the Creator of the souls of men."
3. "Now such ought to be in 'subjection' to him; not only as creatures to a Creator, and as subjects to their prince: but as children to a father, and particularly to him, as and when correcting; they should bow to his sovereignty, resign to his will, be humble under his mighty hand, be still and quiet, and bear all patiently."

1. "We neither despised nor fainted under their correction."
2. "Submit with reverence and meekness to the Father of spirits."
