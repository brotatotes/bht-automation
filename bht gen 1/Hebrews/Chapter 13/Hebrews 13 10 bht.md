# Hebrews 13:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
At the heart of the passage lies our altar, not to be elevated above the sacrifice offered upon it, but still a source of pride and foundation that we fiercely defend. Those who persist in the rites of the Jewish priesthood have no share in the blessings of the new covenant, for the participation in the great Christian sacrifice is reserved only for the believers. The figure of the altar encompasses the profound concepts of approach to God, atonement, salvation, and acceptance, all rooted in the sacrifice of Christ.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "That is our altar: not to be emphasized, nor exalted into any comparison with the adorable Victim thereon offered; but still our altar, that wherein we glory, that for which, as 'pro aris,' we contend: of which our banners, our tokens, our adornments, our churches, are full: severed from which, we know not Christ; laid upon which, He is the power of God, and the wisdom of God."
2. "We Christians have an altar whereof (even) they who serve the (Christian) tabernacle have no right to eat: i. e. as explained by Hofmann, as the high priest himself did not eat of the sin-offerings whose blood was brought into the tabernacle, but they were burnt without the camp, so we Christians have no sacrifice of which we have any right to eat, no further profit to be derived from that one sacrifice, by which we have been reconciled to God."
3. "The only true reference of our words, as also that which has been all but universally acknowledged, is that to the Jewish priesthood, and in them to those who have part with them in serving the rites and ordinances of the ceremonial law. These have no right to eat of our altar: for just as the bodies of those beasts whose blood was brought into the sanctuary were burnt without the camp, so Jesus suffered altogether without the gate of legal Judaism."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "They who serve the (Jewish) tabernacle," have no right to eat our spiritual Gospel meat."
2. "The Lord's table represents this altar, the cross; as the bread and wine represent the sacrifice offered on it."
3. "That not a literal eating of the sacrifice of Christ is meant in the Lord's Supper, but a spiritual is meant."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The design of the apostle is to show that the same thing substantially, so far as 'privilege' and 'sanctifying influence' were concerned, was enjoyed by Christians."
2. "The 'altar' to which he here refers is evidently the cross on which the great sacrifice was made."
3. "The participation in the great Christian sacrifice appertained only to those who were the friends of the Redeemer."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Those who persist in adhering to the Jewish economy can have no part in the blessing of the new covenant." 
2. "Rather the ideas of approach to God, - sacrifice, atonement, pardon and acceptance, salvation, - are gathered up and generally represented in the figure of an altar."
3. "The foundation of the figure is the sacrifice of the peace or thank - offering, in which the worshippers partook of the sacrifice."

### John Calvin:
1. "No wonder if the rites of the Law have now ceased, for this is what was typified by the sacrifice which the Levites brought without the camp to be there burnt."
2. "If we serve the tabernacle, that is, retain its ceremonies, we shall not be partakers of that sacrifice which Christ once offered."

### John Gill:

2. "Christ is a refuge to his people, that come from the four corners of the earth; and who believe in him, and lay hold on him, are preserved and protected by his power and grace."
3. "To 'eat' of it is to believe that Christ is come in the flesh, and is become an offering for sin, and for us that eat; it is to receive, embrace, and possess the blessings procured by it; which is done by faith, with spiritual joy and gladness, and with sincerity and singleness of heart."

### John Wesley:
1. "We have an altar — The cross of Christ."
2. "Whereof they have no right to eat — To partake of the benefits which we receive therefrom."
3. "Who serve the tabernacle — Who adhere to the Mosaic law."
