# Hebrews 13:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the commentators shed light on the significance of Jesus' sacrifice. They highlight the contrast between the sacrifices of the tabernacle servants, whose portions were shared, and Jesus' sacrifice, which was completely consumed. They emphasize that Jesus suffered outside the gate of Jerusalem, just as the sacrifices were burned outside the camp. By doing so, He fulfilled the Old Testament's sacrificial system and made atonement for our sins. His sacrifice extends to all believers, inviting us to participate in Christ's redemption, while the adherents of the old Mosaic law are excluded from these privileges.

### Henry Alford:
1. "Our great Sacrifice is not one of those in which the servants of the tabernacle had any share, but answers to one which was wholly taken out and burnt."
2. "There was a distinction in the sacrifices as to the subsequent participation of certain parts of them by the priests."
3. "The holy of holies, into which the blood of the sin-offering was brought on the day of atonement, only typified heaven, whither Christ as High Priest is entered with His Blood."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Jesus also that . . . suffered without the gate" - His crucifixion outside the gate of Jerusalem is a type of the ceremonial Judaism from which He was excluded.
2. "His sacrifice is not like one of those sacrifices in which they had a share but answers to one which was 'wholly burned' outside" - His sacrifice was completely consumed by burning, unlike the sacrifices in which the tabernacle servants had a share.
3. "No sin offering whereof any of the blood is brought into the tabernacle of the congregation to reconcile withal in the holy place, shall be eaten; it shall be burnt in the fire" - The sin offerings were either outward or inward, and the inward ones were not to be eaten but burnt completely.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The apostle is suggesting a new consideration to excite those whom he addressed to fidelity and perseverance."

3. "We should be willing to go out with him to that sacrifice, whatever reproach or shame it might be attended with."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The statement that the adherents of the old economy are excluded from the privileges of the new is justified by an illustrative argument drawn from the ceremonies of the Great Day of Atonement." 

2. "The victims for the Day of Atonement were a bullock and two young goats for sin-offerings, and two rams for burnt-offerings."

3. "Without the camp [εξω της παρεμβολης]. Burning without the camp was also required in the case of victims offered at the consecration of the priests, Exodus 29:14; at the sin-offering for the priest, Leviticus 4:11, Leviticus 4:12; and at the sin-offering for the congregation, Leviticus 4:21."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "The blood of which beasts" - The commentary explains the use of the phrase to refer to the sacrificial animals whose blood is being discussed in the verse.

1. "These beasts were slain, their blood was shed, and was brought into the most holy place, by the high priest; and was sprinkled on the mercy seat, and the horns of the altar of incense; and, by it, atonement was made for the priest, his house, and all Israel; which was a type of the death of Christ." 
2. "The shedding of his blood; the carrying of it into heaven; the sprinkling it upon the throne of grace and mercy; by which reconciliation is made for the sins of all God's people."
3. "The dolorous sufferings of Christ without Jerusalem, as the next verse shows; and points out the extent of his sufferings, reaching to all parts of his body, and even to his soul; and expresses not only the pains, but the shame and reproach he endured."

1. "According to their own law, the sin-offerings were wholly consumed, and no Jew ever ate thereof."
