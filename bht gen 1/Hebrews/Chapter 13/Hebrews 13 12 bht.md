# Hebrews 13:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus, in order to sanctify the people through his own blood, suffered outside the gate of Jerusalem, symbolically demonstrating his sacrifice's fulfillment of the old sin-offerings. This act of shedding his blood rendered the previous sacrifices obsolete by effectively reconciling believers with God. His suffering was not in vain, as through it he consecrated and set apart a new people, those who have faith in him, for a restored relationship with God.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Jesus also, that He might sanctify the people through His own blood." 
2. "His offering on earth, which was accomplished on the cross, and answered to the slaying of the legal victim and the destruction of its body by fire, the annihilation of the fleshly life." 
3. "His offering in the holy place above, which consisted in His entering heaven, the abode of God, through the veil, that is to say His flesh, and carrying His blood there as a standing atonement for the worldâ€™s sin."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "His blood has been brought into the heavenly sanctuary, and 'sanctifies the people' by cleansing them from sin, and consecrating them to God."
2. "The fiery ordeal of His suffering on the cross, answers to the burning of the victims; thereby His mere fleshly life was completely destroyed, as their bodies were."
3. "The second part of His offering was His carrying His blood into the heavenly holiest before God at His ascension, that it should be a perpetual atonement for the world's sin."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It is implied here that it was voluntary on the part of Jesus that he suffered out of the city; that is, it was so ordered by Providence that it should be so."
2. "If he had been killed in a tumult, it is possible that it might have been done as in other cases, even at the altar."
3. "The place where he was put to death was called Golgotha, the place of a skull, and hence, the Latin word which we commonly use in speaking of it, Calvary."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Agiazein to sanctify had a peculiar significance to Jews. It meant to set them apart as holy."
2. "For Christ's work he claims the same efficacy which the Jew claimed for the special call of God to Israel, and for the operation of the Jewish sacrificial system."
3. "The office of his atoning work is to sanctify; to make for himself a holy nation, a people 'prepared for the Lord'."

Note: The commentary is quite long, so I had to condense it significantly to fit within the word limit.

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The purpose of Jesus is shown, to sanctify, by his own blood." 
2. "The means employed, by his own blood." 
3. "The place of his suffering, outside the gate."

### John Gill:
1. "By 'the people' are meant the people who are the objects of divine love and favour; a chosen and covenant people; a distinct and peculiar people; Christ's own special people, by the gift of his Father to him."
2. "The sanctification of them does not design the internal sanctification of them, though this is from Christ, and in consequence of his blood; nor does it so much regard the cleansing of the filth of sin, though Christ's blood sanctifies, in this sense; but rather the expiation of the guilt of sin, which Christ has fully took away; complete pardon being procured, and a perfect righteousness brought in."
3. "Christ with his own blood, which he was, really, a partaker of; and his human nature, being in union with his divine person, as the Son of God, it had a virtue in it, to sanctify and cleanse from all sin, and to make full expiation of it; in shedding of which, and sanctifying with it, he has shown great love to his people."

### John Wesley:
1. "Jesus suffered without the gate of Jerusalem, symbolically representing the old camp of Israel. This act of sacrifice was meant to sanctify and reconcile the people who believe in him." 

2. "By shedding his own blood, Jesus fulfilled the purpose of the old sin-offerings and rendered them obsolete. His sacrifice was far more powerful and effective in reconciling humanity to God." 

3. "Jesus' suffering and sacrifice were not in vain. Through his blood, he consecrated and set apart a new people, those who have faith in him, to be in a right relationship with God."
