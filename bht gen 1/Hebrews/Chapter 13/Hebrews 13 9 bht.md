# Hebrews 13:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, the commentators warn against being swayed by diverse and strange teachings that deviate from the one true faith. They emphasize the need for a heart established with grace, rather than being deceived by external rituals or observances. It is important to remain rooted in the doctrine of grace, which provides stability and nourishment for faith. By focusing on the unchangeable Lord Jesus Christ and His saving grace, believers can avoid being carried away by false doctrines and find true spiritual grounding.
