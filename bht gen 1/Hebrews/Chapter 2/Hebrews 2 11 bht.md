# Hebrews 2:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Bible verse being described is a powerful reminder of the intimate bond between Christ and believers. Commentators emphasize the concept of sanctification, the process of being made holy and set apart for God. Christ, as the sanctifier, brings believers into a union with Him that is marked by a oneness and brotherhood. This union is not based on merit, but on the grace of God who deems believers worthy of being called His children. Through Christ, believers are not only sanctified, but also connected to a divine kinship that transcends all earthly relationships.
