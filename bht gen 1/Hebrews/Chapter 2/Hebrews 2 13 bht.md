## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Still, regarding the above-stated objection as of no weight, owing to the diversity of the two cited clauses, the one expressive of personal trust in God, the other declaratory respecting a relation to others... I prefer, as the more natural, the opinion which derives both texts from the same place of Isaiah." 

2. "In the passage of Isaiah (Hebrews 2:11-18), the Prophet is especially blaming the people of Judah under Ahaz, for having called in the help of the Assyrian king against Pekah king of Israel, and Rezin king of Syria... This confident speech of the Prophet our Writer adopts at once as the words of the greatest of all Prophets thereby assuming the prophetic office of Christ."

3. "So that our passage forms a notable instance of the prophetic office of Christ being taken as the antitype of the official words and acts of all the Prophets, just as His kingly office fulfils and takes up all that is said and done by the theocratic Kings, and His priestly office accomplishes all the types and ordinances of the O. T. Priesthood."
