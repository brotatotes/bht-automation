# Hebrews 2:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, it is emphasized that Christ became human in order to destroy the power of death and the devil. His death served as a means to break free from the tyranny of sin and to deliver those who are ungodly. Death, being the servant of the devil, was conquered by Christ through His incarnation, suffering, and death. By assuming humanity, Christ revealed the hidden power of God, ultimately defeating the devil and offering salvation to mankind.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The Death of Christ brought to nought the agency of the devil in death, because, that Death of His being not the penalty of His own sin, but the atoning sacrifice for the sin of the world, all those who by faith are united to Him can now look on death no longer as the penalty of sin, but only as the passage for them, as it was for Him, to a new and glorious life of triumph and blessedness."
2. "But for those who are not united to Him, death, retaining its character of a punishment for sin, retains also therewith all its manifold terrors."
3. "These persons whom Christ died to free, were all subject to this bondage induced by the fear of death. And these in fact were, all mankind; to whom the potential benefit of Christ’s death extends."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "He who has thus been shown to be the 'Captain of salvation' to the 'many sons,' by trusting and suffering like them, must therefore become man like them, in order that His death may be efficacious for them."
2. "The inner and more important element, the blood, as the more immediate vehicle of the soul, stands before the more palpable element, the flesh; also, with reference to Christ's blood-shedding with a view to which He entered into community with our corporeal life."
3. "Christ made Himself a sort of hook to destroy the devil; for in Him there was His humanity to attract the devourer to Him, His divinity to pierce him, apparent weakness to provoke, hidden power to transfix the hungry ravisher."

### Albert Barnes:

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The distinction between it and kekoinwnhken were partakers is correctly stated by Westcott; the latter marking the characteristic sharing of the common fleshly nature as it pertains to the human race at large, and the former signifying the unique fact of the incarnation as a voluntary acceptance of humanity."
2. "The sense of the passage is that Satan's dominion in the region of death is seen in the existence and power of the fear of death as the penalty of sin."
3. "Jesus assumes the mortal flesh and blood which are subject to this bondage. He proves himself to be both exempt from the fear of death and victorious over the accuser."

### John Calvin:
1. "The Son of God became man, that he might partake of the same condition and nature with us. What could be said more fitted to confirm our faith? Here his infinite love towards us appears."
2. "He put on our nature that he might thus make himself capable of dying, for as God he could not undergo death."
3. "He has so delivered us from the tyranny of the devil, that we are rendered safe, and he has so redeemed us from death, that it is no longer to be dreaded."

### Philip Schaff:

2. "That he might bring to nought (ινα καταργηση). Purpose of the incarnation clearly stated."
3. "By means of death" (his own death) Christ broke the power (κρατος) of the devil over death.

### John Gill:
1. "Christ became man also, or assumed an human nature like theirs; this shows that he existed before his incarnation, who of himself, and by his own voluntary act, assumed an individual of human nature into union with his divine person, which is expressive of wondrous grace and condescension."
2. "Christ's participation of human nature, and the children's, in some things agree, in others they differ; they agree in this, that it is real flesh and blood they both partake of; that Christ's body is not spiritual and heavenly, but natural as theirs is; and that it is a complete, perfect, human nature, and subject to mortality and infirmity like theirs."
3. "The true reason of Christ's assuming such a nature was on account of the children, which discovers great love to them, and shows that it was with a peculiar view to them that he became man; hence they only share the special advantages of his incarnation, sufferings, and death."

2. "Death is the devil's servant and serjeant, delivering to him those whom he seizes in sin." 
3. "That is, the devil — The power was manifest to all; but who exerted it, they saw not."
