## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "This help is not by Him rendered to angels: He is not the Captain of their salvation."
2. "The seed of Abraham then means, the Jewish race, among whom Christ was born in the flesh, and whom He did come primarily to help."
3. "The right view is taken by Witlich, Braun, Akersloot, Limborch, Calmet, Bengel, Peirce, Cramer, Michaelis, Ernesti (who however is wrong in saying it was the interpretation of the Greek Fathers), Storr, and the moderns almost without exception."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "For as we all know"; "For as you will doubtless grant." Paul probably alludes to Isaiah 41:8; Jeremiah 31:32, Septuagint, from which all Jews would know well that the fact here stated as to Messiah was what the prophets had led them to expect.
2. "It is not angels that He is helping (the present tense implies duration) but it is the seed of Abraham that He is helping." The verb is literally, to help by taking one by the hand, as in Jeremiah 31:32- :, "When I took them by the hand," c. Thus it answers to "succor," Hebrews 2:18, and "deliver," Hebrews 2:15.
3. "Not angels," who have no flesh and blood, but "the children," who have "flesh and blood," He takes hold of to help by "Himself taking part of the same" (Hebrews 2:15- :). Whatever effect Christ's work may have on angels, He is not taking hold to help them by suffering in their nature to deliver them from death, as in our case.

### Albert Barnes:

"He took not on him the nature of angels... but of the seed of Abraham he taketh hold." - The commentary explains that Jesus did not take on the nature of angels to aid them, but rather he became a man to help humanity.

3. "He came to help the descendants of Abraham... though this does not exclude the idea that he died for the whole human race." - The commentary clarifies that while Jesus specifically came to aid the descendants of Abraham, his death and redemption extend to all of humanity.

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "He did not appropriate the nature of angels. Angels did not need to be delivered from the fear of death."
2. "The entire statement in vers. 16, 17 is not a mere repetition of vers. 14, 15. It carries out the line of thought and adds to it, while at the same time it presents a parallel argument to that in vers. 14, 15."
3. "Christ gives that peculiar help the necessity of which was exhibited in the O. T. economy under which the original seed of Abraham lived."

### John Calvin:
1. "He never did so much for angels. As then it was necessary that there should be a remarkable remedy for man’s dreadful ruin, it was the design of the Son of God that there should be some incomparable pledge of his love towards us which angels had not in common with us."
2. "That he preferred us to angels was not owing to our excellency, but to our misery."
3. "There is therefore no reason for us to glory as though we were superior to angels, except that our heavenly Father has manifested toward us that ampler mercy which we needed."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The word 'Verily' is feeble, as is even assuredly. The word means, it is known, admitted, and admitted everywhere; it is nowhere questioned."
2. "It is not angels whom Christ delivers, nor is it angels He succours, but the seed of Abraham, the theocratic name of the people of God peculiar to Paul."
3. "The tense is present, the voice is middle, and the word 'nature' is not expressed, and can hardly be supplied, so that we seem shut up to the meaning which is admittedly found in Hebrews 8:9, and in other sixteen places where it is used in N. T., including 1 Timothy 6:19, and seven passages in the Acts."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Verily (δε που). 'Now in some way,' only here in N.T." - This quote highlights the unique usage of the phrase "δε που" in the verse, emphasizing that it carries a specific meaning not found elsewhere in the New Testament.

2. "Doth he take hold (επιλαμβανετα). Present middle indicative and means to lay hold of, to help..." - This quote explains the meaning of the phrase "επιλαμβανετα," emphasizing that it conveys the idea of God reaching out to assist or support.

### John Gill:
1. "He never took, as the Vulgate Latin version more rightly renders it; at no time, in no place; nor is it said in any place of Scripture that he did; this is a certain truth, and not to be disputed."
2. "Christ assumed human nature as derived from Abraham; for the Messiah was to spring from Abraham, and is promised, as that seed of his, in whom all nations should be blessed."
3. "The word here used signifies to catch hold of anyone ready to perish, or to lay hold on a person running away, and with great vehemence and affection to hold anything fast, that it be not lost, and to help persons, and do good unto them; all which may be observed in this act of Christ's, in assuming an individual of human nature, in Abraham's line, into union with his divine person."
