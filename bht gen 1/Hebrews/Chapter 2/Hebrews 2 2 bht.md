### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The Mosaic law was spoken by the ministration of angels, whereas the Gospel was first spoken by the Lord alone."

2. "The slightest infraction of the Law was sure to be punished. It made no provision for indulgence in sin; it demanded prompt, implicit, and entire obedience."
3. "The Law threatened punishment for each and every offence, and made no allowance for transgression in any form."

### Marvin Vincent:

### John Calvin:

3. "The doctrine of which God shows himself to be the avenger, is by no means unprofitable or unimportant."

### Philip Schaff:

2. "The command was confirmed in authority and obligation by the punishment of transgressors."
3. "Every violation of the command is here included: all actual transgression of the law in the first, and all neglect or contempt of divine precepts in the second."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Through angels" - Allusion to the use of angels by God at Sinai as in Acts 7:38; Acts 7:53; Galatians 3:19, though not in the O.T., but in Josephus (Ant. XV. 156).
2. "Transgression and disobedience" - Both words use παρα as in παραρυωμεν, refused to obey (stepping aside, παρα-βασις as in Romans 2:23), neglect to obey (παρ-ακοη as in Romans 5:19), more than a mere hendiadys.
3. "Recompense of reward" - Late double compound, like μισθαποδοτης (Hebrews 11:6), from μισθος (reward) and αποδιδωμ, to give back. The old Greeks used μισθοδοσια.

### John Gill:
1. "This is called 'the word', and a terrible one it was; it was a voice of words, which they that heard entreated they might hear no more."
2. "Jehovah the Father's voice was never heard; when he came to give the law, ten thousand angels came along with him; and the ministry of these he used in the delivery of the law."
3. "And every transgression and disobedience received a just recompense of reward; every precept of the law had a penalty annexed to it; and every breach of it was punished as that penalty required."
