## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "It is MAN who in the Psalm is spoken of, in the common and most general sense: the care taken by God of him, the lordship given to him, the subjection of God’s works to him."
2. "Whatever high and glorious things can be said of man, belong de proprio jure to Him only, propriâ personâ to Him only, but derivatively to us His brethren and members."
3. "To hold that our Lord is from the first intended by ἄνθρωπος and υἱὸς ἀνθρώπου here, is to disturb altogether the logical sequence, which runs thus: ‘It is not to angels that He has subjected the latter dispensation, but to man. Still, we do not see man in possession of this sovereignty. No; but we do see Jesus, whose humiliation fulfilled the conditions of manhood, crowned with glory and honour, and thus constituted the Head of our race, so that His death and sufferings were our deliverance and our perfecting."

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Paul proves that it is to MAN, not to angels, that God has subjected the 'world to come.'"
2. "How insignificant in himself, yet how exalted by God's grace!"
3. "The Hebrew, 'Enosh' and 'Ben-Adam,' express 'man' and 'Son of man' in his weakness: 'Son of man' is here used of any and every child of man."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The argument of the apostle is this, that there stood in the sacred Scriptures a declaration that 'all things were placed under the control and jurisdiction of man,' but that that had not yet been accomplished."
2. "The argument of Paul seems to be this: Originally this control was given to man. It was absolute and entire. All things were subject to him, and all obeyed. Man was made a little lower than the angels, and was the undisputed lord of this lower world."
3. "What is man ... - What is there in man that entitles him to so much notice? Why has God conferred on him so signal honors? Why has he placed him over the works of his hands?"

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The Hebrew interrogation, mah, what, what kind of, implies 'how small or insignificant' compared with the array of the heavenly bodies; not 'how great is man.'" 

2. "The direct reference of these words cannot be to the Messiah, yet one is reminded that the Son of man was Christ's own title for himself."

3. "Thou didst for some little time make him lower than the angels. He who has been described as superior to the angels, was, for a short time, on the same plane with man, and identified with an economy which was under the administration of angels."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "It is human nature that is thus honoured human nature, not probably in its original state, but as subject to death because of sin, the chief quality in which angels excel men."
2. "Both senses are true of man as fallen and redeemed, and of Christ as incarnate and suffering."
3. "The expression is applied in Scripture to magistrates and rulers, who are ‘hedged round with a Divinity,’ and the word is rendered ‘than kings’ in the Chaldee paraphrase."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "The insignificance of man is implied." 
2. "Not ο υιος του ανθρωπου which Jesus used so often about himself, but literally here 'son of man' like the same words so often in Ezekiel, without Messianic meaning here."
3. "Second person singular present indicative middle of επισκεπτομα, old verb to look upon, to look after, to go to see (Matthew 25:36), from which verb επισχοπος, overseer, bishop, comes."

### John Gill:
1. "The passage stands in Psalms 8:4 which psalm belongs to the times of the Messiah, as appears from the non-application of it to others; and from the application of a passage in it to the children in his time, Matthew 21:16 by Christ himself, and of the passage here by the apostle."
2. "Not of man in a state of innocence; there were no babes nor sucklings in paradise, nor enemies to restrain; 'Enosh', the word for man, signifies a frail mortal man, which Adam then was not; nor could he be called the son of man; nor can it so well suit with him, to be said to be made a little lower than the angels, and then crowned with glory and honour."
3. "What is said of him suits with him, as that God was 'mindful of him'; which may be expressive of his love and delight in, and choice of his human nature, to be taken into union with his divine person; and of his counsel and covenant in preparing it for him; and of his uniting it to his person; and of his providential care of it, and great affection for it; of his unction of it, and of his great regard to it in its sufferings, by supporting it, and in raising it from the dead."

### John Wesley:
1. "What is man — To the vast expanse of heaven, to the moon and the stars which thou hast ordained!"
2. "The words here cited concerning dominion were doubtless in some sense applicable to Adam; although in their complete and highest sense, they belong to none but the second Adam."
3. "Or the son of man, that thou visitest him — The sense rises: we are mindful of him that is absent; but to visit, denotes the care of a present God."
