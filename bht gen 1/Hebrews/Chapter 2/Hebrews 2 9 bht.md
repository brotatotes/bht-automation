## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "We behold (by faith: a different Greek verb from that for 'we see,' which expresses the impression which our eyes passively receive from objects around us; whereas, 'we behold,' or 'look at,' implies the direction and intention of one deliberately regarding something which he tries to see." 
2. "He is already crowned, though unseen by us, save by faith; hereafter all things shall be subjected to Him visibly and fully."
3. "His exaltation after sufferings is the perfecting or consummation of His work for us: without it His death would have been ineffectual; with it, and from it, flows the result that His tasting of death is available for every man."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "We see Jesus, for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honor, so as that, by the grace of God, he might taste of death for every man."

3. "When we look on the weakness and sinfulness of our race, we may well ask, what is man that God should honor him or regard him?

This statement emphasizes the profound honor and dignity bestowed upon humanity through Jesus' incarnation and exaltation.

2. "Christ was made a little lower than the angels by becoming man, and assuming a body frail and mortal, that he might die for his church and people."
