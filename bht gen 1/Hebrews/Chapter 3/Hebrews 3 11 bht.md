# Hebrews 3:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Bible verse under consideration reveals that the oath of God preceded the forty years, and it extended beyond the exclusion of unbelieving individuals from the land of rest. The rest promised to the believers is yet to come. When God swore with determination and certainty, He established a punishment that matched their disobedient acts. This punishment of being deprived of God's promised rest in the land of Canaan was a direct consequence of their continuous offenses. The acts and the corresponding punishment are inseparable, forming two sides of the same coin.

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The oath of God preceded the forty years."
2. "The threat extended farther than the exclusion of the unbelieving from the literal land of rest."
3. "The rest promised to the believing in its full blessedness was, and is, yet future."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "God is often represented in the Scriptures as 'swearing' - and usually as swearing by himself, or by his own existence. Of course this is figurative, and denotes a strong affirmation, or a settled and determined purpose."

2. "The word 'if' has this negative meaning in Hebrew, and this meaning is transferred to the Greek word 'if.' It is called 'my rest' here, meaning that it was such rest as God had provided, or such as he enjoyed."

3. "The meaning is, that he formed and expressed a deliberate and solemn purpose that they should never enter into the promised land. Whether this 'rest' refers here to heaven, and whether the meaning is that God would exclude them from that blessed world, will be more appropriately considered in the next chapter."

### John Calvin:
1. "It was the punishment of their madness, that they were deprived of the rest promised them."
2. "The land of Canaan was to be, according to the promise, their perpetual inheritance; and it was in reference to this promise that God called it his rest."
3. "God then does not here ascribe their expulsion from the land to this instance of tempting him as to the first cause; but he intimates that by no chastisement could they have been restored to a sound mind, but that they continually added new offenses."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The acts corresponded to the punishment is the meaning of 'as;’ the punishment corresponded to the acts is the meaning of so."

2. "First aorist active indicative of ομνυω, old verb for solemn oath."

### John Gill:
1. "Swearing is ascribed to God, to show the certainty of the thing spoken of; as of mercies, when he swears in love, and by his holiness; so here, of punishment, when he swears in wrath, in indignation, in sore displeasure, and the threatened evil is irrevocable and inevitable."
2. "They shall not enter into my rest; into the land of Canaan, called God's rest, because he promised it, and gave it to the Israelites as their rest; and where he himself had a place of rest; and where he gave the Messiah, the author of peace and rest; and which was a type of heaven, that rest from toil and labour, which remains for the people of God."
3. "For the Jews say, 'the generation of the wilderness have no part in the world to come:' but this seems too harsh, for doubtless there were many who died in the wilderness, that went safe to heaven, notwithstanding all their sins and provocations."
