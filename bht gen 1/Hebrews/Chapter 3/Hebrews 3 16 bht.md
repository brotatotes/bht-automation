# Hebrews 3:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse described warns against the danger of unbelief and disobedience, drawing from the example of the Israelites in the wilderness. Commentators note that the majority of the Israelites rebelled and fell because of their unbelief, serving as an admonition to Christians. This serves as a reminder that a good beginning does not guarantee a good end, and that faithfulness is required throughout the journey. Despite this, there is hope as God preserves a faithful minority to serve Him even in the worst of times.
