# Hebrews 3:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we find a continuation of thought rather than a contrast, emphasizing the connection between God's anger towards past sins and the potential for His anger towards our own. The term "carcases" evokes a gruesome and violent scene, highlighting the consequences of sin, both physically and spiritually. The phrase "with them that sinned" emphasizes the communal aspect of sin, demonstrating that sin is not an isolated act but has a collective impact. This warning serves as an example of the dangers of unbelief and the need to guard against departing from God.
