3. "The idea of such a reading being 'an alteration to remove a seeming roughness of style' is simply absurd, the roughness existing not in the received text and LXX, but in the expression 'to harden in trying.'" This commentary challenges the notion that the alternate reading was an attempt to smooth out the text, emphasizing that the roughness is actually present in the received text.
