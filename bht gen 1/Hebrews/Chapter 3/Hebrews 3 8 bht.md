# Hebrews 3:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse at hand warns against hardening our hearts, a conscious act that obstructs the entrance of God's grace. It refers to the provocation and temptation faced by the Israelites, exemplifying their lack of faith and habitual disobedience. The Israelites' repeated testing of God's patience serves as a cautionary tale, reminding us of the perils of doubting His faithfulness. Yet, God's response is not one of anger or abandonment, but rather a display of His patience and mercy as He continues to provide for and lead His people.
