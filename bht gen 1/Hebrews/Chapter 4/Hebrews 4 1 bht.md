# Hebrews 4:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Let us approach our salvation with fear and trembling, not with slavish terror, but with godly fear and caution as we work out our salvation. There is a promise of rest from God that remains unchanged and holds good. We should fear the treacherous nature of our hearts and be vigilant against anything that may endanger our spiritual safety. This fear should not lead to doubt, but rather inspire courage, freedom, and a careful circumspection as we strive to reach the goal of the promised rest for our souls and bodies.
