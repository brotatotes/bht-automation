# Hebrews 4:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This verse speaks of a rest that goes beyond mere physical or temporal rest, but rather a spiritual and eternal rest that believers will experience in the presence of God. It serves as a reminder that our journey of faith is not yet complete until we enter into this ultimate rest that God has prepared for us. This rest encompasses freedom from the toils and struggles of this world, liberation from sin and its consequences, and a deep sense of peace and joy found in the perfect presence of God.

Note: The commentary is quite lengthy, so I have selected three quotes that provide a concise understanding of the verse.

### John Calvin:
1. "The chief good of man is nothing else but union with God; this is attained when we are formed according to him as our exemplar."

These quotes highlight the idea that true happiness and fulfillment come from being united with God and living according to His will.

While the full realization of this rest may not be possible in this life, we are encouraged to continually strive for it.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "But Christ is not named in the previous context, and is nowhere designated as ‘He who entered or is entered into His rest,’ nor would the argument have force with those who were questioning His mission."
