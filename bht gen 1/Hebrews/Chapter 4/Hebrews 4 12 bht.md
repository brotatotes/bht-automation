# Hebrews 4:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Word of God is a powerful and penetrating force, displaying both judicial power and salvation. It divides the soul and spirit, exposing the deepest parts of our being. It is all-penetrating, searching the thoughts and intentions of the heart, bringing truth to light. Like a sharp sword, it inflicts wounds, revealing hypocrisy and self-deception. It is living and powerful, quickening and discerning, able to bring life or death to the hearers.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The qualities here attributed to the word of God, and the whole context, show that it is regarded in its JUDICIAL power, whereby it doomed the disobedient Israelites to exclusion from Canaan, and shall exclude unbelieving so-called Christians from the heavenly rest."
2. "The same word which is saving to the faithful is destroying to the disobedient."
3. "The word of God divides the closely joined parts of man's immaterial being, soul and spirit, and penetrates to the innermost parts of the spirit."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The truth of God is all-penetrating and searching, and that the real thoughts and intents of the heart will be brought to light, and that if there is insincerity and self-deception there can be no hope of escape."
2. "The Word of God is 'what God speaks' - whether it be a promise or a threatening; whether it be Law or gospel; whether it be a simple declaration or a statement of a doctrine."
3. "The Word of God reaches the 'heart' - the very center of action, and lays open the motives and feelings of the man."
4. "The Word of God is like a sharp sword that inflicts deadly wounds. The sinner 'dies;' that is, he becomes dead to his former hopes, or is 'slain' by the Law."
5. "The truth of God will detect the feelings of the hypocrite and self-deceiver. They cannot always conceal their emotions, and the time will come when truth, like light poured into the soul, will reveal their unbelief and their secret sins."

### Marvin Vincent:

2. "The word of God penetrates to the inmost recesses of our spiritual being as a sword cuts through the joints and marrow of the body."

### John Calvin:
1. "Whenever the Lord addresses us by his word, he deals seriously with us, in order that he may touch all our inmost thoughts and feelings; and so there is no part of our soul which ought not to be roused."
2. "The word of God is far from being so efficacious towards [the reprobate] as to penetrate into them to the dividing of the soul and the spirit."
3. "The sum of the whole then is this, â€” that as soon as God opens his sacred mouth, all our faculties ought to be open to receive his word; for he would not have his word scattered in vain, so as to disappear or to fall neglected on the ground, but he would have it effectually to constrain the consciences of men, so as to bring them under his authority."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The words which I have spoken are spirit and are life." (John 6:63)

3. "God's word like his eye sees the secret lurking doubt and unbelief 'of the thoughts and intents of the heart'." (Hebrews 4:12)

### John Gill:
1. "For the word of God is quick and powerful... Christ, the author, sum, and substance of it, is the living God, omnipotent and omniscient."
2. "He is quick, or, as it may be better rendered, 'living'; he has life in himself as God, he is the living God; he is the living Redeemer and Mediator, and he lives for ever as man."
3. "He is powerful, as he appears to be in the creation and sustaining of all things; in his miracles and ministrations; in the work of man's redemption; in the preservation of his people, and in his advocacy and intercession."
4. "He is sharper than any twoedged sword... by which he pierces the hearts of men, cuts them to the quick, and lays them open."
5. "He is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart; Christ knows what is in man; he is the searcher of the hearts, and the trier of the reins of the children of men."

2. "Sharper than any two-edged sword...penetrating the heart more than this does the body."
3. "A discerner...not only of the thoughts, but also of the intentions."
