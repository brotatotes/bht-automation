# Hebrews 4:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
We have a great High Priest, surpassing all others, for He is Jesus, the Son of God, who is both our Forerunner and our High Priest in Heaven. He has passed through the heavens into the very throne of God, offering Himself as a sacrifice and interceding for us. Let us, therefore, steadfastly hold onto our confession of faith, for it is through Christ as our High Priest that we have access to God and receive the blessings of His grace.
