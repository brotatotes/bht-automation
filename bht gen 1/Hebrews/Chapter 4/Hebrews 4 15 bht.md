# Hebrews 4:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Bible verse under consideration portrays a unique and compassionate High Priest who sympathizes with humanity's weaknesses and temptations. This Priest exemplifies tenderness, kindness, and understanding towards those who are feeble and in need of encouragement. Although sinless, His shared human nature equips Him to relate intimately to the struggles, infirmities, and trials experienced by mankind. The exalted majesty of this Son of God should inspire reverence and obedience, while His ability to conquer sin enables Him to extend a helping hand to all.
