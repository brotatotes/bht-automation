# Hebrews 4:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Approach the throne of grace with confidence, for it is where God, our reconciled Father, dispenses blessings in a way of unmerited favor. Boldly bring your wants and shortcomings to our sympathetic high priest on the throne. This is a spiritual act, a sacerdotal duty of prayer, where we seek mercy and obtain all the blessings of grace that we need.

### Albert Barnes:

2. "We come not depending on our own merits, but we come where a sufficient sacrifice has been offered for human guilt; and where we are assured that God is merciful."
3. "We need pardon - as the first thing when we come to God. We are guilty and self-condemned - and our first cry should be for 'mercy' - 'mercy'."

### Marvin Vincent:

### John Calvin:
1. "And the chief benefit of divine teaching is a sure confidence in calling on God, as, on the other hand, the whole of religion falls to the ground, and is lost when this certainty is taken away from consciences."
2. "For we must hold this principle, â€” that Christ is not really known as a Mediator except all doubt as to our access to God is removed; otherwise the conclusion here drawn would not stand, 'We have a high priest Who is willing to help us; therefore we may come bold and without any hesitation to the throne of grace.'"
3. "The import of the whole is, that we are to call upon God without fear, since we know that he is propitious to us, and that this may be done is owing to the benefit conferred on us by Christ."

2. "And this coming to him is a sacerdotal act, for every believer is a priest; and is not local, but spiritual, and with the heart, and by faith; and chiefly regards the duty of prayer, and a drawing nigh to God in that ordinance with spiritual sacrifices to offer unto him."
