# Hebrews 4:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse being described talks about entering into a future rest promised by God. This rest is something yet to be experienced by believers and pertains to a heavenly rest. It is a rest that remains for the people of God and is different from the rest of the promised land. Faith is crucial for entering into this rest, and unbelief is what shuts people out. This rest is not in reference to the finished creation, but rather it is a spiritual rest found in Christ under the Gospel dispensation.
