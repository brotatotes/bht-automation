# Hebrews 4:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse under discussion highlights the concept of God's rest, which remains to be experienced by believers. This rest was promised in the Scriptures but was not inherited by those to whom it was first preached due to their lack of faith. The entrance into this divine rest is not an empty promise, as God always carries out what He has purposed. Therefore, there is a need for appropriation and faith in order to enter into the rest that God has prepared.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Since what God once purposed, He always purposes."
2. "The entrance itself, as such, is so."
3. "He limiteth a certain day, saying 'To-day' in David."

Note: The commentary is quite lengthy and difficult to understand, but these quotes provide some insight into the verse.

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "The denial of entrance to unbelievers is a virtual promise of entrance to those that believe."
2. "God wishes not His rest to be empty, but furnished with guests."
3. "They to whom it was first preached entered not...in type."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Since there is a rest spoken of in the Scriptures, implying that it is to be enjoyed by some, and since they to whom it was first promised did not inherit it, it follows that it must still be in reserve."
2. "It has the appearance of being 'suggested' to him as a new thought of importance, and which he preferred to place even in the midst of the summing up of the argument rather than omit it altogether."
3. "The implied argument to prove this is: (1) That there was a 'rest' spoken of which deserved to be called a 'divine rest,' or the 'rest of God;' (2) It could not be supposed that God would prepare such a rest in vain, for it would follow that if he had suited up a world of rest, he designed that it should be occupied."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The promise has not been appropriated. It must be appropriated in accordance with God's provision."
2. "The rest was not provided for nothing. God's provision of a rest implies and involves that some enter into it."
3. "They to whom it was first preached. Lit. they who were first the subjects of the announcement of the glad tidings."

Note: The commentary is about Hebrews 4:6-7.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "In all these verses where 'it remains' is used, the phrase has the same meaning not that a rest now remains and is still future, but that the promise was not fulfilled in the Sabbath-rest or in the Canaan-rest."
2. "It awaited the faith and the entrance which were to exhaust its meaning."
3. "The promise of entering God's rest still stands, but some have failed to enter because of unbelief."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "It remaineth... Here the infinitive clause (τινας εισελθειν εις αυτην) is the subject of απολειπετα."
2. "This left-over promise is not repeated, though not utilized by the Israelites under Moses nor in the highest sense by Joshua and David."
3. "Failed to enter in (ουκ εισηλθον). 'Did not enter in' (second aorist active indicative of εισερχομα). It is a rabbinical argument all along here, but the author is writing to Jews."

### John Gill:
1. "Some must enter therein; for God's swearing concerning some, that they should not enter into his rest, supposes that others should."
2. "The Gospel was first preached, namely, the Israelites in the wilderness: entered not in because of unbelief."
3. "Entered not in because of unbelief."
