# Hebrews 4:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse being described talks about a rest that goes beyond the physical rest Joshua brought to the people of Israel in the land of Canaan. It points to a spiritual rest, a fulfillment of God's promises, that can only be found in Christ. This rest is not earned through our own efforts, but is received as a gift by placing our faith in the finished work of Christ on the cross. It is a state of peace and assurance, where we cease striving and find true rest in God.

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

3. "This suggests that the rest of God is not merely a physical place, but a spiritual state of being that goes beyond the boundaries of a specific land."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The object is to prove that Joshua did not give the people of God such a rest as to make it improper to speak of a 'rest' after that time."
2. "Joshua did give them a rest in the promised land; but it was not all which was intended, and it did not exclude the promise of another and more important rest."

### John Calvin:
1. "He denies this to be the final rest to which the faithful aspire, and which we have also in common with the faithful of that age; for it is certain that they looked higher than to that land; nay, the land of Canaan was not otherwise so much valued except for this reason, because it was an image and a symbol of the spiritual inheritance."
2. "They to whom David addressed the Psalm were in possession of that land, but they were reminded of the duty of seeking a better rest."
3. "Though our salvation is as yet in hope, yet as to the truth, it leads directly to heaven; nor does Christ extend his hand to us, that he may conduct us by the circuitous course of types and figures, but that he may withdraw us from the world and raise us up to heaven."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Clearly, therefore, the Psalm speaks of a Divine rest into which men are bidden to enter, different from the rest of Canaan, and long subsequent to it."
2. "For if Joshua had given them rest had led them into the rest of which we are speaking He would not have gone on speaking after that of another day."
3. "God...describes the rest as still unentered."

These quotes highlight the idea that the rest mentioned in the Psalm is a divine rest that is different from the rest of Canaan and is still unentered. It also emphasizes that if Joshua had already led them into this rest, God would not have spoken of another day, indicating that this rest is still future.

"Joshua was a type of Christ in many actions of his life; in the miracles he wrought, or were wrought for him; in the battles he fought, and the victories he obtained; in saving Rahab and her family; in receiving the Gibeonites, who came submissively to him; and in leading the children of Israel into Canaan's land, which he divided to them by lot."
2. "Joshua was a temporal saviour, Christ a spiritual one; and in their office they were both servants; and in their qualifications for their office, such as wisdom, courage, faithfulness, and integrity."
3. "Though he brought them into a land of rest, into the typical rest, where they had rest for a while from their temporal enemies, yet he did not give them the true spiritual rest."

### John Wesley:
1. "The rest refers to the fulfillment of God's promises, the ultimate rest that comes from being in a right relationship with Him."
2. "This rest is not merely a physical or temporal rest, but a spiritual rest that is found in Christ."
3. "It is a rest from striving and trying to earn salvation, and instead, it is a rest in the finished work of Christ on the cross."
4. "This rest is not something that we can achieve on our own, but it is a gift from God that we receive by faith."
