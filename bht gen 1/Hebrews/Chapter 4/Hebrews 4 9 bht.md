# Hebrews 4:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Bible verse being described speaks of a sacred rest, a Sabbath-rest that remains for the people of God. This rest points to the idea of a heavenly, eternal rest with God. It is a rest that has not yet been fully realized, but it is a promise that believers have hope in and eagerly await. This rest is beyond the earthly Sabbath, beyond the rest in the land of Canaan, and it foreshadows the eternal rest that awaits the true Israel, the people of God.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Therefore there remains a keeping of sabbath...God’s rest was a σαββατισμός; so also will ours be." 
2. "For He that entered into his (own or God’s) rest, Himself also rested from His works like as God rested from His own."
3. "Thus, as Ebrard says, Jesus is placed in the liveliest contrast to Joshua, who had not brought God’s people to their rest; and is designated as ‘That one, who entered into God’s rest.’"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "God's rest was a Sabbatism; so also will ours be."
2. "The 'rest' in Hebrews 4:9 is the nobler and more exalted (Hebrew) 'Sabbath' rest; literally, 'cessation': rest from work when finished."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The meaning is this, that according to the Scriptures there is 'now' a promise of rest made to the people of God."
2. "It properly means 'a keeping Sabbath' from σαββατίζω sabbatizō - 'to keep Sabbath.' This word, not used in the New Testament, occurs frequently in the Septuagint... It means here 'a resting,' or an observance of sacred repose - and refers undoubtedly to heaven, as a place of eternal rest with God."
3. "Heaven will be like a Sabbath. The best description of it is to say it is 'an eternal Sabbath.' Take the Sabbath on earth when best observed, and extend the idea to eternity, and let there be separated all idea of imperfection from its observance, and that would be heaven."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "A sabbath rest (σαββατισμος). Late word from σαββατιζω (Exodus 16:30) to keep the Sabbath, apparently coined by the author." 
2. "Here it is parallel with καταπαυσις (cf. Revelation 14:13)."
