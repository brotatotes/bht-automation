### Albert Barnes:

### John Calvin:
1. "For every high priest, etc. He compares Christ with the Levitical priests, and he teaches us what is the likeness and the difference between them; and the object of the whole discourse is, to show what Christ’s office really is, and also to prove that whatever was ordained under the law was ordained on his account."
2. "This he says of the priests. It hence follows that it was necessary for Christ to be a real man; for as we are very far from God, we stand in a manner before him in the person of our priest, which could not be, were he not one of us."
3. "The benefit is expressed in these words, ordains those things which pertain to God. They may, indeed, be explained in two ways, as the verbκαθίσταται has a passive as well as an active sense. They who take it passively give this version, 'is ordained in those things,' etc.; and thus they would have the preposition in to be understood; I approve more of the other rendering, that the high priest takes care of or ordains the things pertaining to God; for the construction flows better, and the sense is fuller."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Taken as he is from among men affirms part of the quality of a priest, and is so regarded by most commentators."

2. "And such an one is ordained for men; in their room and stead, and for their good; and above them, as the word sometimes signifies; he was exalted unto, and invested with a superior office."
3. "In things pertaining to God; in things in which God had to do with men; and so he presided over them in the name of God, and declared the will of God unto them, and blessed them."
