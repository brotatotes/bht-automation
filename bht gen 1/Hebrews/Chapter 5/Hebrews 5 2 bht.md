# Hebrews 5:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse being described emphasizes the role of a high priest who embodies compassion and understanding towards sinners. Commentators highlight the priest's moderation and sympathy, which stems from his own awareness of his limitations and weaknesses. This perspective enables him to extend kindness and leniency to those who are ignorant and erring, without condoning their actions. The priest's dual nature, caught between sorrow and blame, emphasizes the necessity of his ministry for all guilty and misguided individuals.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The word μετριοπαθέω is a word apparently invented to serve the view of the Peripatetic school, as opposed to the ἀπάθεια of the Stoics. They held that we ought to rule our passions by reason, and denominated such moderation μετριοπάθεια." 

2. "The meaning here therefore must be given according to this analogy, and the dative following explained as one of direction, or perhaps commodi towards the ignorant and erring as well as with the implication of ignorance."

3. "The sense might be filled up, ‘towards those who (possibly after all) are ignorant and deluded.’ And thus the propriety of the next clause is rendered still greater; both these, ἄγνοια and πλάνη, being the results of ἀσθένεια, with which he himself is encompassed."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Not showing stern rigor save to the obstinate."
2. "Ignorant—sins not committed in resistance of light and knowledge."
3. "Deluded through the fraud of Satan and their own carnal frailty and thoughtlessness."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The high priest is taken from among men, in order that he may have a fellow-feeling for those on whose behalf he officiates."
2. "Sensible of his own ignorance, he is able to sympathize with those who are ignorant; and compassed about with infirmity, he is able to succour those who have like infirmities."
3. "He is liable to err; He is subject to temptation; he must die, and appear before God - and encompassed with these infirmities, he is better qualified to minister in behalf of guilty and dying people."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "It signifies to be moderate or tender in judgment toward another's errors."
2. "Here it denotes a state of feeling toward the ignorant and erring which is neither too severe nor too tolerant."
3. "Sympathy belongs to the high-priestly office, and grows out of the sense of personal infirmity."

### John Calvin:
1. "The priest ought to be kind and gentle to sinners, because he partakes of their infirmities."
2. "Christ is a brother to us...by becoming a partaker of our infirmities, so that he is led, and as it were formed, to show forbearance and kindness."
3. "The sum of what is said is, that Christ is...led to show forbearance and kindness."
4. "Being capable of duly feeling for the ignorant and the erring."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The true position of a priest in relation to those who are not only suffering, but are also guilty, is between the two. His is a blended feeling of sorrow and blame." 
2. "The persons for whom the priest acts are not innocent, or the function would cease; they are sinners, and are described as ignorant and out of the way." 
3. "All men are blameably ignorant, and are out of the way; every sin is want of knowledge, as well as want of wisdom; we all have gone astray, and for all the priest acts."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "If the priest is cordially to plead with God for the sinner, he must bridle his natural disgust at the loathsomeness of sensuality, his impatience at the frequently recurring fall, his hopeless alienation from the hypocrite and the superficial, his indignation at any confession he hears from the penitent."
2. "People who sinned 'willingly' had no provision in the Levitical system. For deliberate apostasy no pardon is offered."
3. "The priest himself has weakness lying around him like a chain. Not so Jesus."

### John Gill:
1. "Who can have compassion on the ignorant,.... Who have committed sins of ignorance, and bring their sacrifices for them; these he does not insult and upbraid, nor break out into anger and indignation against; but pities them, and sympathizes with them."
2. "And on them that are out of the way; of God's commandments; who are like sheep going astray, and turn to their own way; who transgress the law of God, and err from it."
3. "For that he himself also is compassed with infirmity; not of body only, but of mind, sinful infirmity; he had much of it, it beset him all around."

### John Wesley:
1. "Who can have compassion — In proportion to the offence: so the Greek word signifies." 
2. "On the ignorant — Them that are in error."
3. "And the wandering — Them that are in sin."
4. "Seeing himself also is compassed with infirmity — Even with sinful infirmity; and so needs the compassion which he shows to others."
