# Hebrews 5:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Bible verse describes the high priesthood and its divine appointment. It emphasizes that the high priesthood is not self-appointed, but is received or called by God. Historically, the high priesthood was an important institution in Jewish society, having endured long in the Jewish polity. The verse also highlights the need for ministers or priests to be called by God rather than assuming the office through human effort or ambition. The high priesthood is a role that requires qualifications and evidence of divine calling, as demonstrated by Aaron's appointment and the prescribed rules in the Law of Moses.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "None taketh the office of the high priesthood to himself." (The commentary suggests that the high priesthood cannot be self-appointed or assumed, but must be received or called by God.)

2. "But only he who is called by God." (This quote emphasizes that the calling to the high priesthood is a divine appointment and not something that can be obtained through human effort or ambition.)

3. "This divine ordinance of Aaron and his sons to be high priests endured long in the Jewish polity." (The commentary highlights the historical significance of the high priesthood, indicating that it was a longstanding institution in Jewish society.)

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "No man—of any other family but Aaron's, according to the Mosaic law, can take to himself the office of high priest."
2. "The analogy in our Christian dispensation would warn ministers...that content with this, they should beware of assuming the sacrificial priesthood also, which belongs to Christ alone."
3. "No Christian minister, as such, is ever called Hiereus, that is, sacrificing priest. All Christians, without distinction, whether ministers or people, have a metaphorical, not a literal, priesthood."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "No one has a right to enter on this office unless he has the qualifications which God has prescribed."
2. "It was necessary that his successors should have as clear evidence that they were called of God to the office, as though they had been mentioned by name."

### John Calvin:
1. "What makes an office lawful is the call of God; so that no one can rightly and orderly perform it without being made fit for it by God."
2. "Christ then is a lawful priest, for he was appointed by God’s authority."
3. "No government is to be set up in the Church by the will of men, but that we are to wait for the command of God, and also that we ought to follow a certain rule in electing ministers, so that no one may intrude according to his own humor."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "A priest, moreover, who is God’s agent as well as man’s, has his appointment not from himself nor from man, but from God."
2. "Who are to present offerings to God, and whom God will accept, are questions that belong clearly to God Himself."
3. "We have under the Gospel one Priest only in the deeper sense of that word, a Mediator and a sacrifice, who has made complete atonement for sin."

### John Gill:
1. "The office of the high priest was a very honourable one; it was a peculiar honour to Aaron, and his sons, to be separated unto it; their instalment into it was very grand and solemn; at that time they were anointed with oil, and clothed with glorious garments, and sacrifices were offered for them; they had an honourable maintenance assigned them, and a large retinue of priests and Levites to attend them; great respect and reverence were shown them."

2. "Now no man might take this honourable office upon himself, or intrude himself into it, or obtain it by any unjust method, or in any other way than by a call from God; nor did any man dare to do it, until of late, when some got into it of themselves, and were put in by the Roman governors, and even purchased it of them."

3. "No one ought to be in this office, but he that is called of God, as [was Aaron]; whose call was immediately from the Lord, and was unquestionable: Moses was ordered to separate him, and his sons, from the children of Israel, and install them into this office; they were destroyed by fire, or swallowed up by the earth, that disputed his call; and this was confirmed by a miracle, by his dry rod budding, blooming, and bringing forth almonds."

### John Wesley:
1. "Whatever is excellent in the Levitical priesthood is in Christ, and in a more eminent manner."
2. "Whatever is wanting in those priests is in him."
3. "But it is observable, Aaron did not preach at all; preaching being no part of the priestly office."
