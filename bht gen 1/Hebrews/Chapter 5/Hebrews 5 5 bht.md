This Bible verse describes the appointment of Jesus Christ as the High Priest, a position not self-assumed but bestowed upon him by God the Father. It emphasizes the inseparable relationship between Christ's sonship and his role as the High Priest.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Thus Christ also (as well as those others) did not glorify HIMSELF to be made High Priest...but He (i.e. the Father) who spake to Him, Thou art my son, I have this day begotten thee." 
2. "It must be carefully observed, that the Writer does not adduce this text as containing a direct proof of Christ’s divine appointment to the High Priesthood: that follows in the next verse: nor again, does it merely assert, without any close connexion, that the same Divine Person appointed Him High Priest, who said to Him 'Thou art my Son': but it asserts, that such divine appointment was wrapped up and already involved in that eternal generation to the Sonship which was declared in these words."
3. "The true account seems to be this: the word ἐδόξασεν contains in it the whole process of exaltation (through suffering) by which the Lord Jesus has attained the heavenly High Priesthood. This whole process was not his own work, but the Father’s...He did not constitute himself the Son of God, in virtue ultimately of which sonship He ἐγενήθη ἀρχιερεύς."

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Christ did not constitute Himself the Son of God, but was from everlasting the only-begotten of the Father."
2. "On His Sonship depended His glorification, and His being called of God, as Priest."
3. "The connection of Sonship and priesthood is typified in the Hebrew title for priests being given to David's sons."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Jesus was not ambitious; that he did not obtrude himself into the great office of high priest; he did not enter upon its duties without being regularly called to it."
2. "He received his appointment from him. This was decisive in the case, and this was sufficient, if it could be made out, for the only claim which Aaron and his successors could have to the office, was the fact that they had received their appointment from God."
3. "The propriety of this application is founded on the fact that the language in the Psalm is of so general a character, that it may be applied to 'any' exaltation of the Redeemer, or to any honor conferred on him."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "He did not glorify himself, but God who styled him 'son' glorified him." 
2. "Thou art my Son is introduced thus in close connection with the call to the priesthood, in recognition of the fact that the priesthood of Christ had its basis in his sonship." 
3. "Christ's priestly vocation ceases to be an accident in his history, and becomes an essential characteristic of his position as Son: sonship, christhood, priestliness, inseparably interwoven."

### John Calvin:
1. "We must however bear especially in mind what we said on the first chapter; that the begetting of Christ, of which the Psalmist speaks, was a testimony which the Father rendered to him before men."
2. "One indued with no honor, with no power? Nay, one who was to be a Mediator between himself and man; his begetting then included his priesthood."
3. "Christ did not make himself a high priest but God."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "These requisites of the high priests are all found in Christ, and found in Him in such a degree as proves Him to be superior to all others."
2. "Christ also glorified not himself, took not the honour upon Himself to be made High Priest."
3. "God who acknowledges Him as His Son in a sense that raises Him above all creatures, God gives Him the office."

### Archibald T Robertson:

2. "God did glorify Jesus in appointing him priest."
3. "Clearly the Father nominated the Son to the Messianic priesthood."

### John Gill:
1. "It was a glorifying of Christ, to make him an high priest; not as God, for as such no addition can be made to his glory; yea, it was a condescension in him to become a priest: but as man." 

2. "It was an honour to the human nature to be united to the Son of God; and to be separated from others to this office; and to be called unto it, qualified for it, and invested with it; and to be of the order he was, and to do the work." 

3. "Christ did not take this high and honourable office to himself, nor the glory of it; indeed, he did not receive it from man, nor was he made a priest according to the ceremonial law; yet he did not intrude himself into this office."

### John Wesley:
1. "Christ glorified not himself to be an high priest... but received it from him who said, Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee." This highlights the humility of Christ, as he did not seek the honor of being a high priest on his own accord, but rather received it from God the Father. 

2. "Not, indeed, at the same time; for his generation was from eternity." This emphasizes the eternal nature of Christ's existence, as his generation as the Son of God was not a temporal event, but rather an eternal reality. 

3. "Psalm 2:7 reveals the divine declaration of the Father to the Son, affirming their eternal relationship and the Son's divine nature." This verse underscores the intimate relationship between God the Father and God the Son, highlighting the divine nature of Christ.
