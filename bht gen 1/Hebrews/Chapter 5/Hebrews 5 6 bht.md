# Hebrews 5:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This verse is a messianic prophecy, highlighting the change in priesthood and the eternal nature of Jesus' role as a high priest. Jesus is described as a priest forever in the order of Melchizedek, who serves as a model for his dual role as both king and priest. Unlike the Levitical priests, Jesus' priesthood is not based on genealogy but is eternally effective, offering a perfect atonement for sin and granting access to God's presence. This emphasizes the superiority of Jesus' priesthood over the Levitical system and points to him as the ultimate mediator between God and humanity.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "He, in whom all the theocratic promises find their fulfilment, in whom the true Kingdom of God comes and is summed up, was to be, as in Zechariah 6:12 ff., 'a priest upon His throne,' and such a priest as should be after the order of Melchisedek." 
2. "κατὰ τὴν τάξιν will be very nearly the same as κατὰ τὴν ὁμοιότητα; and the Peschito has this latter expression both in the Psalm, and throughout our Epistle."
3. "On εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα, as indeed on the detailed application of the several expressions to Christ, see on ch. Hebrews 7:20 ff."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "He is a Priest absolutely, because He stands alone in that character without an equal."
2. "He is 'High Priest' in respect of the Aaronic type, and also in respect to us, whom He has made priests by throwing open to us access to God."
3. "Melchisedec was at once man, priest, and king. Paul's selecting as the type of Christ one not of the stock of Abraham, on which the Jews prided themselves, is an intimation of Messianic universalism."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The Psalm referred to Christ, and this is one of the instances of quotation from the Old Testament respecting which there can be no doubt."
2. "The 'evidence' that it refers to the Messiah is such as the following: It cannot be referred to Jehovah himself, for he is expressly distinguished from him who is here addressed."
3. "The scope of the Psalm is such as to be applicable to the Messiah, and there is no part of it which would be inconsistent with such a reference."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Christ is prophetically pointed out in Psalms 110:0 as an eternal priest, independent of fleshly descent, a king, and superior in dignity to the Levitical priests."
2. "According to the order [κατα την ταξιν]. According to the rank which Melchisedec held."

2. "Melchisedec was God’s priest; and the Psalmist testifies that that king whom God has set on his right hand would be a |kohen| according to the order of Melchisedec."
3. "The royal dignity will not prevent him to exercise the priesthood also, for a type of such a thing has been already presented in Melchisedec."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Even as also he saith in another place; a psalm written with a different purpose; a quotation from the 110th Psalm, which is generally accepted by the Jews themselves as Messianic." 

2. "Showing that if Jesus is the Christ it is by a Divine appointment He holds the character and performs the functions of a Priest a perpetual Priest."

3. "The only Priest with honours and qualifications higher and greater than those of Aaron."

1. "This verse is a messianic prophecy, pointing to the coming of Jesus Christ as the ultimate high priest. It signifies a change in the priesthood, as Jesus is described as a priest forever in the order of Melchizedek."

4. "This verse highlights the superiority of Jesus' priesthood over the Levitical priesthood. The Levitical priests offered sacrifices repeatedly, but Jesus offered himself once for all, making a perfect atonement for sin. He is the mediator between God and humanity, providing access to God's presence and eternal salvation."
