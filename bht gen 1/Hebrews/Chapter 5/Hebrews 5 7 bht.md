# Hebrews 5:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we see the sufferings and obedience of Christ in his role as our High Priest. Christ's special obedience, attained through suffering, is highlighted as a qualification for his priesthood. He was heard by the Father and his prayers and tears demonstrate his deep anguish and need for divine help. His crying and tears were part of his lesson of obedience and testify to the extreme anguish of his soul. Christ's human nature, while sinless, experienced the same infirmities and need for divine support as ours, and we are called to follow his example in prayer and supplication.
