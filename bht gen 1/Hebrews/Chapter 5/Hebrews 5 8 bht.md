# Hebrews 5:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, we see that although Jesus is the divine Son of God, He willingly embraced the experience of suffering in order to learn obedience. His sufferings were not only for his own benefit but also to serve as an example for us. Jesus, as our High Priest, went through a special form of submission and obedience through his sufferings, which ultimately perfected him for his role. Through his obedience in suffering and dying, Jesus demonstrated the importance of submitting to God's will, even in the midst of trials and tribulations.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Though He WAS God's divine Son, yet He learned His obedience, not from His Sonship, but from His sufferings."
2. "As the Son, He was always obedient to the Father's will; but the special obedience needed to qualify Him as our High Priest, He learned experimentally in practical suffering."
3. "He was obedient already before His passion, but He stooped to a still more humiliating and trying form of obedience then."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Though he were a Son - Though the Son of God. Though he sustained this exalted rank, and was conscious of it, yet he was willing to learn experimentally what is meant by obedience in the midst of sufferings."
2. "Yet learned he obedience - That is, he learned experimentally and practically. It cannot be supposed that he did not 'know' what obedience was; or that he was 'indisposed' to obey God before he suffered; or that he had, as we have, perversities of nature leading to rebellion which required to be subdued by suffering, but that he was willing to 'test' the power of obedience in sufferings."
3. "Hence, learn that one of the objects of affliction is to lead us 'to obey God.' In prosperity we forget it. We become self-confident and rebellious. 'Then' God lays his hand upon us; breaks up our plans; crushes our hopes; takes away our health, and teaches us that we 'must' be submissive to his will."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "His training for the priesthood involved suffering, even though he was a son."
2. "Jesus did not have to learn to obey, but he required the special discipline of a severe human experience as a training for his office as a high priest."
3. "The special course of submission by which he became perfected as our high priest was gone through in time, and was a matter of acquirement and practice."

### John Calvin:
1. "The proximate end of Christ’s sufferings was thus to habituate himself to obedience...that he might exhibit to us an instance and an example of subjection even to death itself."
2. "Christ by his death learned fully what it was to obey God, since he was then led in a special manner to deny himself...he so far gave himself up to his Father that of his own accord and willingly he underwent that death which he greatly dreaded."
3. "This benefit, which arises from the cross, ought to allay its bitterness in our hearts; for what can be more desirable than to be made obedient to God?"

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Though he was Son, yet learned he his obedience." 
2. "The obedience He practiced, or the obedience which was to fit Him for His office."
3. "Troubles are our best teachers, discipline essential to discipleship."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Though he was a Son...Yet learned obedience." 
2. "Succinct and crisp statement of the humanity of Jesus."
3. "He always did his Father's will, but he grew in experience as in wisdom and stature and in the power of sympathy with us."

### John Gill:
1. "Though he were a Son,.... The Son of God, as the Vulgate Latin version reads; not by creation, nor by adoption, nor by office, but by nature, being the only begotten of the Father, having the same nature and perfections with him."

2. "Yet learned he obedience; not to his parents, or civil magistrates, though that is true; nor merely to the precepts of the law, which he did; but unto death: through sufferings he became obedient to death, even the death of the cross."

3. "Christ's sonship did not exempt him from obedience and sufferings; this shows the dignity of Christ's person, that he is the Son of God, not as Mediator, for as such he is a servant; and it would be no wonder that he should learn obedience as a servant."

### John Wesley:
1. "In the garden, how frequently did he call God his Father! Matthew 26:39, etc. And hence it most evidently appears that his being the Son of God did not arise merely from his resurrection."
2. "Yet learned he — The word learned, premised to the word suffered, elegantly shows how willingly he learned."
3. "He learned obedience, when be began to suffer; when he applied himself to drink that cup: obedience in suffering and dying."
