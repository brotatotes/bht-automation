# Hebrews 6:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse being described emphasizes the significance of an oath for confirmation. It is a solemn appeal to the truth and reliability of God. When God swears by Himself, it carries even greater weight and credibility than when humans swear by someone greater than themselves. The act of taking an oath is intended to bring an end to contradiction, confirming what is promised or asserted. In the context of the gospel, an oath taken in a religious manner is considered lawful and serves as a powerful means of assurance.

### John Calvin:
1. "If credit is given to man, who is by nature false, when he swears, and for this reason, because he confirms what he says by God’s name, how much more credit is due to God, who is eternal truth, when he swears by himself?"
2. "If God’s name, pronounced by man’s tongue, possesses so much superiority, how much more weight ought it to have, when God himself swears by his own name?"

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The oath here spoken of includes two distinct cases: the truth of a statement was made legally valid by the oath of assurance which appealed to God; an agreement or covenant was made legally binding by the oath of promise, accompanied on solemn occasions by the death of the covenanting victim, which death was really an imprecation of death on him who broke the agreement."
2. "The oath went beyond everything. It was as far as men could go. It still forms the highest and final sanction of the law; and when men’s statements are contradicted or their promises questioned, the oath is the ultimate confirmation of both."
3. "The interpretation given above is the more probable, however, partly because ‘contradiction’ is the accurate rendering of the word elsewhere (chap.

3. "An oath for confirmation is to them an end of all strife; it is used to confirm things that are doubtful, and in dispute; and to put an end to strife and contention."
