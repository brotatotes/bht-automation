# Hebrews 6:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, God goes to great lengths to ensure the certainty of our salvation. He not only confirms His promise, but also adds an oath, appealing to both His own unchangeable nature and His desire to demonstrate His steadfastness to us. Through this act, God acts as a mediator, binding Himself by His own word, to assure us of His unchanging purpose and our place as heirs of His promises. It is truly a remarkable display of God's loving grace and our responsibility to believe in His unfailing faithfulness.
