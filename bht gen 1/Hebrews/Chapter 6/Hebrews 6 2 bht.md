## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The converts being Jews, their first and most obviously elementary instruction would be, the teaching them the typical significance of their own ceremonial law in its Christian fulfillment."
2. "By laying on of hands, the sick were healed, officers and teachers of the Church were admitted to their calling, and converts were fully admitted into the Christian Church after baptism."
3. "These [resurrection of the dead and eternal judgment] also were points of Jewish doctrine, confirmed and brought into clearer light by the Gospel."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Jewish believers passed, by an easy transition, from Jewish baptismal purifications, baptism of proselytes, and John's baptism, and legal imposition of hands, to their Christian analogues, baptism, and the subsequent laying on of hands, accompanied by the gift of the Holy Ghost."
2. "The six particulars here specified had been, as it were, the Christian Catechism of the Old Testament; and such Jews who had begun to recognize Jesus as the Christ immediately on the new light being shed on these fundamental particulars, were accounted as having the elementary principles of the doctrine of Christ."
3. "The first and most obvious elementary instruction of Jews would be the teaching them the typical significance of their own ceremonial law in its Christian fulfillment."
4. "Resurrection, &c.—held already by the Jews from the Old Testament: confirmed with clearer light in Christian teaching or 'doctrine.'"
5. "Eternal judgment—judgment fraught with eternal consequences either of joy or of woe."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "To understand the true doctrine respecting baptism was one of the first principles to be learned then as it is now, as baptism is the rite by which we are 'initiated' into the Church."

3. "The belief of the resurrection of the dead is an elementary article in the system of Christianity. It lies at the foundation of all our hopes."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The meaning here is lustral rites in general, and may include the baptism of John and Christian baptism." 
2. "The teaching would cover all such rites, their relations and comparative significance."
3. "The resurrection of Christ as involving the resurrection of believers would, of itself, change the whole aspect of the doctrine of resurrection as held by a Few."

### John Calvin:
1. "For what is the doctrine of baptism but what he mentions here, faith in God, repentance, judgment, and the like?"
2. "This one passage abundantly testifies that this rite had its beginning from the Apostles, which afterwards, however, was turned into superstition."
3. "And this passage tends to confirm pedobaptism; for why should the same doctrine be called as to some baptism, but as to others the imposition of hands, except that the latter after having received baptism were taught in the faith, so that nothing remained for them but the laying on of hands?"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The plural βαπτισμων 'by itself does not mean specifically Christian baptism either in this epistle (Hebrews 9:10) or elsewhere (Mark 7:4), but ablutions or immersions such as the mystery religions and the Jewish cultus required for initiates, proselytes, and worshippers in general' (Moffatt)."

2. "The laying on of hands" seems to us out of place in a list of elementary principles, but it was common as a sign of blessing, healing, in the bestowal of the Holy Spirit, in separation for a special task, and in ordination."

3. "The resurrection of the dead is easily seen to be basal as well as eternal judgment."

### John Gill:
1. "But now, since this blood was shed, they were no more to teach nor learn the doctrine of cleansing by the blood of Christ this way; nor any more to be led unto it through these divers baptisms, ablutions, and purifications."
2. "It has no reference to the right of laying on of hands by the apostles, either in private persons, or officers of churches; but to the rite of laying on of hands of the priests, and of the people, upon the head of sacrifices."
3. "These are doctrines of pure revelation, and were taught under the Old Testament, and were believed by the generality of the Jews, and are articles which they hold in common with us Christians; yet the believing Hebrews were not to rest in the knowledge of these things, and in the smaller degrees of light they had in them, under the former dispensation; but were to go on to perfection, and bear forward towards a greater share of knowledge of these, and other more sublime doctrines of grace."
