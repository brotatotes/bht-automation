# Hebrews 6:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we are reminded of the entrance of the Lord, who has gone ahead as a forerunner for us, paving the way to full fellowship with God. As our High Priest, He represents and introduces us, sanctifying our nature and leading us towards perfection. With Christ as our guide and advocate, we can find firm hope and have the assurance that He has prepared a place for us. His ascension is our promotion, and through His sacrifice, He has opened the gates of heaven for His people.
