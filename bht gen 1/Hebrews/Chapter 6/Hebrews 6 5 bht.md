# Hebrews 6:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Believers have encountered the transformative power of the Word of God, finding fulfillment and nourishment in its truth. They have not only intellectually grasped its message, but have experienced its goodness and comfort. Moreover, they have already begun to taste the spiritual blessings and powers of the future promised by God, receiving a foretaste of eternal life and the fullness of glory. Like a child who sees the light, receives nourishment, and grows, believers progress in their spiritual journey, embracing the light of Christ and partaking in the blessings of the world to come.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The good word of God...usually with reference to its quickening, comforting, strengthening power, as sent or spoken by God to men."
2. "The Writer may have had in view...the wholesome and soul-preserving utterance of God in the gospel."
3. "The δυνάμεις of this ‘world to come’ will be...spiritual powers bestowed in virtue of the indwelling Spirit to arm the Christian for his conflict with sin, the world, and the devil."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "We do not yet enjoy all the fulness of Christ, but only have a taste OF Him, the heavenly gift now; but believers may taste the whole word of God already, namely, God's 'good word of promise.'" 
2. "The world to come stands in contrast to the course of this world, altogether disorganized because God is not its spring of action and end."
3. "By faith, Christians make the world to come a present reality, though but a foretaste of the perfect future."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The meaning here is, that they had experienced the excellency of the truth of God; they had seen and enjoyed its beauty. This is language which cannot be applied to an impenitent sinner. He has no relish for the truth of God; sees no beauty in it; derives no comfort from it."
2. "He loves the Bible; he loves the truth of God that is preached. He sees an exquisite beauty in that truth. It is not merely in its poetry; in its sublimity; in its argument; but he has now a 'taste' or 'relish' for the truth itself, which he had not before his conversion."
3. "They had experienced the promised blessings of the new and last dispensation; and the language here is such as appropriately describes Christians, and as indeed can be applicable to no other."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "To the word are attached life, spirit and life, salvation, cleansing, especially the impartation of the Spirit." 
2. "The world to come is the world of men under the new order which is to enter with the fulfillment of Christ's work."
3. "These powers are characteristic of that period, and in so far as that dispensation is inaugurated here and now, they assert and manifest themselves."

### John Gill:
1. "And have tasted the good word of God... which he makes use of for conviction, conversion, instruction, and comfort; and which are preserved by him: and these are a good word; they come from him who is good; they are a revelation of good things; they make known things true, pleasant, and profitable."

2. "And there is a special and spiritual taste of this good word, which is delightful, relishing, and nourishing; and such who have it can never totally and finally fall away; because they who taste it, so as to eat and digest it, and be nourished by it, to them it becomes the ingrafted word, which is able to save them."

3. "And the powers of the world to come... the ultimate state of glory and happiness, the powers of which are the immortality, incorruption, and glory of the body, the perfect holiness and knowledge of the soul, entire freedom from all evils of every kind, full communion with Father, Son, and Spirit, and a complete enjoyment of all happiness for ever."

### John Wesley:
1. "And have tasted the good word of God" - This phrase highlights the experiential aspect of engaging with the Word of God, suggesting that believers have not only intellectually understood it but also found delight and satisfaction in it.

2. "And the powers of the world to come" - This phrase refers to the spiritual blessings and realities that believers have already begun to experience in the present, giving them a foretaste of the future glory and eternal life promised by God.

3. "Every child that is naturally born, first sees the light, then receives and tastes proper nourishment" - This analogy emphasizes the natural progression of growth and development, drawing a parallel to the spiritual journey of believers who first encounter the light of Christ, then receive nourishment from the Word, and finally partake in the blessings of the world to come.
