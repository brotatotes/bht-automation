# Hebrews 6:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Bible verse describes how receiving and embracing the seed of the Gospel can lead to spiritual growth and fruitfulness. It emphasizes that just as the earth drinks in rain and produces a blade and eventually ripe crops, believers who receive the Gospel into their hearts and bring forth genuine growth will continually progress until they bear fruit. However, those who reject or corrupt the Gospel reveal themselves as reprobates. The verse encourages prompt and joyful acceptance of the Gospel, highlighting its transformative power in softening hardened hearts and bringing abundant fruitfulness to barren souls.

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The 'oft' implies, on God's part, the riches of His abounding grace ('coming' spontaneously, and often); and, on the apostate's part, the wilful perversity whereby he has done continual despite to the oft-repeated motions of the Spirit."
2. "The rain of heaven falls both on the elect and the apostates."
3. "The heart of man is the earth; man is the dresser; herbs are brought forth meet, not for the dresser, by whom, but for God, the owner of the soil, for whom it is dressed."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "If Christians should become like the barren earth they would be cast away and lost."
2. "The comparison of 'drinking in' the rain is designed to distinguish a mellow soil which receives the rain, from hard or rocky land where it runs off."
3. "The design is to show that a Christian who makes proper use of the means of growing in grace which God bestows upon him, and who does not apostatize, meets with the divine favor and approbation."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The inevitableness of the punishment illustrated by a familiar fact of nature."
2. "The natural result of the ground's receiving and absorbing the rains is fruitfulness, which redounds to the benefit of those who cultivate it."
3. "The blessing is increased fruitfulness."

### John Calvin:
1. "The earth, which by sucking in the rain immediately produces a blade suitable to the seed sown, at length by God’s blessing produces a ripe crop; so they who receive the seed of the Gospel into their hearts and bring forth genuine shoots, will always make progress until they produce ripe fruit."
2. "The only remedy the husbandman has is to burn up the noxious and useless weeds. So they who destroy the seed of the Gospel either by their indifference or by corrupt affections, so as to manifest no sign of good progress in their life, clearly show themselves to be reprobates, from whom no harvest can be expected."
3. "The Apostle then not only speaks here of the fruit of the Gospel, but also exhorts us promptly and gladly to embrace it, and he further tells us, that the blade appears presently after the seed is sown, and that growing follows the daily irrigations."

### John Gill:
1. "Earthly and unregenerate men and carnal professors are of earthly minds; they are like the earth when it was rude and without form, and cursed by God; and are as insensible as the earth."
2. "The rain that comes upon them may signify either the grace of Christ, which, like rain, is an instance of his sovereignty, and what he alone can give, and not the vanities of the Gentiles; and which he gives to persons undeserving of it; and which refreshes, revives, and makes fruitful."
3. "The Gospel... comes from above, and is the means of softening hard hearts, of reviving distressed and disconsolate minds, and of making barren souls fruitful; which is done by coming 'oft' upon them, at first conversion, and afterwards, alluding to the former and latter rain."
