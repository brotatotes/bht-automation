# Hebrews 6:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This passage describes the fate of those who do not bear good fruit. They are compared to land that produces thorns and briers, which are prickly and hurtful. These individuals are rejected and abandoned, left to their own barrenness. Their end is likened to the burning of Jerusalem, signifying impending destruction. It serves as a warning about the consequences of a life devoid of righteousness and devoted to worldly pursuits.

1. "But if it (the 'land') bear"; not so favorable a word as "bringeth forth," Hebrews 6:7, said of the good soil.
2. "Rejected—after having been tested; so the Greek implies. Reprobate...rejected by the Lord."
3. "Nigh unto cursing—on the verge of being given up to its own barrenness by the just curse of God."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The force of the comparison here is, that God would thus deal with those who professed to be renewed if they should be like such a worthless field."
2. "The sense is not that the owner would curse it 'in words,' or imprecate a curse on it, as a man does who uses profane language, but the language is taken here from the more common use of the word 'curse' - as meaning to devote to destruction."
3. "If after all attempts to secure holy living, and to keep them in the paths of salvation, they should evince none of the spirit of piety, all that could be done would be to abandon them to destruction as such a field is overrun with fire."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The contrast is between two classes of Christians under equally favorable conditions, out of which they develop opposite results."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "For 'thorns and thistles' see Matthew 7:16 for both words (ακανθας κα τριβολους). Roman soldiers scattered balls with sharp iron spikes, one of which was called tribulus, to hinder the enemy's cavalry."

2. "Rejected (αδοκιμος). See 1 Corinthians 9:27; Romans 1:28. For καταρας εγγυς (nigh unto a curse) see Galatians 3:10."

3. "To be burned (εις καυσιν). 'For burning.' Common sight in clearing up ground."

These quotes provide additional context and references to other Bible verses, as well as historical information about the use of thorns and thistles by Roman soldiers.

### John Gill:
1. "Wicked men...are hurtful, pricking and grieving, by their wicked lives and conversations, by their bitter and reproachful words, and by their violent and cruel persecutions."
2. "Carnal professors, and especially apostates...are worldly, slothful, defrauding and overreaching, carnal and wanton."
3. "Such earth is rejected; as such men are, both by the church, and by God himself; or 'reprobate', as they are concerning the faith, and to every good work."

### John Wesley:
1. "That which beareth thorns and briers - Only or chiefly." This quote highlights the specific type of vegetation being referred to in the verse, emphasizing that it is the plants that produce thorns and briers that are being rejected.

2. "No more labour is bestowed upon it." This quote suggests that once something is deemed to be bearing thorns and briers, no further effort or attention is given to it. It implies a sense of abandonment or disregard for that which does not produce good fruit.

3. "Whose end is to be burned - As Jerusalem was shortly after." This quote draws a parallel between the fate of the rejected vegetation and the impending destruction of Jerusalem. It adds a historical context and reinforces the idea that those who do not bear good fruit will face a similar fate.
