In this verse, the commentators emphasize the idea of perfection and the insufficiency of the Levitical priesthood. They point out that the previous order of priesthood could not bring man to his highest state of salvation and sanctification. It is clear that the Law and the Levitical priesthood had limitations and defects, leading to the need for another priest of a different order. The verse highlights the realization of the ideal priesthood in Christ, who brings a more excellent dispensation and a perfect fellowship between God and humanity.
