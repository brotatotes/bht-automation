## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "For if the priesthood is changed, there takes place of necessity a change of the law."
2. "Not 'of law,' which would be decidedly wrong, and would require τοῦ νόμου, as in a general sentence, implying 'the law' of the particular case in view; νόμου, anarthrous, means that law, which had already begun to be used as a proper name, the well-known law of Moses."
3. "The connexion is with the parenthesis in Hebrews 7:11, which was inserted to prepare the way for our verse."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "These presuppose a change or transference of the priesthood, and this carries with it a change also of the law." 
2. "The priesthood and the law are inseparably bound up together, both standing and falling together."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "For the priesthood being changed - According to the prediction in Ps. cx., that it would be. When that occurs, the consequence specified will also follow."
2. "There is made of necessity a change also of the law - The Law so far as it grew out of that, or was dependent on it."
3. "But the meaning is, that since a large number of laws - constituting a code of considerable extent and importance - was given for the regulation of the priesthood, and in reference to the rites of religion, which they were to observe or superintend, it followed that when their office was superseded by 'one of a wholly different order,' the Law which had regulated them vanished also, or ceased to be binding."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "A change [μεταθεσις] . A transfer to a new basis."
2. "The inferiority of the Levitical priesthood is inferred from the fact that another priesthood was promised."
3. "If the law failed to effect complete fellowship with God, the priesthood was shown to be a failure, and must be abolished; and the change of the priesthood involved the abolition of the entire legal system."

### John Calvin:
1. "The sum of the whole is, that the ministry of Moses was no less temporary than that of Aaron; and hence both were annulled by the coming of Christ, for the one could not stand without the other."

### John Gill:
1. "For the priesthood being changed,.... Not translated from one tribe, family, or order, but utterly abolished; for though it is called an everlasting priesthood, yet that is to be understood with a limitation, as the word 'everlasting' often is, as relating to things under that dispensation; for nothing is more certain than that it is done away."

2. "There is made of necessity a change also of the law; not the moral law, that was in being before the priesthood of Aaron, nor do they stand and fall together; besides, this still remains, for it is perfect, and cannot be made void by any other; nor is it set aside by Christ's priesthood: though there is a sense in which it is abolished; as it is in the hands of Moses; as it is a covenant of works; as to justification by it; and as to its curse and condemnation to them that are Christ's; yet it still remains in the hands of Christ, and as a rule of walk and conversation; and is useful, and continues so on many accounts."

3. "But either the judicial law; not that part of it which is founded on justice and equity, and was a means of guarding the moral law, for that still subsists; but that which was given to the Jews as Jews, and some parts of which depended on the priesthood, and so ceased with it; as the laws concerning the cities of refuge, raising up seed to a deceased brother, preserving inheritances in families, and judging and determining controversies: or rather the ceremonial law, which was but a shadow of good things to come, and was given but for a time; and this concerned the priesthood, and was made void by the priesthood of Christ; for that putting an end to the Levitical priesthood, the law which related to it must unavoidably cease, and become of no effect."

### John Wesley:
1. "The conjunction 'for' here indicates a cause-and-effect relationship, highlighting the inseparable connection between the two elements being discussed."

2. "This verse emphasizes the interdependence of two entities, suggesting that they are so closely linked that any alteration in one will inevitably result in a corresponding change in the other."

3. "The word 'for' in this context serves as a reminder that the relationship between these two elements is not arbitrary or coincidental, but rather a fundamental and unbreakable bond."
