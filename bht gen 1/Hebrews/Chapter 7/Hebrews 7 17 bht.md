# Hebrews 7:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Based on the commentaries, the Bible verse being described emphasizes the eternal nature of Christ's priesthood. The verse is seen as a confirmation of God's testimony, declaring that Christ is a priest forever after the order of Melchisedec. The verse is considered a solemn declaration of truth, authored by the Holy Ghost himself. It serves to distinguish Christ's priesthood from the temporary priesthood of the Levitical order and highlights the indissoluble and everlasting nature of Christ's role as a priest.
