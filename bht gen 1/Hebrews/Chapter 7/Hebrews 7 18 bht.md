## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The Levitical priesthood and the law are inseparably joined, since the former is repealed, the latter is so also."
2. "The legal ordinance introducing and giving place to the Christian, the antitypical and permanent end of the former."
3. "Weakness and unprofitableness: The opposite of 'power'."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The Law which existed before in regard to the priesthood becomes now abrogated in consequence of the change which has been made in the priesthood."
2. "The reasoning of the apostle does not pertain to that, and, (2) That law cannot be abrogated. It grows out of the nature of things, and must be perpetual and universal."
3. "It was not adapted to save man; it had not power to accomplish what was necessary to be done in human salvation."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The fundamental idea is the doing away of something established."
2. "The verb ajqetein to make void, do away with, is common in N. T. and in LXX."
3. "It could not bring men into close fellowship with God."

Note: The commentary is quite technical and does not provide much insight into the meaning of the verse. However, these quotes highlight the concept of the commandment being annulled, the usage of the verb "ajqetein," and the inability of the commandment to bring people closer to God.

### John Calvin:
1. "The Law is useless, when separated from Christ."
2. "The whole efficacy of the ceremonies depended on Christ alone."
3. "Former laws are abrogated by the latter."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "A disannulling (αθετησις). Late word from αθετεω (alpha privative and τιθημ), to set aside (Mark 6:26), in N.T. only here and Hebrews 9:26. Common in the papyri in a legal sense of making void."
2. "Involved in μεταθεσις (change in verse Hebrews 7:12)."
3. "Unprofitableness (ανωφελες). Old compound (alpha privative and οφελος) useless, and neuter singular like ασθενες. In N.T. only here and Titus 3:9."

### John Gill:
1. "Not the moral law; though what is here said of the commandment may be applied to that; that is sometimes called the commandment, Romans 7:12 it went before the promise of the Messiah, and the Gospel of Christ, and the dispensation of it; it is in some respects weak; it cannot justify from the guilt of sin, nor free from the power of it, nor secure from death, the punishment of it, nor give eternal life..."
2. "And this may be said to be going before; with respect to time, being before the Gospel state, or the exhibition of the new covenant of grace; and with respect to use, as a type or shadow of good things to come; and as it was a schoolmaster going before, and leading on to the knowledge of evangelical truths..."
3. "The ceremonial law was weak; it could not expiate or atone for sin, in the sight of God; it could not remove the guilt of sin from the conscience, but there was still a remembrance of it; nor could it cleanse from the filth of sin; all it could do was, to expiate sin typically, and sanctify externally to the purifying of the flesh; and all the virtue it had was owing to Christ, whom it prefigured; and therefore, being fulfilled in him, it ceased..."

### John Wesley:
1. "There is implied in this new and everlasting priesthood, and in the new dispensation connected therewith, a disannulling of the preceding commandment." 
2. "An abrogation of the Mosaic law."
3. "The weakness and unprofitableness of the Mosaic law - its insufficiency either to justify or to sanctify."
