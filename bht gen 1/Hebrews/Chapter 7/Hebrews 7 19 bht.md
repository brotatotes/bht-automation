# Hebrews 7:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Bible verse being described speaks of how the law, though necessary, could not bring about true justification or sanctification before God. Instead, a better hope was needed, one that could bring us nearer to God and allow us to experience intimate fellowship with Him. This better hope is found in the priesthood of Christ, which brings perfection to all the types, promises, and prophecies of the Old Testament, bringing about perfect atonement, righteousness, and redemption. Through this hope, we are able to draw near to God and become one spirit with Him.

2. "The law brought nothing to its perfected end, everything in it was introductory to its antitype in the Christian economy, which realizes the perfection contemplated."
3. "There takes place a repealing of the commandment, but a bringing in afterwards of a better hope, not one weak and unprofitable, but, as elsewhere the Christian dispensation is called, 'everlasting,' 'true,' 'the second,' 'more excellent,' 'different,' 'living,' 'new,' 'to come,' 'perfect.'"
