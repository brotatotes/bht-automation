# Hebrews 7:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse being described highlights the imperfections of the Old Testament priesthood and the superiority of Jesus Christ as the eternal High Priest. The Old Testament priests were hindered by death, constantly changing, and their sacrifices could only provide temporary relief. In contrast, Jesus, as the one and only High Priest, offered himself as the ultimate sacrifice, providing everlasting forgiveness for sin. This verse emphasizes the unchangeable nature and incomparable efficacy of Christ's priesthood compared to the temporary and imperfect priesthood of the past.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "They indeed are appointed priests in numbers, on account of their being hindered by death from continuing in their priesthood." 
2. "The verb is a vox media, and may be applied to any sort of endurance treated of in the context, which clearly here treats of abiding in the priesthood." 
3. "It would be somewhat tautological to say that they were hindered by death from continuing in life."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Christ dies not, and so hath a priesthood which passes not from one to another."
2. "His 'unchangeable (that does not pass from one to another) priesthood.'"
3. "Hindered from permanently continuing, namely, in the priesthood."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The excellence of the priesthood of Christ is that it is unchangeable, unlike the priesthood under the Jewish dispensation."
2. "Christ's exaltation to the heavens ensures the permanence of his priesthood."
3. "Everything in regard to Christ's office as a priest is permanent."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Many priests have been made, not because they were allowed to continue, but because they are hindered from continuing." 

2. "The hindrance of their continuation implies that their priesthood is temporary and limited in its effectiveness." 

3. "The abundance of priests highlights the inadequacy of the Levitical priesthood and the need for a superior and eternal High Priest."

### John Calvin:
1. "He had already touched on this comparison; but as the subject deserved more attention, he unfolds it more fully."
2. "The ancient priests were many, for death put an end to their priesthood; but there is no death to prevent Christ from discharging his office."
3. "Then he alone is a perpetual priest. Thus a different cause produces different effects."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Many in number (πλειονες). Comparative predicate adjective, 'more than one,' in succession, not simultaneously."
2. "Because they are hindered (δια το κωλυεσθα). Articular infinitive (present passive) with δια and the accusative case, 'because of the being hindered.'"
3. "By death (θανατω). Instrumental case."
4. "From continuing (παραμενειν). Present active infinitive of the compound (remain beside) as in Philippians 1:25 and in the ablative case."

### John Gill:
1. "This shows the imperfection of this priesthood, since it was in many hands; no one continuing and being sufficient to execute it; but Christ is the one and only high priest; there is no other, nor is there any need of any other."
2. "Death has a power to forbid a long continuance in this world, and no man does continue long here: death puts a stop to men's works, and to the exercise of their several callings; no office, even the most sacred, exempts from it; no, not the office of high priests."
3. "The office was bought for money, and men that would give most were put into it: hence there were frequent changes; the Jews themselves say, they changed every twelve months."

### John Wesley:
1. "The mention of 'many priests' highlights the temporary and imperfect nature of the Old Testament priesthood. It emphasizes the constant need for new priests to offer sacrifices, as the work of atonement was never truly finished."

2. "The repetition of priests also underscores the inability of the Levitical priesthood to bring about lasting forgiveness of sins. The sacrifices they offered could only provide temporary relief, requiring continuous repetition."

3. "This verse serves as a stark contrast to the priesthood of Jesus Christ, who is the eternal and perfect High Priest. Unlike the many priests of the Old Testament, Jesus offered himself as the ultimate sacrifice once and for all, providing complete and everlasting forgiveness for sin."
