# Hebrews 7:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Bible verse being described is a powerful declaration about the unchanging and eternal priesthood of Jesus Christ. This priesthood is contrasted with the earthly priesthoods that were subject to death and required succession. Jesus' priesthood is not only unchangeable, but it remains forever because He Himself lives forever. This unique and enduring priesthood is not limited by time, but is a fundamental part of who Jesus is. It is a priesthood that continues to have an eternal impact, as Jesus is always interceding for His people.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "He, on account of his remaining for ever, hath his priesthood unchangeable." 
2. "They, on account of their deaths, are subject to continual renewal: He, because He lives for ever, has, &c."
3. "The adjective a pure predicate, not an epithet. ἀπαράβατος is a word of later Greek: sec Lob. on Phryn. p. 313."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "THOU art a priest"; singular, not priests, "many."
2. "Remaineth," namely, in life.
3. "This Man, because He liveth ever, hath no successor in office, not even Peter."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Because he does not die, but ever lives, he has an unchanging priesthood."
2. "The reason in their case, why it passed to others, was not that they did not perform the office well, but that they were mortal, and could not continue to hold it."
3. "The idea is not strictly that it was 'unchangeable,' but that 'it did not pass over into other hands.'"

These quotes highlight the eternal nature of Christ's priesthood and emphasize that it does not pass from one person to another like the Levitical priesthood. They also clarify that the passing of the priesthood in the case of the Jewish priests was due to their mortality, not their performance.

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Hath his priesthood unchangeable." - The commentary emphasizes the possessive force of the article, highlighting that the priesthood belongs to the subject. This helps to establish a sense of ownership and authority in the verse.

2. "The emphasis is on unchangeable." - The commentary points out that the focus is on the quality of being unchangeable. This suggests that the priesthood is steadfast and enduring, which adds depth to the understanding of the verse.

3. "Usage is in favor of the former meaning, but the other falls in better with the course of thought." - The commentary acknowledges different interpretations of the term "unchangeable," but suggests that the interpretation aligning with the overall context of the passage is more fitting. This insight helps to guide the reader in understanding the intended meaning of the verse.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The active sense of the word rendered 'unchangeable' is very unusual, and therefore less likely; but either meaning makes a good, and nearly the same, sense."
2. "By some commentators, the 'abiding' which is here affirmed of Christ is applied not to His life, but to His priesthood."
3. "If this meaning seems preferable, it needs then to be kept in mind that the 'forever' of the Psalm relates to the priesthood of Christ, and answers to the 'forever' of the arrangement with Melchisedec."

Note: The commentary provided is quite lengthy, so I have selected three quotes that provide different perspectives on the interpretation of the verse.

### Archibald T Robertson:

3. "God placed Christ in this priesthood" - The author emphasizes that it was God who appointed Christ to this unique role, indicating that no one else can assume or replace him in this position.

### John Gill:
1. "Though he died, death did not forbid him to continue, as it does other men; he was not forced to die, he died voluntarily."
2. "He not only continued in his divine nature, which still had the human nature in union with it, but he continued in his office as a priest, and quickly rose from the dead."
