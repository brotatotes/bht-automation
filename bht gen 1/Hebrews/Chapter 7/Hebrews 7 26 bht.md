### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "For to us (as sinners; emphatical) there was also becoming (besides the other excellencies of our High Priest) such an High Priest." 
2. "Temptation, to which He was exposed, left no trace of evil in Him."
3. "He is lifted above our sinful community, being 'made higher than the heavens,' at the same time that He makes believers as such (not as sinners), 'to sit together (with Him) in heavenly places'."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "There was a special propriety that he should surpass all others in 'moral' purity."
2. "He is just such a Saviour as is adapted to the wants of ignorant, fallen, wretched, sinful man."
3. "He is benevolent, and pities our woes; wise, and is able to enlighten our ignorance; compassionate, and ready to forgive our faults."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "There was an essential fitness in the gift of our great high priest."

### John Calvin:
1. "These conditions, or qualifications, as they commonly say, are of necessity required in a priest — that he should be just, harmless, and pure from every spot. This honor belongs to Christ alone." 
2. "For there was some holiness, and harmlessness, and purity in Aaron, but only a small measure; but Christ, exempt from the common lot of men, is alone free from every sin; hence in him alone is found real holiness and innocency." 
3. "No one is a lawful priest, except he is appointed by God’s command; and God has nowhere conferred this honor on angels. It would then be a sacrilegious usurpation, were they, without being called, to intrude into the office."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Such" (τοιουτος) refers to the Melchizedek character of Jesus as high priest and in particular to his power to help and save (Hebrews 2:17) as just explained in Hebrews 7:24.
2. Holy (οσιος). Saintly, pious, as already noted. Cf. Acts 2:24; Acts 13:35.
3. Undefiled (αμιαντος). Untainted, stainless. In the papyri. Not merely ritual purity (Leviticus 21:10-15), but real ethical cleanness.

### John Gill:
1. "He was typified by the high priest, who had holiness to the Lord written on his forehead, and far exceeds any of the priests in holiness."
2. "He was separated from them in Adam; he was not among the individuals of human nature that sinned in him; and he had no communion with them in sin."
3. "He is removed far from them; and herein he exceeds the priests under the law, and is suitable to us."

### John Wesley:
1. "For such an high priest suited us — Unholy, mischievous, defiled sinners: a blessed paradox!"
2. "Holy - With respect to God. Harmless — With respect to men. Undefiled — With any sin in himself."
3. "Separated from sinners — As well as free from sin. And so he was when he left the world."
