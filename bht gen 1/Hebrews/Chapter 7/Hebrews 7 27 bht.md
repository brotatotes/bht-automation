# Hebrews 7:27 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse being described depicts the uniqueness and completeness of Jesus' sacrifice, as highlighted by commentators such as John Wesley. Jesus offered himself without any personal sin, making his sacrifice distinct from the offerings of the high priests who needed to atone for their own sins. Unlike the constant repetition of sacrifices in the Old Testament, Jesus' sacrifice was presented once for all and was deemed acceptable by God due to its spotless nature. Through his unblemished offering, Jesus provided a lasting atonement for the sins of all people, surpassing the limitations of the previous priesthood.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The allusion is to the daily offerings of the priests, which are spoken of as offered by the high priests, though they took part in them only on festival days, because the high priests in fact lead and represent the whole priesthood."
2. "The true meaning is the simple one, that the allusion is to the daily offerings of the priests."
3. "The most probable solution of the difficulty... is that καθʼ ἡμέραν belongs not to οἱ ἀρχιερεῖς, but only to Christ: 'who has not need day by day, as the high priests had year by year,' etc."

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "The 'daily' strictly belongs to Christ, not to the high priests, 'who needeth not daily, as those high priests (year by year, and their subordinate priests daily), to offer.'"
2. "The high priest's double offering on the day of atonement, the bullock for himself, and the goat for the people's sins, had its counterpart in the TWO lambs offered daily by the ordinary priests."
3. "The sufficiency of the one sacrifice to atone for all sins for ever, resulted from its absolute spotlessness."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The Jewish high priest was a sinful man... He needed an expiatory sacrifice for his own sins... But it was not so in the case of Jesus."
2. "The sacrifices in the Jewish service should be constantly repeated... But it was not so with the Lord Jesus... His offering... had sufficient merit for all the sins of the world, and needed never to be repeated."
3. "He made such an atonement that it was not needful that it should be repeated... He put an end to sacrifice... there was no need that any more blood should be shed for human guilt."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Who needeth not daily (kaq' hJmeran). Apparently inconsistent with ch. 9 7, but the sense is, 'who hath no need day by day as the high priest had (year by year) to offer sacrifices,' etc." 

2. "The great point is repetition, whether daily or yearly."

3. "Once [εφαπαξ] . Rend. once for all. Contrasted with daily. When he offered up himself [εαυτον ανενεγκας] . A new thought. For the first time Christ appears as victim."

### John Calvin:
1. "One of the defects of the ancient priesthood was, that the high priest offered sacrifices for his own sins; how then could he have pacified God for others, who had God justly displeased with himself?"
2. "Then they were by no means equal to the work of expiating for sins."
3. "The other defect was, that they offered various sacrifices daily; it hence follows, that there was no real expiation; for sins remain when purgation is repeated."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "First (προτερον). Regular adverb for comparison between two, though πρωτον often occurs also (John 1:41), with επειτα (then) following."
2. "For the sins (τον). Only the article in the Greek with repetition of υπερ or of αμαρτιων."
3. "When he offered up himself (εαυτον ανενεγκας). First aorist active participle of αναφερω, to offer up. See same idea in Hebrews 9:14 where εαυτον προσηνεγκεν is used. Old verb for sacrifice to place on the altar (1 Peter 2:5; 1 Peter 2:24)."

### John Gill:
1. "Christ needed not to offer for his own, nor could he, for he had none of his own; what he had was by imputation."
2. "Christ only needed to offer, and he only did offer, for the sins of the people; not of the Jews only, but of the Gentiles also, even of all God's covenant people."
3. "Christ offered himself, his whole human nature, soul and body, and both as in union with his divine nature; and this being offered to God freely and voluntarily, in the room and stead of his people, was acceptable to God."

### John Wesley:
1. "He offered once for all: not for his own sins, for he then offered up himself 'without spot to God.'" This highlights the uniqueness and completeness of Jesus' sacrifice, as he offered himself without any blemish or sin.

2. "Who needeth not to offer up sacrifices daily." This emphasizes that Jesus' sacrifice was sufficient and did not require constant repetition, unlike the sacrifices offered by the priests in the Old Testament.

3. "He offered himself 'without spot to God.'" This phrase underscores the purity and perfection of Jesus' sacrifice, as he presented himself to God as an unblemished offering.

Overall, these quotes emphasize the superiority of Jesus' sacrifice, which was offered once for all and was without any personal sin. His sacrifice was sufficient to atone for the sins of humanity and did not require continual repetition like the sacrifices of the Old Testament.
