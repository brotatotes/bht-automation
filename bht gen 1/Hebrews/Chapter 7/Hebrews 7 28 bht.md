Christ's priesthood is the ultimate fulfillment of God's design for a better and perfect priesthood.

1. "Christ had not the first, and therefore need not offer for his own sin: he was free from the second, and therefore need not repeat His sacrifice."
2. "This oath is recorded in David, i.e. subsequently to the giving of the law, and therefore as antiquating it and setting it aside."

2. "The great High Priest of the Christian profession is the only perfect priest. The Jewish priests were all imperfect and sinful men. The sacrifices which they offered were imperfect, and could not give peace to the conscience. There was need of some better system, and they all looked forward to it. But in the Lord Jesus, and in his work, there is absolute perfection." 
3. "Christ saves to the uttermost. He makes the salvation complete. As far as we can trace the departing soul when it goes into the dark valley, we receive the same assurance; and why should we doubt that the same grace is bestowed further onward, and that he saves 'to the uttermost'?"
