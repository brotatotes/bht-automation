# Hebrews 7:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Melchizedek, the mysterious figure mentioned in Scripture, stands alone as a priest without a recorded genealogy. Unlike other priests who relied on their lineage, Melchizedek's priesthood is unique and foreshadows the eternal priesthood of Christ. He is not to be understood as a miraculous being, but rather as someone whose ancestry isn't mentioned in the priestly records. Melchizedek's likeness to the Son of God is depicted in the description found in Genesis, emphasizing both his uniqueness and the eternal nature of Christ's priesthood.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Without genealogy... his genealogy is not known, whereas a Levitical priest could not dispense with the proof of his descent." 
2. "Nothing is said in Genesis of the end of his priesthood, or of his having had in his priesthood either predecessor or successor, which, in a typical point of view, represents Christ's eternal priesthood, without beginning or end."
3. "Melchisedec was, in his priesthood, 'made like' Christ, as far as the imperfect type could represent the lineaments of the perfect archetype."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The phrase 'without father'...means literally one who has no father; one who has lost his father; one who is an orphan...The word occurs often in these senses in the classic writers...It is morally certain, however, that the apostle did not use the word here in either of the senses...The apostle says that there was no such genealogical table in regard to Melchizedek...He stood alone." 

2. "The name of whose mother is unknown, or is not recorded in the Hebrew genealogical tables...The simple thought is, that the name of his ancestry does not appear in any record of those in the priestly office."

3. "The obvious meaning of the phrase is, that in the 'records of Moses' neither the beginning nor the close of his life is mentioned...The apostle adverts to this particularly, because it was so unusual in the records of Moses, who is in general so careful to mention the birth and death of the individuals whose lives he mentions."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The meaning is that there is no record concerning his parentage. This is significant as indicating a different type of priesthood from the Levitical, in which genealogy was of prime importance." 
2. "The words likened unto the Son of God stand independently. Not to be connected with the following sentence, so as to read abideth a priest continually like the Son of God; for, as a priest, Melchisedec, chronologically, was prior to Christ; and, therefore, it is not likeness with respect to priesthood that is asserted."
3. "The emphasis is on the eternal duration of the ideal priesthood, and the writer explains the Psalm as asserting eternal duration as the mark of the Melchisedec order."

### John Calvin:
1. "He then exempts Melchisedec from what is common to others, a descent by birth; by which he means that he is eternal, so that his beginning from men was not to be sought after."
2. "And what was shadowed forth in Melchisedec is really exhibited in Christ. It behooves us then to be satisfied with this moderate view, that while Scripture sets forth to us Melchisedec as one who had never been born and never died, it shows to us as in a mirror, that Christ has neither a beginning nor an end."
3. "It seems not to be worth oneâ€™s while to refute the delirious notions of those who dream that Christ himself, or the holy Spirit, or an angel, appeared at that time."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "His is a priesthood purely personal, and not to be traced to natural descent or hereditary claim."
2. "Unlike the Jewish priests therefore, who began their ministry at thirty and closed it at fifty, the high priest holding his office until he died."
3. "All sacrifices are superseded by the sacrifice of the cross, and all priesthoods by the priesthood of our Lord."

Note: The commentary provided is quite lengthy, so I have selected three quotes that I believe capture the essence of the commentary and provide valuable insights into the verse.

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Melchizedek stands alone. He is not to be understood as a miraculous being without birth or death." 
2. "The likeness is in the picture drawn in Genesis, not in the man himself." 
3. "Jesus continues priest in fact in heaven."

### John Gill:
1. "Melchizedek is 'without father' and 'without mother' in the sense that there is no genealogical account of his lineage in Scripture. This sets him apart from other priests who had a clear lineage and descent. It emphasizes his uniqueness and foreshadows the eternal priesthood of Christ."

### John Wesley:
1. "Without father, without mother, without pedigree" - Recorded, without any account of his descent from any ancestors of the priestly order.
2. "Having neither beginning of days, nor end of life" - Mentioned by Moses.
3. "Made like the Son of God" - Who is really without father, as to his human nature; without mother, as to his divine; and in this also, without pedigree - Neither descended from any ancestors of the priestly order.
