# Hebrews 7:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the discussion of the Bible verse, commentators highlight the contrast between the Levitical priesthood and the priesthood of Melchisedec. The Levitical priests, being mortal and subject to death, would pass away and be succeeded by others. In contrast, Melchisedec is portrayed as living, with no mention of his birth or death. This enigmatic quality adds to the eternal nature of his priesthood, which is described as enduring and perpetual. The silence regarding his death and the testimony that he lives emphasize the uniqueness and superiority of Melchisedec's priesthood over the temporary and mortal Levitical priesthood.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "They who thus received tithes, though by the right to do this they asserted a superiority over their brethren, were mortal. Like others, they would soon die; and in regard to the most essential things they were on a level with their brethren."
2. "The simple meaning of this passage is, that, under the Levitical economy, those who received tithes were mortal, and were thus placed in strong contrast with him of whom it was said 'he liveth.' Thus, they were inferior to him - as a mortal is inferior to one who does not die."
3. "The fair and obvious meaning is, that all the record we have of Melchizedek is, that he was 'alive;' or as Grotins says, the record is merely that he lived. We have no mention of his death. From anything that the record shows, it might appear that he continued to live on, and did not die."

### Marvin Vincent:

2. "Melchisedec does not appear in Scripture as one who dies, and whose office passes to another."

### John Calvin:
1. "He takes the silence respecting his death, as I have said, as an evidence of his life."
2. "And by these words the Apostle intended to show, that the dignity of Melchisedec’s priesthood was to be perpetual, while that of the Levites was temporary."
