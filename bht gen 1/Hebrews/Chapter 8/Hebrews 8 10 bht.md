# Hebrews 8:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, God promises to establish a new covenant with His people. The new covenant differs from the old in that it is not focused on external rituals, but on transforming one's mind and heart internally. Through this covenant, God will be intimately connected with His people, offering guidance, protection, forgiveness, and salvation. The laws of God will not be mere written regulations, but will be deeply ingrained in the minds and hearts of His people, enabling true understanding and obedience.
