# Hebrews 8:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse describes Christ as a minister in the heavenly sanctuary, representing his own sacrifice and interceding for his people. The heavenly sanctuary is portrayed as the true and ultimate holy place, compared to the earthly tabernacle. Unlike the man-made tabernacle of Moses, the heavenly sanctuary is not of human origin, but established by God Himself. 

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The λειτουργός is subordinate to those whose minister he is, as in Jos 1:1 Λ, τῷ Ἰησοῦ … τῷ λειτουργῷ Μωυσῆ: see also 2Ki 13:18; 2 Kings 3 Kings 10:5; 4 Kings 4:43; Hebrews 6:15; 2 Chronicles 9:4." 
2. "Both are agreed that τὰ ἅγια betokens the immediate, immaterial presence of God, the veritable Holy of Holies, beyond, and approached through, the heavens, ch. Hebrews 4:14." 
3. "That glorified body of His, in which they are accepted before God, and in which as a heavenly temple, they serve God, and God dwells, He has passed through, not by passing out of it, but by finally establishing it as an accomplished thing in God’s sight, and in and as proceeding forth from it carrying on his intercession and λειτουργία τῆς σκηνῆς τῆς ἀληθινῆς in the ἅγια itself."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The Lord Jesus the Great High Priest, has entered into the Holy of Holies in heaven, of which that in the tabernacle was an emblem."
2. "The 'real' tabernacle in heaven, of which that among the Hebrews was but the type."
3. "Heaven has been prepared by God himself, and whatever is necessary to constitute that an appropriate abode for the divine majesty has been done by him."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Leitourgia in LXX rarely of the service of the priests, often of the Levites." 
2. "The heavenly sanctuary. Ta agia the most holy place." 
3. "The true tabernacle [της σκηνης της αλυθινης] . Explanatory oftwn aJgiwn. The form of expression is emphatic : the tabernacle, the genuine one, as compared with the tabernacle in the wilderness."

### John Calvin:
1. "The old tabernacle was not the empty inventions of man, but the effigy of the heavenly tabernacle."
2. "Whatever of an earthly kind appears at first sight to be in Christ, it is to be viewed spiritually by the eye of faith."
3. "Christ is a priest and a minister in sacred things, and a minister in the true tabernacle. He has holy things to do, and he does them, not in the shadowy and typical tabernacle, but in that which is real and celestial."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Christ’s place and work are described in terms taken from the divisions of the earthly copy of the spiritual or heavenly reality."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Of the holy places" (τα αγια), without any distinction... between the holy place and the most holy place as in Hebrews 9:2.
2. By way of explanation of των αγιων. For σκηνη see Matthew 17:4 and σκηνος (2 Corinthians 5:1), old word used here for the antitype or archetype of the tabernacle in the wilderness in which Aaron served, the ideal tabernacle in heaven of which the earthly tabernacle was a symbol and reproduced in the temple which merely copied the tabernacle.
3. Hence it is the "genuine" tabernacle and see John 1:9 for αληθινος.

2. "Christ is a minister to his people in heaven, interceding for them."

These quotes highlight the role of Christ as a minister in the heavenly sanctuary, his intercession for his people, and the divine nature of his human incarnation.

### John Wesley:
1. "A minister — Who represents his own sacrifice, as the high priest did the blood of those sacrifices once a year." 
2. "Of the sanctuary — Heaven, typified by the holy of holies." 
3. "Not man — As Moses fixed the tabernacle."
