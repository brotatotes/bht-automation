# Hebrews 8:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Bible verse being described is about the ceremonial service of the Levitical priests in the tabernacle, which was a mere shadow and copy of heavenly things. The earthly worship and rituals were appointed by God and had a real and spiritual meaning. The priests and their service were a representation of the heavenly sanctuary, and their worship was meant to lead people to Christ, who is the true high priest performing his service in heaven. It is emphasized that all worship should be done according to God's divine rule and pattern.

2. "The tabernacle, and tabernacle worship, were of divine institution; the ceremonious rites of the Jews were not, as some have affirmed, borrowed from the Egyptians; nor were they given as diversions to that people, nor only to preserve them from idolatry, and keep them separate from others, but were designed to lead them to Christ, whom they were typical of."
3. "Moreover, it may be gathered from hence, that whatever is done in a way of religious worship, should be according to a divine rule; a church of Christ ought to be formed according to the primitive pattern, and should consist, not of all that are born in a nation, province, or parish; nor should all that are born of believing parents be admitted into it."

3. "And shadow — Or shadowy representation, which gives you some dim and imperfect idea of the body, but not the fine features, not the distinguishing air; none of those living graces which adorn the real person."
