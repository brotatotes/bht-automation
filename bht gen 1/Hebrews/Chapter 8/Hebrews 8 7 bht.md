## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Argumentation, exactly as in ch. Hebrews 7:11, from sayings of God, to show the imperfection of the former covenant." 
2. "For if that first (covenant) were blameless, a place would not be sought." 
3. "It is far better to understand it of a place in history, and regard the expression as 'a place is found' and 'a place is taken' in references."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The law in its morality was blameless (Greek, 'amomos'); but in saving us it was defective, and so not faultless (Greek, 'amemptos')."
2. "The old covenant would have anticipated all man's wants, so as to give no occasion for seeking something more perfectly adequate."
3. "The law in its morality was blameless, but in saving us it was defective."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It is implied here that God had said that that covenant was not perfect or faultless."
2. "The meaning is not that that first covenant made under Moses had any real faults - or inculcated what was wrong, but that it did not contain the ample provision for the pardon of sin and the salvation of the soul which was desirable."
3. "It was merely 'preparatory' to the gospel."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "If that first covenant had been faultless, there would no place have been sought for a second."
2. "A search would not have been going on. This implies a sense of dissatisfaction while the old covenant was still in force, and a looking about for something better."
3. "It is to be shown that the Levitical system answered to a covenant which was recognized as imperfect and transitory by an O. T. prophet, since he spoke of a divine purpose to establish a new covenant."

### John Calvin:
1. "He confirms what he had said of the excellency of the covenant which God has made with us through Christ; and he confirms it on this ground, because the covenant of the Law was neither valid nor permanent; for if nothing was wanting in it, why was another substituted for it?"
2. "Though the crime of violating the covenant was justly imputed to the people, who had through their own perfidy departed from God, yet the weakness of the covenant is also pointed out, because it was not written in their hearts."
3. "Then, to render it perfect and valid, God declares that it needed an amendment. It was not, therefore, without reason that the Apostle contended that a place was to be sought for a second."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The better promises implied in what follows are themselves a proof of the inferiority of the old covenant." 
2. "No place would have been sought in the development of the Divine purpose, in the plan of redemption." 
3. "The old covenant was merely a shadow, a temporary arrangement, pointing to the greater reality and fulfillment found in the new covenant."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "The word διαθηκη (covenant) is not expressed, but clearly meant by the feminine gender πρωτη." 
2. "The condition is second class and assumes that the old covenant was not 'blameless,' apparently a serious charge which he hastens to explain." 
3. "The conclusion with αν and the imperfect passive indicative (εζητειτο) is clearly a second-class condition."

### John Gill:
1. "The covenant here designed is the covenant of grace, as administered under the legal dispensation, and which was a typical one; the people with whom it was made were typical of the true Israel of God; the blessings promised in it were shadows of good things to come." 

2. "There was a weakness in it; its sacrifices could not make men perfect, nor take away sin; there wanted a larger supply of the grace of the Spirit to write the law of God upon the heart, and to enable men to keep it."

3. "The covenant of grace unveiled in the Gospel dispensation, called the better testament, the better covenant, and the new covenant; in order to introduce which, the first was removed, that this might succeed it."
