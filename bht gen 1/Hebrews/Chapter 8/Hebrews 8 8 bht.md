# Hebrews 8:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse being described speaks of a new covenant, one that is different from the old covenant. This new covenant is fulfilled in the Gospel covenant, where God forgives His people's sins and writes His law on the hearts of believers. It is a covenant that is not limited to the house of Israel but extends to all people, offering a more full and clear account of spiritual religion. It is a covenant ratified by the death of Christ and accompanied by the larger influences of the Spirit. This new covenant is everlasting and will never be abolished.
