# Hebrews 9:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse being described speaks of the first covenant and its liturgical ordinances, which were divinely ordained and rested on God's revelation. This old covenant had a sanctuary on earth, constructed to replicate heavenly patterns. The copula "τε" in the description of the sanctuary implies a close connection between the noun and the adjective. The verse emphasizes the imperfect representation of the tabernacle, which referred to what was to come. The earthly sanctuary with its rituals was a part of the old covenant and has now been superseded by Christ's coming.

2. "As the writer is commending the first covenant, ‘of this world’ can hardly be only depreciatory. The word used, when not used ethically, describes the world in its order and beauty; and this is part of the thought: of this world indeed, and yet costly and beautiful."
