# Hebrews 9:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse being described is about the limitations of the precepts and external ordinances imposed by the religious authorities. It emphasizes the focus on external rules, particularly in relation to dietary restrictions, and suggests that they were insufficient to bring about true transformation. These rules were temporary and were meant to be replaced by something greater - the arrival of Christ and the subsequent reformation of religious practices. They served as a foundation for a future time when all would be made right in the conscience, in the life, and with God.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The gifts and offerings, e.g. those of the day of atonement, had far other reference than merely to meats and drinks and washings: nay, these were parables in reference to higher things."
2. "They regarded material things, gifts, sacrifices, meats, drinks, washings, which from their very nature could only affect the outward, not the inward man."
3. "When all these things would be better arranged, the substance put where the shadow was before, the sufficient grace where the insufficient type."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The rites of meats, &c., go side by side with the sacrifices."
2. "Usage subsequently to the law added many observances as to meats and drinks."
3. "Carnal ordinances" stand in apposition to "sacrifices."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The ordinances of the Jews... consisted much of laws pertaining to what was lawful to eat and drink." 
2. "The various ablutions which were required in the service of the tabernacle and the temple." 
3. "The object was rather to keep them 'externally' pure than to cleanse the conscience and make them holy in heart."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The impotence of the gifts and sacrifices lay in the fact that they were only symbolic ordinances."
2. "Meats and drinks and divers washings, clean and unclean meats, drinks, concerning which the Levitical law laid down no prescriptions except as to abstinence in the case of a Nazarite vow, and of the priests when they were about to officiate."
3. "The time of reformation is the Christian age, when God made with his people a better covenant. It was inaugurated by the death of Christ."

### John Calvin:
1. "The new covenant succeeded the old as a reformation."
2. "He expressly mentions meats and drinks, and other things of minor importance, because by these trifling observances a more certain opinion may be formed how far short was the Law of the perfection of the Gospel."
3. "Although the original text in the book refers to Jeremiah 31:37, which warns of an ultimate rejection of Israel; it would seem that Jeremiah 31:31 is more appropriate in the current context of reformation."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "They purified the flesh and not the spirit. They failed to meet the demands of the awakened conscience and to bring back that blessed fellowship with God which sin destroys."
2. "Burdensome in themselves, they were also inadequate for spiritual purposes. They were imposed on men to prepare them for better things, and for a better time, when all is to be put right in the conscience, in the life, and with God."
3. "The time of reformation, not 'a time,' as if there were several, not quite 'the time;' the Greek simply marks the quality of the time itself 'until what is to prove God’s set time, when all is to be made straight' is described in the following verses."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "What ritual value these Levitical sacrifices had was confined to minute regulations about diet and ceremonial cleansing (clean and unclean)."
2. "Carnal ordinances (δικαιωμασιν σαρκος). But the correct text is undoubtedly simply δικαιωματα σαρκος (nominative case), in apposition with δωρα τε κα θυσια (gifts and sacrifices)."
3. "Christianity itself is the great Reformation of the current Judaism (Pharisaism) and the spiritual Judaism foreshadowed by the old Abrahamic promise."

### John Gill:
1. "There only were meat offerings and drink offerings; things which only respect the body, and cannot therefore make perfect, as to the conscience."
2. "These were the washings of the priests and of the Israelites, and of sacrifices, and of garments, and of vessels and other things; and which, because they were performed by immersion, they are called 'baptisms'."
3. "They were enjoined the Jews only, though by God himself; and were put upon them as a burden, or a yoke, and which was on some accounts intolerable, but were not to continue any longer than the time of the Gospel."

### John Wesley:
1. "They could not so perfect him" - The commentary highlights the limitations of the precepts and external ordinances imposed by the religious authorities. It suggests that these rules were insufficient to bring about true perfection or transformation in an individual's life.
