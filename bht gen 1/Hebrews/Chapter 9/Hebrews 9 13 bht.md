# Hebrews 9:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This verse describes a significant Old Testament ritual involving the ashes of a red heifer. The commentators provide insights into the symbolic and ceremonial aspects of this practice. The ashes of the heifer, mixed with water, were used to purify individuals from ceremonial impurity. While this ritual had an external cleansing effect, it did not have the power to cleanse from sin or purify the conscience. The significance of the heifer's ashes lies in their ability to restore legal purity, allowing those who were once excluded to rejoin the community and engage in worship.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "If the blood of mere brutes could purify in any, however small a degree, how much more shall inward purification, and complete and eternal salvation, be wrought by the blood of Christ, in whom dwelt all the fulness of the Godhead?"
2. "The water of separation, made of the ashes of the red heifer, was the provision for removing ceremonial defilement whenever incurred by contact with the dead. As she was slain without the camp, so Christ... The ashes were laid by for constant use; so the continually cleansing effects of Christ's blood, once for all shed."
3. "In our wilderness journey we are continually contracting defilement by contact with the spiritually dead, and with dead works, and need therefore continual application to the antitypical life-giving cleansing blood of Christ, whereby we are afresh restored to peace and living communion with God in the heavenly holy place."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The ashes of the heifer, after it was burnt, should be kept 'for a water of separation; it is a purification for sin.' That is, the ashes were to be carefully preserved, and being mixed with water were sprinkled on those who were from any cause ceremonially impure."
2. "The nature of these institutions also required that this should be in connection with 'sacrifice,' and in order to this, it was arranged that there should be this 'permanent sacrifice' - the ashes of the heifer that had been sacrificed - of which they could avail themselves at any time, without the expense and delay of making a bloody offering specifically for the occasion."
3. "The apostle goes on to argue that if they had such an efficacy, it was fair to presume that the blood of Christ would have far greater efficacy, and would reach to the conscience itself, and make that pure."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The two examples selected cover the entire legal provision for removing uncleanness, whether contracted by sin or by contact with death." 
2. "The Levitical law required two remedies: the Christian economy furnishes one for all phases of defilement." 
3. "For the unclean, rend. them that have been defiled. The literal rendering of the participle brings out better the incidental or occasional character of the defilement."

### John Calvin:
1. "The cleansing of the flesh they leave explained of what avails among men, as the heathens had their expiations to blot out the infamy of crimes. But this explanation is indeed very heathenish; for wrong is done to God’s promises, if we restrict the effect to civil matters only."
2. "Often does this declaration occur in the writings of Moses, that iniquity was expiated when a sacrifice was duly offered. This is no doubt the spiritual teaching of faith."
3. "If the blood of beasts was a true symbol of purgation, so that it cleansed in a sacramental manner, how much more shall Christ who is himself the truth, not only bear witness to a purgation by an external rite, but also really perform this for consciences?"

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The case of the 'ashes of the heifer' is one of the most suggestive symbols of the Law." 
2. "The heifer without spot, slain by the priest without the camp, its blood sprinkled in the direction of the tabernacle, the animal itself burnt with solemn rites, its ashes laid up in a clean place." 
3. "All was done to secure an outward purity only."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Ashes (σποδος). Old word, in N. T. only here, Matthew 11:21; Luke 10:13. Common in LXX."
2. "Of a heifer (δαμαλεως). Old word (δαμαλις), a red heifer whose ashes mingled with water (μετα υδατος, verse Hebrews 9:19) were sprinkled (ραντιζουσα, present active participle of ραντιζω, in LXX, though ραινω more common) on the contaminated or defiled ones (Hebrews 9:19) as the blood of bulls and goats was offered for sins (Hebrews 9:16)."
3. "Sanctify (αγιαζε). First-class condition, assumed as true. This ceremonial ritual does serve 'for the cleansing (καθαροτητα, old word here only in N.T.) of the flesh,' but not for the conscience (verse Hebrews 9:9). The cow was αμωμον, the individual καθαρος."

### John Gill:
1. "Neither of them can purge from sin." - The blood of animals, such as bulls and goats, may have been used in ancient rituals, but they were incapable of truly cleansing or forgiving sins.

2. "The ashes of an heifer sprinkling the unclean." - The apostle refers to the practice of using the ashes of a red heifer mixed with water to create the water of sprinkling, which was used to purify unclean individuals.

3. "It only sanctifieth to the purifying of the flesh." - The water of sprinkling, although it had a symbolic and external cleansing effect, could only purify the body and not truly sanctify the heart or cleanse the soul from sin.

### John Wesley:
1. "The ashes of an heifer...purified the flesh" - This verse highlights the symbolic power of the ashes of a heifer in removing legal uncleanness and restoring purity to the individual. 

2. "Consumed by fire as a sin-offering" - The act of consuming the heifer by fire emphasizes the sacrificial nature of this purification process, reminding us of the need for atonement and forgiveness for our sins. 

3. "Re-admitted them to the temple and the congregation" - Through the sprinkling of the ashes, those who were once excluded due to their uncleanness were able to be reintegrated into the community and participate fully in the worship and fellowship of the temple.
