# Hebrews 9:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we see the voluntary and efficacious nature of Christ's offering, which began on the cross and was completed by entering the holiest place with His blood. Christ's sacrifice on the cross, being inwardly stainless, cleanses the deepest part of our being, the conscience. It is through the eternal Spirit that Christ, as the perfect and unblemished sacrifice, offers Himself to God. The purpose of this purgation of conscience, achieved by Christ's blood, is to serve the living God in a life of faith and perfect holiness.
