# Hebrews 9:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we learn about the pre-eminent spiritual virtue of Christ's redeeming blood, which makes Him the perfect Mediator of the new covenant. Through His death, Christ secures forgiveness for sins not covered by the old imperfect covenant and promises an eternal inheritance to those who are called. His blood is efficacious, extending its efficacy throughout time and redeeming transgressions both past and present. As the fulfillment of the divine covenant, Christ's sacrifice paves the way for the adoption of believers as children and heirs of eternal life.
