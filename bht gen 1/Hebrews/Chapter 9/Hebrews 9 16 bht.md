"And if it be objected to this, that a testament may exist many years before the death of the testator, the answer is easy, that the Writer here defines his own meaning of ὅπου διαθήκη, when he says διαθήκη γὰρ ἐπὶ νεκροῖς βεβαία: viz. that the document in question does not in reality become a διαθήκη, a disposition, till it is of force, till things are disposed by it."
