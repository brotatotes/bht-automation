# Hebrews 9:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse under consideration highlights the necessity of death in the fulfillment of a testament or covenant. The commentaries emphasize the ineffectiveness of a will or covenant as long as the testator or covenanting victim is alive. It is only upon their death that the covenant takes effect, granting rights and making provisions for the recipients. The perplexity of the passage and alternate interpretations contribute to the deeper contemplation of the role of death in the establishment of the covenant.
