# Hebrews 9:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This verse discusses the dedication and ratification of the first covenant, contrasting it with the new covenant. The first covenant was inaugurated without blood as a temporary arrangement, while the new covenant, symbolized by the shedding of Jesus' blood, brings eternal redemption. The death of the victims and the sprinkling of their blood were necessary to confirm the old covenant, foreshadowing the ultimate sacrifice of Christ in the new covenant.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:

3. "When regarded as the typical representative of the new, [the Old Testament] is strictly a Testament."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The death of the victim was necessary to confirm the covenant, was the 'reason' why the first covenant was ratified with blood."

### John Calvin:
1. "The Apostle then says, that the old testament or covenant was dedicated with blood. He hence concludes, that men were even then reminded, that it could not be valid and efficacious except death intervened."
2. "He first teaches us that the covenant was dedicated or consecrated, not that it had in itself anything profane; but as there is nothing so holy that men by their uncleanness will not defile, except God prevents it by making a renewal of all things, therefore the dedication was made on account of men, who alone wanted it."
3. "For whenever God was to be called upon, they turned themselves to the sanctuary; and it was a common way of speaking to say that they stood before the Lord when they appeared in the temple."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The notion of a will, though familiar to Western civilization, was not familiar in countries where each child's portion was settled by law."
2. "All solemn covenants under the Law were made valid by the death of a victim which represented the covenanting persons, and pledged them on peril of their lives to faithfulness."
3. "If the rendering 'testament' is preferred, and 'testator,' it is best to regard Hebrews 9:16-17 as an illustrative argument, a parallel case, suggested partly by the mention of an inheritance and partly by the double meaning of the Greek word (covenant or testament)."
