# Hebrews 9:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we see the meticulous adherence to the law by Moses, leaving no room for variation or deviation. The specific elements used in the ritual, such as the blood, water, scarlet wool, and hyssop, hold deep significance and symbolism. The act of sprinkling the blood, both upon the book and the people, sanctifies and emphasizes the importance of the covenant and its connection to the people. It is through such acts that the imperfections of the law and man's obedience to it are revealed, pointing towards the need for the blood and life of Christ.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The law was ὁ νόμος τῶν ἐντολῶν, and these ἐντολαί were faithfully reported, spoken according to the law, i.e. as the law directed, not varying from it in any point." 
2. "The additions made here to the text of Exodus fill up the account with subsequent usage, presuming that the solemn legal appointment of various ceremonial details was a divine sanction of practices already existing." 
3. "The book is of course that out of which he had just read the ordinances of God: τὸ βιβλίον τῆς διαθήκης."

1. "The law in Exodus sanctioned formally many sacrificial practices in use by tradition, from the primitive revelation long before."
2. "Scarlet or crimson, resembling blood: it was thought to be a peculiarly deep, fast dye, whence it typified sin."
3. "The sprinkling of the roll (so the Greek for 'book') of the covenant, or testament, as well as of the people, implies that neither can the law be fulfilled, nor the people be purged from their sins, save by the sprinkling of the blood of Christ."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The mere omission by Moses cannot demonstrate that it was not done."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The author uses the account in Exodus 24:3 'with characteristic freedom' (Moffatt)." 
2. "There is nothing there about the water, the scarlet wool, and hyssop. It had become the custom to mingle water with the blood and to use a wisp of wool or a stem of hyssop for sprinkling."
