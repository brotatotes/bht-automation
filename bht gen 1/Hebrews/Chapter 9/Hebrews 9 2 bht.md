# Hebrews 9:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In describing the significance of the various articles in the tabernacle, commentators shed light on the nature of the first division, or "holy place." It is highlighted as a beautiful and sacred area, containing the candlestick and table, which symbolize the dissemination of light and life, and the provision of communion and nourishment. The candlestick represents the church, holding forth the light of the gospel, while the table represents Christ and communion with Him. Additionally, the shewbread, continually shown before God and the people, signifies Christ as the bread of life and the sustenance for His people.

### Henry Alford:
1. "The general idea σκηνή is put forward anarthrously, and afterwards defined by appositional epithets having the article."
2. "The question, whether the Writer thinks (locally) of two tabernacles, or is speaking of the first portion of one and the same tabernacle, is of no great importance: the former would be but a common way of expressing the latter."
3. "There can be no doubt that it is neut. plur. This is insisted on as early as by Thdrt.: προπαροξυτόνως ἀναγνωστέον τὰ ἅγια · οὕτω γὰρ ἡμᾶς διδάσκει νοεῖν τὸ ἕτερον ὄνομα: viz. ἅγια ἁγίων, Hebrews 9:3."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The candlestick consisted of a shaft and six branches of gold, seven in all, the bowls made like almonds, with a knop and a flower in one branch." 
2. "The table of shittim wood, covered with gold, was for the showbread." 
3. "The Eucharist continues until our entrance into the heavenly Holy of Holies."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The apostle proceeds now to enumerate the various articles of furniture which were in the two rooms of the tabernacle and temple. His object seems to be, not for information, for it could not be supposed that they to whom he was writing were ignorant on this point, but partly to show that it could not be said that he spoke of that of which he had no information, or that he undervalued it; and partly to show the real nature of the institution, and to prove that it was of an imperfect and typical character, and had a designed reference to something that was to come."
2. "The candlestick was undoubtedly designed to furnish light in the dark room of the tabernacle and temple; and in accordance with the general plan of those edifices, was ornamented after the most chaste and pure views of ornamental architecture of those times - but there is no evidence that its branches, and bowls, and knops, and flowers each had a special typical significance. The sacred writers are wholly silent as to any such reference, and it is not well to attempt to be 'wise above that which is written.' An expositor of the Scripture cannot have a safer guide than the sacred writers themselves."
3. "Perhaps the true idea, after all that has been written and conjectured is, that the table and the bread were for the sake of carrying out the idea that the tabernacle was the dwelling-place of God, and that there was a propriety that it should be prepared with the usual appurtenances of a dwelling. Hence, there was a candlestick and a table, because these were the common and ordinary furniture of a room; and the idea was to be kept up constantly that that was the dwelling-place of the Most High by lighting and trimming the lamps every day, and by renewing the bread on the table periodically."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The first tabernacle, that is, the first division of the tabernacle. He speaks of the two divisions as two tabernacles."
2. "Rend. lampstand...Description in Exodus 25:31-37. Comp. Zechariah 4:0."
3. "The table and the loaves are treated as one item. Lit. the table and the setting forth o f the loaves, that is, the table with its loaves set forth."

### John Calvin:
1. "It is then sufficient for our present purpose to consider the tabernacle in its three parts, — the first was the court of the people; the middle was commonly called the sanctuary; and the last was the inner sanctuary, which they called, by way of eminence, the holy of holies." 

2. "There, the Apostle says, was theθυμιατήριον by which name I understand the altar of incense, or fumigation, rather than the censer." 

3. "But it is easy to reconcile these two passages: God had commanded the pot and Aaron’s rod to be laid up before the testimony; it is hence probable that they were deposited in the ark, together with the tables."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The writer first notes the beauty of the holy place."

3. "The first wherein were the candlestick and the table and the shewbread."

2. "The candlestick (η λυχνια, late word for λυχνιον) or lampstand, necessary since there were no windows." 
3. "The shewbread (η προθεσις των αρτων) as in Exodus 25:30; Exodus 40:23; Leviticus 24:5-9. Probably a hendiadys for the table with the loaves of God's Presence."

### John Gill:
1. "The candlestick...was a type of Christ mystical, or the church; in the general use of it, to hold forth light, so the church holds forth the light of the Gospel, being put into it by Christ."
2. "The table...was typical of Christ, and of communion with him; of the person of Christ; in the matter of it, which was Shittim wood overlaid with gold, whereby were signified the two natures of Christ in one person."
3. "The shewbread...may be typical of Christ himself, who is the bread of life, the food of his people; and may be signified by the shewbread for its fineness and purity, being made of fine flour, Christ is the finest of the wheat, bread from heaven, and angels' food."

### John Wesley:
1. "The candlestick and the table...seem to have typified the light and life which are more largely dispensed under the gospel by Him who is the Light of the world, and the Bread of life."
