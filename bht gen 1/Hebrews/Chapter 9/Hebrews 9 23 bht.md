# Hebrews 9:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The heavenly things themselves, which include the patterns, exemplars, and realities shown to Moses in the mount, required purification. Through the atoning blood of Christ, heaven was consecrated and made accessible to sinners. This purification was superior to the levitical purification, as it was accomplished by a perfect sacrifice. The heavenly sanctuary, the heavenly pattern, and even the human nature of Christ were purified, not because of impurity, but to fulfill the divine plan of reconciliation and enable us to approach God with acceptability and worship.

"But the heavenly things themselves, with better sacrifices than these; the sum and substance of the above patterns, shadows, and examples, such as heaven itself; which though not impure in itself, yet some think it, may be said to be purified, because saints are made meet for it, by being purged with the blood of Christ."
