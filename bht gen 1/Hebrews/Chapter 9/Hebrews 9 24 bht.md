# Hebrews 9:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Bible verse being described portrays the unique and transcendent nature of Christ's presence before God. He has entered into the heavenly sanctuary, the true and genuine holy place where God's presence is manifested. Unlike the earthly tabernacle or temple made by human hands, Christ's entrance into the true temple of heaven is significant. He presents Himself as our eternal offering, advocating for our salvation in the face of God, representing us and pleading for our favor. Through Christ, we have access to God's presence, and He manifests Himself openly before the face of God in our behalf.
