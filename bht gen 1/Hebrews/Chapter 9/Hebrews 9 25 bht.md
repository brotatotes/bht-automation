# Hebrews 9:25 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse being described speaks of Christ's unique and perfect sacrifice, which differs from the Levitical sacrifices that needed repetition. Christ entered the true sanctuary, not with the blood of animals, but with his own blood. This once-for-all offering was so efficacious that it need not be repeated, unlike the sacrifices of the Jewish high priest. Through his sacrifice, Christ obtained complete salvation, satisfying justice and fulfilling the law.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "This προσφέρειν ἑαυτόν is not to be understood of Christ’s death, nor confounded, as Owen, Thol., De Wette, Ebrard, Lünem., and many others have done, with παθεῖν below: see there."
2. "ὥς περ, as ὅς περ, ὅσος περ, and other words lengthened by περ (περί), implies a thorough similitude as far as the thing compared goes."
3. "He enters, furnished with, as it were clad with, that which follows. We use our ‘in’ of even the lesser articles of personal wear in a similar sense: ‘a man in spectacles’."

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "It was not into the typical, but the true sanctuary, that Christ is entered."
2. "His sacrifice needs not, as the Levitical sacrifices did, to be repeated."
3. "Nor yet did He enter for this purpose that He may offer Himself often, that is, present Himself in the presence of God, as the high priest does, year by year, on the day of atonement, entering the Holy of Holies."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The offering made by Christ, and the work which he performed, differed from that of the Jewish high priest."
2. "It was not needful that he should enter the holy place but once."
3. "Christ entered there with his own blood."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "His offering did not need repetition like the Levitical sacrifices."
2. "Offer himself refers rather to Christ's entrance into the heavenly sanctuary and presentation of himself before God, than to his offering on the cross."
3. "The point is that, being once in the heavenly sanctuary, Christ was not compelled to renew often his presentation of himself there, since, in that case, it would be necessary for him to suffer often."

### John Calvin:
1. "It is not required of a priest that he should be continually sacrificing; for even under the Law there were days appointed for the chief sacrifices every year; they had also their hours daily morning and evening."
2. "But as that only true sacrifice which Christ offered once for all is ever efficacious, and thus perpetual in its effects, it is no wonder that on its virtue, which never fails, Christ’s eternal priesthood should be sustained."
3. "Christ differs from the Levitical priest... Christ offered himself and not an animal; and he adds another; that he repeated not his sacrifice, as under the Law, for the repetition there was frequent and even incessant."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "That he should offer himself often" - Purpose clause with present active subjunctive of προσφερω, emphasizing the repeated nature of Christ's self-offering.
2. "Keep on offering himself, like Hebrews 5:1; Hebrews 5:3" - Comparing Christ's self-offering to the actions of the high priests in Hebrews 5:1 and 5:3, highlighting the significance of Christ's sacrifice.

### John Gill:
1. "Which shows the perfection of his sacrifice, for justice was satisfied, the law fulfilled, sin done away, and complete salvation obtained at once."
2. "Which lies against the errors of the Socinians, who say he offers himself now in heaven; and of the Papists, who pretend to offer the body of Christ daily in their mass."
3. "Christ entered into heaven with his own blood, he having been altar, priest, and sacrifice: the high priest went into the most holy place every year, but Christ has entered into heaven once for all, where he sits down and continues, having done his work effectually."
