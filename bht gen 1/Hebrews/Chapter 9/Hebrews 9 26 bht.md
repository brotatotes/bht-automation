## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "If Christ’s view in entering heaven was, to offer, present, himself often to God, then, as a condition of that frequent presentation, there would be an antecedent necessity for Him to suffer often."
2. "The theatre of Christ’s sufferings is of necessity this present world, pointing out that those supposed repeated sufferings must necessarily in that case take place within the temporal limits indicated by ἀπὸ καταβολῆς κόσμου."
3. "Between the first and second coming of Christ, the N. T. Scriptures know of no intermediate interposition of the divine dealings with men: in Him we are τέλειοι, and at His appearing, our αἰῶνες had their συντέλεια."

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "His oblation of Himself before God was once for all (that is, the bringing in of His blood into the heavenly Holy of Holies), and therefore the preliminary suffering was once for all."
2. "The continued sins of men, from their first creation, would entail a continual suffering on earth, and consequent oblation of His blood in the heavenly holiest place, since the foundation of the world, if the one oblation 'in the fulness of time' were not sufficient."
3. "The offering of Christ was a thing once done that it might be thought of for ever."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "If his blood had no more efficacy than what the Jewish high priest offered, and which was so often repeated, it would have been necessary that Christ should have often died."
2. "Once for all; once in the sense that it is not to be repeated again."
3. "He has been manifested in human form. To put away sin. By the sacrifice of himself."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The phrase 'since the foundation of the world' emphasizes the timeless nature of sin and the need for atonement. Sin has been a problem since the beginning of creation, and it requires a solution that transcends time and space." 

2. "The mention of sin requiring atonement highlights the seriousness of sin and the need for a sacrifice to cleanse and redeem humanity. This verse reminds us that sin is not to be taken lightly, and it necessitates a divine intervention to restore the broken relationship between God and humanity." 

3. "This passage serves as a summary restatement of the previous discussions in chapter 8. It encapsulates the key points and themes, reminding readers of the significance of Christ's sacrifice and the new covenant that brings forgiveness and reconciliation."

### John Calvin:
1. "For he hence concludes that he must have died often; for death is connected with sacrifices. How this latter supposition is most unreasonable; it then follows that the virtue of the one sacrifice is eternal and extends to all ages."
2. "Except then the sacrifice of Christ was efficacious, no one of the fathers would have obtained salvation; for as they were exposed to God’s wrath, a remedy for deliverance would have failed them, had not Christ by suffering once suffered so much as was necessary to reconcile men to God from the beginning of the world even to the end."
3. "But now once in the end of the world, etc. He calls that the end of the world or the consummation of the ages, which Paul calls 'the fullness of time,' (Galatians 4:4;) for it was the maturity of that time which God had determined in his eternal purpose; and thus cut off is every occasion for men’s curiosity, that they may not dare to inquire why it was no sooner, or why in that age rather than in another."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Since, if that were true, it would be necessary for him to suffer often."
2. "The one sacrifice of Christ is of absolute and final value."
3. "Jesus came once for all."
4. "The sacrifice of Christ dealt with sin as a principle: the Levitical sacrifices with individual transgressions."

### John Gill:
1. "Christ's sufferings were but once, though the virtue of them is always, both before and after."
2. "His appearance was but to a very few, and for a little time; and the time of it was, 'in the end of the world.'"
3. "The end of his appearance was, to put away sin; the filth of it, by his blood; the guilt of it, by his atoning sacrifice; and the punishment of it, by his sufferings and death."

### John Wesley:
1. "By suffering once he atoned for all the sins which had been committed from the foundation of the world."
2. "He could not have atoned for them without suffering."
3. "The sacrifice of Christ divides the whole age or duration of the world into two parts, and extends its virtue backward and forward, from this middle point wherein they meet to abolish both the guilt and power of sin."
