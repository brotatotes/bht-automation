# Hebrews 9:27 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Bible verse being described highlights the relationship between death and judgment. Commentators emphasize that death is an appointed event, not a random occurrence, reminding us of our mortality and the undeniable connection to our sinful nature. While physical death is a universal experience, it points to a deeper truth — that we await the second coming of Christ with patience, just as we patiently wait for the day of judgment. In this verse, death is not the end, but rather a gateway to the ultimate judgment before Christ, where both believers and non-believers will face their respective destinies.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Christ is not only a fit object of comparison with man, but is man."
2. "It is appointed to men once to die."
3. "Next to death, with no more like events between, comes judgment."

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "He is the representative man; and there is a strict correspondence between the history of man and that of the Son of man."
2. "The two most solemn facts of our being are here connected with the two most gracious truths of our dispensation, our death and judgment answering in parallelism to Christ's first coming to die for us, and His second coming to consummate our salvation."
3. "The intermediate state is a state of joyous, or else agonizing and fearful, expectation of 'judgment'; after the judgment comes the full and final state of joy, or else woe."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Death is the result of 'appointment;' it is not the effect of chance, or haphazard. It is not a 'debt of nature.' It is not the condition to which man was subject by the laws of his creation. It is not to be accounted for by the mere principles of physiology. God could as well have made the heart to play forever as for 50 years. Death is no more the regular result of physical laws than the guillotine and the gallows are."
2. "In every death, then, we have a demonstration that the race is guilty; in each case of mortality we have an affecting memento that we are individually transgressors."
3. "The dying pang, the chill, the cold sweat, are not to be repeated. Death is not to approach us often - he is to be allowed to come to us but once. When we have once passed through the dark valley, we shall have the assurance that we shall never tread its gloomy way again."

### John Calvin:
1. "Since we patiently wait after death for the day of judgment, it being the common lot of nature which it is not right to struggle against; why should there be less patience in waiting for the second coming of Christ?"
2. "For if a long interval of time does not diminish, as to men, the hope of a happy resurrection, how unreasonable would it be to render less honor to Christ?"
3. "But less would it be, were we to call upon him to undergo a second death, when he had once died."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "It is appointed (αποκειτα). Present middle (or passive) of αποκειμα, 'is laid away' for men." 
2. "Once to die (απαξ αποθανειν). Once for all to die, as once for all to live here. No reincarnation here." 
3. "After this cometh judgement (μετα τουτο κρισις). Death is not all. Man has to meet Christ as Judge as Jesus himself graphically pictures."

### John Gill:
1. "Men's days can neither be lengthened nor shortened, either by Christ himself, or others."
2. "It is the comfort of the saints, that though they die the first death, they shall not be hurt of the second death."
3. "There is a particular judgment which is immediately after death; by virtue of which, the souls of men are condemned to their proper state of happiness or woe."

### John Wesley:
1. "At the moment of death every man's final state is determined."
2. "There is not a word in scripture of a particular judgment immediately after death."
3. "The judgment refers to the great day, when all will be held accountable for their actions."
