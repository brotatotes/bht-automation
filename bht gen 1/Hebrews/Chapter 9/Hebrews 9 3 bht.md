# Hebrews 9:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Bible verse being described in this paragraph is talking about the significance of the two veils in the temple. These veils serve to separate the holy from the most holy place, symbolizing the barrier between God and humanity. The presence of the second veil emphasizes the sacredness and holiness of the most holy place, serving as a reminder of limited access to God's presence. However, through Christ's sacrifice, the barriers were torn down, granting believers direct access to God and removing the separation between God and humanity.

1. "The reason of these two vails may be seen in the account Maimonides gives of this matter: 'in the first temple there was a wall which divided between the holy, and holy of holies, the thickness of a cubit; but when they built the second temple, it was doubted by them, whether the thickness of the wall was of the measure of the holy place, or of the measure of the holy of holies; wherefore they made the holy of holies twenty cubits complete, and the holy place forty cubits complete, and they left the space of a cubit between the holy, and the holy of holies.'" 

2. "This vail, or vails, might represent the sin of man, which separates between God and men, excludes from heaven; but is removed by the death of Christ, when the vail was rent in twain; so that now there is an open way to heaven; Christ has entered into it by his own blood; and saints have boldness to enter there by faith and hope now, and shall hereafter personally enter into it."

3. "Now within this second vail wasthe tabernacle, or that part of it, the second part,which is called the holiest of all; which was either typical of Christ, who is called the most Holy, Daniel 9:24 he being so in both natures, divine and human; or of heaven, for the holy places, made with hands, were figures of heaven, Hebrews 9:24 for its holiness, it being the habitation of the holy God, holy angels, and spirits of just men made perfect; and for its invisibility, and the unseen things which faith and hope, which enter within the vail, are the evidence of; and for the things that are in it, typified by the following ones."
