# Hebrews 9:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we find a description of the sacred items housed in the Holy of Holies. Among them is the golden censer, a tool used for burning incense, symbolizing both the prayers of the saints and the high priest's intercession. The ark of the covenant, a gold-plated chest, contains the tables of the covenant as well as the significant items of manna and Aaron's rod. Together, these treasures represent God's provision, the priesthood, and His covenant with His people. The Holy of Holies is a place of reverence and protection, guarded carefully throughout the history of the Hebrew commonwealth.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The first difficulty is respecting the meaning of the word θυμιατήριον. And here the etymology gives us no help. For the word is a neut. adj., importing anything having regard to or employed in the burning of incense. It may therefore mean either an altar upon which, or a censer in which, incense was burnt."
2. "The Author treats the Holy of holies, irrespective of the veil, as symbolical of the heavenly sanctuary, and had also a motive to include in it the altar of incense, whose offerings of incense are the symbol of the prayers of the saints."
3. "The solution to be gathered from this would be, that the altar of incense, being appointed by the Mosaic ordinance to stand in immediate contiguity to the veil separating the Holy of holies, and being destined in its use especially for the service of the Holy of holies, and being described in more than one place of Scripture as connected with the sanctuary, is taken by the Writer as appertaining to the Holy of holies."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The golden censer was only used on the day of atonement...and is therefore associated with the holiest place, as being taken into it on that anniversary by the high priest."
2. "The incense answers to the prayers of the saints; and the altar though outside the holiest place, is connected with it."
3. "The rending of the veil by Christ has brought the antitypes to the altar, candlestick, and showbread of the anterior holy place into the holiest place, heaven."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The fact that Moses does not expressly mention it, does not prove that in fact no such censer was laid up in the most holy place."
2. "All the implements that were employed in the most holy place were made of gold, or overlaid with gold, and it is in the highest degree improbable that the high priest would use any other on so solemn an occasion."
3. "Containing the Law, and being the place where the symbol of the divine presence was manifested, it was regarded as especially holy, and in the various wars and revolutions in the Hebrew commonwealth, it was guarded with special care."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The golden censer is not mentioned in O. T. as a part of the furniture of the holy of holies."
2. "The writer clearly speaks of an abiding-place of the qumiathrion in a particular division of the tabernacle."
3. "The writer follows the rabbinical tradition that the pot of manna and the rod were inside of the ark."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "The altar of incense was used for the Holy of Holies." 
2. "The ark of the covenant, a box or chest four feet long, two and a half broad and high." 
3. "There were three treasures in the ark of the covenant: a pot of manna, Aaron's rod that budded, and the tables of the covenant."

### John Gill:
1. "The burning coals signify the very great sufferings of Christ, not only the sufferings of his body, which were very painful, but those of his soul, when the wrath and hot displeasure of God was poured out upon him."
2. "The incense, which was carried in with those coals, typified the intercession of Christ in heaven, which is pure and holy, sweet, fragrant, and perpetual."
3. "The manna in the golden pot was typical of Christ; in the signification of its name, whether it comes from 'manah', which signifies to appoint, prepare, and distribute, Christ being appointed, prepared, and distributed, as food for his people; or from 'man hu', what is it? the words said by the Israelites, when they first saw it, not knowing what it was; so Christ is unknown to his people until revealed to them, and remains unknown to all natural and unregenerate men."

### John Wesley:
1. "The golden censer, used by the high priest only, on the great day of atonement."
2. "The ark, or chest, of the covenant, containing the tables of the covenant."
3. "The manna, a monument of God's care over Israel; Aaron's rod, a monument of the regular priesthood; and the tables of the covenant, the most venerable monument of all."
