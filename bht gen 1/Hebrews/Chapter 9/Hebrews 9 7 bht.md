# Hebrews 9:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, a high priest is depicted as entering a sacred place once a year, symbolizing that his access is limited and unique. The high priest is not exempt from sin and ignorance, for he needed to offer sacrifices for himself and the people's sins. This emphasizes the humanity of the high priest and the need for a perfect and sinless high priest to truly atone for the people's sins, differentiating between intentional and unintentional wrongdoings.
