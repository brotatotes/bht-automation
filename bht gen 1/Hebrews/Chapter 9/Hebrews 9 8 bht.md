2. "The tabernacle, with its different apartments, utensils, and services, was a permanent means of keeping important truths before the minds of the ancient people of God."
3. "The way into the holiest of all - Into heaven - of which the Most Holy place in the tabernacle was undoubtedly designed to be an emblem. It was the place where the visible symbol of God - the Shekinah - dwelt; where the blood of propitiation was sprinkled, and was, therefore, an appropriate emblem of that holy heaven where God dwells, and whence pardon is obtained by the blood of the atonement."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "God intended to emphasize, in the old economy itself, the fact of his inaccessibility, in order to create the desire for full access and to prepare the way for this."
2. "The point is that the division of the tabernacle showed the limitations of the Levitical system, and kept the people from coming directly to God."
3. "The priests in the holy place stood between the people and God as revealed in the shrine."

1. "The Holy Ghost this signifying, i.e by the arrangement which excluded all from the sanctuary except the high priest, who entered only on one day in the year." 
2. "That is, while there is a distinction of tabernacle and tabernacle with a veil between them, and a hidden glory, there is no freedom of access."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The Holy Ghost this signifying... to make plain." 
2. "The way into the Holy place... for the very Presence of God."
3. "The first tabernacle still having a place... kept the people out of the first tent as the second veil kept the priests out of the Holy of Holies."

### John Gill:
1. "This shows that the Holy Ghost existed under the Old Testament; that he is a distinct person in the Godhead, a personal act being here ascribed to him."
2. "Moreover, that the Levitical ordinances were of God, and that they had a spiritual signification; that the Old Testament saints were not without some knowledge of the spiritual meaning of them; and that the Holy Ghost was the author of that knowledge."
3. "While the tabernacle and tabernacle worship, the temple and temple service, were in being, 'the way into the holiest of all was not yet manifest'... the way to it is not by works of righteousness done by men, which being imperfect cannot justify, and so not save, though this is the way men naturally seek and take; but Christ is the only way, and he is the plain, pleasant, and safe one."
