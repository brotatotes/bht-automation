# Hebrews 9:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the time now present, the first tabernacle served as a parable for the heavenly realities that would be revealed. It was a temporary figure, representing the future fulfillment found in Christ's human nature. The offerings and sacrifices of the old system could not cleanse the conscience or provide lasting peace and salvation. They were symbolic and incapable of reaching the moral-religious consciousness, leaving the worshipper still longing for true reconciliation with God. Ultimately, this age of crisis and shadow pointed towards a richer and more perfect fulfillment yet to come.
