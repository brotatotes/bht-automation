## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "James, the first president or bishop of the church at Jerusalem, an Apostle, but not one of the Twelve."
2. "Devotion to God and His work alone, irrespectively of self-will or other men's will."
3. "The Epistle must be considered as addressed, from the head of the mother church in Jerusalem, to the Jewish believers, residing among the dispersed tribes of Israel."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It is remarkable that James does not call himself an apostle; but this does not prove that the writer of the Epistle was not an apostle, for the same omission occurs in the Epistle of John, and in the Epistle of Paul to the Philippians, the Thessalonians, and to Philemon."
2. "It may be observed also that this term is one which was especially appropriate to James, as a man eminent for his integrity. His claim to respect and deference was not primarily founded on any relationship which he sustained; any honor of birth or blood; or even any external office, but on the fact that he was a 'servant of God.'"
3. "The phrase 'the twelve tribes' became also a sort of technical expression to denote the people of God - the church."

### John Calvin:
1. "He then wrote and exhorted all those whom he could not personally address, because they had been scattered far and wide."
2. "But that he speaks not of the grace of Christ and of faith in him, the reason seems to be this, because he addressed those who had already been rightly taught by others; so that they had need, not so much of doctrine, as of the goads of exhortations."
3. "James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, bids, (or sends, or wishes) joy to the twelve tribes who are in their dispersion."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "We are all the servants of Jesus Christ, bound to obey His commands, and to devote ourselves to His service." 
2. "Only in another place in this Epistle does James mention our Lord by name, though elsewhere he alludes to Him." 
3. "This Epistle was not written primarily to the Gentile Christians, or to the Jews generally, but to the Christian Jews of the dispersion."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "James is not an Ebionite. He accepts the deity of Jesus his brother, difficult as it was for him to do so."
