# James 1:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, we are encouraged to find glory in our lowliness and humility, even in the face of material wealth. It is a reminder that worldly riches are temporary and fleeting, like a flower that blooms and withers away. Instead, our true worth lies in our character and our ability to remain humble in all circumstances. This verse serves as a reminder to focus on the eternal and lasting values rather than the temporary and transient.
