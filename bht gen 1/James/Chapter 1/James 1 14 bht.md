# James 1:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse being described highlights the power of personal desires and the inward inclination towards sin. The commentary explains that the source of temptation lies within ourselves, and it is our own lust and desires that draw us away from what is right. The imagery used, such as being enticed like a fish or drawn away like a beast, emphasizes the captivating and alluring nature of sin. It is our individual inclinations and habits that make us vulnerable to these temptations, and we must take responsibility for restraining them.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The image, if we are justified in supposing that a fixed one was contemplated from the first, seems to be, as Pott observes (in Huther), 'ἐπιθυμία, ἁμαρτία, et θάνατος personarum vim habent: imaginem meretricis suppeditant voces συλλαβεῖν, τίκτειν, ἀποκύειν, necnon et ἐξέλκειν atque δελεάζειν.'"
2. "The participles ἐξελκόμενος and δελεαζόμενος are abundantly illustrated by the Commentators, e.g. in Wetst. by Xen. Mem. ii. 1. 4, τὰ … ζῶα.… τούτων γὰρ δήπου τὰ μὲν γαστρὶ δελεαζόμενα … τῇ ἐπιθυμίᾳ τοῦ φαγεῖν ἀγόμενα πρὸς τὸ δέλεαρ, ἁλίσκεται."
3. "Schneckenburger says, 'ἐξέλκειν et δελεάζειν sunt verba e re venatoria et piscatoria in rem amatoriam et inde in nostrum tropum translata: only we must not here interpret ἐξέλκειν which precedes δελεαζ., as in Herod. above, 'to draw to land,' but rather as Schulthess, 'elicere bestias ex tuto, ubi latent, in locum hamis retibusque expositum.'"
