# James 1:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse in question describes the process by which lust gives birth to sin and the ultimate consequence of sin, which is death. Commentators explain that this process begins with the will embracing and yielding to lust, resulting in sin being conceived. Sin, when it reaches maturity, gives birth to death. The description also highlights the inherent sinful nature of desire itself, emphasizing that even the initial inclination towards sin is deserving of consequences.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The inner act is the union of the will with the ἐπιθυμία, the τίκτει denoting extrusion into outward act."
2. "The second ἁμαρτία... is the sinful act when brought to perfection in all its consequences, in a series of results following on one another and bringing a man under bondage to his sin, being thus perfected, brings forth eternal death."
3. "So that temptation to sin cannot be from God, while trial is from Him."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Lust," the harlot, then, "brings forth sin," namely, of that kind to which the temptation inclines.
2. Then the particular sin (so the Greek implies), "when it is completed, brings forth death," with which it was all along pregnant.
3. He who will fight Satan with Satan's own weapons, must not wonder if he finds himself overmatched. Nip sin in the bud of lust.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "When the desire which we have naturally is quickened, or made to act, the result is that sin is produced."
2. "The result is sin - open, actual sin. When that which is conceived in the heart is matured, it is seen to be sin."
3. "The result of sin when it is fully carried out, is death - death in all forms. The idea is, that death, in whatever form it exists, is to be traced to sin, and that sin will naturally and regularly produce it."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The harlot, Lust, draws away and entices the man. The guilty union is committed by the will embracing the temptress: the consequence is that she beareth sin.... Then the sin, that particular sin, when grown up, herself, as if all along pregnant with it, bringeth forth death."

2. "Sin, figured as male, when it has reached maturity, becomes the begetter of death."

3. "The impious deed begets a numerous brood alike in kind; while households ruled by right inflexible blossom with offspring fair."

Note: The commentary provides two interpretations of the image of sin conceiving and bringing forth death, one depicting sin as a female figure and the other as a male figure. It also references parallel passages in Aeschylus and Milton's "Paradise Lost" that elaborate on the concept.

### John Calvin:
1. "He first calls that lust which is not any kind of evil affection or desire, but that which is the fountain of all evil affections; by which, as he shews, are conceived vicious broods, which at length break forth into sins."
2. "But as the use of a word is various, there is nothing unreasonable if it be taken here, as in many other places, for actual sin."
3. "For he proceeds gradually and shews that the consummation of sin is eternal death, and that sin arises from depraved desires, and that these depraved desires or affections have their root in lust."

These quotes highlight the commentary's explanation of the relationship between lust, sinful desires, and the consequences of sin. They emphasize the idea that lust is the root of all evil affections and that sin can be both internal and external.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Lust is here considered as a harlot who seduces the will, and sin is the consequence of this unhallowed alliance." 
2. "Sin is the child of our corrupt passions; it has its origin in our evil desires; it is the outcome of inward depravity." 
3. "Lust is the mother of sin and death its progeny."

1. "The will yields to lust and conception takes place." 
2. "Sin is the union of the will with lust."

### John Gill:
1. "Instead of resisting and rejecting the motion made, he admits of it, and receives it, and cherishes it in his mind; he dallies and plays with it; he dwells upon it in his thoughts, and hides it under his tongue, and in his heart, as a sweet morsel." 
2. "Sin, when it is finished: being solicited, is agreed to, and actually committed." 
3. "Every sin is deserving of death, death is the just wages of it; yea, even the motions of sin work in men to bring forth fruit unto death."
