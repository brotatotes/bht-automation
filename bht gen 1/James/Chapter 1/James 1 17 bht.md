## BHT:
God, as the Father of lights and the source of all good and perfect gifts, holds a position of unmatched excellence and purity.

The lights of the natural and spiritual realms, including the sun, moon, stars, knowledge, and grace, all find their origin in Him. Through His unchanging character, God bestows upon us blessings that lead us towards holiness and glory.
