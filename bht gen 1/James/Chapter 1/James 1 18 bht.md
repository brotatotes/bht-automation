# James 1:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Regeneration, described as the greatest example of God's goodness, is the work of God's sovereign will and the imparting of His divine life. The believers, like first-fruits, are consecrated to God and serve as a pledge of the ultimate restoration of all creation. This act of begetting, known as regeneration, is God's deliberate and gracious purpose, implanting new principles of light, life, grace, and holiness in believers. It is through the word of truth, the gospel, that this renewal takes place, making Christians sanctifying agents in the world.
