# James 1:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we are reminded that the anger and wrath of man cannot produce the righteousness that God desires. Our hasty speaking and impulsiveness hinder the work of righteousness in our lives and in the world. Instead, we are encouraged to be humble, slow to anger, and ready to listen, seeking understanding rather than reacting rashly. Our anger does not align with God's righteousness, and it is important to guard our tongues and control our anger to avoid derailing our efforts to live out God's righteousness.
