## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "ῥυπαρία is here figurative, as ῥυπαρός and ῥυπαρεύω in ref. Rev.: in the other reff. the word occurs in its literal sense. Some Commentators take it here as standing alone: Others join it with καὶ περισσείαν, as belonging to the genitive κακίας, which seems better for the context, which concerns not the putting away of moral pollution of all kinds, but only of that kind which belongs to κακία: see below." 
2. "the word spoken of is beyond doubt the same as the λόγος ἀληθείας above i. e. the gospel, in its fulness. But the epithet makes some little difficulty. First of all, it clearly is not, as Œc. seems to take it, 'innate': τὸν διακριτικὸν τοῦ βελτίονος καὶ τοῦ χείρονος, διʼ ὃ καὶ λογικοὶ ἐσμὲν καὶ λεγόμεθα: and so in the Apostolical Constt. viii. 12, νόμον δέδωκας ἔμφυτον, for this would stultify δέξασθε, we having it already."
3. "It is the ψυχή which carries the personality of the man: which is between the πνεῦμα drawing it upwards, and the σάρξ drawing it downwards, and is saved or lost, passes into life or death, according to the choice between these two. And the λόγος ἔμφυτος, working through the πνεῦμα and by the divine πνεῦμα, is a spiritual agency, able to save the ψυχή."

3. The Gospel word is engrafted inwardly and fulfills the ultimate design of the law.
4. The word we hear so carelessly is able to save us.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "In view of the fact that excited feeling tends only to wrong, let us lay aside all that is evil, and submit ourselves wholly to the influence of truth."
2. "Sin may be contemplated as a wrong thing; as a violation of law; as evil in its nature and tendency, and therefore to be avoided; or it may be contemplated as disgusting, offensive, loathsome."
3. "Purity of heart is the best preparation always for seeing the force of truth."
4. "The gospel is here represented under the image of that which is implanted or engrafted from another source; by a figure that would be readily understood, for the art of engrafting is everywhere known."
5. "The meaning here is, that we should allow the principles of the gospel to be thus engrafted on our nature; that however crabbed or perverse our nature may be, or however bitter and vile the fruits which it might bring forth of its own accord, it might, through the engrafted word, produce the fruits of righteousness."

### Marvin Vincent:

2. "Malice is an adequate translation, the word denoting a malevolent disposition toward one's neighbor."

### Philip Schaff:

2. "Put away all the defilement and rank growth of malice which like weeds encumber the ground, and prevent the growth of the ingrafted word." 
3. "Receive with meekness: here, as opposed to malice and wrath, not so much a teachable spirit, as mildness a gentle and loving disposition toward our fellow-men."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Putting away filthiness, the dirty garment of sin, is necessary because of this principle." 
2. "Meekness, in contrast to anger and wickedness, is the attitude of docility and humility." 
3. "The implanted word, like a seed sown in the heart, has the power to save and bring about ultimate salvation."

### John Gill:
1. "All manner of filthiness, both of flesh and spirit; all pride, vanity, wrath, malice, and evil speaking, under hearing the word."
2. "And such is the spirit of wrathful men; it throws up the filth of haughtiness and pride, of anger, wrath, and wickedness, which must be taken off, and laid aside."
3. "Receive with meekness the ingrafted word; which becomes so when it is received; when it is put into the heart by the Spirit of God, and is mixed with faith by them that hear it."

1. "All the filthiness and superfluity of wickedness — For however specious or necessary it may appear to worldly wisdom, all wickedness is both vile, hateful, contemptible, and really superfluous."
