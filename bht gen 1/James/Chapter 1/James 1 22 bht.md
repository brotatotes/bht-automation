## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "But be ye (not, ‘become ye,’ any more than in Matthew 6:16; Matthew 10:16; Matthew 24:44; John 20:27; Romans 12:16. In all these places no other meaning will suit the context but simply 'be ye': with reference indeed to some future act by which the word γίνεσθαι gets its propriety; but 'become' in English carries a very different meaning, viz. that of change into the state mentioned from some other previous one, which is in none of these cases implied) doers of the word." 

2. "Theile remarks well, 'Substantiva plus sonant quam participia;' the substantive ποιητής carries an enduring, a sort of official force with it: 'let this be your occupation.'"

3. "The 'hearer only' does this, when he infers that the mere sound of the word received in his outward ear will suffice for him."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
