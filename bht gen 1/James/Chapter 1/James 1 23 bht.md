## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "If any is a hearer of the word and not a doer, this man is like to a man contemplating the countenance of his birth in a mirror." 
2. "The word of God is a mirror in which we may and ought to see our moral visage." 
3. "The face he was born with. The expression is to be explained apparently as Wiesinger: 'Not that he can see in the glass any other than his natural face, but the addition τῆς γενέσεως αὐτοῦ serves more plainly to point out the sphere of mere material perception from which the comparison is taken.'"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The true disciple, say the rabbis, learns in order that he may do, not in order that he may merely know or teach."

3. "This faithful portraiture of man's soul in Scripture is the strongest proof of the truth of the latter."

### Marvin Vincent:
