## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "If any man imagines that he is religious, not bridling his tongue but deceiving his heart." 
2. "Hoc vitium nominatim oportuit taxari, quum de legis observatione sermo esset." 
3. "The religious service is vain (idle and fruitless)."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "If any man think himself to be religious, that is, observant of the offices of religion, let him know these consist not so much in outward observances, as in such acts of mercy and humble piety."
2. "James does not mean that these offices are the great essentials, or sum total of religion but that, whereas the law service was merely ceremonial, the very services of the Gospel consist in acts of mercy and holiness."
3. "Discretion in speech is better than fluency of speech. God alone can enable us to do so. James, in treating of the law, naturally notices this sin."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "A man may undoubtedly have many things in his character which seem to be evidences of the existence of religion in his heart, and yet there may be some one thing that shall show that all those evidences are false."
2. "If the tongue is not restrained, or if there is any unsubdued propensity to sin whatever, it proves that there is no true religion."
3. "A single unsubdued sinful propensity neutralizes all these things, and shows that there is no true religion."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "A man can scarcely seem to be religious, when, as Trench observes, 'his religious pretensions are belied and refuted by the allowance of an unbridled tongue.'" 

2. "The adjective here refers to a zealous and diligent performance of religious services."

3. "Lit., to guide with a bridle. So Plato, 'Laws,' 701: 'I think that the argument ought to be pulled up from time to time, and not to be allowed to run away, but held with bit and bridle.'"

### John Calvin:
1. "He speaks now of another thing, that the faithful should not employ their tongue in evil speaking."
2. "The object here, then, was to distinguish between the true worshippers of God and hypocrites, who are so swollen with Pharisaic pride, that they seek praise from the defects of others."
3. "For by saying that his religion is vain, he not only intimates that other virtues are marred by the stain of evil-speaking, but that the conclusion is, that the zeal for religion which appears is not sincere."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "If any man among you seem, that is, not seems to others, but thinketh himself, appears to himself to be religious." 
2. "It is not internal religion to which St. James alludes, but the manifestation of religion, the service of God or religious worship."
3. "To be religious, in the sense of our verse, is to be a diligent observer of the external forms of worship."

These quotes highlight the false opinion people may have of their own religiousness, the focus on external forms of worship, and the lack of value in such superficial religious service.

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "The word θρησκος is found nowhere else except in lexicons. Hatch (Essays in Biblical Greek, pp. 55-57) shows that it refers to the external observances of public worship, such as church attendance, almsgiving, prayer, fasting (Matthew 6:1-18). It is the Pharisaic element in Christian worship."
2. "The picture is that of a man putting the bridle in his own mouth, not in that of another. See the similar metaphor of muzzling (φιμοω) one's mouth (Matthew 22:12 εφιμωθη)."
3. "Religion (θρησκεια). Later form of θρησκιη (Herodotus) from θρησκος above. It means religious worship in its external observances, religious exercise or discipline, but not to the exclusion of reverence."

### John Gill:
1. "By his preaching, or praying, and hearing, and other external duties of religion, he is constant in the observance of; and who, upon the account of these things, 'thinks himself to be a religious man'..."
2. "...boasts of his works, and speaks ill of his brethren; backbites them, and hurts their names and characters..."
3. "...gives his tongue a liberty of speaking anything, to the injury of others, and the dishonour of God, and his ways..."

These quotes highlight the hypocrisy of someone who appears religious outwardly but fails to control their tongue and engage in harmful speech. Their religion becomes meaningless and ineffective, bringing reproach upon the ways of God.

### John Wesley:
1. "Exact in the outward offices of religion."
2. "Bridleth not his tongue."
3. "He only deceiveth his own heart, if he fancies he has any true religion at all."
