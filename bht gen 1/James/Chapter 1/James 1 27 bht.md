# James 1:27 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Pure and undefiled religion is marked by genuine sincerity and freedom from hypocrisy. It is not merely about ceremonies or boasting, but about actively demonstrating one's faith through acts of compassion towards the vulnerable, such as visiting the fatherless and widows in their affliction. This true religion also entails striving to maintain personal purity, resisting the temptations and corruptions of the world. It is about living a life that reflects the love and righteousness of God, separating oneself from worldly influences.
