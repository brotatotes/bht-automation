# James 1:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Without mentioning the specific Bible verse, the commentators collectively emphasize the importance of genuine faith in receiving from the Lord. They caution against doubting or wavering in one's belief, as such skepticism hinders one from receiving anything from God. The commentators also emphasize that the Lord refers to God in this context, highlighting the need to have unwavering trust and reliance on Him. Lack of faith leads to unanswered prayers and empty-handed visits to the throne of grace.
