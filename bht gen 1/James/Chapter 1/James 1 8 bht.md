# James 1:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Bible verse describes a person who is double-minded, wavering, and unstable in their ways. This person is characterized by their indecisiveness, lack of firmness, and inconsistency. They struggle to fully commit or make clear choices in their beliefs, actions, and intentions. This double-mindedness hinders their ability to have stability and clarity in their thoughts, leading to confusion and constant change. Their inner conflict between faith and doubt affects all aspects of their life, making them unreliable and without a solid foundation.
