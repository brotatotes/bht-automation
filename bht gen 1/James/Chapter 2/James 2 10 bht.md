2. "One portion of the law is as much binding as another, and if a man violates any one plain commandment, he sets at nought the authority of God."

1. "Whosoever shall keep... as in Matthew 27:36, without αν (though often used, but only one example of modal εαν=αν in James, viz., James 4:4). This modal αν (εαν) merely interprets the sentence as either more indefinite or more definite."

3. "The case in the text is only a supposed one, and, as it is here put, implies perfection; for it follows, and yet offend in one point; sin, which is a transgression of the law, is an offense to God the Father, who is of purer eyes than to behold it; to Jesus Christ, who loves righteousness, and hates iniquity; and to the blessed Spirit who is grieved and vexed by it."
