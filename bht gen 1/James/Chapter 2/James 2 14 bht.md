## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "What is the profit, my brethren, if any man say that he has faith but have not works?" - This question highlights the importance of actions that demonstrate one's faith, rather than mere words or claims.

2. "Can his faith save him?" - This question challenges the notion that faith alone is sufficient for salvation, emphasizing the need for works as well.

3. "Here, and not in λέγῃ, nor in ἡ πίστις, lies the true key to the nullity of the faith in question." - This statement clarifies that the true problem lies not in the declaration of faith or the concept of faith itself, but in the absence of corresponding works.

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "James here, passing from the particular case of 'mercy' or 'love' violated by 'respect of persons,' combats the Jewish tendency to substitute a lifeless, inoperative acquaintance with the letter of the law, for change of heart to practical holiness, as if justification could be thereby attained."
2. "Whether James individually designed it or not, the Holy Spirit by him combats not Paul, but those who abuse Paul's doctrine. The teaching of both alike is inspired, and is therefore to be received without wresting of words; but each has a different class to deal with; Paul, self-justiciaries; James, Antinomian advocates of a mere notional faith."
3. "What doth it profit—literally, 'What is the profit?' though a man say he hath faith; referring to a mere profession of faith, such as was usually made at baptism. The inoperative profession of sympathy answering to the inoperative profession of faith."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He doubtless had in his eye those who abused the doctrine of justification by faith, by holding that good works are unnecessary to salvation, provided they maintain an orthodox belief."
2. "The apostle, therefore, in the question before us, implicitly asserts that faith would not 'profit' at all unless accompanied with a holy life."
3. "It is implied in this question that faith cannot save him, for very often the most emphatic way of making an affirmation is by asking a question."

2. "Ofelov, profit, only here, ver. 16, and 1 Corinthians 14:32." - This highlights the rarity of the word used in the verse, emphasizing its significance. It suggests that the concept of profit is not frequently discussed in the context of the Bible, making it even more thought-provoking.

3. "Lit., what is the profit?" - The use of the word "lit." indicates that this translation is a literal rendering of the original text. This phrase emphasizes the directness and simplicity of the question, focusing on the concrete outcome or gain that is being questioned.

### John Calvin:
1. "The sum, then, of what is said is, that faith without love avails nothing, and that it is therefore wholly dead."
2. "James then, as he was satisfied that it was a false pretext by which hypocrites covered themselves, was not disposed to raise a dispute about a word or an expression."
3. "Salvation comes to us by faith for this reason, because it joins us to God. And this comes not in any other way than by being united to the body of Christ, so that, living through his Spirit, we are also governed by him."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Faith without works will not profit at the judgment; it will not be conducive to the saving of the soul."
2. "James admits the existence of a speculative faith; the man is supposed to have faith of a certain kind, though not saving faith."
3. "James undoubtedly considers faith to be a necessary prerequisite to salvation, but only that faith which is productive and accompanied with works."

### John Gill:

3. "But as for the other faith, a man may have it, and be in the gall of bitterness, and bond of iniquity; he may have all faith in that sense, and be nothing; it is no other than the devils themselves have; and so he may have it, and be damned."

### John Wesley:
1. "There is, therefore, no contradiction between the apostles: they both delivered the truth of God, but in a different manner, as having to do with different kinds of men."
2. "Here, therefore, true, living faith is meant: but in other parts of the argument the apostle speaks of a dead, imaginary faith."
3. "He does not, therefore, teach that true faith can, but that it cannot, subsist without works: nor does he oppose faith to works; but that empty name of faith, to real faith working by love."
