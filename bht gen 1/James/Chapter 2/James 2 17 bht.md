# James 2:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Faith without works is lifeless and ineffective, lacking vitality and power. It is not just ineffective in achieving a desired outcome, but it is devoid of true belief. Faith and works are closely intertwined, with works serving as evidence of the authenticity and vitality of one's faith. Without works, faith is a mere dead, empty notion, useless and of no profit. Good works, flowing naturally from a living faith, are necessary to demonstrate the true life of faith.
