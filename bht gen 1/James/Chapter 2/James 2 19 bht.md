# James 2:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This verse addresses the belief in the unity of God, which is common among both Jews and Christians. It distinguishes between a theoretical faith and obedient faith, highlighting that even demonic entities acknowledge God's existence and tremble at the thought of judgment. The passage emphasizes that this belief alone, without the accompanying obedience and good works, cannot justify or save a person. Thus, it underscores the importance of an active and transformative faith in one's relationship with God.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Thou believest that God is one...the Apostle selects, from all points of dogmatic belief, that one which stands at the head of the creed of Jews and Christians alike."
2. "The construction with ὅτι after πιστεύεις instead of εἰς or ἐν, implies that merely a theoretical faith is spoken of."
3. "Their belief does nothing for them but certify to them their own misery."

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Thou—emphatic. Thou self-deceiving claimant to faith without works."
2. "But unless thy faith goes farther than an assent to this truth, 'the evil spirits believe' so far in common with thee."
3. "Their faith only adds to their torment at the thought of having to meet Him who is to consign them to their just doom: so thine."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The design of the apostle seems to have been to select one of the doctrines of religion, the belief of which would - if mere belief in any doctrine could - save the soul; and to show that even this might be held as an article of faith by those who could be supposed by no one to have any claim to the name of Christian."
2. "The apostle here is not to be supposed to be addressing such an one as Paul, who held to the doctrine that we are justified by faith; nor is he to be supposed to be combating the doctrine of Paul, as some have maintained, but he is to be regarded as addressing one who held, in the broadest and most unqualified sense, that provided there was faith, a man would be saved."
3. "There was much more in the case referred to than mere speculative faith. There was a faith that produced some effect, and an effect of a very decided character. It did not, indeed, produce good works, or a holy life, but it made it manifest that there was faith; and, consequently, it followed that the existence of mere faith was not all that was necessary to save men, or to make it certain that they would be secure."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Tremble [φρισσουσιν] . Only here in New Testament. It means, originally, to be rough on the surface; to bristle."
2. "Hence, used of the fields with ears of corn; of a line of battle bristling with shields and spears; of a silver or golden vessel rough with embossed gold."
3. "Hence, of a horror which makes the hair stand on end and contracts the surface of the skin making 'gooseflesh.'"

### John Calvin:
1. "From this one sentence it appears evident that the whole dispute is not about faith, but of the common knowledge of God, which can no more connect man with God, than the sight of the sun carry him up to heaven."
2. "The devil trembles, he says, at the mention of God’s name, because when he acknowledges his own judge he is filled with the fear of him. He then who despises an acknowledged God is much worse."
3. "Obedient faith is that which saves, and not merely that which makes us tremble."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Thou believest that there is one God... Thou hast more knowledge and a more correct faith than the Gentiles, who have gods many and lords many."
2. "Thou doest well: so far good... a theoretical faith in the unity of God, though in itself good, yet does not essentially differ from the belief of devils."
3. "The devils... also believe assent to this doctrine and tremble... The devils' belief in God, because unproductive of works and obedience, not only cannot save them, but is the cause of their trembling before the Divine tribunal."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Belief that God exists (there is one God), a fundamental doctrine, but that is not belief or trust in God. It may be mere creed."
2. "Thou doest well. That is good as far as it goes, which is not far."
3. "The demons also believe. They go that far. They never doubt the fact of God's existence."
4. "The demons do more than believe a fact. They shudder at it."

### John Gill:
1. "To believe there is one God, is not merely to give into this article, in opposition to the polytheism of the Gentiles, or barely to confess the God of Israel, as believed on by the Jews, but to believe that there are three persons, Father, Son, and Spirit, and that these three are the one God."
2. "But then the devils also believe; they believe the same truth; they know and believe there is but one God, and not many; and they know that the God of Israel is he; and that the Father, Son, and Spirit, are the one God."
3. "And tremble; at the wrath of God, which they now feel, and at the thought of future torments, which they expect... and yet these shall not be saved, their damnation is certain and inevitable."

### John Wesley:
1. "Thou believest there is one God — I allow this: but this proves only that thou hast the same faith with the devils." 
2. "Nay, they not only believe, but tremble - At the dreadful expectation of eternal torments." 
3. "So far is that faith from either justifying or saving them that have it."
