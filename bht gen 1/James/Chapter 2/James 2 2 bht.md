## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The word may well be understood of a Christian assembly, so in Test. XII. Patrum, p. 747, ἐν ταῖς συναγωγαῖς τῶν ἐθνῶν, or as merely an assembly in general, cf. ref. Heb., μὴ ἐγκαταλείποντες τὴν ἐπισυναγωγὴν ἑαυτῶν."
2. "This ἅπαξ λεγόμενον is expressed by χρυσόχειρ in Lucian, Timon, § 20. Wetst. has accumulated evidence of the practice of overloading the fingers with rings: e. g. Lucian, Somn. (Gall) 12, ἐγὼ δὲ ἔχων .… δακτυλίους βαρεῖς ὅσον ἑκκαίδεκα ἐξημμένους τῶν δακτύλων."
3. "Glittering, either in colour, or with ornaments."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The 'synagogue' implies a mere assembly or congregation not necessarily united by any common tie. 'Church,' a people bound together by mutual ties and laws."
2. "Partly from James' Hebrew tendencies, partly from the Jewish Christian churches retaining most of the Jewish forms, this term 'synagogue' is used here instead of the Christian term 'Church.'"
3. "Christian churches were built like the synagogues, the holy table in the east end of the former, as the ark was in the latter; the desk and pulpit were the chief articles of furniture in both alike."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It is remarkable that this is the only place in the New Testament where the word 'synagogue' is applied to the Christian church."
2. "The word 'synagogue' would properly refer to the whole congregation, considered as 'assembled together,' without respect to the question whether all were truly pious or not."
3. "A man with a gold ring - Indicative of rank or property. Rings were common ornaments of the rich; and probably then, as now, of those who desired to be esteemed to be rich."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The word synagogue is a transcript of this. From sun, together, and agw, to bring. Hence, literally, a gathering or congregation, in which sense the word is common in the Septuagint, not only of assemblies for worship, but of gatherings for other public purposes."
2. "The ring was regarded as an indispensable article of a Hebrew's attire, since it contained his signet; and the name of the ring, tabbath, was derived from a root signifying to impress a seal. It was a proverbial expression for a most valued object."
3. "The practice of wearing rings was adopted by the early Christians. Many of their rings were adorned with the symbols of the faith - the cross, the anchor, the monogram of Christ, etc."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "St. James does not here mention a mere hypothetical case, but what must frequently have occurred."
2. "The word employed in the Greek is ‘synagogue,’ Some understand it of the Jewish synagogue, from which believers had not yet separated themselves; but against this opinion is the pronoun ‘your,’ nor would Christians in a synagogue not their own be permitted to give any preference of place to those who entered."
3. "The reference is undoubtedly to the Christian places of assembly, for worship. To denote these places of assembly, the word ‘synagogue’ was employed, because it was more familiar to St. James and the Jewish Christians than the corresponding Greek term."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The term 'synagogue' may seem odd for a Christian church, but James is writing to Jewish Christians, which supports the early date of the letter." 
2. "The description of the man with a gold ring as 'gold-fingered' adds a vivid image to the scene."

3. "And there come in also a poor man in vile raiment; mean and despicable, filthy and ragged."

### John Wesley:
