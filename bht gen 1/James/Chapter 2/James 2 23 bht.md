# James 2:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Through his act of obedience in offering up his son Isaac, Abraham fulfilled the scripture that his faith was genuine and that he believed in God. This fulfillment was not a mere confirmation, but an actual realization of the scripture. Both James and Paul acknowledge different aspects of Abraham's faith, with Paul emphasizing his initial belief and James highlighting its culmination in the act of offering Isaac. As a result, Abraham was known as the friend of God, a title that testified to his faithful works.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "that saying of Scripture, which long preceded the offering of Isaac, received its realization, not, it may be, its only realization, but certainly its chief one, in this act of obedience."
2. "It was not, until this, fulfilled, in the sense of being entirely exemplified and filled up."
3. "It became more and more gloriously true of Abraham’s life and acts till it reached this its culminating point, in his chief act of self-denying obedience."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "James must mean by works the same thing as Paul means by faith, only that he speaks of faith at its manifested development, whereas Paul speaks of it in its germ."
2. "Abraham's offering of Isaac was not a mere act of obedience, but an act of faith."
3. "The 'Scripture' would not be 'fulfilled,' as James says it was, but contradicted by any interpretation which makes man's works justify him before God."



### Albert Barnes:
1. "The fair and full meaning of the language of Scripture was expressed by this act, showing in the highest sense that his faith was genuine."
2. "His faith was shown to be genuine; and the fair meaning of the declaration that he believed God was carried out in the subsequent act."
3. "The act of offering his son on the altar by which James says this Scripture was fulfilled, occurred some 20 years afterward. That act confirmed or fulfilled the declaration. It showed that his faith was genuine, and that the declaration that he believed in God was true."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Was fulfilled [επληρωθη] . Not was confirmed, which the word does not mean either in New - Testament or in classical usage, but was actually and fully realized."
2. "James here uses the formula which in the Old Testament is employed of the realizing of a former utterance."
3. "He was called the friend of God. The term, however, does not occur either in the Hebrew or Septuagint, though it is found in the A. V. and retained in Rev."

### John Calvin:
1. "They who seek to prove from this passage of James that the works of Abraham were imputed for righteousness, must necessarily confess that Scripture is perverted by him; for however they may turn and twist, they can never make the effect to be its own cause."
2. "I consider that all those are bound fast by an indissoluble knot, who imagine that righteousness was imputed to Abraham before God, because he sacrificed his son Isaac, who was not yet born when the Holy Spirit declared that Abraham was justified."
3. "Man is not justified by faith alone, that is, by a bare and empty knowledge of God; he is justified by works, that is, his righteousness is known and proved by its fruits."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "This great act of obedience on the part of Abraham was a proof of the fulfilment of the scriptural declaration made concerning him."
2. "It is therefore evident that this act of obedience was not the cause of Abraham’s justification; but, because it proved that Abraham was possessed of a living faith, it fulfilled the words of Scripture."
3. "Abraham was the Beloved of God... And this is still the favourite description of Abraham, both by the Jews and by the Mahometans."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "James quotes Genesis 15:6 as proving his point in verse James 2:21 that Abraham had works with his faith, the very same passage that Paul quotes in Romans 4:3 to show that Abraham's faith preceded his circumcision and was the basis of his justification."
2. "And both James and Paul are right, each to illustrate a different point."
3. "The Arabs today speak of Abraham as God's friend. It was evidently a common description before James used it, as in Isaiah 41:8; 2 Chronicles 20:7."

### John Gill:
1. "By this it was made known what a strong faith he had in God, and what reason there was to believe that he was a justified person."
2. "Abraham believed God, and it was imputed to him for righteousness; which shows both that Abraham was justified before he wrought this work, and therefore that could not be the cause or matter of his justification, but only an effect and evidence of it."
3. "Abraham, on the other hand, loved God, and showed himself friendly to him; trusted in him, and believed every word of his; readily complied with his will, and not only yielded a cheerful obedience to his commands, but enjoined his children after him to observe them."

### John Wesley:
1. "Abraham believed God, and it was imputed to him for righteousness - This was twice fulfilled, - when Abraham first believed, and when he offered up Isaac." 
2. "St. Paul speaks of the former fulfilling; St. James, of the latter." 
3. "And he was called the Friend of God — Both by his posterity, 2 Chronicles 20:7; and by God himself, Isaiah 41:8 so pleasing to God were the works be wrought in faith."
