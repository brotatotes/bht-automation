# James 2:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This verse emphasizes that true faith is not merely a belief, but is accompanied by actions and good works. It contrasts the notion that faith alone is sufficient for justification before God, stating that works play a crucial role. The commentators highlight that faith must include obedience and produce good works, serving as evidence of its authenticity. They differentiate between faith as a transformative force and faith devoid of action, and distinguish between works that precede faith and works that follow true faith.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Ye see that by works a man is justified, and not by faith only." - This verse emphasizes that while faith is important, it must be accompanied by actions or works. Faith alone is not enough for justification before God.

3. "By faith alone, without works, is no man justified." - This statement reinforces the idea that faith without corresponding actions or works is insufficient for justification. True faith is demonstrated through obedience and good works.

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Faith to justify must, from the first, include obedience in germ (to be developed subsequently), though the former alone is the ground of justification." 

2. "The scion must be grafted on the stock that it may live; it must bring forth fruit to prove that it does live." 

3. "Faith without works is like a tree without fruit, it may have the appearance of life, but it lacks the evidence of true vitality."

1. "Not by a cold, abstract, inoperative faith. It must be by a faith that shall produce good works, and whose existence will be shown to men by good works."
2. "As a matter of fact, therefore, it is only the faith that produces good works that justifies."
3. "The ground of justification in the case is faith, and that only; the evidence of it, the carrying it out, the proof of the existence of the faith, is good works."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The emphasis is upon works: stress is put upon the fact that faith must be productive of works."
2. "The meaning is, ‘not by faith simply,’ by a faith without works, which cannot justify either in whole or in part."

### John Gill:
1. "Good works do not go before justification as causes or conditions, but follow it as fruits and effects."
2. "The Apostle Paul speaks of justification before God; and James speaks of it as it is known by its fruits unto men."
3. "The one speaks of good works as causes, which he denies to have any place as such in justification; and the other speaks of them as effects flowing from faith, and showing the truth of it, and so of justification by it."

"They do not speak of the same faith: St. Paul speaking of living faith; St. James here, of dead faith" - This quote explains that St. Paul and St. James are referring to different aspects of faith.

"They do not speak of the same works: St. Paul speaking of works antecedent to faith; St. James, of works subsequent to it" - This statement clarifies that St. Paul and St. James are discussing different types of works.
