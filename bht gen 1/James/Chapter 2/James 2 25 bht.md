# James 2:25 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we are presented with a remarkable example of faith. Through the narratives of commentators, we learn that the person being referenced is a woman named Rahab. Despite her troubled past and being of foreign descent, she demonstrated her faith through her actions and hospitality towards God's servants. Her actions not only saved the lives of the spies but also led to her own deliverance from destruction. This powerful demonstration of faith is a reminder that true belief goes beyond mere words, but reveals itself in tangible acts of righteousness and obedience.

### Henry Alford:
1. "Ne se causarentur opera tanti patris Abrahæ imitari non valere, præsertim cum nullus eos modo cogeret Deo filios offerre perimendos, … addit et mulieris exemplum, mulieris criminosæ, mulieris alienigenæ, quæ tamen per opera misericordiæ, per officium hospitalitatis, etiam cum periculo vitæ suæ Dei famulis exhibitum, justificari a peccatis meruit" &c.
2. "Abrahami exemplum Hebræis ad Christum conversis sufficere debebat, sed quia etiam alienigenis scribebat, adjunxit exemplum fœminæ extraneæ."
3. "Post virum ponitur mulier: nam viros et mulieres appellat," ch. James 4:4 (see note there).

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "She believed assuredly what her other countrymen disbelieved, and this in the face of every improbability that an unwarlike few would conquer well-armed numbers."
2. "If an instance of obedience were wanting, Paul and James would hardly have quoted a woman of previously bad character, rather than the many moral and pious patriarchs."
3. "The nature of the works alleged is such as to prove that James uses them only as evidences of faith, as contrasted with a mere verbal profession: not works of charity and piety, but works the value of which consisted solely in their being proofs of faith: they were faith expressed in act, synonymous with faith itself."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Her act showed that she truly believed God. If that act had not been performed, the fact would have shown that her faith was not genuine, and she could not have been justified."
2. "The act which she performed was the public manifestation of her faith, the evidence that she was justified."
3. "When we commend the faith of a man who has been a profane swearer, or an adulterer, or a robber, or a drunkard, we do not commend his former life, or give a sanction to it. We commend that which has induced him to abandon his evil course, and to turn to the ways of righteousness."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Rahab became the wife of Salmon, and the ancestress of Boaz, Jesse's grandfather. Some have supposed that Salmon was one of the spies whose life she saved."

### John Calvin:
1. "He designedly put together two persons so different in their character, in order more clearly to show, that no one, whatever may have been his or her condition, nation, or class in society, has ever been counted righteous without good works."
2. "Whosoever, then, seeks to be counted righteous, though he may even be among the lowest, must yet show that he is such by good works."
3. "The meaning is not, that works are to faith what the spirit is to the body, for that would make works to be the life of faith, the reverse of the fact; but the meaning is, that faith having no works is like a dead carcass without life."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The same example, and the same incident in Rahab’s history, is also adduced by the author of the Epistle to the Hebrews, as an illustrious instance of faith."
