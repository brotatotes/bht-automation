# James 2:26 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Faith is described as a spiritual and living force, while works are seen as the external evidence of that faith. Inverting the expected comparison, faith is likened to the body, the essential substance of the Christian life, while works are the animating and enlivening force. The absence of works is comparable to a body without breath, signifying death and the absence of true faith. Consequently, a productive and authentic faith is seen as a living body, while a faith devoid of works is deemed vain and useless, like a body without a soul.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Faith is unquestionably a thing spiritual: works are external and material: so that it would seem as if the members of the comparison should have been inverted, and works made the body, faith the spirit."
2. "Faith is the body, the sum and substance, of the Christian life: works (= obedience), the moving and quickening of that body."
3. "Just as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is also dead."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Faith is a spiritual thing: works are material."
2. "James reverses the expectation that faith corresponds to the spirit and works to the body."
3. "Living faith does not derive its life from works, but rather from the animating spirit."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The body is animated or kept alive by the presence of the soul, and that when that is withdrawn, hope departs."
2. "If good works do not follow, it is clear that there is no true and proper faith; none that justifies and saves."
3. "If it leads to no practical holiness of life, it is like the body without the soul, and is of no value whatever."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The works of faith are not the cause of salvation, but the evidence of it."
2. "Faith without works is dead, because true faith always produces good works."
3. "Works are not a means to earn salvation, but a natural outflow of a genuine faith in Christ."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The deadness of faith without works. According to him, a faith without works is like a body from which the living principle has departed; works are the evidences of life, and if these be absent, the faith is dead."
2. "A mere system of doctrine, however correct, is a mere dead body, unless it be animated by a living working spirit."
3. "An unproductive faith is a body without the spirit; a productive faith is the living body."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Apart from breath" (the breath of life).
2. "The absence of a sign of breath on a glass before the mouth and nose is proof of death."
3. "Startling picture of dead faith in our churches and church members with only a name to live (Revelation 3:2)."

### John Gill:
1. "As a body, when the spirit or soul is departed from it, or the breath is gone out of it, is dead, and without motion, and useless." 

2. "Faith without works is dead also: a vain thing, useless and unprofitable, can neither justify, nor save, nor prove that a man is justified, or will be saved." 

3. "The body without the spirit, or breath, is a carcass."
