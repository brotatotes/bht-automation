# James 2:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, individuals are confronted with a situation where they must decide how to treat two different people who enter a place of worship. Commentators highlight the contrast in treatment between the rich and poor. While the rich are given seats of honor and respect, the poor are left to the side or even beneath a footstool. This disparity in treatment reflects a condemnation of respect of persons and serves as a reminder of the importance of treating all individuals with respect and kindness, regardless of their worldly status.
