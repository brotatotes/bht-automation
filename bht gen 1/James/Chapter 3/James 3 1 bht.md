### John Calvin:
1. "Be not many masters... for it is, as it were, an innate disease in mankind to seek reputation by blaming others." 
2. "Few are influenced by a right feeling, for hypocrisy and ambition stimulate them, and not a care for the salvation of their brethren."

### John Gill:
1. "Be not many masters" - The exhortation warns against the ambition to be preachers of the word without suitable gifts, divine mission, and a regular call by a church. Teaching should be done as helpers of joy, peace, and comfort, not as lords over God's heritage or claiming dominion over the faith of others.

2. "Reproof for sin ought to be given" - Reproving others for their faults is commendable when done in a right manner, with a good spirit, and a good end. Private offenses should be privately addressed, and public offenses should be rebuked before all. However, reproof should be gentle, avoiding exaggeration and aggravation.

3. "Knowing that we shall receive the greater condemnation" - Those who enter the teaching office without a proper call, perform it negligently, or live contrary to the doctrine they teach will face a greater condemnation. Similarly, those who judge rashly or are overly censorious will themselves be judged harshly without mercy.

### John Wesley:
1. "Be not many teachers — Let no more of you take this upon you than God thrusts out; seeing it is so hard not to offend in speaking much."
2. "Knowing that we — That all who thrust themselves into the office."
3. "Shall receive greater condemnation — For more offences."
