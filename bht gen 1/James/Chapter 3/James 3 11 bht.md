# James 3:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we are presented with the imagery of a fountain that emits both sweet and bitter water from the same opening. Commentators emphasize the unnaturalness and contrariness of this occurrence in nature, remarking that such a phenomenon would not be found in the works of God. The verse points to the contrast between the qualities of sweet and bitter, highlighting the incongruity of blessing and cursing proceeding from the same mouth, which is deemed monstrous and contrary to the established order created by God.
