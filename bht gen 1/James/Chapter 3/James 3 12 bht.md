# James 3:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Just as a tree bears fruit according to its kind, whether it be figs from a fig tree or olive berries from an olive tree, so too does the tongue have its own nature. It is inconceivable for a fountain to produce both salt water and fresh water, just as it is irrational for a person to bless and curse with their tongue. These comparisons highlight the essentiality of consistency and the folly of contradictory speech.

2. "The mouth that emits cursing cannot really emit also blessing."
3. "No tree 'can' bring forth fruit inconsistent with its nature."
