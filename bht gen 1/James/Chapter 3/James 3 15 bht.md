# James 3:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This verse warns against the dangers of earthly, sensual, and devilish wisdom, which is in contrast to the true heavenly wisdom that comes from God. Earthly wisdom is limited to the affairs of this present life, devoid of spiritual understanding. It is acquired through natural strength and appeals to the corrupt nature of unregenerate individuals, just as demons influence and corrupt the soul. This false wisdom breeds envy, contention, and a quarrelsome spirit, standing in opposition to the divine wisdom that brings peace, gentleness, and love for truth.
