## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The wisdom from above is first of all pure."
2. "The heavenly-wise must be pure, i.e. free from all contact with anything that offends, before he can be peaceable."
3. "The great triumph of the Christian practical life is won by ἔλεος."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "First pure—literally, 'chaste,' 'sanctified': pure from all that is 'earthly, sensual (animal), devilish.'"
2. "Ministers must not preach before a purifying change of heart, 'Peace,' where there is no peace."
3. "Our first concern is to have in ourselves sanctity; our second, to be at peace with men."
4. "gentle—'forbearing'; making allowances for others; lenient towards neighbors, as to the DUTIES they owe us."
5. "without hypocrisy—Not as ALFORD explains from James 1:22; James 1:26, 'Without deceiving yourselves' with the name without the reality of religion."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The first effect of [wisdom from above] on the mind is to make it pure. The influence on the man is to make him upright, sincere, candid, holy."
2. "The effect of true religion - the wisdom which is from above - will be to dispose a man to live in peace with all others."
3. "He who is under the influence of the wisdom which is from above, is not a stiff, stern, obstinate, unyielding man. He is not one who cannot be affected by any appeals which may be made to him on the grounds of patriotism, justice, or benevolence; but is one who is ready to yield when truth requires him to do it, and who is willing to sacrifice his own convenience for the good of others."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Emphasizing its inner quality, pure, as distinguished from its outward expressions."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The heavenly wisdom is described by seven qualities which, as has been well said, are 'nothing but the seven colours of the one ray of light of heavenly truth which has appeared and been revealed in Christ Himself the Wisdom of God.'"

2. "Purity is its primary quality; all other qualities of heavenly wisdom are subservient to this. We must, however, beware of perverting this remark in the interests of intolerance and party-strife; these are the bitter fruits, not of heavenly, but of earthly wisdom."

3. "Pure, free from all impure and corrupt mixtures; separated from everything that offends; no stain of sin must pollute it; everything that is morally evil is abhorrent to its nature."

4. "Gentle, kind, forbearing, considerate, making every allowance for the ignorance and frailties of others, imitating the character of Him who is meek and lowly 'the gentle Jesus.'"

5. "It is full of mercy and good fruits; of compassion and beneficence to the poor; feeding the hungry, clothing the naked, visiting the widows and fatherless in their affliction; and doing all other good works and duties, both with respect to God and man, as fruits of grace, and of the Spirit."
