# James 3:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse described in these commentaries emphasizes the power and influence of the tongue. It uses the analogy of a bit in a horse's mouth to illustrate how the tongue has control over the whole body. Just as a bridle directs and governs the movements of a horse, the tongue has the power to guide and shape our actions. The verse underscores the importance of self-control and the impact our words can have on our behavior and relationships. Through this analogy, the verse calls for reflection on the responsibility and influence we have in our speech.
