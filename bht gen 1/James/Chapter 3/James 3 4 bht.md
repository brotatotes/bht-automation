# James 3:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse describes the power of a small instrument to guide and control something much larger. It compares a ship, which is driven by fierce winds, to the human tongue, which has the ability to direct and influence the course of one's actions and words. Just as the steersman controls the ship with a small rudder, the governor of one's speech can have a significant impact on their entire being. This analogy serves as a reminder of the immense influence and responsibility that comes with controlling one's tongue.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Behold, even the ships, though so great and driven by fierce winds, are turned about by a very small rudder." 
2. "The desire of the steersman may wish." 
3. "The same thought occurs in Aristot. Quæst Mechan. 5, τὸ πηδάλιον, μικρὸν ὄν, καὶ ἐπʼ ἐσχάτῳ τῷ πλοίῳ, τοσαύτην δύναμιν ἔχει, ὥστε ὑπὸ μικροῦ οἴακος, καὶ ἑνὸς ἀνθρώπου δυνάμεως, καὶ ταύτης ἠρεμαίας, μεγάλα κινεῖσθαι μεγέθη πλοίων."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The impulse of the steersman pleaseth." - This quote highlights the idea that just as a ship is directed by the will of the steersman, so too is the governor able to exercise control and authority over others. It emphasizes the power and influence that a leader possesses.

2. "The feeling which moves the tongue corresponds with this." - This quote suggests that the ability to speak and express oneself is connected to the inner desires and intentions of a person. It implies that the governor's decisions and actions are driven by their own personal inclinations and motivations.

3. "Not only animals, but even ships." - This quote emphasizes that the governor's authority extends beyond just the governance of animals. It implies that the governor has the ability to exert control and influence over various aspects of society, including the navigation and direction of ships. This highlights the broad scope of the governor's power.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "A ship is a large object. It seems to be unmanageable by its vastness, and it is also impelled by driving storms. Yet it is easily managed by a small rudder; and he that has control of that, has control of the ship itself."
2. "The proper control of the tongue in respect to its influence on the whole man, is not unlike the control of the rudder in its power over the ship."
3. "Even a man under impetuous passion would be restrained, if the tongue is properly controlled, as the ship driven by the winds is by the helm."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "There is more imagery drawn from mere natural phenomena in the one short epistle of James than in all St. Paul's epistles put together."
2. "As the ship which conveyed Paul to Malta, which contained two hundred and seventy-six persons."
3. "The rudder was an oar worked by a handle. Helm and rudder were thus one."

Note: The commentary is quite fragmented and lacks coherence, making it difficult to extract more meaningful quotes.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The ships of the ancients were often very large, but the comparison is even more forcible in our days, as our ships are still larger."
2. "These fierce winds may denote human passions, which the government of the tongue controls."
3. "The little helm controlleth the fury of the winds and waves. Here there is an additional point of comparison, namely, the smallness of the instrument employed in governing."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "There is more imagery drawn from mere natural phenomena in the one short Epistle of James than in all St. Paul's epistles put together." (Howson)
2. "If James had only seen the modern mammoth ships. But the ship on which Paul went to Malta carried 276 persons." 
3. "By a very small rudder... the impulse of the steersman willeth."

### John Gill:
1. "Behold also the ships, which though they be so great,.... Of so large a bulk, of such a prodigious size, and are such unwieldy vessels:and are driven of fierce winds; with great vehemence, rapidity, and swiftness."
2. "yet are they turned about with a very small helm, whithersoever the governor listeth; the helm, or tiller of a ship, is a beam or piece of timber fastened into the rudder, and so coming forward into the steerage, where he that stands at helm steers the ship."
3. "And so, though the tongue is to the rest of the body as a small helm to a large ship, yet, like that, it has great influence over the whole body, to check it when it is carrying away with the force of its appetites and passions."
