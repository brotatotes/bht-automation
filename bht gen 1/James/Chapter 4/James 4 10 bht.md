# James 4:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we are called to embrace a mindset deeply rooted in humility, recognizing our own unworthiness and dependence on God. We are urged to humble ourselves before the Lord, acknowledging our sins and seeking His grace and forgiveness. By doing so, we open ourselves up to God's transformative power, allowing Him to exalt us and bring us into a place of joy, restoration, and honor. This call to humility is a reminder that true elevation comes not from self-exaltation, but from a posture of humility and surrender before our Creator.

### Henry Alford:
1. "Sicuti arborem, ut sursum crescat, profundas subtus radices agere oportet, ita quisquis in humilitatis radice fixum animum non habet, in ruinam suam extollitur." (As a tree, in order to grow upwards, must have deep roots below, so whoever does not have a mind firmly rooted in humility is lifted up to his own ruin.) 

2. "Be humbled before the Lord... in recognition of His providence and His judgments."

2. "The tree, to grow upwards, must strike its roots deep downwards; so man, to be exalted, must have his mind deep-rooted in humility."
