# James 4:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Life is uncertain and transient, like a fleeting vapor or mist. As human beings, we often make plans and assumptions about the future, ignorant of what lies ahead. Our lives, as described by several commentators, are fragile and unpredictable, akin to a vapor that appears briefly but vanishes just as quickly. This imagery serves as a reminder of the fleeting nature of our existence and the need to prioritize what truly matters in the limited time we have.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "belonging, as ye do, to a class which"
2. "ye are (ye yourselves: so that any thing of yours, even your life, must partake of the same instability and transitoriness."
3. "a vapour, which appeareth for a little time, afterwards as it appeared, so (this is the force of καί, 'vanishing as it came;'"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "What nature is your life? That is, how evanescent it is."
2. "Ye yourselves are transitory; so everything of yours, even your life, must partake of the same transitoriness."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "We have no power of penetrating the future so as to be able to determine what will occur in a single day or a single hour, and yet we are almost habitually forming our plans as if we saw with certainty all that is to happen."
2. "All your plans must depend of course on the continuance of your life; but what a frail and uncertain thing is that! How transitory and evanescent as a basis on which to build any plans for the future!"
3. "The comparison of life with a vapor is common, and is as beautiful as it is just... Soon it disappears altogether. The works of art that man has made, the house that he has built, or the book that he has written, remain for a little time, but the life has gone."

### Marvin Vincent:

2. "What is your life?...ye are a vapor." - This quote prompts readers to reflect on the deeper meaning and purpose of their lives, reminding them that life is fleeting and should not be taken for granted.

### John Calvin:

### Philip Schaff:

3. "We are but as a smoke which is only seen to vanish; a vapour which rises from the ground at dawn, and disappears long before noon-day."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "The longer relative οστις defines here more precisely (like Latin qui) ο λεγοντες (ye who say) of verse James 4:13 in a causal sense, as in Acts 10:47, 'who indeed do not know'." 
2. "This is the answer. Old word for mist (like ατμος, from which our 'atmosphere'), in N.T. only here and Acts 2:19 with καπνου (vapour of smoke (from Joel 2:30)." 
3. "Present middle participles agreeing with ατμις, 'appearing, then also disappearing,' with play on the two verbs (φαινομαι, αφανιζω as in Matthew 6:19, from αφανης hidden Hebrews 4:13) with the same root φαν (φαινω, α-φαν-ης)."

### John Gill:
1. "No man can secure a day, an hour, a moment, and much less a year of continuance in this life; nor can he foresee what will befall him today or tomorrow; therefore it is great stupidity to determine on this, and the other, without the leave of God."
2. "What is your life? Of what kind and nature is it? What assurance can be had of the continuance of it? By what may it be expressed? Or to what may it be compared?"
3. "It is even a vapour that appeareth for a little time, and then vanisheth away; which rises out of the earth, or water, and expires almost as soon as it exists; at least, continues but a very short time, and is very weak and fleeting, and carried about here and there, and soon returns from whence it came."
