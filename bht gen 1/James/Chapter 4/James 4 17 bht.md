# James 4:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
To him that knows what is right and chooses not to do it, it is sin. This verse stresses the importance of not only having knowledge of good but also actively living it out. It highlights that knowledge alone is not enough; one must embody their knowledge through action. The condemnation of those who possess knowledge but neglect to do good is intensified, as this verse implies that failing to act on what is known exacerbates one's guilt.
