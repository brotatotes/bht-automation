# James 4:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, it is emphasized that the strong desires and cravings we have can lead us astray and cause us to envy or covet what others possess. These intense desires and feelings of jealousy, when left unchecked, can become like bitter hatred and even lead to acts of harm towards others. Instead of engaging in sinful pursuits and conflicts, it is advised to seek God's guidance through prayer, trusting in His provision and avoiding the fruitless and harmful consequences of our worldly desires.
