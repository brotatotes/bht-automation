## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "God is the Lord and husband of every soul that is His, as much as of every church; and the indignant μοιχαλίδες of the Apostle is just as applicable to every one who forsakes his or her God, as to an apostate church."
2. "The friendship of the world is enmity of God, the man who is taken out of the world by Christ, cannot again become a friend and companion of worldly men and their schemes for self, without passing into enmity with God."
3. "Whoever therefore shall be minded to be a friend of the world, is constituted an enemy of God."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "God is the rightful husband; the men of the world are regarded collectively as one adulteress, and individually as adulteresses."
2. "The world - in so far as the men of it and their motives and acts are aliens to God, for example, its selfish 'lusts' and covetous and ambitious 'wars and fightings.'"
3. "Whether he succeed or not, if his wish be to be the friend of the world, he renders himself, becomes by the very fact, 'the enemy of God.'"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "You have in effect broken your marriage covenant with God by loving the world more than him; and, by the indulgence of your carnal inclinations, you have violated those obligations to self-mortification and self-denial to which you were bound by your religious engagements."
2. "The 'friendship of the world' is the love of that world; of the maxims which govern it, the principles which reign there, the ends that are sought, the amusements and gratifications which characterize it as distinguished from the church of God."
3. "It settles the point that anyone, no matter what his professions, who is characteristically a friend of the world, cannot be a true Christian."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The apostate members of the church are figuratively regarded as unfaithful spouses; according to the common Old Testament figure, in which God is the bridegroom or husband to whom his people are wedded."
2. "Will be [βουληθη ειναι] . More correctly, as Rev., would be. Lit., may have been minded to be."
3. "Is the enemy [καθισταται] . Thereby constitutes himself. Rev., maketh himself."

### John Calvin:
1. "He calls them adulterers, as I think, metaphorically; for they corrupted themselves with the vanities of this world, and alienated themselves from God."
2. "This chastity is violated and corrupted by all impure affections towards the world."
3. "He calls it the friendship of the world when men surrender themselves to the corruptions of the world, and become slaves to them."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "It is spiritual adultery to which St. James here alludes. He here adopts the language of an Old Testament prophet."
2. "The believer is considered as married to the Lord; and the world is God’s rival, that which seduces our affections from Him."
3. "The more the world occupies our hearts, the less room there is in them for God, and the more forgetful are we of the world to come."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The feminine form here is a common late word from the masculine μοιχο. It is not clear whether the word is to be taken literally here as in Romans 7:3, or figuratively for all unfaithful followers of Christ (like an unfaithful bride), as in 2 Corinthians 11:1; Ephesians 5:24-28 (the Bride of Christ)." 

2. "Either view makes sense in this context, probably the literal view being more in harmony with the language of verses James 4:2. In that case James may include more than Christians in his view, though Paul talks plainly to church members about unchastity (Ephesians 5:3-5)."

3. "Objective genitive θεου with εχθρα (predicate and so without article), old word from εχθρος, enemy (Romans 5:10), with εις θεον (below and Romans 8:7)."

### John Gill:
1. "as he is an adulterer that removes his affections from his own wife, and sets them upon another woman; and she is an adulteress that loves not her husband, but places her love upon another man; so such men and women are adulterers and adulteresses"
2. "an immoderate love for the good things of the world, and a prevailing desire after the evil things of it, and a delight in the company and conversation of the men of the world, and a conformity to, and compliance with, the sinful manners and customs of the world, are so many declarations of war with God"
3. "whoever is in league with the one must be an enemy to the other; God and mammon cannot be loved and served by the same persons, at the same time; the one will be loved, and the other hated"

### John Wesley:
1. "Ye adulterers and adulteresses — Who have broken your faith with God, your rightful spouse."
2. "Know ye not that the friendship or love of the world... is enmity against God?"
3. "Whosoever desireth to be a friend of the world... does thereby constitute himself an enemy of God."
