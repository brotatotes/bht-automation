# James 5:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the rich are warned of the imminent judgment and miseries that will befall them. The commentators emphasize that not all rich individuals are being addressed, but specifically those who acquired wealth in an unjust and selfish manner. The impending calamities are described as both temporal and eternal, representing the swift and unexpected consequences of their actions. This warning serves not only as a cautionary message to the rich but also as a source of comfort for the oppressed, assuring them that God will be their avenger.

3. "Then James intimates that the heaviness of God’s vengeance will be so horrible and severe on the rich, that they will be constrained to break forth into howling, as though he had said briefly to them, 'Woe to you!'
