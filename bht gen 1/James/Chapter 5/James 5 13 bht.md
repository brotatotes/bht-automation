# James 5:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, believers are encouraged to express their emotions in a Christian and sober manner. When faced with trouble, they are urged to pray and seek God's help. In times of joy and prosperity, they are called to sing praises and give thanks to God. The act of singing psalms is not limited to a specific group or time, as it can be a form of prayer and a way to express gratitude in any circumstance. Through prayer and praise, believers can draw near to God and acknowledge His goodness and mercies.

### John Gill:
1. "Times of afflictions are proper times for prayer; there is then more especially need of it; and God sometimes lays his afflicting hand upon his people, when they have been negligent of their duty, and he has not heard of them for some time, in order to bring them near to him, to seek his face, pay him a visit, and pour out a prayer before him."
2. "Let him not only be inwardly joyful, as he should be in prosperity, and be thankful to God for his many mercies, temporal and spiritual, he enjoys; but let him express it vocally, and melodiously, by singing psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs."
3. "Not that these are the only persons that are to sing psalms, or this the only time, any more than that afflicted persons are the only ones that are to pray, or the time of affliction the only time of prayer; but as affliction more especially calls for prayer, so spiritual joy, and rejoicing in prosperous seasons, for singing of psalms."
