# James 5:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, believers are encouraged to be patient and endure trials, following the example of the husbandman who patiently waits for the precious fruit of his labor. This patience is enduring, not short-lived, as it is connected to the coming of the Lord, which brings deliverance from troubles. Just as the farmer waits for the proper season and necessary rains for a bountiful harvest, Christians are called to wait for God's timing and trust in His faithfulness. This patience is rooted in the hope of the restoration and reward that will come at the appointed time.
