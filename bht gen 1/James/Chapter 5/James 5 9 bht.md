### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Grudge not—rather 'Murmur not'; 'grumble not.' The Greek is literally, 'groan': a half-suppressed murmur of impatience and harsh judgment, not uttered aloud or freely."
2. "To 'murmur against one another' is virtually to judge, and so to become liable to be judged."
3. "The phrase means 'near at hand' (Genesis 4:7), which in the oldest interpretations [Targums of Jonathan and Jerusalem] is explained, 'thy sin is reserved unto the judgment of the world to come.'"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The exact idea here is, not that of grudging in the sense of dissatisfaction with what others possess, or of being envious; it is that of being fretful and impatient - or, to use a common word which more exactly expresses the sense that of grumbling."
2. "There are some persons who are always grumbling. They have a sour, dissatisfied, discontented temper; they see no excellence in other persons; they are displeased that others are more prospered, honored, and beloved than they are themselves."
3. "It is needless to say that this spirit - the offspring of pride - will make any man lead a wretched life; and equally needless to say that it is wholly contrary to the spirit of the gospel."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Grudge not [μη στεναζετε] . Better, as Rev., murmur not. The verb means to sigh or groan." 
2. "Standeth before the doors. In the act of entering." 
3. "The imagery of standing before the doors suggests that the opportunity for change and transformation is right at hand."

### John Calvin:
1. "Be not querulous one against another; lest ye be condemned." - James encourages believers to not grumble or complain against each other, warning that such behavior can lead to condemnation. This reminds us to be just and forgiving towards one another, rather than seeking vengeance or judgment.

"Let no one, then, ask for vengeance on others, except he wishes to bring it on his own head." - James cautions against seeking vengeance on others, emphasizing that we should consider the consequences of our actions. This serves as a reminder to approach conflicts with grace and forgiveness, knowing that we too are in need of mercy.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "This refers not so much to the feeling of envy 'be not envious to each other' as to impatience and irritability of temper, which are often the effects of severe or protracted trials."
2. "Their murmuring against their brethren led them to find fault with them, and thus to accuse them falsely; and this exposed them to the righteous judgment of God, who is the Avenger of all those who are wrongly condemned."
3. "The near approach of the great unerring Judge should cause us to suspend our judgments. Christ is at hand; He is even at the door, ready to render to every man according to his works."

3. "Behold the judge standeth before the door... a little while and he will come, and not tarry; which may refer not to Christ's coming to destroy Jerusalem, but to his second coming to judgment."
