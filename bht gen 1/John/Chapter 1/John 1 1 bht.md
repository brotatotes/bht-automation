# John 1:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the beginning, before the creation of the world, the eternal Word, the Son of God, existed in perfect union with God, pre-existing all things. This Word, who is not a mere written word but the essential Word, is none other than the Lord Jesus Christ. He is the divine manifestation and expression of God to mankind, the Creator of all things, and the source of life and light for all. This Word, who is both distinct from God and fully God himself, reveals the invisible and eternal God to humanity.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "These words, if they do not assert, at least imply, the eternal præ-existence of the Divine Word."
2. "The existence of an enduring and unlimited state of being, implied in ἦν, is contrasted with ἐγένετο in John 1:3, and especially in John 1:14."
3. "Both the inner substantial union, and the distinct personality of the λόγος are here asserted."

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "He who is to God what man's word is to himself, the manifestation or expression of himself to those without him."
2. "Was the Word eternal? It was not the eternity of 'the Father,' but of a conscious personal existence distinct from Him and associated with Him."
3. "It was not the distinctness and the fellowship of another being, as if there were more Gods than one, but of One who was Himself God."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The meaning is: that the 'Word' had an existence before the world was created."
2. "Whatever is meant by the term 'Word,' it is clear that it had an existence before 'creation.'"
3. "This term was in use before the time of John."
4. "John affirms that he was 'with God' in the beginning - that is, before the world was made."
5. "There is no more unequivocal declaration in the Bible than this, and there could be no stronger proof that the sacred writer meant to affirm that the Son of God was equal with the Father."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "In the beginning was the Word, with evident allusion to the first word of Genesis. But John elevates the phrase from its reference to a point of time, the beginning of creation, to the time of absolute pre-existence before any creation."
2. "The Logos was not merely existent, however, in the beginning, but was also the efficient principle, the beginning of the beginning."
3. "The Logos is a person, with a consciousness of personal distinction; Philo's is impersonal. His notion is indeterminate and fluctuating, shaped by the influence which happens to be operating at the time."

### John Calvin:
1. "The design is, to show it to have been necessary that the restoration of mankind should be accomplished by the Son of God, since by his power all things were created, since he alone breathes into all the creatures life and energy, so that they remain in their condition; and since in man himself he has given a remarkable display both of his power and of his grace, and even subsequently to the fall of man has not ceased to show liberality and kindness towards his posterity."
2. "By these words, therefore, the Evangelist assures us that we do not withdraw from the only and eternal God, when we believe in Christ, and likewise that life is now restored to the dead through the kindness of him who was the source and cause of life, when the nature of man was still uncorrupted."
3. "The Evangelist, therefore, declares that we must not confine our views to the world and to created things; for he was always united to God, before the world existed."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The words ‘in the beginning,’ taken by themselves, do not express the idea of eternal preexistence; but they leave room for it... They denote simply the point of time; and the difference of thought with which they are connected... is to be found not in the meaning of ‘beginning,’ but in the different direction which the writer takes, and in the verb which he employs."
2. "He who thus ‘was in the beginning,’ who, as we afterwards read, ‘was with God,’ and ‘was God,’ here bears the name of ‘the Word’ (Logos)... The nearest approach is found in Revelation 19:13, where the name of the righteous Conqueror and King is given as ‘The Word of God.’"
3. "There is One by whom the Eternal and Invisible God reveals Himself: the Revealer is a Person: the Revealer is Himself God. Not only in outward manifestation, but also in inward fellowship with the heart, God reveals Himself by the Word of God, who is God."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "John carries our thoughts beyond the beginning of creation in time to eternity."
2. "The term Λογος is applied to Christ only in John 1:1; John 1:14; Revelation 19:13; 1 John 1:1."
3. "Though existing eternally with God the Logos was in perfect fellowship with God."

### John Gill:
1. "That this is said not of the written word, but of the essential word of God, the Lord Jesus Christ, is clear, from all that is said from hence, to John 1:14 as that this word was in the beginning, was with God, and is God; from the creation of all things being ascribed to him, and his being said to be the life and light of men."
2. "And who is called the word, not as man; for as man he was not in the beginning with God, but became so in the fulness of time; nor is the man God; besides, as such, he is a creature, and not the Creator, nor is he the life and light of men; moreover, he was the word, before he was man, and therefore not as such."
3. "This word, he says, was in the beginning; by which is meant, not the Father of Christ; for he is never called the beginning, but the Son only; and was he, he must be such a beginning as is without one; nor can he be said to be so, with respect to the Son or Spirit, who are as eternal as himself; only with respect to the creatures, of whom he is the author and efficient cause."

### John Wesley:
1. "In the beginning — When all things began to be made by the Word: in the beginning of heaven and earth, and this whole frame of created beings, the Word existed, without any beginning." 

2. "The Word — He is the Word whom the Father begat or spoke from eternity; by whom the Father speaking, maketh all things; who speaketh the Father to us." 

3. "And the Word was God — Supreme, eternal, independent. There was no creature, in respect of which he could be styled God in a relative sense. Therefore he is styled so in the absolute sense."
