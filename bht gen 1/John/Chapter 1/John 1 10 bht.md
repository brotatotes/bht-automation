## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The κόσμος is the created world, into which He came, which was made by Him, which nevertheless knew, recognized Him not."
2. "αὐτόν, not αὐτό, because though τὸ φῶς has been the subject, yet the δι ʼ αὐτοῦ ἐγένετο brings in again the creative λόγος, Who is the Light."
3. "The three members of the sentence form a climax; He was in the world, and the world was made by Him, and the world knew Him not."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The language here is nearly as wonderful as the thought."
2. "By His Incarnation, He became an inhabitant of it, and bound up with it."
3. "The most vivid commentary on this entire verse will be got by tracing Him of whom it speaks walking amidst all the elements of nature, the diseases of men and death itself, the secrets of the human heart, and 'the rulers of the darkness of this world' in all their number, subtlety, and malignity."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He was in the world - This refers, probably, not to his pre-existence, but to the fact that he became incarnate; that he dwelt among human beings."
2. "And the world was made by him - This is a repetition of what is said in John 1:3. Not only 'men,' but all material things, were made by him."
3. "The world knew him not - The word 'knew' is sometimes used in the sense of 'approving' or 'loving.' In this sense it may be used here. The world did not love or approve him, but rejected him and put him to death."

### John Calvin:
1. "He accuses men of ingratitude, because of their own accord, as it were, they were so blinded, that the cause of the light which they enjoyed was unknown to them."
2. "What can be more unreasonable than to draw water from a running stream, and never to think of the fountain from which that stream flows?"
3. "The whole may be summed up by saying, that never was Christ in such a manner absent from the world, but that men, aroused by his rays, ought to have raised their eyes towards him."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The world came into being through him" - The verse highlights the role of the Word in the creation of the world, emphasizing his divine power and authority. 

2. "The world knew him not" - This phrase underscores the irony that the very world that was brought into existence by the Word failed to recognize and acknowledge him. 

3. "The development is rather of thought than of time" - The commentary suggests that the verse is not solely about chronological events but also about the deeper significance and meaning behind the Word's presence in the world.

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "He was in the world (εν τω κοσμω ην). Imperfect tense of continuous existence in the universe before the Incarnation as in verses John 1:1; John 1:2." 

2. "Was made by him (δι' αυτου εγενετο). 'Through him.' Same statement here of 'the world' (ο κοσμος) as that made in verse John 1:3 of παντα."

3. "Knew him not (αυτον ουκ εγνω). Second aorist active indicative of common verb γινοσκω, what Gildersleeve called a negative aorist, refused or failed to recognize him, his world that he had created and that was held together by him (Colossians 1:16)."

### John Gill:
1. "He was in the world, when first made, and since, by his essence, by which he fills the whole world; and by his power, upholding and preserving it; and by his providence, ordering and managing all the affairs of it, and influencing and governing all things in it."
2. "To understand this of the old creation, best suits the context, and proves the deity of Christ, and his pre-existence, as the word, and Son of God, to his incarnation."
3. "The inhabitants of the world knew him not as their Creator: nor did they acknowledge the mercies they received from him; nor did they worship, serve, and obey him, or love and fear him; nor did they, the greater part of them, know him as the Messiah, Mediator, Saviour, and Redeemer."

### John Wesley:
1. "The phrase 'He was in the world' emphasizes the eternal existence of Jesus, highlighting that He was present even before the creation of the world. This speaks to His divine nature and eternal existence as the Word of God."

2. "By stating that Jesus was 'in the world,' the commentary highlights His active involvement and presence in the affairs of humanity. This shows that Jesus is not distant or detached, but intimately connected to the world and its inhabitants."

3. "The phrase 'He was in the world' also suggests that Jesus willingly entered into the brokenness and fallenness of the world. This emphasizes His mission to bring salvation and redemption to humanity, demonstrating His love and compassion for mankind."
