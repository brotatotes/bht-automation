# John 1:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the fulness of time, Jesus came unto his own country, city, and temple, expecting to be received and recognized as the long-awaited Messiah. However, his own people, the Jews, rejected him, failing to acknowledge him as their Savior. This rejection by his own community emphasized the desperate wickedness, malice, and blindness of humanity, despite the chosen and special relationship between God and the Israelites. Such rejection fulfilled prophecies and underscored the tragic outcome of Jesus' rejection, leading to his crucifixion.

### Henry Alford:
1. "τὰ ἴδια here cannot well mean the world, or οἱ ἴδιοι mankind in general: it would be difficult to point out any Scripture usage to justify such a meaning."
2. "But abundance of passages bear out the meaning which makes τὰ ἴδια His own inheritance or possession, i.e. Judæa; and οἱ ἴδιοι, the Jews."
3. "And thus ἦλθεν forms a nearer step in the approach to the declaration in John 1:14. He came to His own."

### John Calvin:
1. "Here is displayed the absolutely desperate wickedness and malice of men; here is displayed their execrable impiety, that when the Son of God was manifested in flesh to the Jews, whom God had separated to himself from the other nations to be His own heritage, he was not acknowledged or received."
2. "The Son of God had solicited an abode for himself in one nation; when he appeared there, he was rejected; and this shows clearly the awfully wicked blindness of men."
3. "By this phrase the Evangelist compares the Jews with other nations; because by an extraordinary privilege they had been adopted into the family of God. Christ therefore was first offered to them as his own household, and as belonging to his empire by a peculiar right."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "There is a manifest advance of thought as we pass from the last verse to this. Instead of ‘He was in,’ we find ‘He came unto;’ for ‘the world,’ we have ‘His own home;’ for ‘knew’ (perceived or recognised), we have ‘accepted.’ Every change seems to point to a more intimate relationship, a clearer manifestation, and a rejection that is still more without excuse."

2. "The Word, who was in the world, had His home with the chosen people, to which had been given the revelation of the truth of God. It is still mainly of the Pre-incarnate Word that John speaks."

2. "By his own are meant the whole body of the Jewish nation; so called, because they were chosen by the Lord above all people; had distinguishing favours bestowed upon them."
