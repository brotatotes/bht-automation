# John 1:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Bible verse being described emphasizes the act of receiving Jesus, which is equated with believing in him. This belief leads to a transformation of one's status, as believers are adopted as children of God. Through faith, believers receive the power and privilege to become sons of God and are filled with the Spirit, enabling them to cry out to God as their Father.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "ἔλαβον = παρέλαβον above as many as recognized Him as that which he was the Word of God and Light of men."
2. "ἔδωκεν αὐτ. ἐξουσ. is not merely capability = δύναμιν (Lücke), still less privilege or prerogative (Chrysost. and others), but power (De Wette); involving all the actions and states needful to their so becoming, and removing all the obstacles in their way."
3. "τέκνα θ. γενέσθαι] The spiritual life owes its beginning to a birth from above, ch. John 3:3-7. And this birth is owing to the Holy Spirit of God; so that this is equivalent to saying, 'As many as received Him, to them gave He His Holy Spirit.'"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Jesus is the Son of God; He is never said to have become such." 
2. "The word signifies both authority and ability, and both are certainly meant here." 
3. "In this sense of supreme faith, as due to Him who 'gives those that believe in Himself power to become sons of God,' it is manifestly used here."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "To receive him, here, means to 'believe' on him."
2. "Sons of God - Children of God by adoption."
3. "On his name - This is another way of saying believeth in 'him.'"

These quotes highlight the meaning of "receiving" Jesus as believing in him, the concept of Christians being adopted as children of God, and the significance of believing in Jesus' name.

### John Calvin:
1. "The Evangelist declares that their condition is changed, because the Jews have been rejected, and their place, which had been left empty, is occupied by the Jews; for it is as if he transferred the right of adoption to strangers."
2. "But if faith regenerates us, so that we are the sons of God, and if God breathes faith into us from heaven, it plainly appears that not by possibility only, but actually — as we say — is the grace of adoption offered to us by Christ."
3. "The Evangelist says that those who believe are already born of God It is not therefore, a mere liberty of choice that is offered, since they obtain the privilege itself that is in question."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The thought of this verse is, that the darkness overcame it not!"
2. "The gift is not directly stated as ‘sonship,’ perhaps because the full manifestation of this blessing belongs to the latter days alone."
3. "It is very important to discriminate between the different phrases which John uses in relation to belief or faith...such an acceptance of the Person trusted, such an approach of the heart towards Him, as leads to union with Him."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "As many as received him" - exceptional action on the part of the disciples and other believers.
2. "To become children of God" - in the full spiritual sense, not merely as offspring of God.

2. "To be the sons of God is a very special favour, a great blessing, and high honour."
3. "Christ, the word, or Son of God, not only espoused their persons, and in time assumed their nature, and by the redemption of them opened a way for their reception of the adoption of children; but actually bestows upon them the 'power' of becoming the sons of God."
