2. "The conjunctions here...rise in climax from one clause to another."
3. "Perhaps this may be earned somewhat further, and we may better satisfy the climax by regarding the ἐξ αἱμάτων as indicating the mere phenomena of physical generation wherever found."

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Which were born—a sonship therefore not of mere title and privilege, but of nature, the soul being made conscious of the vital capacities, perceptions, and emotions of a child of God, before unknown."
2. "Not of blood, &c.—not of superior human descent, not of human generation at all, not of man in any manner of way."

### John Gill:
1. "The birth, here spoken of, is regeneration, expressed by a being born again, or from above; by a being quickened by the Spirit and grace of God; by Christ being formed in men; and by a partaking of the divine nature; and by being made new creatures, as all that believe in the name of Christ are; and which is the evidence of their being the sons of God."
2. "Regeneration is ascribed to another will and power, even to the will and power of God, and denied of this."
