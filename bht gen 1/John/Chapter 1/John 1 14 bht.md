## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "σὰρξ ἐγένετο, became flesh: the most general expression of the great truth that He became man."
2. "ἐσκήνωσεν, ‘sojourned,’ or ‘tabernacled,’ in us. There is no reference to the flesh being the tabernacle of the Spirit; but the word is one technically used in Scripture to import the dwelling of God among men."
3. "μονογενής of the Father in the higher sense, in which He is γεννηθείς the Son of God."


### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "BECAME MAN, in man's present frail, mortal condition, denoted by the word 'flesh'...Nor could He be too much so, for with the verity of the Incarnation all substantial Christianity vanishes."
2. "For ever wedded to our 'flesh,' He has entered this tabernacle to 'go no more out.'"
3. "In His Person all that Grace and Truth which had been floating so long in shadowy forms, and darting into the souls of the poor and needy its broken beams, took everlasting possession of human flesh and filled it full."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The word 'flesh,' here, is evidently used to denote 'human nature' or 'man.'"
2. "The expression...means that he became a man, and that he became such by the power of God providing for him a body."
3. "He was kind, merciful, gracious, doing good to all, and seeking man's welfare by great sacrifices and love; so much so, that it might be said to be characteristic of him, or he 'abounded' in favors to mankind."

### John Calvin:
1. "The word Flesh expresses the meaning of the Evangelist more forcibly than if he had said that he was made man. He intended to show to what a mean and despicable condition the Son of God, on our account, descended from the height of his heavenly glory."
2. "The plain meaning therefore is, that the Speech begotten by God before all ages, and who always dwelt with the Father, was made man."
3. "The Evangelist says what is well adapted to refute both of these blasphemies. When he tells us that the Speech was made flesh, we clearly infer from this the unity of his Person; for it is impossible that he who is now a man could be any other than he who was always the true God, since it is said that God was made man."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The Word became flesh; did not merely take to Him a human body, did not merely become an individual man, but assumed human nature in its entireness... identified Himself with the race, entered into such a condition that He could have perfect communion and fellowship with us, and we with Him." 
2. "The word ‘became’ does not denote that His divine nature was laid aside... What is really indicated is the passing into a new state, a transition rather than a transformation." 
3. "The glory of the Incarnate Word... is compared with that of an only son sent from a father; but it is not until John 1:18 that these elements are combined into one supreme utterance of truth."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "John does not here say that the Logos entered into a man or dwelt in a man or filled a man. One is at liberty to see an allusion to the birth narratives in Matthew 1:16-25; Luke 1:28-38, if he wishes, since John clearly had the Synoptics before him and chiefly supplemented them in his narrative."
2. "By this word John insists that in the human Jesus he beheld the Shekinah glory of God who was and is the Logos who existed before with God. By this plural John speaks for himself and all those who saw in Jesus what he did."
3. "John clearly means to say that 'the manifested glory of the Word was as it were the glory of the Eternal Father shared with His only Son' (Bernard)."

### John Gill:
1. "And the word was made flesh...to show, that it was a real human nature, and not a phantom, or appearance, that he assumed."
2. "The human nature of Christ was of God's pitching, and not man's...the fulness of the Godhead dwelt in it, as well as a fulness of grace and truth."
3. "He dwelt among us...in allusion to the tabernacle, which was a type of Christ's human nature...here God dwelt, granted his presence, and his glory was seen."

These quotes highlight the incarnation of Jesus, emphasizing the reality of his human nature and the divine presence within him. They also draw connections to the tabernacle and the dwelling of God among his people.

### John Wesley:
1. "Flesh sometimes signifies corrupt nature; sometimes the body; sometimes, as here, the whole man."
2. "And in order to raise us to this dignity and happiness, the eternal Word, by a most amazing condescension, was made flesh, united himself to our miserable nature, with all its innocent infirmities."
3. "And we who are now recording these things beheld his glory with so strict an attention, that we can testify, it was in every respect such a glory as became the only begotten of the Father."
