# John 1:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The testimony of John, parallel to the assertions and testimony of the Evangelist himself, is a continuous and unchanging act. John's witness resounds through the years, echoing the glory and truth of the Incarnate Logos. Christ, who came after John, is rightly exalted and preferred, not in rank or birth, but in His eternal existence as the preeminent Word and Son of God. With joy and confidence, John cried out about the One he spoke of before he saw and recognized Him in the flesh, knowing that Jesus is both his successor and superior.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The testimony of John, so important as being the fulfilment of the very object for which he was ἀπεσταλμένος παρὰ θεοῦ, is in this prologue ranged, so to speak, parallel with the assertions and testimony of the Evangelist himself."
2. "μαρτυρεῖ, present, for solemnity as part of the testimony to Him, not only once given, but still subsisting."
3. "This form of the words seems to shew, as indeed would appear from the announcement of his own office by the Baptist, that he had uttered these words in the power of the Spirit concerning Him whose forerunner he was before he saw and recognized Him in the flesh."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "My Successor is my Superior, for He was my Predecessor."
2. "This enigmatic play upon the different senses of the words 'before' and 'after' was doubtless employed by the Baptist to arrest attention, and rivet the thought."
3. "The Evangelist introduces it just to clinch his own statements."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He that cometh after me - He of whom I am the forerunner, or whose way I am come to prepare."
2. "Is preferred before me - Is superior to me."
3. "We may learn here that it is one mark of the true spirit of a minister of Christ to desire and feel that Christ is always to be preferred to ourselves."

### John Calvin:
1. "By using the verb testifieth (μαρτυρεῖ) in the present tense, he denotes a continued act, and certainly this doctrine must be continually in force, as if the voice of John were continually resounding in the ears of men."
2. "The first sentence is intended to convey the statement, that he was sent for the sake of Christ, and therefore that it would have been unreasonable that he should be exalted, while Christ was lying low."
3. "Christ came after John the Baptist. The words which follow might be literally rendered, he was made before me, for he was before me; but the meaning is, that Christ was justly preferred to John, because he was more excellent."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Of this John is the witness; his testimony abides, unchanging, always present."
2. "The loud cry of the faithful witness has come down through all the years; we seem to hear its echoes still."
3. "Jesus came 'after' or 'behind' John, as coming later in His manifestation to the world. But He has been advanced before John; the reason of this is given in John's declaration, 'He was before me.'"

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "The witness of John is adduced in proof of the glory full of grace and truth already claimed for the Incarnate Logos." 
2. "The Beloved Disciple can still hear echoing through the years." 
3. "The language of John here is precisely that in Matthew 3:11."

### John Gill:
1. "This was he, of whom I spake; when he first entered upon his ministry and baptism, before he saw Christ, or baptized him."
2. "He that cometh after me; for Christ came into the world after John; he was born six months after him; he came after him to be baptized by him, and attended on his ministry; and came later into the public ministry than he did."
3. "For he was before me; which cannot be meant of honour and dignity; for this is expressed before; and it would be proving one thing by the same: nor of his birth, as man; for John in that sense was before him, being born before him; besides, being born before another, is no proof of superior worth; others were born before John, whom he yet excelled: but of his eternal existence, as the word, and Son of God, who was before John, or any of the prophets; before Abraham, and Noah, and Adam, or any creature whatever."

### John Wesley:
1. "John cried — With joy and confidence"
2. "This is he of whom I said - John had said this before our Lord's baptism"
3. "He is preferred before me — in his office: for he was before me - in his nature."
