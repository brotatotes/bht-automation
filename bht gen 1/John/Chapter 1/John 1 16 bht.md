# John 1:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse being described is a continuation from John 1:14 and belongs to the Evangelist, not the Baptist. It speaks of the abundance of grace and truth found in Christ, from which believers receive their spiritual blessings. Drawing from the fullness of Christ, believers are able to find complete satisfaction and an inexhaustible fountain of grace. The verse emphasizes that all spiritual goodness is found in Christ alone and that seeking fulfillment outside of Him is in vain. Through faith, grace is received and multiplied, with one blessing upon another.
