# John 1:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse being described is a contrast between the law given by Moses and the grace and truth brought by Jesus Christ. The commentators emphasize that the law, though divine and important, only serves as a shadow and preparation for the gospel. The gospel, filled with favors and the true system, is revealed by Christ. Grace and truth, each complementing the other, characterize John's theology. The Gospel is the means through which grace is declared and implanted in the hearts of believers, and truth stands against false teachings and heresy.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "We received from His fulness continual additions of grace, because that fulness is not, like the law, a positive enactment, finite and circumscribed, of which it could be said that it ἐδόθη, but the bringing in of grace and truth, which ἐγένετο by Jesus Christ."
2. "Certainly, the distinction must not be lost sight of, nor denied, as Lücke attempts to do: for Bengel truly observes: 'Nullus philosophus tam accurate verba ponit, differentiamque eorum observat, quam Johannes, in hoc præsertim capite.'"
3. "I must again caution the student against any such wholly inadequate explanations as that these words are put 'per hendiadyn' for χάρις ἀληθινή. It is in this way that the depths of Scripture have been covered over by the rubbish of expositors."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The Law elicits the consciousness of sin and the need of redemption it only typifies the reality."
2. "The Gospel actually communicates reality and power from above."
3. "Paul terms the Old Testament 'shadow,' while he calls the New Testament 'substance'."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The law worketh wrath...it was preparatory to another state of things." 
2. "The gospel succeeded that and took its place, and thus showed the greatness of the gospel economy, as well as its grace and truth." 
3. "Grace and truth came by Jesus Christ - A system of religion full of favors, and the 'true' system, was revealed by him."

### John Calvin:
1. "The Evangelist therefore shows how far inferior the ministry of Moses was to the power of Christ."
2. "It would otherwise have been a great hindrance, that they expected to receive from the Law what we can only obtain through Christ."
3. "The Evangelist means, that in the Law there was nothing more than a shadowy image of spiritual blessings, but that they are actually found in Christ."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The law is not undervalued. It was divine. It was a gift of God. It was a gift through the great Lawgiver of whom Israel was proud."
2. "But it was a fixed unalterable thing, with definite boundaries, not stretching out into the illimitable and eternal."
3. "Now, however, there has ‘come’ (a far higher word than ‘was given’) a fulness of grace and truth, within which we stand, and which we are to appropriate more and more, vast, illimitable, as is that God who is love."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Without Christ there would have been no Christianity."
2. "John's theology is here pictured by the words 'grace and truth,' each with the article and each supplementary to the other."
3. "It is grace in contrast with law as Paul sets forth in Galatians and Romans. It is truth as opposed to Gnostic and all other heresy as Paul shows in Colossians and Ephesians."

### John Gill:
1. "The moral law was given to Adam, in innocence, which having been broken, and almost lost out of the minds, and memories of men, was given by Moses, in a new edition of it in writing; and points out what is man's duty both to God and men."
2. "The ceremonial law pointed out the pollution of human nature, the guilt and punishment of sin; was a type and shadow of deliverance by Christ, but could not give the grace it shadowed, and therefore is opposed both to grace and truth."
3. "By grace and truth, is meant the Gospel, in opposition to the law; which is called grace, because it is a declaration of the love, and grace, of God to men; it ascribes salvation, in all the parts of it, to the free grace and favour of God; and is the means of implanting and increasing grace in the hearts of men."

### John Wesley:
1. "The law, saith he, was given by Moses: grace was by Jesus Christ." 
2. "His grace was opposite to the wrath, his truth to the shadowy ceremonies of the law." 
3. "St. John having once mentioned the incarnation { John 1:14,) no more uses that name, the Word, in all his book."
