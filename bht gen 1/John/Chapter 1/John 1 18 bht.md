# John 1:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the commentator's insights highlight the limitations of human perception in fully comprehending God's essence. While God can be seen through His works, promises, and ordinances, a direct vision of His nature remains beyond our grasp. However, through faith, believers are able to see God and experience a deep, intimate connection with Him. This verse also emphasizes the unique relationship between the Father and the Son, underscoring the unity and profound knowledge that Jesus possesses as the one who dwells in the embrace of the Father.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Moses could not give out of the πλήρωμα of grace and truth, for he had no immediate sight of God, and no man can have: there is but One who can ἐξηγεῖσθαι θεόν, the μονογενὴς υἱός, who is no mere man, but abides in the bosom of the Father."
2. "The sight of God here meant, is not only bodily sight (though of that it is true, see Exodus 33:20; 1Ti 6:16), but intuitive and infallible knowledge, which enables Him who has it to declare the nature and will of God."
3. "The expression signifies, as Chrysostom observes, συγγένεια καὶ ἑνότης τῆς οὐσίας: and is derived from the fond and intimate union of children and parents."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "No man hath seen God—by immediate gaze, or direct intuition." 
2. "In the bosom of the Father—A remarkable expression, used only here, presupposing the Son's conscious existence distinct from the Father, and expressing His immediate and most endeared access to, and absolute acquaintance with, Him."
3. "He and He only hath declared Him," because He only can.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Jesus 'had an intimate knowledge of God,' which neither Moses nor any of the ancient prophets had possessed."
2. "This passage is not meant to deny that men had witnessed 'manifestations' of God, but it is meant that no one has seen the essence of God, or has 'fully known God.'"
3. "Jesus had a knowledge of God such as one friend has of another - knowledge of his character, designs, and nature which no other one possesses, and which renders him, therefore, qualified above all others to make him known."

### John Calvin:
1. "No man hath ever seen God...we ought to seek all things from Christ." 
2. "God dwells in inaccessible light...he cannot be known but in Christ, who is his lively image."
3. "He magnifies the manifestation of God, which has been brought to us by the gospel, in which he distinguishes us from the fathers, and shows that we are superior to them."
4. "God, who was formerly invisible, hath now made himself visible in Christ."
5. "He shows that the Son was acquainted with the most hidden secrets of his Father, in order to inform us that we have the breast of God, as it were, laid open to us in the Gospel."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The word ‘God’ here corresponds to ‘God’ in John 1:1. ‘No one hath seen God at any time.’ The contrast is to ‘we beheld’ in John 1:14, and the words describe God in His nature as God; He dwelleth in light that is inaccessible."
2. "One has ‘declared’ Him, has, as the Word, unfolded and explained Him. And the glorious fitness of the Word to do this is pointed out in three particulars, all showing how fitly He could do that which none other could do."
3. "He is ‘only begotten,’ Son among all other sons in His own peculiar sense, who is fully able to represent the Father, to whom all the perfections of the Father flow. He is God not only Son, but, as Son, God, Himself divine, not in a metaphorical sense, but possessing all the attributes of true and real divinity."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "God no one has ever seen." - John emphasizes that God is invisible and cannot be seen with the human physical eye. This aligns with other biblical references that describe God as invisible.

2. "The Logos is plainly called θεος in verse John 1:1." - The true text refers to the Logos (the Word) as God. This highlights the deity of Christ and reinforces the concept of the Incarnation.

3. "The mystic sense here is that the Son is qualified to reveal the Father as Logos by reason of the continual fellowship with the Father." - The Son's eternal relationship with the Father allows him to fully reveal and represent the Father as the Logos, both in idea and expression.

4. "He hath declared him." - The Son, through his incarnation as the Logos, effectively and accurately reveals who God is and what he is like. This emphasizes the role of the Son in making God known to humanity.

### John Gill:
1. "God is seen in the works of creation and providence, in the promises, and in his ordinances; but above all, in Christ the brightness of his glory, and the express image of his person."
2. "The phrase, which is in the bosom of the Father, denotes unity of nature, and essence, in the Father and Son; their distinct personality; strong love, and affection between them; the Son's acquaintance with his Father's secrets."
3. "He has made, and delivered a fuller revelation of these things, than ever was yet; and to which no other revelation in the present state of things will be added."

### John Wesley:
1. "No man hath seen God — With bodily eyes: yet believers see him with the eye of faith."
2. "Who is in the bosom of the Father — The expression denotes the highest unity, and the most intimate knowledge."
