## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "So very frequently in St. John, where commonly the mistake is made of supposing the demonstrative pronoun to be the subject, whereas it is ever the predicate of identification." 
2. "John alone of the Evangelists uses this expression; principally as designating the chiefs of the Jewish people, the members of the Sanhedrim."
3. "It is an interesting enquiry, what this usage denotes as to the author or date of our Gospel. Prof. Bleek, Beiträge, pp. 245 249, has satisfactorily shewn that no inference can be deduced from it against the Jewish origin of the author, as Bretschneider and Fischer endeavoured to do: but it is rather confirmatory of the belief that the Gospel was written after the Jews had ceased to be politically a nation, and among Gentiles; the author himself contemplating these last as his readers."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "record—testimony" - The commentary suggests that the word "record" here refers to a testimony, indicating that the verse is emphasizing the importance of bearing witness to the truth.

### Albert Barnes:

### John Calvin:
1. "John openly confessed for what purpose he was sent by God."
2. "They ask John, Who art thou? At first, therefore, they did not act from malice, but, on the contrary, actuated by the desire of redemption."
3. "It is evident, therefore, that a report about John was widely spread and aroused the minds of all; and this was arranged by the wonderful Providence of God, that this testimony might be more strikingly complete."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The words ‘this is the witness of John’ do not necessarily mean ‘this witness which follows is the witness of John;’ the Evangelist’s ordinary usage in similar cases suggests that the sense intended is rather, ‘And of this kind confirmatory of the preceding statements is the witness,’ etc."
2. "In this mention of ‘the Jews’ we meet for the first time with one of the most characteristic terms of the Fourth Gospel."
3. "The mass of the people, the led as contrasted with the leaders, he speaks of as ‘the multitude’ or ‘the multitudes.’ Hence in most of the passages in which we meet with ‘the Jews,’ we must understand the party possessed of greatest influence in the nation, the representatives of Judaism, the leaders in opposition to Jesus."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "He had twice already alluded to it (verses John 1:7; John 1:15) and now he proceeds to give it as the most important item to add after the Prologue."
2. "The story in John proceeds along the same lines as in the Synoptics. There is increasing unfolding of Christ to the disciples with increasing hostility on the part of the Jews till the final consummation in Jerusalem."
3. "The committee from the Sanhedrin put the question sharply up to John to define his claims concerning the Messiah."

### John Gill:
1. "The evangelist proceeds to give a large, and full account of the testimony John the Baptist bore to Christ, which he had hinted at before, and had signified was his work, and office, and the end of his being sent."
2. "A message from so august an assembly, at so great a distance, was doing John a great deal of honour, and serves to make his testimony of Christ the more public and remarkable."
3. "The question they put by their messengers might not be, as some have thought, to ensnare John, nor out of disrespect to Jesus, who, as yet, was not made manifest; but might be in good earnest, having, from many circumstances, reason to think there might be something in the people's opinion of him."

### John Wesley:
1. "The Jews" in this context refers to the religious leaders or members of the Sanhedrin, who held significant authority in Jewish society at the time.
