## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "John's announcement that the Kingdom of God was at hand naturally led the Jews to the prophecy of Malachi 4:5, where the coming of Elijah is mentioned." 
2. "The deputation asked the question in a mistaken and superstitious sense, expecting Elijah to physically come down from heaven. In this sense, John was not Elijah." 
3. "The Jews expected a particular prophet to arise, distinct from the Messiah, whose coming was intimately connected with that of the Messiah Himself. John clarifies that he is not that prophet."

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Elias—in His own proper person." This quote highlights the belief that Elijah would come back in the flesh, rather than in the form of another prophet. 

2. "That prophet—announced in Deuteronomy 18:15, &c." This quote refers to the prophecy in Deuteronomy that speaks of a future prophet like Moses. It suggests that there was confusion among the people as to whether this prophet was the same as Elijah or the Messiah.

3. "About whom they seem not to have been agreed whether he were the same with the Messiah or no." This quote emphasizes the disagreement among the people regarding the identity of Elijah and whether he was the same as the Messiah. It shows that there was uncertainty and differing opinions on this matter.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The Jews expected that Elijah would appear before the Messiah came."
2. "John denied that he was Elijah; but he did not deny that he was the Elias or Elijah which the prophet intended."
3. "He so clearly stated to them his true character that they might understand that he was really the one predicted as Elijah."

### John Calvin:
1. "It was because they learned from the prediction of Malachi 4:2, that when the Messiah, the Sun of Righteousness, should arise, Elijah would be the morning star to announce his approach."
2. "But the question is founded on a false opinion which they had long held; for, holding the opinion that the soul of a man departs out of one body into another, when the Prophet Malachi announced that Elijah would be sent, they imagined that the same Elijah, who lived under the reign of king Ahab, (1 Kings 17:1,) was to come."
3. "Rather do they by this term point out the office of John, and ask if God had appointed him to be a prophet. When he replies, I am not, he does not for the sake of modesty tell a lie, but honestly and sincerely detaches himself from the company of the prophets."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The question was a natural one, for the thought of the coming of Elijah was intimately associated with that of the coming of Messiah."
2. "It is possible that even the Baptist himself did not know that he was 'Elijah' in this latter sense."
3. "But the main point with the Baptist is to show that, strictly speaking, he is simply the herald of that era."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "What then? (Τ ουν;). Argumentative ουν like Paul's τ ουν in Romans 6:15."
2. "Why then does John here flatly deny it? Because the expectation was that Elijah would return in person. This John denies."
3. "He saith (λεγε). Vivid dramatic present.I am not (ουκ ειμ). Short and blunt denial."

### John Gill:
1. "The Jews had a notion that that prophet would come in person a little before the coming of the Messiah."
2. "John's answer is to the intention of their question, and their own meaning in it, and is no contradiction to what Christ says of him."
3. "He was not like one of the prophets of the Old Testament; his prophesying lay not so much in predicting future events, as in pointing out Christ, and preaching the doctrine of the remission of sins by him."

### John Wesley:
1. "He was not that Elijah (the Tishbite) of whom they spoke."
2. "Art thou the prophet — Of whom Moses speaks, Deuteronomy 18:15."
3. "Art thou Elijah?"
