# John 1:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse in question describes a man being questioned about his identity and purpose by a group of people. The commentators highlight that the man's role is not just as a voice, but as a witness for Christ. He has already denied being the Christ, Elijah, or the prophet, which leads the deputation to directly ask him to clarify his identity. With anticipation and urgency, they desire a positive and honest answer from him to understand his role and purpose.
