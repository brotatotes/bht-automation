## BHT:
In the midst of you stands one of great importance, who has already been recognized as the Messiah and has the power to baptize in the Holy Ghost. However, there is a tragic lack of knowledge and recognition among the people regarding this significant figure. John's baptism serves as a preparation for the coming of Jesus, a reminder that both Jews and Gentiles need to embrace him as their Savior and be cleansed from their sins through repentance.
