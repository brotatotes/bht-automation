## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "His testimony is decisive for the universality and authority of Βηθανίᾳ, while for the other he only produces a tradition, and that only at second-hand; 'they say that such a place is shewn.'" 
2. "The whole series of transactions here recorded, from Joh 1:15 onwards, certainly happened after the baptism of our Lord; for before that event John did not know Him as ὁ ἐρχόμενος."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

2. "This distinction is important because it helps us understand the context and location of the events that took place in the verse." 

3. "By identifying Bethany as being 'beyond Jordan,' the commentary highlights the geographical significance of the verse and provides a clearer picture of the setting."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The reading 'Bethabara,' instead of 'Bethany,' seems to have arisen from the conjecture of Origen, who found in his day no such place as 'Bethany,' but saw a town called 'Bethabara,' where John was said to have baptized, and therefore took the liberty of changing the former reading." 

2. "There was a Bethany about 2 miles east of Jerusalem, but there is said also to have been another in the tribe of Reuben, on the east side of the river Jordan, and in this place, probably, John was baptizing."
