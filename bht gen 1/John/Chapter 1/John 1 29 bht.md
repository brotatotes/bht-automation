2. "And Christ is styled the Lamb 'of God', in allusion to the same, whom the Cabalistic Jews call the secret of the mystery, and 'the Lambs of God'; because God has a special property in him; he is his own Son; and because he is of his providing and appointing, as a sacrifice for sin, and is acceptable to him as such; and to distinguish him from all other lambs."
