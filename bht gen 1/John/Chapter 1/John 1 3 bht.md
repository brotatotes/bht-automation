## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The history of the term λόγος forbids such an explanation entirely."
2. "Nothing was made without Him (the λόγος); all matter, and implicitly evil itself, in the deep and inscrutable purposes of creation."
3. "John never uses γενέσθαι ἐν for 'to be made by.'"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "All things, c.—all things absolutely... without Him was not any thing—not one thing." 
2. "This is a denial of the eternity and non-creation of matter, which was held by the whole thinking world outside of Judaism and Christianity."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The expression cannot be limited to any part of the universe. It appropriately expresses everything which exists - all the vast masses of material worlds, and all the animals and things, great or small, that compose those worlds."
2. "The work of 'creation' is uniformly ascribed in the Scriptures to the Second Person of the Trinity."
3. "The Being, therefore, that 'created' all things must be divine; and, since this work is ascribed to Jesus Christ, and as it is uniformly in the Scriptures declared to be the work of God, Jesus Christ is therefore equal with the Father."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The main conception of creation which is present in the writings of St. John is expressed by the first notice which he makes of it: All things came into being through the Word. This statement sets aside the notions of eternal matter and of inherent evil in matter."
2. "The agency of the Word, 'who was God,' again excludes both the idea of a Creator essentially inferior to God, and the idea of an abstract Monotheism in which there is no living relation between the creature and the Creator."
3. "Thus creation (all things came into being through Him) answers to the Incarnation (the Word became flesh). All the unfolding and infolding of finite being to the last issue lies in the fulfillment of His will who is love."

### John Calvin:
1. "The mere name of God attributed to Christ will affect us little, if our faith do not feel it to be such by experience."

2. "Regeneration is denied to be of man, and is always ascribed to God; nor would Christ's being the author of the new creation, be any contradiction to his being the author of the old creation, which is intended here."
