The purpose of John's ministry was to affirm the necessity of forsaking sin in order to truly manifest Jesus in one's heart.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Both accounts are entirely consistent with the supposition that John had been from youth upwards acquainted with our Lord, and indeed may have in his own mind believed Him to be the Christ."
2. "This testimony does not rest upon my long personal acquaintance with Him, but on that which happened during my work of baptizing."
3. "But our narrative is not built upon any such Jewish belief, for it is evidently only as a spiritual preparation, through repentance, for the knowledge of Him, that John regarded his baptism."

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "John only knew that at a definite time after his own call, his Master would show Himself."
2. "The spirit of the Baptist heaving under a divine presentiment that the moment had at length arrived."
3. "Then, catching up the voice from heaven, 'he saw and bare record that this is the Son of God.'"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "John was not personally acquainted with Jesus... This proves that there could have been no collusion or agreement between them to impose on the people."
2. "He understood that he was to announce that the Messiah was about to appear... it now appeared that the Messiah was Jesus of Nazareth."
3. "To Israel - To the Jews."

### John Calvin:
1. "That his testimony may not be suspected of having been given either from friendship or favor, he anticipates such a doubt, by affirming that he had no other knowledge of Christ than what he had obtained by divine inspiration."
2. "John does not speak at his own suggestion, nor for the favor of man, but by the inspiration of the Spirit and the command of God."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The object which the Baptist here assigns for his work of baptizing may at first sight seem to be different from that mentioned in the earlier Gospels, where he is spoken of as sent to prepare the way of the Lord. Attention to the words used by John will remove all difficulty."
2. "‘Made manifest,’ again, is not a mere outward manifestation, but a revelation of Jesus as He is."
3. "Thus the meaning of the words is not, ‘I baptize in water in order that Jesus may come to my baptism, and may there receive a testimony from on high;’ but, ‘I baptize that I may declare the necessity of that forsaking of sin without which no true manifestation of Jesus can be made to the heart.’"
