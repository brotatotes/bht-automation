## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "What seek ye—gentle, winning question, remarkable as the Redeemer's first public utterance."
2. "Where dwellest thou—that is, 'That is a question we cannot answer in a moment; but had we Thy company for a calm hour in private, gladly should we open our burden.'"

These quotes highlight the gentle and inviting nature of Jesus' question and the desire of the individuals to spend more time with Him.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "What seek ye? - This was not asked to obtain 'information.' It was a kind inquiry respecting their desires; an invitation to lay open their minds, to state their wishes, and to express all their feelings respecting the Messiah and their own salvation." 

2. "Rabbi - This was a Jewish title conferred somewhat as literary degrees now are, and meaning literally 'a great one,' and was applied to a teacher or master in the Jewish schools. Our Saviour solemnly forbade his disciples to wear that title. The fact that John 'interpreted' this word shows that he wrote his gospel not for the Jews only, but for those who did not understand the Hebrew language."

3. "Where dwellest thou? - This question they probably asked him in order to signify their wish to be with him and to be instructed by him. They desired more fully to listen to him than they could now by the wayside. Religion teaches people true politeness, or a disposition to consult the convenience of others, and not improperly to molest them, or to break in upon them when engaged."

### John Calvin:
1. "Although, therefore, those two disciples do not yet recognize Christ as the only Teacher of the Church, yet, moved by the commendation bestowed on him by John the Baptist, they hold him to be a Prophet and teacher, which is the first step towards receiving instruction."
2. "By this example we are taught that from the first, rudiments of the Church we ought to draw such a relish for Christ as will excite our desire to profit; and next, that we ought not to be satisfied with a mere passing look, but that we ought to seek his dwelling, that he may receive us as guests."
3. "For there are very many who smell the gospel at a distance only, and thus allow Christ suddenly to disappear, and all that they have learned concerning him to pass away."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "They who thus follow Jesus shall not do so in vain."
2. "Where is Thy permanent resting-place and home, that as pupils we may seek Thee there, and may abide with Thee till we have seen the glory of which we have heard?"
3. "By the title Rabbi... they naturally give the same name of honour to Jesus."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Turned (στραφεις). Second aorist passive participle of στρεφω, vividly picturing the sudden act of Jesus on hearing their steps behind him."
2. "Following (ακολοθουντας). Present active participle of ακολουθεω (verse John 1:37). It was Christ's first experience of this kind and the two came from the Baptist to Jesus."
3. "Rabbi (Ραββε). Aramaic title for 'Teacher' which John here translates by Διδασκαλε as he is writing late and for general readers. Luke, a Greek Christian, does not use it, but John recalls his first use of this term to Jesus and explains it."

### John Gill:
1. "He knew what John had said, and what an effect it had upon these disciples, and what was working in their hearts, and how desirous they were of coming up to him, and conversing with him."
2. "He who will not break the bruised reed, nor quench the smoking flax, but cherishes and encourages the first motions of grace, begins first with them, and treats them in a free and familiar manner."
3. "Being said by both the disciples, or by one in the name of both, putting the following question: where dwellest thou? signifying, that that was not a proper place, in the public way, to enter into a conversation with him, and acquaint him with what they were desirous of."
