# John 1:40 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we see the disciple Andrew, who, along with another disciple, heard John speak about Jesus being the Lamb of God. Andrew then chose to follow Jesus, distinguishing himself as the brother of Simon Peter. The commentators emphasize Andrew's responsiveness to the message, his immediate decision to follow Jesus, and his role as a disciple connected to Simon Peter.
