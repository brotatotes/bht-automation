# John 1:43 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This passage describes Jesus' return to Galilee, where he was baptized by John and faced his temptations. Jesus had a divine purpose in going to Galilee, which was to call more disciples to follow him. The power of Jesus' words was so compelling that one disciple, Philip, immediately left everything behind to become his follower. The calling of these disciples marked the beginning of Jesus' ministry in Galilee and the formation of his dedicated group of followers.
