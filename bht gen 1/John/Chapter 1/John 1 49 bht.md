# John 1:49 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, a man named Nathanael encounters Jesus and recognizes Him as the Son of God with perfect knowledge of his character. Jesus' response indicates that Nathanael was not in sight when Philip called him, suggesting that Jesus' knowledge extends beyond what is visible. The verse also mentions Nathanael seeking solitude under a fig tree, possibly for prayer and meditation. Commentators emphasize Jesus' unique authority as the Rabbi, His ability to discern the thoughts and intentions of individuals, and Nathanael's noble confession of Jesus as the Son of God and the King of Israel.

### Henry Alford:
1. "The remark was overheard by Nathanael, and recognized as indicating perfect knowledge of his character."
2. "The whole form of our Lord’s answer seems to indicate that the place where Philip called Nathanael was not now in sight, nor had been."
3. "ὄντα ὑπὸ τὴν συκῆν, says Wordsw., 'is something more than ὑπὸ τῇ συκῇ the accusative indicates retirement thither as well as concealment there, perhaps for purposes of prayer and meditation.'"
