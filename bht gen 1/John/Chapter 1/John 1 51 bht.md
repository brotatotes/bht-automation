## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Our Lord says this not in blame, rather in praise of the simple and honest expression of Nathanael’s conviction; but principally to shew him, that if he believed by reason of this comparatively small proof of His divine power, his faith would increase from strength to strength at the greater proofs which should from that time forward be given."
2. "The glories of a period beginning from the opening of the Lord’s public ministry, and at this day not yet completed, are described. For it is not the outward visible opening of the material heavens, nor ascent and descent of angels in the sight of men, which our Lord here announces; but the series of glories which was about to be unfolded in His Person and Work from that time forward."
3. "The opening of heaven is a symbolical expression, signifying the imparting of divine grace, help, and revelation. See Genesis 28:10-17; Ezekiel 1:1; Isaiah 6:1; Malachi 3:10; Isaiah 64:1; also Deuteronomy 11:17; 1 Kings 8:35."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "To show the patriarch that though alone and friendless on earth his interests were busying all heaven, he was made to see 'heaven opened and the angels of God ascending and descending upon a' mystic 'ladder reaching from heaven to earth.'"
2. "By and by," says Jesus here, "ye shall see this communication between heaven and earth thrown wide open."
3. "And the Son of man the real Ladder of this intercourse."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The word 'amen' means 'truly, certainly, so be it' - from the Hebrew verb to confirm, to establish, to be true." 
2. "The thing shall take place, and you shall be a witness of it."
3. "By their ascending and descending upon him it is probable that he meant that Nathanael would have evidence that they came to his aid, and that he would have 'the' kind of protection and assistance from God which would show 'more fully that he was the Messiah'."

### John Calvin:
1. "They are greatly mistaken, in my opinion, who anxiously inquire into the place where, and the time when, Nathanael and others saw heaven opened; for he rather points out something perpetual which was always to exist in his kingdom."
2. "But if we duly consider what took place at that time, it is of perpetual duration; for the kingdom of God, which was formerly closed against us, is actually opened in Christ."
3. "This passage teaches us, that though the whole human race was banished from the kingdom of God, the gate of heaven is now opened to us, so that we are fellow-citizens of the saints, and companions of the angels, and that they, having been appointed to be guardians of our salvation, descend from the blessed rest of the heavenly glory to relieve our distresses."

### Philip Schaff:
1) "The formula is always employed to mark some important step in a discourse, where the words of Jesus either take some new start, or rise to some higher stage."
2) "There is real and unceasing intercourse between earth and heaven. It is to Jesus that the angels descend; it is from Him that they return to heaven; through His presence on earth this union between earth and heaven exists."
3) "We have simply a symbolical representation of the fact that through the Incarnation and sufferings of Jesus heaven is opened, is brought into the closest and most constant communion with earth, so that the latter is itself transfigured with the glory of God’s special abode."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Jesus is himself the bond of fellowship between heaven and earth, between God and man."
2. "God and man meet in Christ. He is the true Jacob's Ladder."
3. "He is more than King of Israel, he is the Son of Man (the race)."

These quotes highlight the significance of Jesus as the bridge between heaven and earth, the one who brings together God and humanity. They emphasize that Jesus is not just a king or a prophet, but the embodiment of the divine and human connection.

### John Gill:
1. "To show himself to be the 'Amen', and faithful witness, as well as more strongly to asseverate what he was about to say, he doubles the expression."
2. "There should be a clearer manifestation of heavenly truths made by his ministry; and that the way into the holiest of all should be made more manifest."
3. "It is observable, that some of the Jewish writers understand the ascent, and descent of the angels, in Genesis 28:12, to be, not upon the ladder, but upon Jacob; which makes the phrase there still more agreeable to this."

### John Wesley:
1. "Hereafter ye shall see me come in my glory, and all the angels of God with me."
2. "All of these, as well as thou, who believe on me now in my state of humiliation, shall hereafter see me."
