# John 1:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
John the Baptist was described as the precursor to the Light, the witness to the coming Dayspring from on high. While he had great light and understanding of Jesus Christ and His salvation, he was not the Light itself. John fulfilled his purpose as a burning and shining light, rejoiced by the Jews, but his role was to bear witness and prepare the way for the greater Light to come.
