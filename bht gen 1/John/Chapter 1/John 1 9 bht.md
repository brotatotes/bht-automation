# John 1:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, we learn about the true light that came into the world. It is described as the original, archetypal light, bringing illumination and understanding to all people. This true light, shining from itself, enlightens every man and serves as a steady and trustworthy guide. It is not a false or deceptive light, but rather the source of spiritual enlightenment for all, leading us towards the harbor of safety. This light is not limited to believers, but extends to all individuals, providing them with the perception of divine truth and the general lines of good and evil.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The word ἀληθινόν (see reff.) in this connexion imports original, ‘archetypal,’ and is used of the true genuine sources and patterns of those things which we find here below only in fragmentary imitations and derivations."
2. "The former construction can only be defended by a Rabbinical usage, by which כָּל בָּאֵי עוֹלָם means ‘all men’ (Schöttgen, i. 223). But it is very questionable whether John ever speaks thus."
3. "We are driven then to the only legitimate rendering, which is to take ἦν ἐρχόμενον as equivalent to an imperfect came: this usage being frequent in the N.T., see reff.: i.e. at the time when John bore this witness, the true light which lighteth every man, came was in process of manifesting Himself, into the world."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "which, coming into the world, enlighteneth every man" - This phrase emphasizes that Jesus is the Light of the world, bringing illumination and understanding to all people.
2. "Coming into the world" - This description of Jesus is a familiar and recurring theme in the writings of the Gospel of John, highlighting his divine mission and purpose.
3. "the Light of the world" - This title further emphasizes Jesus' role as the source of spiritual enlightenment and guidance for humanity.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He was not a false, uncertain, dangerous guide, but was one that was true, real, steady, and worthy of confidence."
2. "A true light is one that does not deceive us, as the true beacon may guide us into port or warn us of danger. Christ does not lead astray. All false teachers do."
3. "The true light was he who, coming into the world, enlightened every man."

### John Calvin:
1. "Christ is the light, shining from itself and by itself, and enlightening the whole world by its radiance; so that no other source or cause of splendor is anywhere to be found."
2. "He might have reasoned more ingeniously, that Christ, as the eternal light, has a splendor which is natural, and not brought from any other quarter; but instead of doing so, he sends us back to the experience which we all possess."
3. "There is no man, therefore, whom some perception of the eternal light does not reach. But as there are fanatics who rashly strain and torture this passage, so as to infer from it that the grace of illumination is equally offered to all, let us remember that the only subject here treated is the common light of nature, which is far inferior to faith."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The manifestation is in its initial stage, not yet complete. To this thought the word ‘coming’ exactly corresponds."
2. "If the words are joined with ‘man,’ they add little or nothing to the thought. ‘Every man’ is really as full and inclusive an expression as ‘every man that cometh into the world.’"
3. "The ‘true worshippers’ are those whose worship is real, not imperfect and undeserving of the name; the bread which came down from heaven is ‘the true bread,’ that of which the manna was a type, that which ministers real and abiding nourishment."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "The true light had been on hand all the time in the darkness before John came."
2. "This true light...guides to the harbor of safety."
3. "All the real light that men receive comes from Christ."

### John Gill:
1. "Christ is that light, that famous and excellent light, the fountain of all light to all creatures."
2. "He is the true light, in distinction from typical lights; the 'Urim' of the former dispensation; the candlestick, with the lamps of it; the pillar of fire which directed the Israelites by night in the wilderness."
3. "He is that light which lighteth all sorts of men; which is true in a spiritual sense...the light of nature and reason, which Christ, as the word, and Creator and light of men, gives to every man that is born into the world."

### John Wesley:
1. "By what is vulgarly termed natural conscience, pointing out at least the general lines of good and evil." 
2. "And this light, if man did not hinder, would shine more and more to the perfect day." 
3. "The light of Christ, which lighteth every man, is the true light, which lighteth every one that cometh into the world."
