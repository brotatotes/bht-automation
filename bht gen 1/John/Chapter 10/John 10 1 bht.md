3. "It is not the character of the flock, but that of the shepherd, and the relation between him and his sheep, which is here prominent."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "He that entereth not by the door—the legitimate way (without saying what that was, as yet)."
2. "climbeth up some other way—not referring to the assumption of ecclesiastical office without an external call, but to the want of a true spiritual commission, the seal of heaven going along with the outward authority."
3. "it is the assumption of the spiritual guidance of the people without this that is meant."

### Albert Barnes:

1. "Verily, verily [αμην, αμην] . The formula never begins anything quite new, but connects what follows with what precedes."
2. "The thief does not, like the shepherd, come from some well-known direction, as from his dwelling or from the pasture, but from an unknown quarter and by a road of his own."
3. "Thief - robber [κλεπτης - ληστης] . For the distinction see on Mark 11:17. There is a climax in the order of the words; one who will gain his end by craft, and, if that will not suffice, by violence."

### John Calvin:
1. "No plague is more destructive to the Church, than when wolves ravage under the garb of shepherds."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Verily, Verily (Αμην, αμην). Solemn prelude by repetition as in John 1:51. The words do not ever introduce a fresh topic... So Jesus has a direct word for them." 
2. "Originally αυλη (from αω, to blow) in Homer's time was just an uncovered space around the house enclosed by a wall, then a roofless enclosure in the country where flocks were herded... It later came to mean the house itself or palace." 
3. "One who goes up, not by the door, has to climb up over the wall... The same (εκεινος). 'That one' just described. Is a thief and a robber."

### John Gill:
1. "The design of which is to show, that Christ is the true and only shepherd, who was appointed, called, and sent of God, whose the sheep are, whose voice they hear, and know, and whom they follow."
2. "The church may be compared to a sheepfold, because it is separated from the world: it is where the people of God, and sheep of Christ are gathered together; where there is a strict union between them; have society with each other; keep one another warm and comfortable; and where they are fed and nourished, and are preserved; and where they lie down and have rest."
3. "Now he that does not come into the church of God, whether as a member of it, or officer in it, at this door, but climbeth up some other way; by hypocrisy and deceit: or, like the prophets of old, who ran and were not sent; prophesied when they were not spoken to, but took their place and post by usurpation: the same is a thief and a robber."
