### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "By this He points to His own peculiar relation to the sheep, the same as His Father's, the great Proprietor and Lord of the flock."
2. "Though faithful under-shepherds are so in their Master's interest, that they feel a measure of His own concern for their charge."
3. "Whoever comes upon the flock with hostile intent, in whatever form: though the wicked one, no doubt, is at the bottom of such movements."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "As he does not own the sheep, and guards them merely for pay, rather than risk his life he would leave the flock to the ravages of wild beasts."
2. "The word translated 'hireling' is often employed in a good sense; but here it denotes one who is unfaithful to his trust."
3. "They are those who have no boldness in the cause of their Master, but who, rather than lose their reputation or place, would see the church corrupted and wasted by its spiritual foes."

3. "Compare Dante: 'But not so much, that did not give me fear A lion's aspect which appeared to me.'"

### John Calvin:
1. "Though such persons do not serve Christ faithfully, yet we ought to hear them; for Christ wished that the Pharisees should be heard, because they sat in Moses ’seat, (Matthew 23:2;) and, in like manner, we ought to give such honor to the Gospel, as not to shrink from its ministers, though they be not good men."
2. "For how base and shameful is our indolence, if our life is more dear to us than the salvation of the Church, which Christ preferred to his own life!"
3. "But it the flock — as well as the pastor — be in danger, and if there be reason to believe that the pastor flees, not so much from a desire to promote the public advantage as from a dread of dying, Augustine contends that this is not at all lawful, because the example of his flight will do more injury than his life can do good in future."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "The hireling here is not necessarily the thief and robber... He may conceivably be a nominal shepherd (pastor) of the flock who serves only for the money." 
2. "Every true shepherd considers the sheep in his care 'his own' even if he does not actually 'own' them. The mere 'hireling' does not feel so."
3. "The cowardly hireling cares naught for the sheep, but only for his own skin."

### John Gill:
1. "By whom are meant, not the faithful ministers of the word, who live upon the Gospel, as Christ has ordained, and who are worthy of their reward, and are not to be called hirelings by way of reproach."
2. "Such an one 'seeth the wolf coming'; by whom may be meant, either Satan; so the Jews compare Israel to a flock of sheep, and Satan, they say, 'he is the wolf'; or any false prophet, or teacher, who are ravenous wolves; though sometimes in sheep's clothing; or any tyrant, oppressor, or persecutor of the saints."
3. "And fleeth; not being willing to bear any reproach or persecution, for the sake of Christ; not such a keeper of the flock as David, who went after the lion and the bear, and when they rose up against him, did not flee, but caught them by the beard and slew them; nor like the Apostle Paul, who fought with beasts at Ephesus, and would turn his back on none, nor give place, no, not for an hour, that truth might continue."

### John Wesley:
1. "He is a hireling, who would not work, were it not for the hire; to whom this is the great (if not only) motive of working."
2. "If a man who works only for hire is such a wretch, a mere thief and a robber, what is he who continually takes the hire, and yet does not work at all?"
3. "The wolf - signifies any enemy who, by force or fraud, attacks the Christian's faith, liberty, or life."

These quotes highlight the concept of a hireling, someone who works solely for the sake of the reward, and the consequences of not fulfilling one's responsibilities. They also emphasize the significance of the wolf as an enemy who seeks to harm the Christian community.
