# John 10:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the commentators emphasize the contrast between the hireling, motivated by personal gain and lacking genuine care for the flock, and the true shepherd who is the door of the sheepfold. The hireling flees in times of danger, having no commitment or love for the sheep, while the good shepherd, Jesus, provides protection and security for his followers. The hireling is solely concerned with his own interests, while the true shepherd embodies sacrificial love and concern for the well-being of the flock.
