# John 10:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, Jesus reveals that he has other sheep beyond the Jewish nation who also belong to him. His purpose is to gather them and bring them into his Church, uniting them with the existing believers. This unity is not about a physical enclosure, but about being one flock under the care and guidance of Jesus, the one true Shepherd. It is through Jesus's sacrificial love for his sheep that this unity is made possible, ensuring that no false shepherds will lead them astray.
