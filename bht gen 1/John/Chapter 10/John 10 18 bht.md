The verse described emphasizes the voluntary nature of Jesus' sacrifice and the authority he had over his own life. Commentators highlight that Jesus willingly surrendered himself and had the power to lay down his life and take it up again.

By fulfilling the commission from the Father, Jesus demonstrated his divine power and obedience to the Father's plan for salvation.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The truth of this voluntary rendering up was shewn by His whole sufferings, from the falling of His enemies to the ground in the garden (ch. Joh 18:6 ) to His last words, παρατίθεμαι τὸ πν . μου , Luke 23:46 (see note there)."

2. "His resurrection also was eminently His own work, by virtue of the Spirit of the Father dwelling in and filling Him."

2. "Here lay the glory of His sacrifice, that it was purely voluntary."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "No man taketh it from me - That is, no one could take it by force, or unless I was willing to yield myself into his hands."
