# John 10:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse being described depicts a true shepherd, recognized by God, entering through the proper door with a genuine concern for the well-being of the sheep. This shepherd is a symbol of care, protection, and guidance, leading the sheep to green pastures and still waters, providing nourishment and rest. Jesus uses this metaphor to highlight his role as the ultimate shepherd, in contrast to false shepherds who seek to deceive and exploit. He is the one who cares for and guides his followers, drawing a sharp contrast between himself and those lacking compassion.
