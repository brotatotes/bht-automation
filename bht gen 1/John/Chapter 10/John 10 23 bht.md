# John 10:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Solomon's portico, a magnificent structure on the eastern side of the temple, provided shelter and gathering space for the people. It stood as a symbol of the enduring legacy of Solomon's temple, its grandeur mirroring the power and glory of Israel. With its construction over a filled-up valley, it exemplified the transformative power of God. The portico's continued existence after Christ's death, though not the original built by Solomon, served as a tangible reminder of Israel's history and the profound connection between God and His people.
