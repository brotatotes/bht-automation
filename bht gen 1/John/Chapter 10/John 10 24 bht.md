# John 10:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The hostile Jews, fueled by their desire to undermine Jesus' credibility, demand a clear and direct answer from him regarding his identity as the Messiah. They accuse him of keeping them in doubt and purposefully hiding the truth from them. Their true intention is to use his response against him, leveraging it to accuse him as an enemy of Caesar. Their demand for a plain declaration stems not from genuine curiosity, but from a cunning strategy to strip him of his influence and authority.
