# John 10:25 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Throughout his ministry and teachings, Jesus consistently and unmistakably described himself as the Son of God, the Messiah. His words and works, including his miracles, served as powerful testimonies to his divine identity. Yet, despite the clear evidence he presented, the people still resisted and refused to believe. Jesus had already provided sufficient proof, making any further explanations or signs unnecessary. Their disbelief stemmed from their refusal to acknowledge and accept the truth that was right in front of them.
