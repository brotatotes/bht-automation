# John 10:30 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This verse, as exclaimed by various commentators, reveals a profound union between the Father and the Son, existing not only in their will and plan but also in their essence and nature. With different arguments against the Sabellians and the Arians, the commentators emphasize that the oneness of God extends beyond mere numerical unity to a fusion of their being. Despite their distinct personhood, the Father and the Son share the same divine perfections and power, evoking awe and reverence as they are portrayed not just as united, but also as intrinsically connected to one another.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Are" is in the masculine gender—"we (two persons) are"; while "one" is neuter—"one thing." Perhaps "one interest" expresses, as nearly as may be, the purport of the saying.
2. "Neither have they," says He; "though He has given them to Me, they are as much in His own almighty hands as ever—they cannot be, and when given to Me they are not, given away from Himself; for HE AND I HAVE ALL IN COMMON."
3. Thus it will be seen, that, though oneness of essence is not the precise thing here affirmed, that truth is the basis of what is affirmed, without which it would not be true. And AUGUSTINE was right in saying the "We are" condemns the Sabellians (who denied the distinction of Persons in the Godhead), while the "one" (as explained) condemns the Arians (who denied the unity of their essence).

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The word translated 'one' is not in the masculine, but in the neuter gender. It expresses union, but not the precise nature of the union."
2. "Many interpreters have understood this as referring to union of design and of plan."
3. "Most of the Christian fathers understood them, however, as referring to the oneness or unity of nature between the Father and the Son."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "One [εν]. The neuter, not the masculine eiv, one person." 
2. "It implies unity of essence, not merely of will or of power." 
3. "The oneness of God is not a numerical oneness, but a oneness of essence, a oneness of being."

### John Calvin:
1. "He intended to meet the jeers of the wicked; for they might allege that the power of God did not at all belong to him, so that he could promise to his disciples that it would assuredly protect them."

2. "He therefore testifies that his affairs are so closely united to those of the Father, that the Father’s assistance will never be withheld from himself and his sheep."

3. "For Christ does not argue about the unity of substance, but about the agreement which he has with the Father, so that whatever is done by Christ will be confirmed by the power of his Father."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Not one person, but one essence or nature."
2. "By the plural συμυς (separate persons) Sabellius is refuted, by υνυμ Arius."
3. "This crisp statement is the climax of Christ's claims concerning the relation between the Father and himself (the Son)."

### John Gill:
1. "Not in person, for the Father must be a distinct person from the Son, and the Son a distinct person from the Father... their unity of nature, and equality of power."
2. "Christ is both the Son of God, and the son of man... as the Son of God, he lay in the bosom of his Father, and was privy to all his secrets... having the same perfections of power, knowledge, etc."
3. "Considered in the relation of the Son of God, and as possessed of the same perfections with God, he and his Father are one; though as man, he is different from him, and knew not some things he did."

### John Wesley:
1. "I and the Father are one — Not by consent of will only, but by unity of power, and consequently of nature."
2. "Are — This word confutes Sabellius, proving the plurality of persons: one - This word confutes Arius, proving the unity of nature in God."
3. "Never did any prophet before, from the beginning of the world, use any one expression of himself, which could possibly be so interpreted as this and other expressions were, by all that heard our Lord speak. Therefore if he was not God he must have been the vilest of men."
