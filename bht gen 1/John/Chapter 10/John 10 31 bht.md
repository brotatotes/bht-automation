# John 10:31 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this passage, we see the intense hostility and disbelief of the Jewish leaders towards Jesus. They were so offended and enraged by his claim to be equal with God that they lifted up stones, ready to stone him as a blasphemer. This hostile reaction reflects their refusal to accept Jesus' divine authority and their hardened hearts. The conflict between Jesus and the religious leaders is evident, with their anger and rejection serving as a strong testament to the ongoing struggle between Jesus and those threatened by his teachings.

3. "Here it might very properly be rendered brought, perhaps from the works which were then going on at the temple."

### John Calvin:
1. "As true religion, in maintaining the glory of God, burns with its own zeal which the Spirit of God directs, so unbelief is the mother of rage, and the devil hurries on the wicked in such a manner, that they breathe nothing but slaughter." 

2. "This result shows with what intention they put the question to Christ; for the open confession, of which they pretended to be desirous, instantly drives them to madness." 

3. "And yet, though they are hurried along, with such violence, to oppress Christ, there can be no doubt that they assigned some plausible reason for their judgment, as if they were acting according to the injunction of the Law, by which God commands that false prophets shall be stoned."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Their view of the blasphemy of His words is given more fully in John 10:33."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "They wanted to kill him also when he made himself equal to God in John 5:18."
