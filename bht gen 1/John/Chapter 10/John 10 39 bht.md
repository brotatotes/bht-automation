# John 10:39 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, Jesus is faced with a hostile crowd who continuously sought to seize him and accuse him of blasphemy, despite His powerful words and actions. He miraculously escaped their grasp, leaving them in awe but still filled with anger. The Jews' relentless pursuit and Jesus' ability to walk away unharmed emphasized the divine power at work in Him and the fulfillment of His purpose. Jesus' escape highlighted the restraining hand of God, protecting him from the lawless passions of his enemies.
