## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The reference to John 1:28 suggests that this verse is connected to the ministry of John the Baptist, who was baptizing and preaching in the region of Bethany beyond the Jordan. This context helps us understand the significance of Jesus' words and actions in this passage."

2. "The phrase 'they stayed with him that day' implies a deep level of personal connection and relationship. It speaks to the intimacy and trust that the disciples had in Jesus, as they desired to spend more time with him and learn from him."

3. "The mention of the tenth hour in this verse is significant. In Jewish timekeeping, the day was divided into twelve hours, with the first hour being sunrise. The tenth hour would then be around 4 p.m. This detail adds a sense of urgency to the disciples' decision to stay with Jesus, as it suggests that they were so captivated by him that they lost track of time."

4. "The phrase 'come and see' is a recurring theme in the Gospel of John. It is an invitation to experience and encounter Jesus for oneself, rather than relying solely on the testimony of others. It encourages a personal and transformative encounter with Jesus, inviting individuals to explore and discover the truth of who he is."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The fact that Jesus went away again beyond the Jordan to the place where John first baptized is significant. It shows that Jesus was intentionally retracing his steps and returning to the place where his ministry began. This highlights the continuity between John's ministry and Jesus' ministry, and emphasizes the importance of John's role in preparing the way for Jesus."

2. "By going back to the place where John first baptized, Jesus is reminding his disciples and the people of the significance of baptism. It is a symbol of repentance and a turning away from sin. Jesus is calling his followers to remember their own baptism and to live lives of repentance and obedience to God."

3. "The location of Jesus' ministry is not accidental. By going beyond the Jordan, Jesus is intentionally reaching out to the marginalized and forgotten. He is showing that his message of salvation is for all people, regardless of their social status or background. This challenges us to extend the love and grace of God to those who are often overlooked or excluded."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The location of John's baptism holds significance as it was not just any ordinary place, but Bethabara or Bethany. This adds depth to the narrative, as these were places associated with important biblical events and figures, such as the crossing of the Jordan River by the Israelites and the residence of Lazarus. It suggests that John's baptism was not just a random act, but part of a larger divine plan." 

2. "By choosing to baptize at Bethabara, John was intentionally connecting his ministry to the rich history of God's redemptive work. This highlights the continuity between the Old and New Testaments, emphasizing that John's baptism was not a new invention, but a continuation of God's covenant relationship with His people." 

3. "The choice of location also underscores the symbolic nature of baptism. Just as the Israelites crossed the Jordan River to enter the Promised Land, those who were baptized by John were symbolically crossing over from a life of sin and bondage to a new life in God's kingdom. It signifies a radical transformation and a commitment to follow God's ways."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Beyond Jordan" refers to the region called Peroea, which was on the east side of the river. It was the ancient possession of Gad and Reuben, and it corresponds to the region around Jordan in a broader sense. (Commentary on location)

2. The phrase "beyond Jordan" signifies a movement from one side of the river to the other, indicating a transition or crossing over. (Commentary on symbolism)

3. The mention of "beyond Jordan" in this verse highlights the significance of crossing over into a new territory, both geographically and spiritually. It reminds us of the Israelites crossing the Jordan River to enter the Promised Land, signifying a new chapter in their journey. (Commentary on spiritual significance)

### John Calvin:
1. "Christ passed beyond Jordan, that he might not have to fight continually without any advantage." 
2. "He has therefore taught us, by his example, that we ought to avail ourselves of opportunities, when they occur." 
3. "As to the place of his retreat, the reader may consult the observations which I have made at Chapter 1, verse 28."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The Evangelist here pauses before relating the last struggle, and leads his readers to survey with him all the period of the ministry of Him to whom John bore witness." 
2. "Whatever Jesus had since done or said ratified the witness borne by the Baptist."
3. "Possibly it was because of John’s testimony that Jesus sought this spot: near it may have lived many whose hearts had been prepared for His teaching."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Παλιν does not mean that the other visit was a recent one."
2. "Here the identical language of John 1:28 is used with the mere addition of το πρωτον (οπου ην Ιωανης βαπτιζων, 'where John was baptizing')."
3. "Probably from here Jesus carried on the first part of the later Perean Ministry (Luke 13:22-16) before the visit to Bethany at the raising of Lazarus (John 11:1-44)."
