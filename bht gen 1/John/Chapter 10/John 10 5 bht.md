# John 10:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the Bible describes a scenario where the true followers of God are warned against listening to false shepherds, who are described as strangers or aliens. These imposters, not recognized by the true Shepherd, seek personal gain rather than the well-being of the flock. The faithful sheep, well-trained by their shepherd, instinctively flee from these outsiders, as they neither approve nor benefit from their teachings. These discerning sheep have a deep understanding of the voice of their true Shepherd and reject the voices of those who do not align with his nature and purpose.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The ἀλλότριος is not the shepherd of another section of the flock, but an alien: the λῃστής of John 10:1." 
2. "τῶν ἀλλ. is generic, as in E. V. Meyer takes it as merely meaning a stranger, one who is not their Shepherd."
3. "This hardly seems strong enough for the context."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Jesus by this indicates that the true people of God will not follow false teachers - those who are proud, haughty, and self-seeking, as were the Pharisees."
2. "A church learns to put confidence in a pastor; he knows the wants of his people, sees their danger, and can adapt his instructions to them."
3. "The shepherd goes before, not merely to point out the way, but to see that it is practicable and safe. He is armed in order to defend his charge, and in this he is very courageous."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The ‘stranger’ is not one to whom the porter has opened... he must therefore have entered by some other way, and he is in the fold as ‘a thief and a robber.’" 

2. "No mark of a true shepherd is found in him. He has not entered by the door, and he has not been recognised by the keeper of the door." 

3. "His object is not their good, but his own spoil and gain. Lead a flock forth he cannot; the sheep flee from him."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "A stranger (αλλοτριω). Literally, 'One belonging to another'... not necessarily the thief and robber."
2. "They simply will not follow such a man or woman, these well-trained sheep will not."
3. "Alas and alas, if only our modern pastors had the sheep (old and young) so trained that they would run away from and not run after the strange voices that call them to false philosophy, false psychology, false ethics, false religion, false life."

### John Gill:
1. "A stranger will they not follow... but will flee from him." 
2. "They do not approve of their doctrine, nor take any delight in it, or receive any profit from it." 
3. "Neither will the lambs ever go after strange sheep, and if they see [them], they will flee [from them]."

### John Wesley:
1. "They will not follow a stranger — One whom Christ hath not sent, who doth not answer the preceding description."
2. "Him they will not follow - And who can constrain them to it? But will flee from him - As from the plague."
3. "For they know not the voice of strangers — They cannot relish it; it is harsh and grating to them. They find nothing of God therein."
