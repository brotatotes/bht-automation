# John 10:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this passage, a parabolic allegory is presented, though not explicitly referred to as a parable. The listeners, particularly the Pharisees, lacked understanding and failed to comprehend the intended message. Through the use of lively figures and plain language, Jesus spoke in a way that required deeper insight and spiritual discernment. Despite the clear terms used, their hardened hearts and prejudices against Christ hindered their understanding of his teachings.
