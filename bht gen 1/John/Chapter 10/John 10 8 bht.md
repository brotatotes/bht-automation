## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Remember the connexion of these discourses. He has taught the Jews that Abraham and the Prophets entered by Him: but He has set in strong opposition to Himself and His, them (these Jews) and their father, the Devil."
2. "However the sheep may for a while listen to these false shepherds, they do not hear them, so as to follow them. Those who do, belong not to the true flock."
3. "He is here set in opposition to ὁ κλέπτης, and thus insensibly passes into the place of a ποιμήν, who has been hitherto thus opposed. Then the ζωὴν ἔχωσιν binds on to νομὴν εὑρήσει and καὶ περισὶ ἔχ.: q. d. not merely as a door to pass through, but actively, abundantly, to bestow abundance of life."

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "All that ever came before me—the false prophets; not as claiming the prerogatives of Messiah, but as perverters of the people from the way of life, all pointing to Him." 

2. "The sheep did not hear them—the instinct of their divinely taught hearts preserving them from seducers, and attaching them to the heaven-sent prophets."

3. "The Spirit of Christ was in them."

### Albert Barnes:

2. "Thieves and robbers...This had been the general character of the Pharisees and scribes. They sought wealth, office, ease at the expense of the people, and thus deserved the character of thieves and robbers."
3. "The sheep - The people of God - the pious and humble portion of the Jewish nation. Though the great mass of the people were corrupted, yet there were always some who were the humble and devoted people of God."

### John Calvin:
1. "Christ testifies that all the doctrines, by which the world has been led away from him, are so many deadly plagues; because, apart from him, there is nothing but destruction and horrible confusion."
2. "He now confirms more clearly what he had already spoken more obscurely and in the figure of an allegory, that they who were led out of the way by impostors did not belong to the Church of God."
3. "Christ declares that they who are called into the order of believers are so firmly bound together, that they cannot stray or wander, or be carried about by any wind of new doctrine."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "In the similitude of the door, Jesus had declared that it was through Him alone that the flocks could come out of the Jewish fold into the pastures into which they had longed to enter; and this was a truth not depending only upon His proclamation of it, but lying in the very essence of the Old Testament dispensation."
2. "But those who trusted in God and waited patiently for Him were kept by Him from these deceivers: ‘the sheep did not hear them.’"
3. "The meaning of the words must extend much farther, and must embrace all who had sought to turn the people from waiting for the promise which God had given, or had substituted other principles of national life for the hope of the Messiah."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Jesus refers to the false Messiahs and self-appointed leaders who made havoc of the flock."
2. "These are the thieves and robbers, not the prophets and sincere teachers of old."
3. "They keep on coming, these wolves in sheep's clothing, who grow rich by fooling the credulous sheep."

### John Gill:

2. "The elect of God, some of which there were in all ages, though their number is comparatively few, did not attend to the false prophets, and false teachers, and idol shepherds."
3. "It is not possible that these should be finally and totally deceived, or carried away with the error of the wicked."

### John Wesley:
1. "Whosoever are come — Independently of me, assuming any part of my character, pretending, like your elders and rabbis, to a power over the consciences of men, attempting to make laws in the Church, and to teach their own traditions as the way of salvation..."
2. "All those prophets and expounders of God's word, that enter not by the door of the sheepfold, but run before I have sent them by my Spirit."
3. "Our Lord seems in particular to speak of those that had undertaken this office since he began his ministry, are thieves - Stealing temporal profit to themselves, and robbers - Plundering and murdering the sheep."
