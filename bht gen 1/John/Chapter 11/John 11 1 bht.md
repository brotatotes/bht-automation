# John 11:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this well-known Bible verse, we are transported to the village of Bethany, distinguished from another Bethany, east of Mount Olivet. In this village lived Mary and Martha, two well-known women from the apostolic teaching. Bethany holds a unique position, being located near Jerusalem, where Jesus performed a remarkable resurrection miracle, raising a man named Lazarus. This miracle not only displayed Jesus' divine power but also foreshadowed our future resurrection. The scene of this miracle is Bethany, a small village south-east of Jerusalem, and the home of Mary and Martha, who were born there or at least lived there.
