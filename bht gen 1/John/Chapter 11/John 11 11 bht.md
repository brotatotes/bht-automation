# John 11:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, Jesus refers to Lazarus as having "fallen asleep," using sleep as a metaphor for death. The disciples initially misunderstand this metaphor, not realizing that Lazarus is dead. Jesus, however, speaks with divine knowledge of Lazarus' death and His power to awaken him from this sleep. His use of metaphor conveys both comfort to the disciples and a deeper understanding of the meaning of death and resurrection.

### Henry Alford:
1. "Quanta humanitate Jesus amicitiam suam cum discipulis communicat!" Bengel. (Translation: "How much humanity Jesus shares his friendship with his disciples!" Bengel.) 
2. "And the ἡμῶν gives a reason why they should go too." 
3. "But the former οὐ πρός θάν. had not been understood, and that error ruled in their minds."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Our friend Lazarus." To Abraham only is it accorded in the Old Testament, and not till after his death, to which our attention is called in the New Testament.
2. "The phrase here employed, 'our friend Lazarus,' means more than 'he whom Thou lovest' in John 11:3, for it implies that Christ's affection was reciprocated by Lazarus."
3. The symbol of "sleep" for death is common to all languages, and familiar to us in the Old Testament. In the New Testament, however, a higher meaning is put into it, in relation to believers in Jesus.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The word 'sleep' is applied to death" - This phrase highlights the metaphorical use of the word "sleep" to refer to death in the Bible. It suggests that death is not the end, but rather a temporary state of rest before resurrection or eternal life.

2. "Lazarus sleepeth" - This quote emphasizes the gentle and peaceful nature of death as described in the verse. It implies that death is not something to be feared or dreaded, but rather a state of tranquility and repose.

3. "Is dead" - This simple statement serves as a reminder of the finality and inevitability of death. It underscores the reality that Lazarus has passed away and sets the stage for the miraculous resurrection that follows in the biblical narrative.

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Sleepeth [κεκοιμηται] . More correctly, as Rev., hath fallen asleep." 
2. "Awake him out of sleep [εξυπνισω αυτον] . Only here in the New Testament." 
3. "See on Acts 7:60; 2 Peter 3:4."

### John Calvin:
1. "Our friend Lazarus sleepeth." - This statement by Jesus serves to comfort his disciples and prepare them for the news of Lazarus' death, while also hinting at the hope of resurrection to come.

2. "Having formerly asserted that the disease was not deadly... he now informs them also that Lazarus is dead." - Jesus' previous statement about the illness not being unto death was not a denial of Lazarus' death, but rather a declaration of the ultimate purpose of the situation - to bring glory to God through the resurrection.

3. "It is a proof of amazing ignorance, that they believe that Christ spoke about sleep." - The disciples' misunderstanding of Jesus' metaphorical language regarding sleep reveals their lack of familiarity with the common scriptural use of this metaphor, highlighting their need for further spiritual understanding.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "These things said he: and after that he saith unto them." - This shows the sequential nature of Jesus' words, emphasizing the importance and intention behind His statement.
2. "Our friend Lazarus hath fallen asleep; but I go, that I may awake him out of sleep." - Jesus uses the metaphor of sleep to refer to Lazarus' death, highlighting His power to bring him back to life.
3. "No second message has been sent to Him; by His own Divine knowledge He speaks of the death of His friend." - This emphasizes Jesus' omniscience and divine understanding, as He speaks of Lazarus' death without receiving any prior message.

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Fallen asleep (κεκοιμητα). Perfect passive indicative of κοιμαω, old verb to put to sleep. Common as a metaphor for death like our cemetery."
2. "I go (πορευομα). Futuristic use of the present tense as in John 14:2."
3. "That I may awake him out of sleep (ινα εξυπνισω αυτον). Purpose clause with ινα and the first aorist active subjunctive of εξυπνιζω, a late compound (εξ, υπνος, sleep) for the older αφυπνιζω, here only in the N.T. See Job 14:12 where also it occurs along with κοιμαομα."

### John Gill:
1. "Our friend Lazarus sleepeth; meaning, that he was dead; in which sense the word is often used in the Old Testament, and in the common dialect of the Jews, and frequently in their writings; and especially it is so used of good men."
2. "It is usual to say of the righteous, that there is no death in them, but sleep."
3. "These words respecting Lazarus's sleeping and awaking, express both the omniscience and omnipotence of Christ; his omniscience, that he should know that Lazarus was dead; when at such a distance from him; and his omnipotence, that he could raise him from the dead; and yet his great modesty to signify it in such covert language, though not difficult to be understood."

### John Wesley:
1. "Our friend Lazarus sleepeth — This he spoke, just when he died."
2. "Such is the death of good men in the language of heaven."
3. "And the slowness of our understanding makes the Scripture often descend to our barbarous manner of speaking."
