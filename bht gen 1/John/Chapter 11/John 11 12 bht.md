# John 11:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The commentators emphasize the disciples' understanding of sleep and their limited perception of Lazarus' condition. While sleep is seen as a sign of recovery and health, the disciples fail to comprehend the gravity of the situation. They question the need to go to Judea, suggesting a lack of faith in Jesus' healing power and a desire to avoid potential danger. In their ignorance, they overlook Jesus' ability to awaken and restore those who are asleep.
