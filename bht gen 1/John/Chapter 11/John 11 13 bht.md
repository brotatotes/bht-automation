# John 11:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, Jesus speaks of his death with the phrase "our friend Lazarus," illustrating the reciprocal affection between him and Lazarus. The use of the metaphor of sleep for death employs a common concept, but with a higher meaning in relation to believers in Jesus. The disciples misunderstood this metaphor, thinking that Jesus was referring to a mere physical rest, showcasing their limited comprehension of the spiritual truth Jesus was conveying and their unawareness of his impending sacrifice.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Our friend Lazarus." To Abraham only is it accorded in the Old Testament... to which our attention is called in the New Testament.
2. "The phrase here employed, 'our friend Lazarus,' means more than 'he whom Thou lovest' in John 11:3, for it implies that Christ's affection was reciprocated by Lazarus."
3. The symbol of "sleep" for death is common to all languages, and familiar to us in the Old Testament. In the New Testament, however, a higher meaning is put into it, in relation to believers in Jesus.

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Taking rest [κοιμησεως] . Akin to the verb in ver. 11 Wyc., the sleeping of sleep." 
2. "Tyndale's Version of the New Testament, the natural sleep." 
3. "The phrase 'taking rest' implies a state of peaceful repose and tranquility."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The figure can hardly have been here used by Jesus for the first time."
2. "The misconception of His meaning would seem to have arisen from His words in John 11:4."
3. "...and from His delay in setting out for Bethany."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "The disciples had misunderstood Christ's metaphor for death."
2. "Present active indicative retained in indirect discourse after the secondary tense."
3. "Only use of κοιμησις (from κοιμαω) in the N.T., but it also was used of death (Sirach 46:19)."

### John Gill:
1. "Jesus spake of his death" - This phrase highlights the deeper meaning behind Jesus' words, emphasizing that he was referring to his impending death. It reminds us that Jesus was aware of his sacrificial mission and was preparing his disciples for what was to come.

2. "Under the figurative phrase of sleeping" - This quote emphasizes the metaphorical language Jesus used to describe his death as "sleeping." It suggests that Jesus saw death as a temporary state, akin to sleep, and foreshadows his resurrection. This metaphor adds depth to our understanding of Jesus' perspective on his own death.

3. "They thought that he had spoken of taking of rest in sleep" - This statement reveals the disciples' misunderstanding of Jesus' words. It highlights their limited comprehension and inability to grasp the true significance of what Jesus was trying to convey. It serves as a reminder that spiritual truths can often be misunderstood or misinterpreted by those who are not spiritually attuned.
