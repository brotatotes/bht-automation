# John 11:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the straightforwardness and clarity of the statement is emphasized, highlighting the finality and completed nature of death. Despite using a simple metaphor that should have been easily understood, the disciples were unable to grasp its meaning due to their present state of mind. With patience and without reproach, Jesus plainly tells them that Lazarus has already passed away. It showcases Christ's astonishing patience and generosity in bearing with their ignorance and serves as a foreshadowing of his own resurrection.
