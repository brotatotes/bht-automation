# John 11:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we witness the contrasting behavior of two sisters who each respond to the news of Jesus' approaching arrival in distinct ways. One sister, Martha, enthusiastically takes the initiative to go and meet Him, eager in her energy and activity. Meanwhile, her sister Mary remains seated quietly in the house, seemingly absorbed and unaware of the imminent presence of Jesus. These different postures and responses highlight the unique traits and characteristics of each sister, inviting us to consider their individual perspectives and emotional states in this moment of anticipation.
