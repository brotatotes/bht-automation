# John 11:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The sender of the message, filled with love and confidence in Jesus, simply states the urgent need for healing without explicitly asking Him to come. Commentators note that this demonstrates a deep understanding of Christ's love and power. Jesus had a special affection for Lazarus, similar to the love shared between Him and His disciple John. It is understood that those who are loved by Christ may experience difficulties in life as part of his divine plan. These words highlight the importance of turning to Jesus, the ultimate healer, in times of distress.
