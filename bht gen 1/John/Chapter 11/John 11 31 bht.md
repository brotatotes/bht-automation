# John 11:31 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, we see the custom in the East where people would loudly wail and lament at funerals, as described in Lamartine's "Pilgrimage to the Holy Land." The first days of mourning among the Jews were observed with great solemnity and many ceremonies of grief, and it was common for people to visit graves to seek mercy, pray, and study the law as a sign of respect to the deceased. Although the intentions behind going to the tomb were varied, the crowd accompanying Mary had no thought of meeting Jesus, unaware of the glorious miracle that would follow.
