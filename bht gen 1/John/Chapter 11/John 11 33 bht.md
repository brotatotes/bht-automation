# John 11:33 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this particular Bible verse, we witness Jesus experiencing a deep and profound emotional response. His genuine sympathy and love for others are evident as he restrains his tears and delicately checks his rising emotions. Jesus' inner turmoil is a result of both his compassion for those around him and his own profound grief and indignation over sin and unbelief. This display of genuine humanity showcases Jesus' ability to relate to our sorrows and troubles, as he willingly embraces the emotional burden placed upon him.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Jesus, with the tears of sympathy already rising and overcoming His speech, checked them, so as to be able to speak the words following."
2. "I would thus divest the self-restraint of all stoical and unworthy character, and consider it as merely physical, requiring indeed an act of the will, and a self-troubling, a complication of feeling, but implying no deliberate disapproval of the rising emotion."
3. "Indignation over unbelief and sin, and death the fruit of sin, doubtless lay in the background; but to see it in the words seems unnatural."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The tears of Mary and her friends acting sympathetically upon Jesus, and drawing forth His emotions. What a vivid and beautiful outcoming of His 'real' humanity!"
2. "The word here rendered 'groaned' does not mean 'sighed' or 'grieved,' but rather 'powerfully checked his emotion'—made a visible effort to restrain those tears which were ready to gush from His eyes."
3. "And was troubled—rather, 'troubled himself' (Margin); referring probably to this visible difficulty of repressing His emotions."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He groaned in the spirit...denoting violent agitation of mind. Here it also evidently denotes violent agitation - not from anger, but from grief."
2. "He saw the sorrow of others, and he was also moved with sympathy and love."
3. "The word here...does not mean that utterance was given to the internal emotion, but that it was deep and agitating, though internal."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The word for groaned occurs three times elsewhere: Matthew 9:30; Mark 1:43; Mark 14:5. In every case, it expresses a charge or remonstrance, accompanied with a feeling of displeasure."
2. "The interpretation which explains tw pneumati as the sphere of feeling is to be preferred."
3. "The nature of the particular emotion of Jesus must remain largely a matter of conjecture."

### John Calvin:
1. "He gives proof that he has sympathy, (συμπάθεια.)"
2. "He intended to show that he accomplished it with warmth and earnestness."
3. "Christ, though otherwise tranquil and free from all passion, brought groaning and grief upon himself of his own accord."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "There is little doubt that the first word describing the emotion of Jesus denotes rather anger than sorrow." 

2. "The only other passage in the New Testament in which we find the word is John 11:38 of this chapter. That we are to understand it as implying anger seems thus to be clear." 

3. "The meaning of chap. John 13:21, where a similar expression occurs, is substantially the same: there we read that, at the thought of the presence of sin, of such evil as was about to show itself in His betrayal by Judas, Jesus was ‘troubled’ (that is, agitated, disturbed) ‘in His spirit.’"

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Mary's weeping was genuine, that of the Jews was partly perfunctory and professional and probably actual 'wailing'." 
2. "He groaned in the spirit...to snort with anger like a horse...the notion of indignation is present." 
3. "His sympathy with the weeping sister and the wailing crowd caused this deep emotion."

### John Gill:
1. "He groaned in the spirit; in his human soul; and which shows, that he had a real human soul, subject to passions, though sinless ones."
2. "The word signifies an inward motion of the mind, through indignation and anger; and it may be partly at the weakness of Mary's faith, and at her immoderate sorrow; and partly at the hypocrisy of the Jews."
3. "His human soul being touched with a fellow feeling of their griefs and sorrows."

### John Wesley:
1. "He groaned — So he restrained his tears. So he stopped them soon after, John 11:38."
2. "He troubled himself — An expression amazingly elegant, and full of the highest propriety."
3. "For the affections of Jesus were not properly passions, but voluntary emotions, which were wholly in his own power."
