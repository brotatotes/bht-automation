# John 11:34 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus, with deep sympathies and composure, asked where Lazarus was buried, not out of ignorance, but to lead those around him to witness the miracle about to unfold. Restraining himself from immediately going to the burial site, Jesus manifested his humanity and omniscience, ensuring there was no doubt of trickery and drawing the Jews to be witnesses of the impending resurrection.
