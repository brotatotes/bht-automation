# John 11:37 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, commentators describe a scene where some spectators express suspicion and doubt while discussing Jesus' abilities. They refer to a previous miracle where Jesus restored sight to a blind man, questioning why he couldn't have prevented the death of Lazarus. The commentators highlight the people's belief in Jesus' power to perform miracles, but also their lack of understanding and disbelief in his ability to bring the dead back to life. This mixed response showcases the paradoxical nature of human faith and unbelief.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "The former exclamation came from the better-feeling portion of the spectators; this betokens a measure of suspicion."
2. "It hardly goes the length of attesting the miracle on the blind man; but 'if (as everybody says) He did that, why could He not also have kept Lazarus alive?'"
3. "But this disposition to dictate to divine power, and almost to peril our confidence in it upon its doing our bidding, is not confined to men of no faith."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Referring to the restoration of the blind man in ch. 9."
2. "This saying of the Jews may have been uttered ironically, in which case it throws light on the meaning of groaned in the spirit (ver. 33) and of groaning in Himself in the next verse."
3. "But the words may have been spoken sincerely."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "The opening of the blind man's eyes had made a lasting impression on some of these Jews, for it was done three months ago."
2. "These Jews share the view expressed by Martha and Mary that Jesus could have prevented the death of Lazarus."
3. "They do not say 'can,' but clearly the opening of the blind man's eyes had made a lasting impression on some of these Jews."

### John Gill:
1. "And some of them said,.... Who were averse to him, and bore him a secret grudge, and were willing to put the worst construction on every action of his." 

2. "Could not this man which opened the eyes of the blind; as it is said, at least pretended, that he did, John 9:6, for this must be understood as calling the miracle into question, and as a sneer upon it, and not as taking it for granted that so it was." 

3. "But this reasoning, as specious as it may seem, was very fallacious; for he that cured the man born blind could raise Lazarus from the dead, which he intended; and therefore did not prevent his death, that he might still give more joy to the family, bring more glory to God, and himself, and more shame and confusion to his enemies."
