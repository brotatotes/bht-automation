# John 11:38 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, there is a scene where Jesus, filled with a mix of sorrow and indignation, approaches a sepulcher, preparing for a challenge. The entrance is closed with a stone, commonly used to guard against wild beasts but also emphasizing the reluctance of a sister to expose her brother's corrupted body. The cave itself is a significant burial place, with historical connections to the patriarchs and their wives, and its physical characteristics as a cave in rocks, either natural or man-made, adds to its importance.
