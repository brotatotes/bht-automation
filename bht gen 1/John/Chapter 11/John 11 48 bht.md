# John 11:48 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse describes the fear of the religious leaders towards Jesus, as they believed that if people continued to believe in him and view him as the Messiah, it would lead to political repercussions. They feared that the Romans would see this as a rebellion and respond by destroying the temple and the nation. The commentators also emphasize the missed opportunity for the leaders to recognize Jesus as a prophet of God and the potential consequences of their actions.
