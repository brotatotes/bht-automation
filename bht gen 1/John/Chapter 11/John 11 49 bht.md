# John 11:49 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In a significant year, during the high priesthood that was meant to be for life but had become an annual appointment by the king, a man devoid of conscience and restraint takes the lead at a meeting. In a bold and haughty manner, he accuses the others of knowing nothing, urging them to act swiftly. This man's role in the events that would come to pass connects him to the sacrifice of Christ, as he becomes a part of the plan to accomplish His death.
