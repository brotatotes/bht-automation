# John 11:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we see the depth of Jesus' personal relationships, as demonstrated by his love for Martha, Mary, and Lazarus. The use of the word "loved" emphasizes a deep and genuine affection towards them, different from any other kind of love. This love is a powerful example of Christ's personal attachment to specific individuals, refuting any notion that the Gospel lacks a focus on private friendships. The expectation of the sisters and their deep faith in Jesus' healing power further reveal the profound bond between them and Christ.

### John Calvin:
1. "As Christ is the only mirror of the grace of God, we are taught by this delay on his part, that we ought not to judge of the love of God from the condition which we see before our eyes."
2. "When we have prayed to him, he often delays his assistance, either that he may increase still more our ardor in prayer, or that he may exercise our patience, and, at the same time, accustom us to obedience."
3. "Let believers then implore the assistance of God, but let them also learn to suspend their desires, if he does not stretch out his hand for their assistance as soon as they may think that necessity requires; for, whatever may be his delay, he never sleeps, and never forgets his people."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "This simple record of His love for this family connects itself both with John 11:4 and also with the statement of John 11:5-6, these verses really constituting one sentence."
2. "The object of the Evangelist is to set before us the mind of Jesus: in John 11:4 we see the first principle of all, supreme regard to the glory of God; here His love for those on whom the affliction must fall."
