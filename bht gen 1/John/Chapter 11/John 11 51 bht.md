# John 11:51 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we find the high priest Caiaphas unwittingly prophesying about the imminent death of Jesus. His words were driven not by his own intentions, but by the Spirit of God. Though Caiaphas meant it as a political expediency, his statement carries divine significance, revealing the predetermined plan of Jesus' sacrifice as foretold by the prophets. This serves as a poignant demonstration of God's love for humanity, as Jesus willingly gave his life to bring salvation to all.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "He meant nothing more than that the way to prevent the apprehended ruin of the nation was to make a sacrifice of the Disturber of their peace."
2. "But in giving utterance to this suggestion of political expediency, he was so guided as to give forth a divine prediction of deep significance."
3. "God so ordered it that it should come from the lips of the high priest for that memorable year, the recognized head of God's visible people, whose ancient office, symbolized by the Urim and Thummim, was to decide in the last resort, all vital questions as the oracle of the divine will."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Though he uttered what proved to be a true prophecy, yet it was accomplished in a way which he did not intend."
2. "Great importance was attached to the opinion of the high priest by the Jews, because it was by him that the judgment by Urim and Thummim was formerly declared in cases of importance and difficulty."
3. "His death, so far from saving them in the sense in which the high priest understood it, was the very occasion of their destruction."

### John Calvin:
1. "Caiaphas might be said, at that time, to have two tongues; for he vomited out the wicked and cruel design of putting Christ to death, which he had conceived in his mind; but God turned his tongue to a different purpose, so that, under ambiguous words, he likewise uttered a prediction."
2. "God intended that the heavenly oracle should proceed from the high priest’s seat, that the Jews might have less excuse. For, though not one person in the whole assembly had his conscience moved, yet they afterwards perceived that their insensibility was not entitled to forgiveness."
3. "The whole of our salvation consists in this, that Christ should assemble us into one; for in this way he reconciles us to the Father, in whom is the fountain of life. Hence, also, we infer, that the human race is scattered and estranged from God, until the children of God are assembled under Christ their Head."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Not wholly of himself, John means. There was more in what Caiaphas said than he understood."
2. "But certainly unconscious prophecy on his part and purely accidental. Caiaphas meant only what was mean and selfish."
3. "Imperfect active of μελλω in indirect discourse instead of the usual present retained after a secondary tense (επροφητευσεν) as sometimes occurs."

Note: The provided commentary is incomplete and lacks context. It is advisable to provide a complete commentary for a more accurate understanding of the verse.

### John Gill:
1. "Not of his own devising and dictating, but by the Spirit of God."
2. "Jesus the true Messiah must die; this was determined in the counsel of God, agreed to by Christ in the covenant of grace, foretold by the prophets from the beginning of the world."
3. "A strong expression, and a demonstrative proof of his love to them."
