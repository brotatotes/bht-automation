# John 11:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the midst of the tension between love and delay, Jesus deliberately chose to wait before going to Lazarus, knowing fully well that Lazarus was already dead. He remained where he was for two days, allowing the situation to reach its worst before performing the miracle. Jesus' actions displayed His glory, tested the faith of Lazarus' sisters, and ultimately resulted in a greater manifestation of His love and tenderness towards His friends. The waiting, the delay, and the deliberate timing all served a divine purpose to demonstrate the power and compassion of Jesus.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Having then said this, although He loved, &c., He abode," - This quote highlights the tension between Jesus' love for Lazarus and his decision to wait before going to him. It emphasizes the deliberate nature of Jesus' actions.

2. "In all probability Lazarus was dead," - This quote suggests that Lazarus was already dead when Jesus spoke the words in John 11:4. It adds a sense of urgency and foreshadows the miracle that is about to take place.

3. "Or at all events before the messenger returned." - This quote implies that Lazarus had already died by the time the messenger was sent to Jesus. It underscores the fact that Jesus knew about Lazarus' condition even before receiving the message.

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Beyond all doubt this was just to let things come to their worst, in order to display His glory."
2. "But the ways of divine are not as the ways of human love. Often they are the reverse."
3. "When His people are sick, in body or spirit; when their case is waxing more and more desperate every day; when all hope of recovery is about to expire—just then and therefore it is that 'He abides two days still in the same place where He is.'"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He abode two days - Probably Lazarus died soon after the messengers left him. Jesus knew that (John 11:11), and did not hasten to Judea, but remained two days longer where he was, that there might not be the possibility of doubt that he was dead, so that when he came there he had been dead four days, John 11:39."

2. "This shows, moreover, that he intended to raise him up. If he had not, it could hardly be reconciled with friendship thus to remain, without any reason, away from an afflicted family."

3. "Where he was - At Bethabara John 1:28; John 10:40, about 30 miles from Bethany. This was about a day’s journey, and it renders it probable that Lazarus died soon after the message was sent."

### Philip Schaff:

1. "Though Christ had heard that Lazarus was sick, and by such good hands, a message being sent him by his sisters, to acquaint him with it; and though he had such a very great love for him, and the whole family, yet he did not go directly to him, and to his assistance." 

2. "This he did to try the faith and patience of the sisters of Lazarus, and that the miracle of raising him from the dead might be the more manifest, and his own glory might be the more illustrious." 

3. "Yet equal, if not greater tenderness and love be shown to his friends."
