# John 12:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Six days prior to a significant Jewish holiday, Jesus arrived in Bethany, strategically placing Himself near Jerusalem. The act of raising Lazarus from the dead not only demonstrated Jesus' power over death and His divine authority, but also fulfilled prophecies. As the Sabbath approached, Jesus deliberately timed His actions, preparing for His sacrificial death. The mention of the Sabbath and the proximity to the Passover highlight the adherence to religious customs and the intentional nature of Jesus' arrival.
