As the crowd witnessed Jesus' teachings and actions, they began to withdraw and separate themselves from their previous beliefs and allegiances, recognizing the power and truth in His words. Their departure signified a shift in allegiance, as they turned away from their former party and embraced Jesus and His message. This movement posed a potential threat to the established religious leaders, as more and more people were being drawn to Jesus and aligning themselves with Him.
