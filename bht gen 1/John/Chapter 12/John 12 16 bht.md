# John 12:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Amidst the events unfolding, the disciples found themselves in a state of confusion, lacking understanding of their implications. The mention of prophetic citations raised the importance of the Holy Spirit's illumination in their comprehension. Gradually, their ignorance was remedied as they witnessed the fulfillment of predictions and realized the connection between these occurrences and the Scriptures. The disciples' initial confusion culminated in a gradual realization that their actions and the sufferings of Christ were part of a greater divine plan, which they were able to perceive through the combined influence of experience and the Word of God.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Important, as shewing that this, and probably other prophetic citations under similar circumstances, were the effect of the light poured into the minds of the Apostles by the Holy Spirit after the Ascension."
2. "ταῦτα ἐποίησαν αὐτῷ viz. the going out to meet Him, strewing clothes and branches in the way, and shouting ‘Hosanna’ before Him: also perhaps, the setting Him on the ass, implied in the concise narrative."
3. "Notice the thrice-repeated ταῦτα, each time signifying ‘this which was written by the Prophet,’ ‘the above citation.’"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

3. "Showed them that they, and all the actors in these scenes, had been unconsciously fulfilling those predictions."

### John Calvin:
1. "As the seed does not spring up as soon as it is thrown into the earth, so the result of the works of God is not immediately seen."
2. "We are blind, unless the word of God go before our steps, and it is not even enough that the word of God shine on us, if the Spirit do not also enlighten our eyes."
3. "Let us learn to form our judgment of everything that relates to Christ, not by our own carnal feelings, but by the Scripture."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "It was the events themselves now occurring that were dark to them. They were not seen in their true light as a magnifying, as a prefigurative glorifying, of a suffering Messiah, were not seen to contain within them the great mystery of exaltation through and in the midst of suffering."
2. "The ignorance of the disciples was corrected by experience. What they did not understand now, they understood when the resurrection and ascension had taken place."
