## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Lazarus is mentioned throughout the incident, forming an element in the unfolding of the hatred of the Jews which issued in the Lord's death."
2. "Notice the climax, from mere connecting mention in John 12:1, then nearer connection in John 12:2, to his being the cause of the Jews flocking to Bethany in John 12:9."
3. "Lazarus was the joint object with Jesus of the enmity of the chief priests, in John 12:10."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Martha served—This, with what is afterwards said of Mary's way of honoring her Lord, is so true to the character in which those two women appear in :-, as to constitute one of the strongest and most delightful confirmations of the truth of both narratives."
2. "Lazarus . . . sat at the table—"Between the raised Lazarus and the healed leper (Simon, Mark 14:3), the Lord probably sits as between two trophies of His glory."
3. "The Lord's presence in the house of Lazarus was a testimony to the power of His resurrection, and His fellowship with Lazarus at the table was a symbol of the intimate relationship He desires to have with His followers."

### John Calvin:
1. "John does not mention the house, but shows plainly enough, that it was in some other place than the house of Lazarus and Martha that he supped." 
2. "The three Evangelists agree in this; that Mary did not anoint Christ sparingly, but poured on him a large quantity of ointment." 
3. "There is an amplification in the word feet, which appears more fully from what follows, when he adds, that Mary wiped his feet with her hair."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Two points only are mentioned by John, that a feast was given in honour of Jesus, and that every member of the family so signally blessed was present."
2. "The insertion of the clause relating to Lazarus is hardly to be accounted for if Jesus were a guest in his house."
3. "If then there is no doubt of the identity of the events mentioned by the Synoptists and by John, we learn that the feast was given in the house of Simon the leper, a person of whom we know nothing more."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "This is the last mention of Jesus in Bethany and he may have mentioned it proleptically for that reason as seems to me quite reasonable."
2. "There were two anointings by two absolutely different women for wholly different purposes."
3. "Perhaps Simon gave the feast partly in honour of Lazarus as well as of Jesus since all were now talking of both."

(Note: The commentary is quite lengthy and contains a lot of contextual information. I have selected quotes that provide insights into the timing and purpose of the supper, as well as the significance of the guests present.)

### John Gill:
1. "By preparing a supper for Jesus, Martha demonstrated her love and respect for him, despite having servants to do the work for her." 

2. "Lazarus sitting at the table with Jesus was a powerful testimony to his resurrection and good health." 

3. "This event in Bethany showcased the close relationship between Jesus and the siblings Lazarus, Martha, and Mary."

### John Wesley:
1. "Martha's status and influence can be inferred from the respect and attention she received during the time of Lazarus's death. This suggests that she held a position of prominence in the community." 

2. "The mention of the costly ointment in the next verse hints at Martha's wealth and generosity. It is likely that she had the means to provide for Jesus and his disciples during their stay at her house in Bethany." 

3. "The fact that Jesus and his disciples regularly lodged at Martha's house during the last week of his life indicates the level of trust and friendship between them. Martha's home became a place of refuge and support for Jesus during this crucial time."
