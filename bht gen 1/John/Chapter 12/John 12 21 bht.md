# John 12:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
From the various commentators, we can gather that there are individuals, potentially Greeks, who desire to have a personal encounter with Jesus, expressing reverence and respect in their request. This desire is driven by a genuine longing to see and connect with Jesus, with a focus on their personal faith rather than a specific agenda or mission. There is an emphasis on the importance of individual belief and the longing to have communion with Jesus. Their request is made with modesty, recognizing the limited time that Jesus may have for them.
