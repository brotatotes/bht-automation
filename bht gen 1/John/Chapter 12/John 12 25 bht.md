# John 12:25 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, Jesus teaches the principle of selflessness and self-denial, urging his followers to prioritize spiritual growth over worldly desires. Loving one's life in this world, clinging to material possessions and personal ambitions, leads to eternal loss. On the other hand, hating one's life in this world, prioritizing God's will and being willing to let go, allows for the preservation and fulfillment of life in a deeper, eternal sense. By aligning our desires with the will of God, we find true preservation and a pathway to eternal life.
