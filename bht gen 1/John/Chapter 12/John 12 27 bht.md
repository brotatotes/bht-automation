# John 12:27 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we see the intense conflict within Jesus as he contemplates the approaching hour of his crucifixion. The commentators note that his soul is troubled, not out of personal sorrow, but at the weight of the suffering he would endure to fulfill his Father's will. Jesus recognizes that this hour of suffering is the very purpose for which he came into the world. Without uttering words to fully convey the depth of his anguish, he wrestles with the choice of seeking deliverance or freely embracing the trials to bring about the salvation of mankind.
