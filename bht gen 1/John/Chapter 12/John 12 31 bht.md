# John 12:31 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this profound Bible verse, Jesus reveals that the hour of His passion has arrived and the judgment of the world is imminent. Through His death and resurrection, He initiates the restoration of the world, casting out the prince of darkness and breaking down his dominion. This gradual process results in Satan's ultimate defeat and the separation between the kingdom of God and the kingdom of darkness. The victory over Satan proclaimed here is confirmed throughout the Bible, demonstrating the final triumph of Christ's work.

2. "How differently is that fast-approaching 'hour' regarded in the kingdoms of darkness and of light! 'The hour of relief; from the dread Troubler of our peace—how near it is! Yet a little moment, and the day is ours!' So it was calculated and felt in the one region."
3. "'Now shall the prince of this world be cast out,' is a somewhat different view of the same event. We know who was right. Though yet under a veil, He sees the triumphs of the Cross in unclouded and transporting light."
