# John 12:32 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Bible verse in question speaks of the glorification of Jesus, as he is lifted up on the Cross. This lifting up signifies his death, which would be public and symbolizes his mediation between God and humanity. Through his crucifixion, Jesus draws all men to himself, regardless of their background or nationality. His death serves as a powerful magnet, attracting people to him and breaking the stronghold of Satan. This drawing to Jesus is not forced but is a result of God's efficacious grace.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The Saviour crucified, is in fact the Saviour glorified; so that the exalting to Godâ€™s right hand is set forth by that uplifting on the Cross."
2. "The Lord Jesus, though knowing all this, yet in the weakness of his humanity, puts himself into this seeming doubt, 'if it is so to be.'"

### John Gill:
1. "The death of Christ is here signified by his being 'lifted up from the earth', in allusion to the lifting up of the brazen serpent on the pole; and shows, that his death would not be natural, but violent, and would be public, and not private; and fitly expresses his mediation between God, and men, being lifted up between the heavens and the earth."
2. "This drawing of them to him, in consequence of his death, supposes distance from him, want of power, and will, to come to him, and the efficacious grace of God to bring them, though without any force and compulsion."
