# John 12:33 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Bible verse in question reveals the significance of Jesus' death and the manner in which he would die. The commentators explain that the phrase "lifted up" signifies a death that is not ordinary but specifically by crucifixion, bearing the curse of sin on the accursed tree. This manner of death was not only its first and obvious reference but also the kind that Jesus himself would refer to, highlighting the gravity and whole consequences of his sacrificial act.
