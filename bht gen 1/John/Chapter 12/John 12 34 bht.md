# John 12:34 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Bible verse in this passage describes the significance of Jesus being "lifted up," a phrase that symbolizes his crucifixion and subsequent exaltation. His death is presented as essential for the salvation of humanity. Though dying, he will endure forever, defeating sin and death through resurrection. The crowd's question about the identity of the Son of man highlights the connection between this title and the Messiah, drawing from Old Testament references.

### Henry Alford:
1. "In such passages as Psalms 89:36, and perhaps Psalms 110:4; Daniel 7:13-14." 
2. "The actual words ὅτι δεῖ ὑψ. τ. υἱ. τ. ἀνθ. had not been on this occasion used by Jesus; but in His discourse with Nicodemus, ch. John 3:14, and perhaps in other parts of His teaching which have not been recorded."
3. "They thought some other Son of Man, not the Messiah, was meant; because this lifting up (which they saw implied taking away) was inapplicable to their idea of the Messiah, usually known as the Son of Man."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "We have heard out of the law—the scriptures of the Old Testament."
2. "Christ—the Christ 'endureth for ever.'"
3. "How can that consist with this 'uplifting?' They saw very well both that He was holding Himself up as the Christ and a Christ to die a violent death."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "We have heard out of the law - Out of the Old Testament; or rather we have been so taught by those who have interpreted the law to us." 

2. "The doctrine of many of them certainly was that the Messiah would not die; that he would reign as a prince forever over the people."

3. "Who is this Son of man? - 'The Son of man we understand to be the Messiah spoken of by Daniel, who is to reign forever. To him, therefore, you cannot refer when you say that he must be lifted up, or must die.'"

### Marvin Vincent:

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The ‘multitude,’ who are Jews not Greeks, have rightly understood the words of Jesus in John 12:32 to mean a lifting on high by death." 
2. "There is thus an irreconcilable contradiction between the fate expected by Jesus and the claims which they might perhaps have otherwise allowed."
3. "The words are not an honest inquiry who this Son of man can be, and how he can be the Christ. They are really a rejection of the claims of Jesus."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Out of the law" - That is, "out of the Scriptures." (John 10:34; John 15:25)
2. "The Christ abideth forever" - Timeless present active indicative of μενω, to abide, remain. (Psalms 89:4; Psalms 110:4; Isaiah 9:7; Ezekiel 37:25; Daniel 7:14)

### John Wesley:
1. "The Son of man must be lifted up" - This phrase refers to Jesus' crucifixion and subsequent exaltation. It signifies the necessity of his death for the salvation of humanity.

3. "Who is this Son of man? - Is he the Christ?" - This question raises the inquiry about the identity of the Son of man. The reference to Psalm 110:4 suggests that the Son of man is indeed the Christ, the promised Messiah.
