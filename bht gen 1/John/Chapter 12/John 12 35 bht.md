# John 12:35 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse described here is a call for people to seize the opportunity presented by the presence of the Light. They are urged to not waste time, but rather to walk in the Light while it is still with them. By embracing this Light, they not only gain guidance and security, but also become a source of light themselves. However, if they reject the light, they will be left in darkness, unable to see the way and the dangers that lie ahead.
