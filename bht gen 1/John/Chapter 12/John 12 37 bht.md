## BHT:
In the face of countless and remarkable miracles, the Jewish nation remained obstinate in their unbelief. These signs, though not necessarily grand in magnitude, were undeniable testimony to the truth of Jesus' identity. The purpose of these miracles was to provide undeniable proof of Jesus' divinity and to strengthen the faith of those who saw them. However, even in the midst of such clear evidence, the majority of the people refused to believe, highlighting the need for the powerful and efficacious grace of God to produce true faith.
