# John 12:40 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we see a prophecy being freely cited, indicating that God's will and the consequences of the people's choices are described. The effect of proclaiming the truth can be twofold - it can either lead to their enlightenment or harden their hearts, depending on their response. This hardening, however, is not a passive act of God, but a consequence of their own choices and actions. While God desires all to be saved, repeated rejection of His message can lead to a spiritual blindness that makes it difficult for people to perceive and accept the truth.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The prophecy is freely cited, after neither the Heb. nor the LXX, which is followed in Matthew 13:14 f."
2. "What God bids the Prophet do, is here described as done, and by Himself: which is obviously implied in the Heb. text."
3. "The reading αὑτῶν (Morus) supplying ὁ λαὸς οὗτος as the subject of τετύφ. and πεπώρ., is out of the question, as ungrammatical, and inconsistent with the context, which will only allow of ὁ κύριος (i.e. Jehovah) as the subject."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Go and proclaim the law and the will of God, and the effect will be, owing to the hardness of their heart, that their eyes will be blinded and their hearts hardened."
2. "The effect of truth on such minds is to irritate, to enrage, and to harden, unless counteracted by the grace of God."
3. "In proclaiming the truth there was nothing wrong on the part of God or of Isaiah, nor is there any indication that God was unwilling that they should believe and be saved."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "These words of Isaiah are repeated five times in the New Testament as the description of the Jewish people in its latest stage of decay."

### John Calvin:
1. "It is indeed a dreadful judgment of God, when He overwhelms men by the light of doctrine, in such a manner as to deprive them of all understanding; and when, even by means of that which is their only light, he brings darkness upon them."
2. "But provided that prophets labor faithfully in the work of instruction, and commit to the Lord the result of their labor, though they may not succeed to their wish, they ought not to give way or despond."
3. "Let us remember that the prophet speaks of unbelievers who had already rejected the grace of God. It is certain that all would continue to be such by nature if The Lord did not form to obedience to him those whom he has elected."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
