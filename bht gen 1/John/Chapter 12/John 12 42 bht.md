# John 12:42 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, there were influential leaders, like Nicodemus and Joseph, who secretly believed in Jesus despite the opposition from the Pharisees. The Pharisees, who were leaders in their own religious sects, caused those who openly confessed their faith in Jesus to be expelled from the synagogue, facing social and religious consequences. The faith of these believers, though imperfect, still had an impact and their conviction in Jesus as the Messiah led them to believe in Him, though not in a spiritual and saving manner.

### John Calvin:
1. "A striking instance, truly, of the grace of God; for, when ungodliness has once prevailed, it is a sort of universal plague, which infects with its contagion every part of the body."
2. "Yet we now perceive in the world the same grace of God; for though ungodliness and contempt of God abound everywhere, and though a vast multitude of men make furious attempts to exterminate utterly the doctrine of the Gospel, yet it always finds some places of retreat."
3. "Let no man, therefore, flatter himself who, in any respect, conceals or dissembles his faith for fear of incurring the hatred of men; for however hateful the name of Christ may be, that cowardice which compels us to turn aside, in the smallest degree, from the confession of him, admits of no excuse."

3. "They had made a decree in the sanhedrim, that whoever confessed that Jesus was the Messiah, should be cast out; and they had put it into execution upon the man born blind, whose eyes Christ opened, for speaking in favour of his benefactor."
