## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Jesus cried—in a loud tone, and with peculiar solemnity." 
2. "He that believeth on me, &c.—This seems to be a supplementary record of some weighty proclamations." 
3. "Introduced here as a sort of summary and winding up of His whole testimony."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Jesus saw their unbelief, and proceeded to state the consequence of believing on him, and of rejecting him and his message."
2. "Believeth not on me - That is, not on me alone, or his faith does not terminate on me."
3. "Jesus uniformly represents the union between himself and God as so intimate that there could not be faith in him unless there was also faith in God."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Cried [εκραξεν] . This is not meant to relate a reappearance of Jesus in public. The close of His public ministry is noted at ver. 36. It is in continuation of the Evangelist's own remarks, and introduces a summary of Jesus' past teaching to the Jews."

2. "Believeth - on Him that sent Me [πιστευει - εις τον πεμψαντα με] . This is the first and almost the only place in the Gospel where the words believe on are used with reference to the Father. This rendering in John 5:24 is an error. See John 14:1. The phrase is constantly associated with our Lord."

3. "At the same time it is to be noted that it contemplates the Father as the source of the special revelation of Christ, and therefore is not absolutely an exception to the habitual usage. The same is true of John 14:1."

### John Calvin:
1. "The cry is expressive of vehemence; for it is not a simple doctrine, but an exhortation intended to excite them more powerfully."
2. "Hence he infers, that it is foolish and unreasonable for faith to be wavering or doubtful; for it is impossible to offer a greater insult to God, than not to rely on his truth."
3. "If, then, we would render to God the honor due to him, we must learn to remain firm in faith, not only though the world were shaken, but even though Satan should disturb and overturn all that is under heaven."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The only supposition therefore is, that the passage contains an epitome or summary of the words of Jesus to the Jews."
2. "He that believeth in me, believeth not in me, but in him that sent me."
3. "No words could more strikingly express what Jesus had accomplished for those who received Him: He had led them to the Father, and through Jesus they are now believers in God."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Cried and said (εκραξεν κα ειπεν). First aorist active indicative of κραζω, to cry aloud, and second aorist active of defective verb ερω, to say."
2. "This is probably a summary of what Jesus had already said as in verse John 12:36."
3. "The idea of Jesus here is a frequent one (believing on Jesus whom the Father has sent) as in John 3:17; John 5:23; John 5:30; John 5:43; John 7:16; John 8:42; John 13:20; John 14:1; Matthew 10:40; Luke 9:48."

### John Gill:
1. "He cried with a loud voice, that he might be heard, and his audience left inexcusable; it denotes the concern of his mind, the vehemence of his spirit, and that openness and freedom in which he discharged his ministry."
2. "Christ is the object of faith; he is proposed as such in the Gospel; and it is his Father's will, and his own advice, that his people should believe in him."
3. "He that believes on him as the sent of God, does not so much believe on him, as on the sender of him."

### John Wesley:
1. "Jesus said with a loud voice - This signifies the importance and urgency of the message He is about to deliver."
2. "Believeth not on me - Jesus emphasizes that faith in Him is not separate from faith in the Father who sent Him. It is a call to recognize the unity and divine nature of both."
3. "Because the Father hath sent the Son, and because he and the Father are one - This statement highlights the inseparable bond between Jesus and the Father, affirming their divine unity and the authority of Jesus as the Son of God."
