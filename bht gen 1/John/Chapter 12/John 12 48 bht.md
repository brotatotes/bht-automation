# John 12:48 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the primary subject of Jesus is emphasized, underscoring his authority and power. His words hold the ability to bring judgment and will be remembered by those who rejected him. The rejection of Jesus' words marks a refusal to accept his authority, and in the last day, his word will serve as a witness and an accuser, bringing righteous judgment upon those who have rejected him. The word of Christ, which one despises, is sufficient to judge them, and their self-condemnation will align with the sentence of Christ.
