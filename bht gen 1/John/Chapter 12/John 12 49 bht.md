# John 12:49 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the authority and divine nature of Jesus' teaching are emphasized. Jesus spoke not of his own accord, but rather conveyed the commandments given to him by the Father. This distinction highlights both the obedience and humility of Jesus, who faithfully delivered the divine plan for the salvation of the world. The combination of "say" and "speak" in this verse suggests that Jesus' words not only carry a specific message, but also are delivered in various ways. His teachings hold significant weight and rejecting them will not go unnoticed at the future judgment.
