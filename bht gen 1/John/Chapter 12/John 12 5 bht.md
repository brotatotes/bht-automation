# John 12:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the value of three hundred pence, equivalent to a significant sum of money, highlights the gravity of the debt owed. The mention of the poor acts as a pretext for Judas' true intentions, revealing his hypocritical nature. His true uneasiness stems from his desire to control the money, rather than genuine concern for the poor. The question raised regarding the sale of the ointment exposes Judas' greed and materialistic mindset, overshadowing the significance of the anointing act itself.
