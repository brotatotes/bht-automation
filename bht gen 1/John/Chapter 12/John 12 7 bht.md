# John 12:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, commentators describe a scene where a woman anoints Jesus with expensive ointment. The commentators emphasize that Jesus's response indicates his acceptance and approval of the woman's actions, even in the face of criticism. They interpret the woman's act as a symbolic preparation for Jesus's impending death, and Jesus himself acknowledges this, seeing her gesture as fulfilling the future need for anointing his body. Their reflections highlight Jesus's compassionate perspective and his awareness of the sacrifice he is about to make for humanity's salvation.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "To suppose that it was a remnant from that used at the burial of Lazarus, is not only fanciful, but at variance with the character of the deed as apparent in the narrative."
2. "The history clearly excludes the idea of a remnant."
3. "I understand the words... of her whole act, not regarded as a thing past, but spoken of in the abstract as to be allowed or disallowed: Let her keep it for the day of my burial."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Let her alone" - Jesus' words indicate his acceptance and approval of the woman's actions, despite the criticism from others. 

2. "Against the day of my burying hath she done this" - The commentary explains that the woman's act of anointing Jesus with expensive nard was not a conscious preparation for his burial, but rather a loving gesture that Jesus interprets as a symbolic act of anointing him for his impending death. 

3. "He lovingly regards it as done now" - The commentary highlights Jesus' compassionate perspective, seeing the woman's act as already fulfilling the future need for anointing his body, even though it was not her intention at the time.

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The word ejntafiasmou is wrongly rendered burial. It means the preparation for burial, the laying out, or embalmment."
2. "Mary, then, has kept the ointment in order to embalm Jesus with it on this day, as though He were already dead."
3. "The old rendering, as A. V., is the simplest, and gives a perfectly intelligible and consistent sense."

### John Calvin:
1. "Christ’s reply, as given by the other Evangelists, is longer; but the meaning is the same." 
2. "God certainly does not approve of outward display. Nay, more, perceiving that the mind of man is too prone to carnal observances, He frequently enjoins us to be sober and moderate in the use of them."
3. "But Christ applies to the hope of his resurrection what they so greatly disapproved, in order that the usefulness, which he pointed out to them in this action, might lead them to renounce the fretful and wicked opinion which they had formed respecting it."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The true reading of the Greek text, that which our rendering represents, undoubtedly presents a difficulty, as we, knowing that our Lord is speaking of the day then present, cannot understand how Jesus can say ‘that . . . she may keep it.’"
2. "Our Lord was not distinctly affirming that this day was, so to speak, the day on which He was prepared for entombment: it was His wont to use language which but partially revealed the approaching event, which seemed to unenlightened hearers to contain only some dark hint of trouble impending, but which stood forth in luminous significance when the implied prophecy was ready to be fulfilled."
3. "The word which our Lord uses in this verse shows in what light this section is to be viewed. It is not so much the living Saviour that we have before us as the Saviour on whom sentence of death has been passed."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Let her alone: it was that," etc. (supplying "it was"). Either makes good sense.
2. The word ενταφιασμος is a later and rare substantive from the late verb ενταφιαζω, to prepare for burial.
3. The idea of Jesus is that Mary had saved this money to use in preparing his body for burial. She is giving him the flowers before the funeral.

### John Gill:
1. "Do not disturb her in what she does, or hinder her, or blame her for it." 
2. "Christ suggests, that the time of his death and burial were nigh, and that this woman had kept this ointment till now, for such a purpose."
3. "Though without any knowledge of his death, or any such intention and design in her, but the Holy Ghost so directing her."

### John Wesley:
1. "The phrase 'against the day of my burial' suggests that Jesus is aware of his impending death and is intentionally preparing for it."
2. "This statement highlights Jesus' acceptance of his fate and his willingness to face death with courage and purpose."
3. "By acknowledging the approaching day of his burial, Jesus is demonstrating his understanding of the ultimate sacrifice he will make for humanity's salvation."
