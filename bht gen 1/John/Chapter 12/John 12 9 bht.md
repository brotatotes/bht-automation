# John 12:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, the commentators help to provide a deeper understanding of the situation surrounding Jesus. The term "Ἰουδαῖοι" refers to the rulers and religious leaders rather than the Jewish people as a whole. The crowds of people who came from Jerusalem to Bethany were not just interested in seeing Jesus, but also witnessing the miracle of Lazarus being raised from the dead. These events attracted both the common people and those in positions of power, revealing the diverse reactions of faith, unbelief, and curiosity towards Jesus and the miracles he performed.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The Ἰουδαῖοι are not the people, but the rulers, and persons of repute: the representatives of the Jewish opposition to Jesus."
2. "This distinction is important because it helps to clarify that Jesus' conflict was not with the Jewish people as a whole, but with the religious leaders and those who held power."
3. "By understanding that the Ἰουδαῖοι refers to a specific group within the Jewish community, we can avoid perpetuating harmful stereotypes and recognize the complexity of the situation."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Crowds of the Jerusalem Jews hastened to Bethany, not so much to see Jesus, whom they knew to be there, as to see dead Lazarus alive." 
2. "This, issuing in their accession to Christ, led to a plot against the life of Lazarus also, as the only means of arresting the triumphs of Jesus."
3. "To such a pitch had these chief priests come of diabolical determination to shut out the light from themselves, and quench it from the earth!"

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The best texts insert the article, which converts the expression into the current phrase, the common people."
2. "Rev., more correctly, learned."
3. "They came to know."

### John Calvin:
1. "The more nearly the time of the death of Christ approached, it became the more necessary that his name should be universally celebrated, in order that it might be a preparation for stronger faith after his death."
2. "The recent miracle of the resurrection of Lazarus had acquired great celebrity: and as Christ showed in it a remarkable proof of his Divinity, God intended that it should have many witnesses."
3. "When he says that they came not on account of Jesus only, but also for the sake of Lazarus, he does not mean that they came out of regard to Lazarus, as if they bestowed this mark of honor on him in particular, but that they might behold the astonishing display of the power of Christ in Lazarus."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Faith and unbelief have revealed themselves in the case of the friends and the enemies of Jesus, and especially in the deed of Mary and the words of Judas."
2. "The sifting process which accompanies every manifestation of Jesus extends to a wider circle."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The common people (ο οχλος πολυς). This is the right reading with the article ο, literally, 'the people much or in large numbers.'" 
2. "John's use of οχλος is usually the common crowd as 'riff-raff.'"
3. "Purpose clause with ινα and second aorist active subjunctive of οραω. Motive enough to gather a great crowd, to see one raised from the dead."

2. "They came from Jerusalem to Bethany, not for Jesus' sake only; to see him, and hear him, and observe what he said and did."
