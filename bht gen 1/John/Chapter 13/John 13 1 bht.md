# John 13:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, Jesus displays his unwavering love and self-humbling nature towards his disciples. He knew that his time in the flesh was coming to an end, but this didn't hinder his steadfast affection for them. Jesus, even in the face of imminent suffering and death, desired to express his love by offering himself as a proof of this deep affection. This act of love goes beyond mere endurance and exemplifies Jesus' unchanging character, as he continues to love his own with the same unwavering devotion.

3. "Although this knowledge was united with the highest consciousness of His divine mission and speedy glorification, yet this latter did not prevent Him from giving this proof of His self-humiliating love."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "On these beautiful euphemisms" - The commentary refers to the use of euphemisms in the verse, indicating that there are deeper meanings behind the words used by Jesus.

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "It is not the Passover of the Jews which Jesus is about to celebrate, which had degenerated into an empty form, but the national ordinance, according to its true spirit, and with a development of its higher meaning."
2. "His hour. See on 12 23, and compare John 2:4. That [ινα] . In order that; marking the departure as a divine decree."
3. "Unto the end [εις τελος] . Interpretations differ. The rendering of the A. V. and Rev. is of doubtful authority. The passages cited in support of this, Matthew 10:22; Matthew 24:13; Mark 13:13, may all be rendered to the uttermost."

### John Calvin:
1. "The Lord testified, by this visible sign, that the love with which he embraced them was firm and lasting; that, though they were deprived of his presence, they might still be convinced that death itself would not quench this love."
2. "Christ regarded them with so much the greater solicitude...we ought to know that he is looking at us; for he loveth his own, who are in the world."
3. "This phrase is worthy of notice; for it refers to the knowledge of Christ, that he knew that his death was a passage to the heavenly kingdom of God...there is no reason why we should now think that his affection is changed."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Jesus will partake of ‘the Passover,’ but not of ‘the Passover of the Jews;’ of the great national ordinance of Israel, but not of an ordinance the true spirit and meaning of which had perished."
2. "Certainly not ‘although He knew,’ as if His consciousness of the glory awaiting Him might have proved an obstacle to His present manifestation of Himself, had it not been overcome by love; but because He knew that He was about to be delivered from the toil and suffering of the world, and to be reunited to the Father in the blessedness of the most intimate communion with Him."
3. "The expression does not mean ‘to the end,’ for which another phrase is always used. It is best explained by 1 Thessalonians 2:16, ‘to the uttermost:’ the love of Jesus now reaches its highest point."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "The passover feast began on the 15th Nisan at sunset, the passover lamb being slain the afternoon of 14th Nisan."
2. "Thus understood verse John 13:1 here serves as an introduction to the great esoteric teaching of Christ to the apostles."
3. "He was not stumbling into the dark as he faced 'his hour' (αυτου η ωρα)."

1. "This passover was what Christ had greatly desired, it being his last, and when he was to express his great love to his people, mentioned here, by dying for them."
2. "The death of Christ is here signified by a departing out of this world, a way of speaking frequently used by the Jews as expressive of death."
3. "The objects of his love are described by his property in them, 'his own'; by whom are meant, not all mankind, but all the elect of God, who are his own, by his choice of them, by the Father's gift of them to him, by the purchase he made of them with his blood, and by his effectual call of them by his grace."
