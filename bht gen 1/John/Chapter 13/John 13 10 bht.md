# John 13:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Believers, having been already cleansed through faith in Christ, are called to maintain a daily practice of holiness and purity. They need to continually walk in obedience to God's commands, reflecting the sanctifying work of the Holy Spirit. This includes living a life of moral purity and righteousness, aligning their conduct with their position as children of God. Salvation is a one-time event, but sanctification is an ongoing process that requires intentional effort to walk holy and undefiled.

3. "On the other hand, he who fasts must wash [νιψαι] his face (Matthew 6:17)."

### John Calvin:
1. "Believers are altogether clean; not that they are in every respect pure, so that there no longer remains in them any stain, but because they are cleansed in their chief part; that is, when sin is deprived of its kingly power, so that the righteousness of God holds the superiority."
2. "It is by newness of life, therefore, that we must testify ourselves to be the disciples of Christ, for he declares that he is the Author of purity in all his followers."
3. "The term feet, therefore, is metaphorically applied to all the passions and cares by which we are brought into contact with the world; for, if the Holy Spirit occupied every part of us, we would no longer have anything to do with the pollutions of the world; but now, by that part in which we are carnal, we creep on the ground, or at least fix our feet in the clay, and, therefore, are to some extent unclean."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "He who has just been cleansed in the bath has only further to wash his feet as he proceeds from the bath to the banquet in order that he may sit down there wholly clean."

1. "He that is bathed (ο λελουμενος). Perfect passive articular participle of λουω, to bathe the whole body (Acts 9:37)."
2. "Save to wash his feet (ε μη τους ποδας νιψασθα). Aleph and some old Latin MSS. have only νιψασθα, but the other words are genuine and are really involved by the use of νιψασθα (first aorist middle infinitive of νιπτω, to wash parts of the body) instead of λουσασθα, to bathe the whole body (just used before)."
3. "But not all (αλλ' ουχ παντες). Strongly put exception (ουχ). Plain hint of the treachery of Judas who is reclining at the table after having made the bargain with the Sanhedrin (Mark 14:11)."

### John Gill:
1. "He that is washed,.... Not he that is baptized; for every such person is not wholly clean, but he who is regenerated by the Spirit of God, or rather, who is washed in the blood of Christ: such an one 'is clean every whit'; is all over clean."
2. "And such an one needeth not, save to wash his feet, but is clean every whit; the feet of his life and conversation, which are continually gathering dirt, and need daily washing in the blood of Christ; and therefore recourse must be constantly had to that fountain to wash in, for sin and for uncleanness."
3. "And ye are clean, but not all; which shows, that justifying and regenerating grace are common to all the true disciples of Christ; they are equally born again, alike justified, and are as clean one as another in the sight of God; not only Peter, but all the apostles, were clean, excepting one."
