# John 13:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the midst of a supper, while Judas had already made the wicked decision to betray Him, Satan cast this evil intention into his heart. The darkness of this treacherous act sharply contrasts with the love and purity of Christ, who patiently washes the feet of His disciples. As Jesus takes His way amidst the darkness, we are reminded of the access that all mankind now has to God, symbolized by the rending of the temple veil. Through Christ's death, a new and living way has been opened, inviting us to draw near to God with confidence and find acceptance.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The devil having by this time suggested (to Judas) that Judas Iscariot the son of Simon should betray Him." 
2. "Judas had before this covenanted with the Sanhedrim to betray Him, which must here be meant by the devil having put it into his heart." 
3. "The fact is here stated, to enhance the love which Jesus showed in the following action."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "supper being ended—rather, 'being prepared,' 'being served,' or 'going on'; for that it was not 'ended' is plain from Luke 22:19." 

2. "the devil having now—or, 'already'—put into the heart of Judas... to betray him—referring to the agreement he had already made with the chief priests." 

3. "This verse highlights the contrast between the sacredness of the Last Supper and the sinister plot of betrayal that was unfolding simultaneously."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Supper being ended - This translation expresses too much. The original means while they were at supper; and that this is the meaning is clear from the fact that we find them still eating after this."
2. "The devil - The leader or prince of evil spirits."
3. "Having now put it into the heart - Literally, having cast it into the heart... The meaning of this passage is that Satan inclined the mind of Judas to do this, or he tempted him to betray his Master."

Note: The commentary provided is a combination of different explanations for each part of the verse.

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The most approved reading is ginomenou, the present participle, denoting while a supper was in progress. Hence Rev., rightly, during supper." 
2. "It is important to note the absence of the definite article: a supper, as distinguished from the feast, which also is designated by a different word." 
3. "Having now put [ηδη βεβληκοτος] . Rev., better, already. Put, is literally, thrown or cast. Into the heart of Judas."

### John Calvin:
1. "The Evangelist says that this was done, while Judas already resolved to betray Christ, not only to show the wonderful patience of Christ, who could endure to wash the feet of such a wicked and detestable traitor; but also that he purposely selected the time when he was near death, for performing what may be regarded as the last act of his life."
2. "When the Evangelist says that Judas had been impelled by the devil to form the design of betraying Christ, this tends to show the enormity of the crime; for it was dreadful and most atrocious wickedness, in which the efficacy of Satan was openly displayed."
3. "There is no wickedness, indeed, that is perpetrated by men, to which Satan does not excite them, but the more hideous and execrable any crime is, the more ought we to view in it the rage of the devil, who drives about, in all possible directions, men who have been forsaken by God."

### Philip Schaff:
1) "It is important to notice the exact parallelism of this verse to the preceding, both in the note of time, and in the circumstances of the scene."
2) "The three particulars are in the sharpest contrast with those in John 13:1, the devil with Jesus, Judas with ‘His own,’ treachery with love."
3) "Darkness is over against light, earth over against heaven, the lie over against the truth; and between these Jesus takes His way."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Verse John 13:4 shows plainly that the meal was still going on."
2. "Hence John's 'already' (ηδη) is pertinent."
3. "Satan had an open door by now into the heart of Judas."

### John Gill:
1. "There is no mention made in this whole chapter of the passover supper, or of any of its rites."
2. "The manner in which he tempted him was, he 'put', or 'cast [it] into his heart'; it was a dart, and a fiery one, he threw into him, into his very heart; which shows the access Satan has into, and the influence he has upon the minds of men."
3. "This account is prefaced to Christ's washing the feet of his disciples, to show the great composure of mind Christ was in, though he knew what was doing; and his wonderful condescension in washing the feet of so vile a creature, into whose heart Satan had already put it to betray him."

### John Wesley:
1. "Having now - This expression implies that the privilege of access to God, which the Jews enjoyed, was not to be confined to them, but was to be extended to all mankind."
2. "The privilege of access to God is now enjoyed by all, without distinction of nation or rank."
3. "The veil of the temple, which formerly separated the holy place from the most holy, was rent from the top to the bottom, signifying that the way into the holiest of all was now made manifest."
4. "The death of Christ has opened a new and living way to the throne of grace, which all may approach with confidence and find acceptance."
5. "The veil of separation is removed, and we are invited to draw near to God with a true heart, in full assurance of faith."
