# John 13:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this particular Bible verse, we encounter a scene where the disciples are in a state of confusion and disbelief. They are looking at one another, unsure of whom Jesus is referring to. Their perplexity is evident as they exchange glances, seeking to make sense of the situation. The disciples are deeply troubled by the possibility that one among them could be involved in such a heinous act, and their expressions reflect a mix of astonishment, abhorrence, and indignation. Despite their doubts, they hold great reverence for Jesus' words, convinced that he speaks with authority and purpose.
