### Albert Barnes:
1. "Leaning on Jesus’ bosom - This does not mean that he was at that time actually lying on his bosom, but that he occupied a situation next to him at the table, so that his head naturally fell back on his bosom when he spoke to him."
2. "Whom Jesus loved - This was doubtless John himself. The evangelists are not accustomed to mention their own names when any mark of favor or any good deed is recorded. They did not seek publicity or notoriety."
3. "The highest honor that can be conferred on any man is to say that Jesus loved him. Yet this is an honor which all may possess, but which none can inherit without his spirit and without loving him."

### John Calvin:
1. "The peculiar love with which Christ loved John plainly testifies that, if we love some more than others, this is not always inconsistent with brotherly love."

3. "The love of men towards each other will never be properly regulated, unless it be directed to God."

3. "The universal tradition of the Church, as well as the information afforded by the gospel itself...leave no doubt that this disciple was John himself."

3. "One of the disciples whom Jesus loved — St. John avoids with great care the expressly naming himself. Perhaps our Lord now gave him the first proof of his peculiar love, by disclosing this secret to him."
