# John 13:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the scene depicted, a group of disciples sit at a table, looking at each other in surprise and curiosity. Peter, known for his eagerness and leadership, beckons and gestures to another disciple, perhaps seeking an answer to a question burning within him. The moment captured in this iconic moment from Leonardo da Vinci's 'Last Supper', shows the disciples engaged in intense and meaningful interaction, each bearing their own motives and experiences. It symbolizes Peter's role as a mediator, his close relationship with Jesus, and a reminder of his own journey of faith and redemption.
