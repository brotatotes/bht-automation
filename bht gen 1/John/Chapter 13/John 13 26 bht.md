# John 13:26 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, Jesus is earnestly speaking to John that he would identify the betrayer by giving a small piece of bread. This act is not only a noticeable sign to John but also an opportunity for Judas to soften his heart. However, if Judas remains hardened, Jesus' actions would further confirm his treachery. The gesture of giving the sop was an intimate token, yet it ultimately seals Judas' fate and signifies that he does not truly belong.

### Albert Barnes:

1. "The giving of the sop then is more than an index to the traitor. It is a final appeal to Judas which may yet soften his heart, but which, if it do not soften him, will only make him more hardened than before."
2. "The second question, Does Judas partake of the feast? is not distinctly answered by the Evangelist. We must probably answer in the negative, because (1) The ‘feast’ was only now beginning. (2) The drift of the passage, and indeed of the whole of this section of the gospel, leads to the conclusion that he did not."

3. "Christ took up, without regard to any custom, or ceremony used at any feasts, and gave it to the betrayer, as a sign by which John might know him."
