# John 13:29 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
On the eve of a significant celebration, it is indicated that the disciples speculate whether it was the appropriate time for Judas to leave and purchase provisions. Their conjectures revolve around the timing of the Passover meal and the implications for buying necessities in preparation for the feast. The supposition is made that Christ, despite His own impoverished state, still manages to show generosity by giving to the poor. The disciples' inquiry about the destination of Judas' outing leads to considerations of charity and the specific aid given during the Passover.
