1. "τεκνία here only used by Christ affectingly expresses His not only brotherly, but fatherly love (Isa 9:6) for His own, and at the same time their immature and weak state, now about to be left without Him."
2. "But naturally the two clauses, ‘Ye shall seek Me and not find Me, and shall die in your sins,’ also spoken to the Jews (ch. John 7:33; Joh 8:21), are here omitted: and by this omission the connexion with Joh 13:34 is supplied."
3. "The way is that of Love, to Me, and to one another forming an united Body, the Church, in which all shall recognize My presence among you as My disciples."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Little children [τεκνια]. Diminutive, occurring only here in the Gospel, but repeatedly in the First Epistle."
