# John 13:34 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The commandment emphasized here is the call to love one another. It is referred to as new not in the sense that it was never given before, but rather, it is new in being emphasized and taught specifically by Jesus. This commandment goes beyond simply loving others as oneself; it is a call to love one another as Christ has loved us, with selflessness and sacrifice. It is a commandment that reflects the very essence of the whole law and is to be the defining characteristic of believers, forming a community bound by love and imitating the love of Jesus.
