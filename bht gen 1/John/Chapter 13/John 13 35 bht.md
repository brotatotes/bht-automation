# John 13:35 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Through the lens of different commentators, this Bible verse emphasizes the importance of love among followers of Jesus as a defining characteristic of true discipleship. It is not just about showing love for the sake of appearances, but about attracting others to the spirit of Christ. Love for one another serves as a sign to the world that we are children of God, and its absence contradicts our claim to discipleship. The verse calls for a continuous presence of love, as it is through this love that the world will come to know and recognize our discipleship.
