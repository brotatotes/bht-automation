# John 13:36 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this passage, we encounter Peter's confusion and lack of understanding about Jesus' words and future plans. Peter keenly desires to know more about the situation but fails to grasp the deeper meaning behind Jesus' departure. His thought process reflects the befuddled mindset of both the Pharisees and himself. However, Peter's uncertainty eventually leads to his ultimate following of Jesus, though not without adversity and sacrifice.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "This announcement of Peter’s denial is probably the same with that in Luke 22:33 ff."
2. "ἀκ  .   δὲ ὕστ  ., alluding probably both to the future reception of His Apostle into His glory."
3. "and to the particular path by which he should come to that glory; as in ch. John 21:18-19."

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Peter said—seeing plainly in these directions how to behave themselves, that He was indeed going from them." 
2. "Lord, whither guest thou?—having hardly a glimmer of the real truth." 
3. "Jesus answered, . . . thou canst not follow me now, but thou shalt follow me afterwards—How different from what He said to the Jews: 'Whither I go ye cannot come' (John 8:21)."

### John Calvin:
1. "From this it is evident how ignorant Peter was, who, after having been so frequently warned about Christ’s departure, was as greatly perplexed as if he had heard something new."
2. "We are taught by this passage to subject all our desires to God, that they may not go beyond their proper bounds; and if at any time they become extravagant and foolish, let us at least submit to be held in by this bridle."
3. "He means that Peter is not yet ripe for bearing the cross, but, like corn still in the blade, must be formed and strengthened by the progress of time, that he may follow."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Peter has not been able to apprehend aright the truths of which Jesus has been speaking. We need not wonder at it; and, had he understood them fully, there would have been less necessity either for the instructions that follow or for the discipline of his fall."
2. "Thinking only of himself and his fellow-disciples, failing to see the greatness of the charge that would be committed to them when Jesus went away, and not yet trained as he will be, he turns to the thought of the separation spoken of in John 13:33, and asks whither his Lord goeth."
3. "No direct answer is given to the question. Peter must have known his work and done it before he could have properly comprehended the answer, had it been given; for a disciple’s reward stands in such a relation to his work, that without a knowledge of the latter he can have no true knowledge of the former."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Whither goest thou?" - Peter's question reflects his confusion and uncertainty, mirroring the perplexity of the Pharisees in previous passages (John 7:35; John 8:21). 

2. "Peter is puzzled" - This highlights Peter's state of mind, indicating his lack of understanding or clarity about the situation at hand.

3. "Just as the Pharisees were twice" - The comparison to the Pharisees emphasizes the common struggle of grappling with the teachings and actions of Jesus, suggesting a parallel between Peter's confusion and that of the religious leaders.

### John Gill:
1. "Peter's mind was intent upon them, was uneasy about them, and very much wanted to know the meaning of them."
2. "Christ was going somewhere in a little time; he was going to the garden to surrender himself up into the hands of his enemies."
3. "Thou shalt follow me by dying for me; and thou shall follow me into my kingdom and glory, and be forever with me."

### John Wesley:
1. "St. Peter seems to have thought, that Christ, being rejected by the Jews, would go to some other part of the earth to erect his throne, where he might reign without disturbance, according to the gross notions he had of Christ's kingdom."
2. "Thou canst not follow me now — But Peter would not believe him."
3. "And he did follow him, John 18:15. But it was afar off. And not without great loss."
