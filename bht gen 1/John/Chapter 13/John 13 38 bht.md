1. "The words of Jesus fix with solemn emphasis His disciple’s attention on what He Himself had said."

2. "Not that Peter should deny him three times, before the cock crowed once; for certain it is, that Peter denied Christ but once, before the cock crew, Mark 14:68; but the meaning is, that before the cock had, lone crowing, or within the time of cock crowing, he should deny him thrice."
3. "So that it appears, that Peter twice expressed his confidence, in laying down his life for Christ; once at the supper in Simon's house at Bethany, two days before the 'passover', and again at the passover supper in Jerusalem; and as often Christ rebuked his confidence by this expression, only varying it as the different times required, and therein gave a full proof of his omniscience."
