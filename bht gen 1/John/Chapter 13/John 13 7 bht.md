2. "ὃ ἐγὼ ποιῶ, i.e. (1) this washing itself, as a lesson of humility and love, John 13:14. (2) Its symbolical meaning, John 13:9-10. (3) The great Act of Love, the laying aside my glory, and becoming in the form of a servant, that the washing of the Holy Spirit may cleanse men."
3. "μετὰ ταῦτα (1) was known very soon, but (2) and (3) not till after the Spirit was given."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The Great Teacher now takes in hand the task of instructing the warmhearted but impulsive disciple in the true nature of the act performed by Him." 

2. "The remarkable transition in this verse from ‘knowest’ to ‘learn,’ and the fact that the last of these two words is again taken up in John 13:12 (where we translate ‘perceive’), afford ground for the supposition that the ‘hereafter’ spoken of begins with the light there thrown by Jesus Himself upon what He does."
