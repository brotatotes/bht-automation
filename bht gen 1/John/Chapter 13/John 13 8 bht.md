## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The same well-meaning but false humility would prevent him (and does prevent many) from stooping to receive at the hands of the Lord that spiritual washing which is absolutely necessary in order to have any part in Him."
2. "If I wash thee not, thou hast no part in Me."
3. "Whoever is washed by Jesus, has part in Him."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Never shalt Thou wash my feet": that is, "That is an incongruity to which I can never submit." How like the man!
2. "If I wash thee not, thou hast no part with me": What Peter could not submit to was, that the Master should serve His servant.
3. "If Peter then could not submit to let his Master go down so low as to wash his feet, how should he suffer himself to be served by Him at all?"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "We should yield to all the plain and positive requirements of God, even if we cannot now see how obedience would promote his glory."
2. "If he [Peter] was not willing to submit his will to that of Christ and implicitly obey him, he had no evidence of piety."
3. "Unless by my doctrine and spirit I shall purify you, and remove your pride, your lack of constant watchfulness, your anger, your timidity and fear, you can have no part in me."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Never [ου μη - εις τον αιωνα]. A very strong expression."
2. "Literally, thou shalt by no means wash my feet as long as the world stands."
3. "The phrase emphasizes the strong refusal of Peter to allow Jesus to wash his feet, indicating a deep sense of unworthiness and humility."

### John Calvin:
1. "The true wisdom of faith, therefore, is to approve and embrace with reverence whatever proceeds from God, as done with propriety and in good order; nor is there any other way, indeed, in which his name can be sanctified by us."
2. "In short, until a man renounce the liberty of judging as to the works of God, whatever exertions he may make to honor God, still pride will always lurk under the garb of humility."
3. "The same thing will always happen to us, whenever the Lord begins to contend with us. So long as he remains silent, men imagine that they have a good right to differ from him: but nothing is easier for him than to refute, by a single word, all the plausible arguments which they employ."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Peter is too much amazed to comprehend at once the lesson of the previous words of Jesus."
2. "If I wash thee not, thou hast no part with me."
3. "They relate...that unless Peter enters into the spirit of that self-sacrificing work of love which Jesus performs, makes that spirit his own spirit, sees the beauty and owns the glory of the Master’s becoming the servant for His people’s sake...then he is going his own way, not the way of Jesus."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Peter's sudden humility should settle the issue, he felt."
2. "Jesus picks up the challenge of Peter whose act amounted to irreverence and want of confidence."
3. "Jesus does not make foot-washing essential to spiritual fellowship, but simply tests Peter's real pride and mock-humility by this symbol of fellowship."

### John Gill:
1. "Peter ought to have been satisfied with Christ's reply, and have submitted, since though he then did not know the reason of such surprising conduct, he should hereafter."
2. "Christ uses the word wash here, not literally, but in a mystical and figurative sense, and takes an occasion, as he sometimes does, from things natural, to discourse of things spiritual."
3. "Hence it may be observed, that unless a man is washed by Christ, he can have no part with him in this, or the other world."

1. "If I wash thee not — If thou dost not submit to my will, thou hast no part with me." 
2. "Thou art not my disciple." 
3. "If I do not wash thee in my blood, and purify thee by my Spirit, thou canst have no communion with me, nor any share in the blessings of my kingdom."
