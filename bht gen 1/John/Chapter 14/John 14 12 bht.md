# John 14:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Believers are promised that they will do greater works than Jesus himself, not in terms of miracles, but in their impact and reach. The apostles, through the power of the Holy Spirit, carried out a wider ministry, preaching the Gospel throughout the world. It is through the Spirit that believers are able to continue the mighty work of Jesus, including the conversion of sinners, which is a testament to the exceeding greatness of God's power. Jesus assured his disciples that his departure would lead to the coming of the Holy Spirit, who would empower them to carry on his work.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Albert Barnes:
1. "He that believeth on me - This promise had doubtless special reference to the apostles themselves. They were full of grief at his departure, and Jesus, in order to console them, directed them to the great honor which was to be conferred on them, and to the assurance that God would not leave them, but would attend them in their ministry with the demonstrations of his mighty power."
2. "The works that I do - The miracles of healing the sick, raising the dead, etc. This was done by the apostles in many instances."
3. "The most probable meaning of the passage is the following: The word 'greater' cannot refer to the miracles themselves, for the works of the apostles did not exceed those of Jesus in power. No higher exertion of power was put forth, or could be, than raising the dead. But, though not greater in themselves considered, yet they were greater in their effects. They made a deeper impression on mankind. They were attended with more extensive results."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Greater works. Not more remarkable miracles, but referring to the wider work of the apostolic ministry under the dispensation of the Spirit."

2. "This work was of a higher nature than mere bodily cures."

3. "Jesus' personal ministry in the flesh must be a local ministry. Only under the dispensation of the Spirit could it be universal."

### John Calvin:
1. "All that he had hitherto told his disciples about himself, so far as it regarded them, was temporal; and, therefore, if he had not added this clause, the consolation would not have been complete."
2. "And, indeed, not only was his Divinity attested, so long as he dwelt on the earth, but after he had gone to the Father, striking proofs of it were enjoyed by believers."
3. "Thus, we see that the proof of his Divinity was not confined to the person of Christ, but was diffused through the whole body of the Church."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "By ‘works’ we are obviously to understand something wider than miracles, for the promise is to all believers, and it cannot be said that they in any age have wrought greater miracles than their Lord."
2. "What Jesus speaks of is the general power of the spiritual life, not only as it exists in the breast of the believer, but as it shows itself in all life and action corresponding to its nature."
3. "They were to be put into His position, to take His place, to be sustained in all inward strength and outward manifestation as He had been."


### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Shall he do also" - Emphasizing the continuation of the works, highlighting the potential for even greater works to be done.
2. "Greater works than these" - Referring to works that are not necessarily greater in miracles or quality, but in quantity, such as the impact of Peter at Pentecost and Paul's mission tours.
3. "Because I go" - Explaining the reason for the expansion of works, made possible by the Holy Spirit as the Paraclete.

### John Gill:
1. "He assures his disciples, in order to comfort them under the loss of his bodily presence, that they should do the same, and greater works."
2. "The apostles, in a long series of time, and course of years, went about preaching the Gospel, not in Judea only, but in all the world."
3. "The conversion of a sinner, which is a miracle in grace, is not only an instance of the power of God, and of the greatness of it, but of the exceeding greatness of it."

### John Wesley:
1. "The converting one sinner is a greater work than all these."
2. "Greater works than these shall he do."
3. "Because I go to my Father — To send you the Holy Ghost."
