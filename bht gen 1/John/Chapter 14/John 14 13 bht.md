# John 14:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we find a powerful declaration of the authority and ability of Jesus Christ as the mediator between God and humanity. Through his name, believers have access to approach God and make their requests known. Jesus himself validates this, promising to fulfill these requests, bringing down the powerful Spirit of grace and supplication upon the Church. By calling on the name of Jesus, we not only seek our own blessings but also seek to glorify the Father through the wonders of grace and triumphs of the Spirit.
