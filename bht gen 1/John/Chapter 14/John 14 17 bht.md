# John 14:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Holy Spirit, the Spirit of truth, guides believers into the complete truth, reveals and defends the truth in Jesus, and dwells in them. The world, however, lacking spiritual insight and knowledge, cannot receive the Spirit or comprehend His presence. But for those who trust in Jesus, the Spirit resides within them, making their bodies and souls temples of His divine presence.
