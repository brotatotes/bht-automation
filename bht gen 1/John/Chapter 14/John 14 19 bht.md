# John 14:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we see a promise given by Christ to His disciples. The commentators point to the idea that the disciples will continue to see and have a spiritual connection with Jesus even after His bodily departure. Their vision of Him will be through the eyes of faith, not through physical sight. This spiritual connection is not just for a moment, but it assures believers of a continued and fulfilling life in the presence of Christ, both in this world and in the life to come.
