# John 14:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, the disciples are perplexed by Jesus' statement that He will manifest Himself to them, but not to the world. The mention of Judas in the question highlights the distinction between him and the infamous traitor. While some commentators believe that Judas misunderstands Jesus' words or is fixated on the idea of a visible Messianic revelation, others suggest that his question stems from ignorance or modesty. Ultimately, Judas's inquiry reflects both his desire for understanding and his struggle to grasp the profound mystery of Jesus' manifestation.
