### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "These words, which Arians and Socinians perpetually quote as triumphant evidence against the proper Divinity of Christ, really yield no intelligible sense on their principles."
2. "Does not this strange speech from Christ's lips, then, presuppose such teaching on His part as would make it extremely difficult for them to think He could gain anything by departing to the Father, and make it necessary for Him to say expressly that there was a sense in which He could do so?"
3. "Thus, this startling explanation seems plainly intended to correct such misapprehensions as might arise from the emphatic and reiterated teaching of His proper equality with the Father."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "If you had proper love for me; if you had the highest views of my character and work; if you would lay aside your Jewish prejudices, and put entire, implicit confidence in what I say."
2. "You would rejoice in the completion of the plan which requires me to return to heaven, that greater blessings may descend on you by the influences of the Holy Spirit."
3. "The object of this expression is to console the disciples in view of his absence. This he does by saying that if he goes away, the Holy Spirit will descend, and great success will attend the preaching of the gospel."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "This verse reveals Jesus' understanding of the disciples' mixed emotions. While they may have been saddened by His departure, Jesus assures them that if they truly understood the significance of His return to the Father, they would rejoice instead of mourn."
2. "Jesus' statement highlights the disciples' limited perspective. They were focused on their own loss and the physical separation from Jesus, rather than recognizing the greater purpose and eternal significance of His departure."

### John Calvin:
1. "If they had loved him spiritually, there was nothing which they would have had more deeply at heart, than his return to the Father."
2. "Christ does not now speak either of his human nature, or of his eternal Divinity, but, accommodating himself to our weakness, places himself between God and us."
3. "Christ does not here make a comparison between the Divinity of the Father and his own, nor between his own human nature and the Divine essence of the Father, but rather between his present state and the heavenly glory, to which he would soon afterwards be received."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The ‘going away’ of Jesus is really a ‘going unto the Father,’ a re-establishment in all the glory of the Father’s immediate presence."
2. "The Son, while of the same nature as the Father, is subordinate to Him, inferior economically, as Mediator."
3. "The departure of Jesus to His Father was an arrangement fraught with far higher blessings, both to His believing people and to the world, than His remaining among them would have been."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "If ye loved me...Ye would have rejoiced...at Christ's going to the Father." - The disciples' lack of love for Jesus is revealed through their failure to rejoice at his departure. This implies that true love for Jesus would result in joy and celebration at his exaltation to the Father.

2. "The filial relation makes this necessary. Not a distinction in nature or essence, but in rank in the Trinity." - The statement that the Father is greater than Jesus does not imply a difference in their essential nature, but rather a distinction in their roles and positions within the Trinity.

3. "The very explanation here is proof of the deity of the Son." - The fact that Jesus explains the distinction between himself and the Father is evidence of his divine nature. This refutes any notions of Arianism or Unitarianism, affirming the Son's equality with the Father in essence.

### John Gill:
1. "Christ assured his disciples that in a little time they should see him again, to their unspeakable joy and comfort."
2. "Had they considered things aright, since it was to his greater advantage to remove, they should rather have discovered a willingness to it, and have rejoiced at it; this would have shown pure love and unbiased affection to him."
3. "Two reasons our Lord gives why they should have rejoiced at his departure; one is, because he said, 'I go unto the Father'; the other is, 'for my Father is greater than I'."

### John Wesley:
1. "God the Father is greater than I — As he was man."
2. "As God, neither is greater nor less than the other."
3. "God the Father's greatness does not diminish the equality between the Father and the Son."
