### John Calvin:

2. "For example, the Prophets foretold the calling of the Gentiles with a true perception of faith, and yet Paul declares that it was a mystery hidden from them."

"The idea of separation is thus again brought prominently forward, and Thomas is overborne by the thought of it." - This statement highlights the theme of separation in the verse, emphasizing Thomas' emotional response to the prospect of Jesus leaving. It reminds us that the disciples, like us, can be overwhelmed by the challenges and uncertainties of life.

3. "His discouragement, which blinds his eyes, is uttered in the words before us." - This phrase captures the emotional state of Thomas, who is not only confused but also discouraged. It serves as a reminder that our doubts and discouragement can cloud our perception and hinder us from seeing the truth and the way forward.

1. "Thomas saith unto him, Lord,.... Who was one of his apostles, and here betrays his ignorance, as elsewhere his unbelief; and not only speaks for himself, but for the rest of the apostles, of whom he judged by himself; and who, it may be, might understand things better than himself, though their knowledge at present was but small."

2. "We know not whither thou goest; though he had but just told them of his Father's house, and of his going to prepare a place for them."

3. "And how can we know the way? for if we do not know the place, it is not reasonable to think we should know the way to it. Thomas seemed to have no other notion than that Christ was talking of some particular place in Judea, whither he was going, and of the road to it."
