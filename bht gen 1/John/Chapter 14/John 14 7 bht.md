# John 14:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse being described emphasizes a significant shift in the disciples' understanding of Jesus and His relation to the Father. From this point forward, through the revelations of Jesus, they will come to know and understand the true character of God. The knowledge of the Father and the Son go hand in hand, and it is through this knowledge that the disciples will truly grasp the deep verity of God's being. This knowledge is not merely intellectual, it is a transformative and lifelong journey of seeking, growing, and reflecting the love and righteousness of God.
