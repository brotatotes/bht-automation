# John 14:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The disciples, particularly Philip, reveal their limited understanding and desire for a physical manifestation of God in their request to see the Father. This highlights the misinterpretation of the verse and their ignorance of the true nature of Jesus. Their longing for a visible sight of God reflects the human desire for tangible evidence, rather than relying on faith and the works of Jesus. Ultimately, true knowledge and satisfaction come through a deep relationship with Jesus, rather than a mere physical sight of the Father.
