### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Remember" (μνημονευετε). Present active imperative of μνημονευω, old verb from μνημων, in John again in John 16:4; John 16:21. See John 13:16 for this word.

2. "If they persecuted me" (ε εμε εδιωξαν). Condition of first class. They certainly did persecute (first aorist active of διωκω, to chase like a wild beast like the Latin persequor, our "persecute") Jesus (John 5:16). They will persecute those like Jesus.

3. "But the alternative is true and is stated by Jesus with a like condition of the first class, 'if they kept my word' (ε τον λογον μου ετηρησαν). The world does praise the word of Jesus, but dreads to follow it."
