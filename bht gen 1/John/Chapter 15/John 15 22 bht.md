# John 15:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, commentators emphasize the inexcusable nature of the sin committed by the Jews. They had clear evidence, both in the miracles and teachings of Jesus, to believe in Him. Their rejection of Jesus as the Messiah was a deliberate act of hatred, leaving them without any valid pretext or excuse. The sin of rejecting Jesus is emphasized as a weighty sin, outweighing all others. The people had no rightful plea of ignorance, as Jesus had abundantly revealed Himself to them. This rejection of truth and love stands as a ground for their condemnation.
