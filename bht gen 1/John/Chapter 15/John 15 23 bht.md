# John 15:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the Bible verse described, there is a profound connection between the rejection of Christ and the rejection of God Himself. It is highlighted that when the world hates Christ, it is actually expressing hatred towards God. The hatred towards Christ, His Gospel, and His followers stems from the enmity that naturally resides in the heart of those who do not have faith in God. Through Christ, God is revealed, and to dishonor Christ is to dishonor God. The world's rejection of Christ and God is ultimately a manifestation of unbelief and the absence of love for God.
