1. "It is he, that...": The Lord solemnly asserts the interpretation of the allegory each mind was forming for itself, emphasizing that it is He who holds the true meaning. 

2. "Separate from Me, from being in Me and I in you": The phrase "without Me" implies being separated from the Lord, highlighting the importance of union with Him for fruitful living.

1. "Without me—apart, or vitally disconnected from Me."
2. "Ye can do nothing—spiritually, acceptably."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Without me" denotes the same as separate from me. As the branches, if separated from the parent stock, could produce no fruit, but would immediately wither and die, so Christians, if separate from Christ, could do nothing.
2. The expression strongly implies dependence. The Son of God was the original source of life and by his work as Mediator, gives life to the world. It is by the same grace and agency that life is continued in the Christian.
3. Christians will perform good works just in proportion as they feel their dependence on Christ and look to him. Others fail to be holy because they are unwilling to look to him and seek grace and strength from him, who alone is able to give it.
