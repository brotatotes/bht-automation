2. "Still more worthy of notice is the fact that, in the latter part of the verse, where the asking is spoken of, the words ‘in My name’ do not occur; but in their place we find, ‘If ye abide in Me, and My sayings abide in you.’ This strikingly illustrates what we have already endeavoured to bring out, that ‘in My name’ implies a union with Jesus by faith, resting on a knowledge of and adherence to the revelation that He has given."
