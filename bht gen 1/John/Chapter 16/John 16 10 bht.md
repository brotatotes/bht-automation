# John 16:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse being described speaks of the conviction brought about by the Holy Spirit, through which individuals are made aware of their own sin, the righteousness of Jesus, and the impending judgment. Commentators emphasize that the righteousness of Jesus is a central theme, underscoring His innocence, holiness, and approval from God. They highlight the significance of the Spirit's testimony, which confirms the righteousness of Jesus, even in His absence. Furthermore, the righteousness of Jesus not only assures salvation but also enables His intimate relationship with the Father.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "τοῦ κόσμου must be supplied after each of the three ἁμαρτία, δικαιοσύνη, κρίσις: the conviction being of a sin that is theirs, a righteousness that is (or, in the case of condemnation, might have been) theirs, a judgment which is theirs."
2. "Not their own, but that of the accepted Man Christ Jesus standing at the right hand of God... manifested in the hearts of men by the Spirit to be their only righteousness."
3. "It is the ὑπάγειν πρὸς τὸν πατέρα by which this righteousness is assured to us, and by the effect of which, the Spirit, the conviction respecting it is wrought in our hearts."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Beyond doubt, it is Christ's personal righteousness which the Spirit was to bring home to the sinner's heart."
2. "But if He was the 'Faithful and True Witness,' the Father's 'Righteous Servant,' 'His Elect, in whom His soul delighted,' then was His departure to the Father, and consequent disappearance from the view of men, but the fitting consummation, the august reward, of all that He did here below."
3. "This triumphant vindication of Christ's rectitude is to us divine evidence, bright as heaven, that He is indeed the Saviour of the world, God's Righteous Servant to justify many, because He bare their iniquities."

(Note: The commentary is quite long, so I have selected three quotes that capture the essence of the author's argument.)

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He was soon to be arraigned on heavy charges, and condemned by the highest authority of the nation as guilty. Yet, though condemned, he says that the Holy Spirit would descend and convince the world that he was innocent."
2. "God would not raise up an impostor. If he had been truly guilty, as the Jews who condemned him pretended, God would not have set his seal to the imposture by raising him from the dead."
3. "One of the deepest feelings which an awakened sinner has, is his conviction of the righteousness of Jesus Christ. He sees that he is holy; that his own opposition to him has been unprovoked, unjust, and base; and it is this which so often overwhelms his soul with the conviction of his own unworthiness, and with earnest desires to obtain a better righteousness than his own."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Withdraw from their sight and earthly fellowship." - This quote highlights the idea of separating oneself from the influence of worldly distractions and temptations.

3. "See on 1 18." - This quote refers to a previous explanation or reference that provides further insight into the concept being discussed.

### John Calvin:
1. "Men will never hunger and thirst for righteousness, but, on the contrary, will disdainfully reject all that is said concerning it, if they have not been moved by a conviction of sin."
2. "It is necessary to borrow from the Law that first clause of which Christ spoke."
3. "By righteousness must here be understood that which is imparted to us through the grace of Christ."

2. "Without Christ they lose the sense of righteousness."
3. "New morals" are seen as a result of losing the sense of righteousness.

### John Gill:
1. "The Spirit of God, by the mouth of Peter, on the day of 'Pentecost', proved, to the conviction of the Jews, that all this was slander; that Christ was an innocent, holy, and righteous person, and a man approved of God among them."
2. "The effusion of the Spirit in that extraordinary manner upon the disciples, showed that he was gone to the Father, and had received from him the promise of the Holy Ghost."
3. "The ordinary work of the Spirit of God upon the souls of his people, he always convinces them of the necessity of a righteousness to justify them before God, to render them acceptable in his sight, and to give them a right to the heavenly glory."

### John Wesley:
1. "The righteousness of Jesus is the basis for His ability to go to the Father. It is through His perfect obedience and sinless life that He is able to enter into the presence of God." 

2. "The testimony of the Spirit is a confirmation of the righteousness of Jesus. Even though the disciples cannot physically see Him, the Spirit bears witness to the truth of His righteousness." 

3. "The righteousness of Jesus is not only a personal attribute, but it also has a profound impact on His relationship with the Father. It is because of His righteousness that He is able to approach the Father and be in perfect communion with Him."
