### Henry Alford:
1. "The mode of expression is (purposely) enigmatical; the θεωρεῖτε and ὄψεσθε not being co-ordinate; the first referring merely to physical, the second also to spiritual sight."
2. "The ὄψεσθε began to be fulfilled at the Resurrection; then received its main fulfilment at the day of Pentecost; and shall have its final completion at the great return of the Lord hereafter."
3. "Remember again, that in all these prophecies we have a perspective of continually unfolding fulfilments presented to us."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The joy of the world at their not seeing Him seems to show that His removal from them by death was what He meant."
