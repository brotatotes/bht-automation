## BHT:
When Jesus speaks to his disciples, their understanding of his teachings is often limited. They struggle to grasp the deeper meaning behind his words and are confused by apparent contradictions. Instead of seeking clarification directly from Jesus, they discuss their confusion amongst themselves. Their lack of understanding, ignorance, and preoccupation with worldly expectations contribute to their struggles in comprehending the spiritual significance of his message.
