# John 16:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Believers may face persecution and rejection, even being expelled from their religious community, as a result of their faith. This opposition can come from both external enemies and those within the Church itself. Some may even go to the extreme of violence, believing they are serving God by persecuting and even killing believers. Hypocrites often disguise their wickedness under the pretense of religious zeal. Despite this, believers should remain steadfast and endure, knowing that their cause is approved by God.
