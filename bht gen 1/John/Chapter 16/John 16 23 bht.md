# John 16:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the disciples are reassured that in their future relationship with Jesus, there will be a shift in their interaction. They will no longer need to question or request things from Jesus directly, as they did during his earthly presence. Instead, they are encouraged to ask God in Jesus' name, and through the power of the Holy Spirit, they will receive what they need. Jesus assures them that by approaching the Father in His name, their prayers will be answered and their understanding will be deepened.

1. "Ye shall ask me nothing (εμε ουκ ερωτησετε). Either in the sense of question (original meaning of ερωταω) as in verses John 16:19; John 16:30 since he will be gone or in the sense of request or favours (like αιτεω in this verse) as in John 14:16; Acts 3:2."
