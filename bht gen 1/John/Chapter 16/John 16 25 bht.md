# John 16:25 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, Jesus speaks to his disciples using proverbs and figurative language, which seemed mysterious and unclear to them at the time. However, Jesus promises that a time will come when he will no longer speak in riddles, but will reveal the truths about the Father plainly. This revelation will be facilitated by the Holy Spirit, who will illuminate their understanding and grant them a clear comprehension of these teachings.

3. "This inward teaching, because it is a real imparting of the divine Nature and Life, brings with it not only prayer in the name of Jesus, but a free access to the Father Himself."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "In Proverbs—in obscure language, opposed to 'showing plainly'—that is, by the Spirit's teaching." 

2. "The use of obscure language in Proverbs serves as a contrast to the straightforward and direct teaching of the Spirit."
