# John 16:29 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the disciples are depicted as gradually grasping the deeper meaning of Jesus' teachings. Initially perplexed by his words, their understanding slowly unfolds, and they express satisfaction with Jesus' explanation. The commentators emphasize the disciples' limited comprehension and the simplicity of their faith. They note that while Jesus spoke plainly, his message carried a deeper significance beyond their capacity to fully grasp. The verse is described as a profound statement, distinct from a proverb or superficial saying, and additional references are suggested for a richer understanding.
