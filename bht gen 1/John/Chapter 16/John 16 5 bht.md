# John 16:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The disciples, in their confusion and grief over Jesus' departure, fail to ask the important questions regarding the nature and purpose of his leaving. They rely too heavily on his physical presence and are hesitant to inquire about the future and the benefits that will come from his departure. This lack of inquiry reveals their need for guidance and a deeper understanding of Jesus' teachings. The disciples' silence contrasts with their previous inquiries, emphasizing the missed opportunity to seek wisdom and gain insight into the heavenly realm and their own salvation.

1. "These words seem to belong to John 16:4, and to contain a reason why Christ spoke of the trials and afflictions of his disciples now, because he was going away from them to his Father; when as they would be at the head of his affairs in this world, so they would the more become the butt of the rage of men."
2. "Peter indeed asked the question, John 13:36; but his meaning was, what part of the country he was going to? what private and inaccessible place he was about to betake himself to? he had no notion of his going out of the world, or to heaven to his Father, and therefore inquired nothing about it."
3. "Nor did they ask what he meant by his Father's house, or what those mansions were he was going to prepare; and what the glory was he was going to possess for himself and them; they ask neither about the place he was going to, nor the way to it, nor the happiness to be enjoyed there."
