# John 16:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The disciples' hearts were overwhelmed with sorrow, completely consumed by the absence of Jesus. Their grief was so consuming that it prevented them from understanding where Jesus was going and the significance of his departure. Despite their lack of insight, knowing the purpose and destination should have alleviated their distress and brought them comfort. However, their lack of understanding only intensified their sorrow and prevented them from finding solace in Jesus' departure.
