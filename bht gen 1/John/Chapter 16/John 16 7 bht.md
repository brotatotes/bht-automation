# John 16:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The departure of Jesus may seem counterintuitive, but it is actually beneficial for his disciples. Through his departure, the Holy Spirit is able to manifest more fully and provide guidance and comfort to believers. This new dispensation, brought about by the gift of the Spirit, brings a deeper understanding of the divine plan of redemption. While Jesus could only be physically present in one place at a time, the Holy Spirit can be present everywhere, uplifting and empowering believers. The departure of Jesus and the coming of the Holy Spirit work together to ensure the fulfillment of God's redemptive plan.

3. "The gift of the Spirit at and since the day of Pentecost, was and is something TOTALLY DISTINCT from anything before that time: a new and loftier dispensation."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "By his departure, his death, and ascension - by having these great facts before their eyes they would be led by the Holy Spirit to see more fully the design of his coming than they would by his presence."
2. "While on the earth the Lord Jesus could be bodily present but in one place at one time. Yet, in order to secure the great design of saving men, it was needful that there should be some agent who could be in all places, who could attend all ministers, and who could, at the same time, apply the work of Christ to people in all parts of the earth."
3. "It was an evident arrangement in the great plan of redemption that each of the persons of the Trinity should perform a part. As it was not the work of the Spirit to make an atonement, so it was not the work of the Saviour to apply it."

3. "The expediency of Christ's death for the mission of the Spirit to his disciples, is very conspicuous; for hereby they were comforted and supported under a variety of troubles; were led into all truth, and so furnished for their ministerial work; and were made abundantly successful in it, that being attended with the demonstration of the Spirit and of power."
