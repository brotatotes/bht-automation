# John 16:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Bible verse being described is one that speaks of the profound impact and ministry of the Holy Spirit in the world. Through the Spirit, individuals are convincingly shown the reality of sin and their need for righteousness and judgment. The Spirit's work extends beyond the believers, reaching the entire world, presenting fair and sufficient arguments that lead to conviction and self-condemnation. This promise given to the disciples empowers them with the heavenly and Divine jurisdiction to exercise influence over the world, silencing it and overwhelming it with shame.
