# John 16:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse being described highlights the root sin of unbelief in Christ as the Son of God, which is the essence of all sins. It emphasizes that rejecting Jesus is not simply a matter of intellectual disagreement, but a manifestation of pride and a violation of God's law. The Spirit's work is crucial in convicting individuals of their sinfulness, both in their nature and in their actual sins, leading them to recognize their need for faith in Jesus to be reconciled with God.
