## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The Lord here, as Cyril remarks, compares His keeping of His own, to that by the Father, in a way only accountable by both Persons being of equal Power and Dignity."
2. "...of such persons it is true that there is for them no ‘gratia irresistibilis,’ no ‘keeping in God’s Name’ independently of their ‘keeping God’s word,’ John 17:6, which Judas did not do."
3. "As the other disciples by true τήρησις of the divine ῥήματα given to them, rose from being natural men to be the children of God, so Judas, through want of the same, sunk from the state of the natural man to that of the lost the children of the devil."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "I kept—guarded them in thy name—acting as Thy Representative on earth." 
2. "none of them is lost, but the son of perdition." 
3. "It is not implied here that the son of perdition was one of those whom the Father had given to the Son, but rather the contrary."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "While I was with them in the world - While I was engaged with them among other men - surrounded by the people and the temptations of the world." 

2. "I kept them - By my example, instructions, and miracles. I preserved them from apostasy."

3. "But the son of perdition - See the notes at Matthew 1:1. The term son was given by the Hebrews to those who possessed the character described by the word or name following. Thus, sons of Belial - those who possessed his character; children of wisdom those who were wise, Matthew 11:19. Thus Judas is called a son of perdition because he had the character of a destroyer. He was a traitor and a murderer."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "I kept them, now do Thou keep them." - The commentary emphasizes the transition from the speaker's past act of keeping to the request for God to continue keeping. This highlights the importance of God's ongoing protection and preservation.

2. "The former word means, I preserved them; the latter, I guarded them as a means to their preservation." - This quote explains the distinction between the two words used for "keeping" in the verse. It deepens our understanding of the speaker's role in preserving and guarding what was entrusted to them.

3. "None of them perished, but the son of perishing." - This play on words draws attention to the contrast between the speaker's successful keeping and the one who was lost. It underscores the significance of God's keeping power and the tragic outcome of not being kept by Him.

### John Calvin:
1. "He means, therefore, that it were most unreasonable to suppose that they would now perish, as if by his departure the power of God had been extinguished or dead."
2. "He speaks here of visible guardianship only which ended at the death of Christ; for, while he dwelt on earth, he needed not to borrow power from another, in order to keep his disciples."
3. "What thou didst commit to me I have faithfully executed, and I took care that nothing was lost in my hands; and when thou now receivest what thou hadst intrusted to me, it belongs to thee to see that it continue to be safe and sound."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The sad change that is to take place in the condition of His disciples after He has ‘gone away’ presses on His mind; He recalls tenderly the care with which He had hitherto watched over them in an evil world; and now that He can no longer show that care, He commends them with longing earnestness to the Father."
2. "The word ‘I’ is very emphatic, ‘I kept them: now do Thou.’ The distinction between ‘kept’ and ‘guarded’ is not to be found in the thought of different spheres, such as inward and outward, to which it may be supposed that the words apply; but in the fact that the latter word points to the watchfulness by which the former is attained."
3. "The wonderful fact itself, when rightly viewed, affords evidence that He has fulfilled His promise that He will keep His own. It was in carrying out the Father’s will that not one of the Eleven had been lost: it was in carrying out the same will that Judas had met his fate."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Christ was the sentinel for them. Is he our sentinel now?"
2. "The very phrase for antichrist. Note play on perished. It means the son marked by final loss, not annihilation, but meeting one's destiny."
3. "The Scripture referred to is probably Psalms 41:9 quoted in John 13:18 with the same formula, 'that the Scripture might be fulfilled.'"

Note: The quote "As for the servants whom I have given thee, there shall not one of them perish; for I will require them from among thy number" is not from the Bible, but from the apocryphal book 2 Esdras.

### John Wesley:
1. "So far was even that decree from being unchangeable!" - This quote highlights the idea that even though God had given Jesus a group of followers, one of them was still lost. It challenges the notion of an unchangeable decree and suggests that even God's plans can be altered.
2. "The son of perdition signifies one that deservedly perishes." - This quote explains the meaning of "son of perdition" as someone who deserves to be lost or destroyed. It adds depth to the understanding of the term and emphasizes the consequences of one's actions.

"Children of hell, Matthew 23:15, and children of wrath, Ephesians 2:3, signify persons justly obnoxious to death, hell, wrath." - This quote connects the phrase "son of perdition" to other biblical references such as "children of hell" and "children of wrath." It suggests that these terms all refer to individuals who are deserving of punishment and serves to reinforce the concept of divine justice.
