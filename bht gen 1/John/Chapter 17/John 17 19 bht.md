## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "It is clear against all Socinian inferences from this verse, that all that part of ἁγιάζειν implied in ch. Joh 10:36 is here excluded: and only that intended which is expressed Heb 2:10 by διὰ παθημάτων τελειῶσαι."
2. "The confining the meaning to His sacrifice (Chrys., Euthym), and the ἵνα καὶ αὐτοὶ.… to their martyrdom, or their spiritual self-offering, Romans 12:1 (Euthym), is insufficient for the depth of the words."
3. "ἐν ἀληθ. ] in truth: what truth, is evident from John 17:17, where, in the repetition, ὁ λόγ. ὁ σὸς ἀλήθειά ἐστιν, the article is also wanting: see also ch. John 1:14; John 4:24: 3 John 1:3, for ἀλήθ, without the article."

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "The only difference between the application of the same term to Christ and the disciples is, as applied to Christ, that it means only to 'consecrate'; whereas, in application to the disciples, it means to consecrate with the additional idea of previous sanctification, since nothing but what is holy can be presented as an offering."
2. "The whole self-sacrificing work of the disciples appears here as a mere result of the offering of Christ."
3. "Though the article is wanting in the original here, we are not to translate, as in the Margin, 'truly sanctified'; for the reference seems plainly to be 'the truth' mentioned in John 17:17."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "I sanctify myself - I consecrate myself exclusively to the service of God."
2. "Ministers will understand their work best when they most faithfully study the example of their great model, the Son of God."
3. "That they might be made pure by the effect of my sanctifying myself - that is, that they might be made pure by the shedding of that blood which cleanses from all sin."

### John Calvin:
1. "By these words he explains more clearly from what source that sanctification flows, which is completed in us by the doctrine of the Gospel."
2. "For as the blessing on the first-fruits is spread over the whole harvest, so the Spirit of God cleanses us by the holiness of Christ and makes us partakers of it."
3. "He has, so to speak, presented us to his Father in his own person, that we may be renewed to true holiness by his Spirit."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "It was for the very purpose of bringing them to a consecration like His own that His whole work of love and sacrifice had been freely undertaken."
2. "The following words express, with special reference to the disciples, the end which Jesus had been desirous to attain. It is that their consecration might be the exact counterpart of His."
3. "Finally, let us notice that the consecration spoken of is, alike in the case of Jesus and of His disciples, not a process but an act completed at once."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "I sanctify myself": Jesus' act of sanctifying himself is connected to the Father's sanctification of him, highlighting the divine nature of his ministry (John 10:36).

2. "That they themselves also may be sanctified in truth": Jesus' purpose in sanctifying himself is for the sanctification of his followers, emphasizing the importance of personal consecration in the believer's life (John 17:19).

3. "This high and holy prayer and act of Christ should shame anyone who uses the livery of heaven to serve the devil": Jesus' prayer and act of sanctification should serve as a rebuke to those who claim to serve God but are actually serving evil, reminding us of the seriousness of our commitment to God (2 Corinthians 11:13-15).

### John Gill:
1. "He never was a sinner, and so stood in no need of sanctification: he was made like unto us, yet without sin; he looked like a sinner, but was not one; he was traduced, charged, and treated as such, but was perfectly holy, and free from all sin."
2. "Rather this may be meant of his being separated, and set apart for his office as Mediator, which, though done by the Father, and is ascribed unto him, John 10:36; yet may also be attributed to himself; since he voluntarily devoted himself to this work, and cheerfully accepted of it."
3. "He himself is also the sanctifier or offerer, which shows him to be a priest, and that he had a power over his own life, and that he sacrificed it voluntarily."
