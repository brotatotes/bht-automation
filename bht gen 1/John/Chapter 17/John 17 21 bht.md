In this verse, the commentators emphasize the importance of unity among believers.

This unity is modeled after the inseparable relationship between the Father and the Son.

1. "The subject-matter of the prayer is, that they may be kept in God’s name and sanctified in God’s truth; and if this be so, their unity with the Son and the Father follows."
2. "This unity has its true and only ground in faith in Christ through the Word of God as delivered by the Apostles; and is therefore not mere outward uniformity, nor can such uniformity produce it."
3. "Rather is it, ‘that this their testimony, being borne by them all, and in all ages, may continue to convince the world, so that many in the world may believe,’ &c."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The unity spoken of, then, is not merely that of Christians among themselves, whether outward or inward. It is unity in the Father and the Son, effected by that ‘word’ regarding the Son in the Father and the Father in the Son which has been appropriated in faith, and which produces a result corresponding to itself." 
2. "It is what is known by divines as the ‘mystical union;’ yet in it believers maintain their own personality and freedom, for such is the force of ‘they themselves.’"
