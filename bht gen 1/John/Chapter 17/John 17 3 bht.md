# John 17:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse being described is about the knowledge of God and eternal life. It emphasizes that true eternal life is not simply conscious existence but a living reality of knowledge and personal realization, a oneness with God that comes through knowing Him and His Son Jesus Christ. This knowledge is not a mere intellectual or speculative understanding, but a practical and experiential one that leads to a deepening relationship with God. It is through Jesus Christ, the Mediator, that we come to know the Father and partake in the eternal life to which we are called.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The knowledge spoken of is no mere head or heart knowledge, the mere information of the mind, or excitation of the feelings, but that living reality of knowledge and personal realization, that oneness in will with God, and partaking of His nature, which IS itself life eternal." 
2. "The very juxtaposition of Jesus Christ here with the Father, and the knowledge of both being defined to be eternal life, is a proof by implication of the Godhead of the former."
3. "He who said σου τὸν υἱόν, John 17:1, might well here, before the ἐγώ of John 17:4, use that prophetic Name [Ἰησοῦς] which had been divinely given Him as the Saviour of men, and its weighty adjunct χριστός."

3. "Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent—This is the only place where our Lord gives Himself this compound name, afterwards so current in apostolic preaching and writing."

### Albert Barnes:

2. "To know God as he is" is to know and regard him as a lawgiver, a sovereign, a parent, a friend.
3. "To know Jesus Christ is to have a practical impression of him as he is - that is, to suffer his character and work to make their due impression on the heart and life."

### Marvin Vincent:

### John Calvin:
1. "And that this verse may be fully understood, we ought first to know that we are all in death, till we are enlightened by God, who alone is life."
2. "To know thee, and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent... it is by the intervention of a Mediator that God is known."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Those, then, who receive 'eternal life' enter into a condition in which they learn to know the Father and the Son as They really are, learn to know Them in Their love and saving mercy, and are thus enabled to 'glorify' Them." 
2. "The knowledge of the Father and the Son is neither the condition of the 'life,' nor the same thing as the 'life.' It is rather that far-off goal which is constantly before us, and to which we come ever nearer, in proportion as we enter more deeply into the life which Christ bestows."
3. "The 'eternal life' is thus also a present thing, stretching indeed into the endless future, but begun now."

### John Gill:
1. "The knowledge of God here spoken of, is not the knowledge of him by the light of nature, and works of creation; for a man may know God in this sense, and not know him in Christ, nor anything of Christ."
2. "But this is to be understood of an evangelic knowledge of God, as the God and Father of Christ, as the God of all grace, pardoning iniquity, transgression and sin, and of Christ Mediator; not a general, notional, and speculative knowledge; but a practical and experimental one."
3. "The reason of this different mode of expression, is owing to the character of Christ as Mediator, who is said to be sent by the only true God, about the business of man's salvation."
