# John 17:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, Jesus makes a fervent request, emphasizing the intimate and personal nature of His prayer to God. He specifically prays for His disciples, who have been transformed and separated from the world, seeking blessings that are applicable only to them. While Jesus does not pray for the world in this particular instance, He had previously shown His concern for the world, desiring that all may believe and come to know that God sent Him. Jesus' prayer highlights His deep care for His followers and the distinctiveness of their relationship with Him and the Father.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The Lord does pray distinctly for ὁ κόσμος, John 17:21; John 17:23, that they may believe and know that the Father hath sent Him. He cannot therefore mean here that He does not pray (absolutely) for the world, but that He is not now asking for the world, does not pray this thing for the world." 

2. "These (οὓς δέδωκάς μοι) have already believed and known; the prayer for them is therefore a different one, viz. that in John 17:11; John 17:15."

3. "ὅτι σοί εἰσιν in a fuller sense than σοὶ ἦσαν, John 17:6. That was their preparation for Christ; this is their abiding in Him, which is abiding in the Father, see next verse."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

### John Calvin:
1. "He openly declares that he does not pray for the world, because he has no solicitude but about his own flock, which he received from the hand of the Father."
2. "We ought to pray that this man, and that man, and every man, may be saved, and thus include the whole human race, because we cannot yet distinguish the elect from the reprobate."
3. "Christ expressly declares that they who are given to him belong to the Father; and it is certain that they are given so as to believe, and that faith flows from this act of giving."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The substance of His prayer is that they, occupying His place, may be so preserved as to be what He had been, true to the word given them, victorious over the devil, consecrated, filled with joy, to His glory and the glory of the Father in Him."
2. "Without denouncing the ‘world,’ therefore, He simply sets it aside. It may indeed be asked, Why mention it at all? The answer probably is, to bring out that perfect correspondence between the will of the Son and of the Father, which is the ground of the Son’s confidence in prayer."
3. "Because they are thine. In John 17:6 it had been ‘They were thine:’ then they had been looked at only as the possession of the Father. Now ‘they are thine:’ they have been brought back to Him and united to Him in a closer, dearer bond than ever, the bond of fellowship in the Son."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Not for the world (ου περ του κοσμου). Now at this point in the prayer Christ means."

3. "For those whom (περ ων). A condensed and common Greek idiom for περ τουτων ους with τουτων (the demonstrative antecedent) omitted and the relative ους attracted from the accusative ους (object of δεδωκας) to the case (genitive) of the omitted antecedent."

### John Gill:
1. "Praying, as attributed to Christ, must be restrained to his state of humiliation; prayer is never spoken of Christ but whilst he was here on earth; his intercession in heaven is never expressed by prayer."
2. "Christ whilst on earth, was an excellent pattern of prayer; of private and solitary prayer; of social prayer; for and with his disciples; of frequent and fervent prayer; of submission to the will of God in prayer; and of praying even for enemies."
3. "For whom he is the propitiation, he is an advocate; and for whom he died, he makes intercession; and for no other in a spiritual saving way."
