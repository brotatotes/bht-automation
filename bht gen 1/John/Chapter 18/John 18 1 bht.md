# John 18:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, Jesus willingly goes to His death, surrendering Himself freely and willingly. He crosses the brook Kedron, a deep ravine that symbolizes tribulation and judgment. The brook, also known as the brook of the cedars, represents the darkness and troubles of this world that believers must pass through to reach the heavenly paradise. It held both historical significance, as David crossed it while fleeing from his son Absalom, and typological significance, as Jesus crosses it on His way to face the rejection and betrayal of the Jewish people.

1. "This brook was but about three feet over from bank to bank, and in the summer time was quite dry, and might be walked over dry shod; and is therefore by Josephus sometimes called the brook of Kidron, and sometimes the valley of Kidron: in this valley were corn fields; for hither the sanhedrim sent their messengers to reap the sheaf of the firstfruits, which always was to be brought from a place near to Jerusalem." 

2. "It was an emblem of this world, and the darkness and filthiness of it, and of the exercises and troubles of the people of God in it, which lie in the way to the heavenly paradise and Mount of Zion, through which Christ himself went, drinking 'of the brook in the way,' Psalms 110:7; and through which also all his disciples and followers enter into the kingdom of heaven."

3. "Once more let it be observed, that it was the brook David passed over when he fled from his son Absalom; in this David was a type of Christ, as in other things: Absalom represented the people of the Jews, who rejected the Messiah, and rebelled against him; Ahithophel, Judas, who betrayed him; and the people that went with David over it, the disciples of our Lord; only there was this difference; there was a father fleeing from a son, here a son going to meet his father's wrath; David and his people wept when they went over this brook, but so did not Christ and his disciples; the sorrowful scene to them both began afterwards in the garden."
