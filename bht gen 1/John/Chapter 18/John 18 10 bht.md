# John 18:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this passage, we witness Peter's fierce loyalty to Jesus as he defends him with a sword, cutting off the right ear of the high priest's servant. The mention of the servant's name, Malchus, serves as a testament to the accuracy of the account. Interestingly, while the other evangelists choose not to reveal Peter's involvement in this incident, John, writing later, freely includes Peter's name as he narrates the events. This highlights John's attention to detail and his desire to provide a comprehensive and truthful account of what transpired.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "At this time took place the kiss of Judas, in accordance with the agreement entered into, and to assure the captors that the person thus offering Himself was indeed Jesus of Nazareth."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "None of the other Evangelists mention the name either of the ardent disciple or of his victim. John being 'known to the high priest' (18:15), the mention of the servant's name by him is quite natural, and an interesting mark of truth in a small matter."
2. "As to the right ear, specified both here and in Luke (22:51), the man was 'likely foremost of those who advanced to seize Jesus, and presented himself in the attitude of a combatant; hence his right side would be exposed to attack."
3. "The blow of Peter was evidently aimed vertically at his head."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The incident itself is related by all the Evangelists."
2. "Contrary to the rule which forbade the carrying of weapons on a feast-day."

### John Calvin:
1. "Let us learn that, in the person of Peter, Christ condemns every thing that men dare to attempt out of their own fancy."
2. "This doctrine is eminently worthy of attention; for nothing is more common than to defend, under the cloak of zeal, every thing that we do, as if it were of no importance whether God approved, or not, what men suppose to be right."
3. "Warned by so striking an example, let us learn to keep our zeal within proper bounds; and as the wantonness of our flesh is always eager to attempt more than God commands, let us learn that our zeal will succeed ill, whenever we venture to undertake any thing contrary to the word of God."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Simon Peter therefore having a sword drew it, and smote the high priest’s servant, and cut off his right ear." - The mention of Peter's action with the sword highlights his bold and determined nature, emphasizing his role as the rock among the disciples.

2. "The mention of this fact, as well as of the minute circumstance that the ear cut off was the right ear, illustrates the personal knowledge possessed by John of what he describes." - John's attention to detail, such as knowing the servant's name and the specific ear that was cut off, demonstrates his intimate knowledge of the events he is recounting.

3. "As the great object of John in this passage is to illustrate the perfect submission of Jesus to the will of His heavenly Father in the ‘hour’ now come, nothing is said of the healing of the ear." - The focus of this passage is not on the healing of the servant's ear but rather on Jesus' submission to God's will, highlighting his obedience even in the face of violence.

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "It was unlawful to carry a weapon on a feast-day, but Peter had become alarmed at Christ's words about his peril."
2. "Peter missed the man's head as he swerved to his left."
3. "There was peril to Peter in his rash act as comes out later."
