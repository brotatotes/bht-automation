# John 18:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we see a striking allusion to the prayer in Gethsemane, as Jesus willingly accepts the cup of suffering, despite his aversion to it, as it is the will of the Father. He admonishes Peter to put his sword back into its sheath, emphasizing that his warfare is not a carnal one, but a spiritual one with certain victory. Jesus acknowledges his divine power, knowing that he could call upon heavenly assistance, but he chooses to fulfill the Scriptures and submit to his impending suffering, enduring the cup of God's wrath and punishment for the sake of humanity.

1. "We must also beware of repelling our enemies by force or violence, even when they unjustly provoke us, except so far as the institutions and laws of the community admit; for whoever goes beyond the limits of his calling, though he should gain the applause of the whole world, will never obtain for his conduct the approbation of God."
2. "Scripture compares afflictions to medicinal draughts; for, as the master of a house distributes meat and drink to his children and servants, so God has this authority over us, that he has a right to treat every one as he thinks fit; and whether he cheers us by prosperity, or humbles us by adversity, he is said to administer a sweet or a bitter draught."
3. "Knowing that we must once die, we ought to be prepared for death; but the time of our death being unknown to us, the Lord permits us to defend our life by those aids which he has himself appointed. We must patiently endure diseases, however grievous they may be to our flesh; and though they do not yet appear to be mortal, we ought to seek alleviation of them; only we must be careful not to attempt any thing but what is permitted by the word of God."
