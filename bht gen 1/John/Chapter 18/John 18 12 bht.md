In this verse, we see a profound moment when Jesus, willingly surrendering Himself, allows Himself to be taken, bound, and led away by His captors.

By referring to Judas as "friend," He exemplifies the importance of extending forgiveness and love, even in the face of betrayal. This act of surrender also fulfills the purpose of His mission, breaking the cords of sin, Satan, and the law, and ultimately leading to the liberation of humanity.
