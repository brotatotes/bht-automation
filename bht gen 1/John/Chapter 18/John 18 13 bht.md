# John 18:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Before being taken to the high priest Caiaphas, Jesus was brought to Annas, who had previously held the position of high priest. This demonstrates the continued influence and power Annas held within the religious hierarchy. The strategic nature of this decision is evident, as the religious leaders sought Annas' guidance and approval while also gathering evidence against Jesus. Despite the lack of recorded events during this preliminary examination, the mention of Annas provides a more complete picture of the trial and enhances the historical accuracy of the Gospel.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The influence of Annas appears to have been very great, and Acts 4:6, he is called the High Priest, in the year following this."
2. "The whole matter is discussed in Friedlieb, Arch. der Leid. § 22. He ends by saying that the narrative evidently rests upon some arrangement with regard to the High Priesthood now unknown to us."
3. "That hearing was in a public court of justice, before the assembled Sanhedrim; this was a private and informal questioning."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The fact that Jesus was led to Annas first before being taken to the high priest Caiaphas is significant. Annas was the father-in-law of Caiaphas and had previously held the position of high priest. This suggests that Annas still held significant influence and power within the religious hierarchy, even though he was no longer officially serving as high priest."

2. "The sequence of events highlights the political and religious dynamics at play during Jesus' trial. The religious leaders were not only concerned with maintaining their religious authority but also with appeasing the Roman authorities. By bringing Jesus to Annas first, they may have been seeking his approval or guidance on how to handle the situation."

3. "The decision to take Jesus to Annas first also reveals the strategic nature of the religious leaders. They wanted to gather as much evidence as possible against Jesus and build a strong case for his condemnation. By questioning him before Annas, they hoped to elicit incriminating statements or admissions that could be used against him in his trial before Caiaphas and the Sanhedrin."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Annas had great authority and influence in the Jewish nation."
2. "He had been himself a long time high priest."
3. "It was of importance, therefore, to obtain his sanction and counsel in their work of evil."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Annas first. This supplies the detail of an examination preliminary to that before the high-priest, which is omitted by the Synoptists."
2. "Father-in-law [πενθερος]. Only here in the New Testament."
3. "That same year. See on 11 49."

### John Calvin:
1. "The other Evangelists omit this circumstance, because it does not greatly affect the substance of the narrative; for nothing was done there that was worthy of being recorded."
2. "Perhaps the convenience of the place induced them to imprison Christ in the house of Annas, till the high priest assembled the council."
3. "By the injunction of the Law, this honor was perpetual, and ended only at the death of him who held it; but ambition and intestine broils gave occasion to the Roman governors to dethrone one high priest and put another in his room, at their own pleasure, either for money or for favor."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The word 'first' is worthy of notice...the clear and decided manner in which the writer of the Fourth Gospel corrects impressions drawn from the incomplete statements of the earlier Gospels." 
2. "That Jesus was taken before Annas 'first' is the statement of John, and the very distinctness with which it is made is no small evidence that we are dealing with real history." 
3. "The mention of Annas provides a more complete picture of the events surrounding Jesus' trial and adds credibility to the historical accuracy of the Gospel."

### John Gill:
1. "He and Caiaphas seem to have had the high priesthood alternately; and either now, because his house lay first in the way, or rather, because he was a man of age, learning, and experience, as these men usually were, that they might supply the deficiencies of the high priests, who were sometimes very weak and unlearned men."
2. "He was father-in-law to Caiaphas; so that he was, it is very probable, the older man: and being related to him, had an interest in him; and to whom such a sight was equally pleasing as to the high priest himself, or any of the council."
3. "The high priesthood was not for life, but was often changed, being bought and sold for money; so that this clause is very properly added, though Caiaphas held it longer, or, at least, had it more years than one."

### John Wesley:
1. "Annas had been high priest before his son-in-law Caiaphas." 

2. "They paid so much regard to his age and experience, that they brought Christ to Annas first." 

3. "But we do not read of anything remarkable which passed at the house of Annas."
