## BHT:
In this verse, an ill-willed high priest unknowingly prophesies the necessity of Jesus' sacrificial death for the salvation of God's chosen people.

This verse emphasizes the sovereignty of God, orchestrating even the intentions of the wicked to accomplish His redemptive purposes. Jesus stands before Annas, aware of His impending fate, bound and submissive.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The reference to Caiaphas in John 11:49-52 provides important context for understanding this verse."
2. "The phrase 'τοῦ ἐνιαυτοῦ ἐκείνου' in John 18:13 is also relevant to interpreting this passage."
3. "By referencing these other passages, the commentary suggests that there is a deeper significance to the events described in this verse."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Caiaphas, the high priest, was not aware of the prophetic significance of his words, but God used him to speak a profound truth. In his role as high priest, Caiaphas unknowingly prophesied that Jesus would die for the salvation of the people." 

2. "The concept of substitutionary atonement is highlighted in this verse. Jesus, as the perfect and innocent sacrifice, would take upon himself the sins of the people and offer himself as a ransom for their salvation."

3. "This verse reminds us of the divine sovereignty and providence at work even in the words and actions of those who oppose Jesus. God can use even the intentions of the wicked to accomplish His redemptive purposes."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "This is referred to here, probably, to show how little prospect there was that Jesus would have justice done him in the hands of a man who had already pronounced on the case."
2. "The words of Caiaphas were, in fact, a prophecy, though he did not intend it so. God overruled his wickedness to accomplish his own purposes."
3. "The high priest, in his official capacity, was the representative of the Jewish nation, and his words were regarded as expressing the sentiments of the people."

### John Calvin:
1. "God employed the foul mouth of a wicked and treacherous high priest to utter a prediction." 
2. "Just as he guided the tongue of the prophet Balaam, contrary to his wish, so that he was constrained to bless the people, though he desired to curse them." 
3. "To gain favor with king Balak."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The reason why Jesus was taken to Annas first is not to be found in the mere fact of his relationship to Caiaphas, but that it is to be sought also in that character of the latter which, it was hoped, would influence the former."
2. "Caiaphas had lost self-control, and had become a mere instrument in the hands of higher powers who were urging him onward to fill up the measure of his guilt."
3. "Before this powerful man then Jesus stands, bound, submissive, knowing the fate that is before Him."
