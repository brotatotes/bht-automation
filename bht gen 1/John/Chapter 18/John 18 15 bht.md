# John 18:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, a disciple, possibly John himself, follows Jesus into a court. It is unlikely that this disciple is Simon Peter or Judas Iscariot. While John describes the follower as "the other disciple," it is evident that this person is well-known to the high priest. Though Peter attempts to enter, Jesus will have left before Peter gains admittance. Following Jesus in both faith and suffering is a commendable quality, even though Peter's decision to follow at that moment may not have been wise.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "There is no reason to doubt the universal persuasion that by this name John intends himself."
2. "The idea that it was Judas Iscariot is surely too absurd to need confutation."
3. "The whole character of the incident will prevent any real student of St. John’s style and manner from entertaining such a supposition for a moment."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Simon Peter followed Jesus—Natural though this was, and safe enough, had he only 'watched and prayed that he enter not into temptation,' as his Master bade him (Matthew 26:41), it was, in his case, a fatal step." 

2. "and . . . another disciple—Rather, 'the other disciple'—our Evangelist himself, no doubt." 

3. "known unto the high priest—(See on John 18:1)."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The correct reading omits the article."
2. "Probably John himself."
3. "Not palace, but court."

### John Calvin:
1. "It is more probable that he was not one of the twelve, but that he is called a disciple, because he had embraced the doctrine of the Son of God."
2. "John is not very exact in arranging the narrative, being satisfied with drawing up a brief summary."
3. "We must, therefore, understand that, when Christ was brought before the high priest, admission was not granted to any person who chose, but that the disciple who was known to the high priest requested, as a personal favor, that Peter might be admitted."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Simon is still ‘the rock,’ notwithstanding what he is about to do. It is the very fact indeed that he is ‘Peter’ which shows how terrible is the moment, and how deep the stab inflicted upon Jesus." 

2. "But so far is John from wishing to depreciate his fellow-apostle that he regards him, even in the midst of his greatest defection, as the lion of the apostolic band, the man to whom Jesus had given the name Peter in order to indicate his boldness."

3. "During them Jesus passes through. The two apostles do not pass through at the same instant: John alone finds immediate admittance; and we are justified in saying that, before Peter has well begun his parley at the door, Jesus will be out of sight."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Peter's companion was the Beloved Disciple, the author of the book."
2. "How well known the word does not say, not necessarily a personal friend, well enough known for the portress to admit John."
3. "It is not clear that this word ever means the palace itself instead of the courtyard (uncovered enclosure) as always in the papyri (very common)."

### John Gill:
1. "To follow Christ is a property of his sheep, and is highly commendable, especially to follow him in sufferings; a greater character a person cannot well have, than to be a follower of Jesus, in the exercise of grace, in the discharge of duty, and in bearing the cross."
2. "It does not appear that Peter did well in following Christ now; for Christ had cautioned him of his over confidence, had hinted to him that he should deny him, and had dismissed him, and took his leave of him."
3. "Rather it was some one of the disciples of Christ, who had not openly professed him; one of the chief rulers that believed in him, but, for fear of the Pharisees, had not confessed him; it may be Nicodemus, or Joseph of Arimathea, or the man at whose house Christ had eaten the passover."
