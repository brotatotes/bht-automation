# John 18:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
At a door in Jerusalem, a woman, who had served as a porter, guarded the entrance while Peter stood outside. The detailed account reveals the naturalness of these small details, describing how the disciple gained entrance through his acquaintance with the high priest, while Peter was left in suspense outside. The simplicity of the narrative emphasizes the significance of Peter's vulnerable position at the door, as Jesus disappeared from sight. It is both an ordinary and yet profoundly symbolic moment in the unfolding tale.
