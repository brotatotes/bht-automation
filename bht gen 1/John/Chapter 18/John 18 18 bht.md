# John 18:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Amidst the chilling night, Peter warms himself at a fire, unaware of the deep symbolism it holds. His association with the enemies of Jesus reveals his lack of concern for his suffering Master. As the fire of charcoal crackles, Peter's denial intensifies, leading to his second falsehood under the watchful gaze of the flickering flames. In this poignant scene, the harsh coldness of the night mirrors Peter's own spiritual state, as he unwittingly enters into a dangerous alliance with those who oppose Christ.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "John alone notices the material (charcoal) of which the fire was made, and the reason for a fire—the coldness of the night" [WEBSTER and WILKINSON].
2. "His wishing to 'see the end,' of issue of these proceedings, was what led him into the palace, for he evidently feared the worst."
3. "But once in, the serpent coil is drawn closer; it is a cold night, and why should not he take advantage of the fire as well as others?"

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "It is discouraging to see how the A. V. habitually ignores the imperfect tense, and thus detracts from the liveliness of the narrative."
2. "Matthew does not mention the fire. Mark has to fwv, strictly, the light of the fire. Luke says they had kindled a fire [πυρ]."
3. "Rev., correctly, were warming. So, ver. 25, was standing and was warming, for stood and warmed."

(Note: The commentary seems to be discussing the translation choices and differences in the depiction of the fire and the actions of the individuals in the narrative.)

### John Calvin:
1. "This shows how great was Peter’s stupidity, when, without the least concern, he warmed himself along with a multitude of wicked men, after having denied his Master."
2. "Though it is possible that he may have been restrained by fear lest, in going out of the high priest’s house, he should fall into another danger of the same kind."
3. "When the evangelist adds that Peter was standing near the fire, along with the others and servants, this serves to connect the various parts of the narrative."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The fact is historical. We know that even from the other Gospels. But it is more than historical. To the symbolic eye of John it has a deeper meaning."
2. "In this night of cold he sees Peter associating himself with the enemies of Jesus, perhaps consulting his own comfort while his Master suffers."
3. "The 'fire of charcoal' are in the Old Testament one of the symbols of Divine judgment."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "A fire of coals (ανθρακιαν). Old word, in LXX, only here and John 21:9 in N.T."
2. "It was cold (ψυχος ην). 'There was coldness.' The soldiers had apparently returned to their barracks."
3. "Peter, unabashed by his lie, joined himself to the group and stood in the light of the fire."

### John Gill:
1. "The passover was always in the spring of the year, when nights are commonly cold, as they are generally observed to be at the vernal equinox."
2. "He was cold both inwardly and outwardly; and being so, he gets into bad company; and it may be with a view that he might not be suspected, but be taken for one of their own sort."
3. "By the light of the fire he is again discovered and challenged, which makes way for a second denial."
