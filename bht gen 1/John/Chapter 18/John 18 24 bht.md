# John 18:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
During Jesus' trial, the complex web of political and religious power dynamics is revealed as Annas, a former high priest, sends Jesus bound to Caiaphas, the current high priest. The image of Jesus being bound emphasizes his vulnerability and the injustice of his arrest, standing in stark contrast to the power and authority of his captors. This physical restraint serves as a poignant reminder of the suffering and sacrifice Jesus willingly endured in the face of opposition and persecution.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "I cannot acquiesce in the pluperfect rendering of ἀπέστειλεν, to bring about which the οὖν has apparently been omitted."
2. "The verse simply describes what followed on the preceding: Annas therefore sent Him bound to Caiaphas the High Priest."
3. "There is no real difficulty in this rendering, if Annas and Caiaphas lived in one palace, or at all events transacted public affairs in one and the same."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The words here literally are, 'Annas sent Him [not 'had sent Him'] to Caiaphas'—and the 'now' being of doubtful authority." 
2. "We take this interview, then, with some of the ablest interpreters, to be a preliminary and non-official one with Annas, at an hour of the night when Caiaphas' Council could not convene."
3. "But the building in which both met with Jesus appears to have been the same, the room only being different, and the court, of course, in that case, one."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "John 18:13 provides a vivid picture of the chaotic scene that unfolded during Jesus' arrest. The mention of Annas, the father-in-law of Caiaphas, adds an intriguing layer to the narrative, as it suggests a complex web of relationships and power dynamics within the religious elite of that time."

2. "Matthew 26:57 offers a more detailed account of Jesus' trial before the high priest. The mention of the scribes and elders being gathered together highlights the concerted effort to bring Jesus to trial and underscores the gravity of the situation."

3. "Both verses emphasize the clandestine nature of Jesus' arrest and trial, as they took place under the cover of darkness and away from the public eye. This secrecy not only allowed the religious leaders to maintain control over the situation but also prevented any potential backlash from Jesus' followers."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The rendering of the aorist by the pluperfect here is inadmissible, and is a device to bring this examination of Jesus into harmony with that described in Matthew 26:56-68."
2. "The mention of the high-priest as conducting this examination and the statement of ver. 13, which implies that this was merely a preliminary examination before Annas."
3. "Bound. Probably He had been unbound during His examination."

### John Calvin:
1. "This sentence must be read by way of parenthesis; for, having said that Christ was taken to the house of Annas, and having continued his narrative, as if the assembly of the priests had been held there, the Evangelist now reminds the reader that Christ was taken from the house of Annas to the high priest’s house."
2. "But as the tense of the Greek verb ἀπέστειλε has led many people into a mistake, I have preferred translating it by the pluperfect tense, Had sent."
3. "I have chosen to render it in this way, Annas Had Sent, rather than, Annas Sent."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The difficulty connected with these words will be best explained when we have completed the consideration of the three following verses."
2. "In the original Annas is so introduced to our notice as to lead us directly back to the 'Annas' of John 18:13."
3. "The mention of Caiaphas the high priest emphasizes the religious and political authority behind the trial of Jesus."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "The preliminary examination by Annas was over."
2. "Jesus was bound on his arrest and apparently unbound during the preliminary examination by Annas."
3. "Jesus was bound on his arrest."

### John Gill:
1. "Annas had sent him bound... unto Caiaphas the high priest: his son-in-law, as the more proper person to be examined before." 
2. "This was done before Peter's first denial of Christ; which, it is plain, was in the palace of the high priest, and not in Annas's house." 
3. "They manifestly refer to time past, and do not at all obscure or hinder the true order of the history, as standing here."

### John Wesley:
1. "Annas had sent him to Caiaphas" - This verse highlights the political and religious power dynamics at play during Jesus' trial. It shows that Annas, a former high priest, still held significant influence and was able to manipulate the situation by sending Jesus to Caiaphas, the current high priest.

2. "Being still bound" - The fact that Jesus was still bound emphasizes his vulnerability and the injustice of his arrest. It underscores the contrast between his bound state and the power and authority of those who held him captive.

3. "Bound" - This single word conveys the physical restraint and imprisonment of Jesus, symbolizing the oppression and persecution he endured. It serves as a reminder of the suffering and sacrifice Jesus willingly endured for the sake of humanity.
