# John 18:25 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this biblical verse, we witness the heartbreaking scene where Peter denies his association with Jesus not once, but twice. As one commentator points out, Peter's denial is not only a display of shocking stupidity but also a hardening of himself through indulging in sin. Another commentator highlights the dangerous consequence of Peter's prolonged presence among the wicked. We also see Satan's cunning tactics, as he baits his temptations and makes denial seem attractive. Ultimately, Peter's denial stems from fear and shame, leading him to reject his great mercy, privilege, and glory of being a disciple of Christ.

### John Gill:
1. "The company and conversation of wicked men should be abstained from; no good is got thereby; continuance among such is very dangerous; men are too often more concerned for their bodies than their souls; Satan baits his temptations for the fleshly and sensitive part; and that which is thought to be for good, is the occasion of hurt."

2. "They said therefore unto him; the servants and officers, among whom he stood warming himself, having observed what the maid had said to him: art thou not also one of his disciples? suspecting that he was, though he had denied it, and therefore press him to give a direct answer."

3. "This denial of his being a disciple of Christ, as before, did not arise from a sense of his unworthiness to be one; nor from diffidence and distrust of a right to such a character; but from the fear of men; and being ashamed of Christ, he denies that which was his great mercy, privilege, and glory."
