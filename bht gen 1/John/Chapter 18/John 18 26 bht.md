# John 18:26 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we witness a poignant moment where Peter, in a state of fear and desperation, denies his association with Jesus not once, not twice, but three times. The denials are witnessed by someone who had personal connections to the servant Peter had injured earlier, intensifying the bitterness of the questioning. Peter's actions put him at great risk of being arrested himself, and his fervent denial comes with cursing and swearing. The intensity of the situation is further emphasized by Jesus himself turning and looking at Peter during this ordeal.
