# John 18:27 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, we see a significant moment of betrayal and repentance. The scene unfolds as Peter denies his association with Jesus, despite being warned by God through the crowing of a cock. While Peter's denial is momentary and temporary, Judas' act of betrayal reflects a deep resistance against the light and love he had witnessed. The high priest's exaggerated religious horror emphasizes the gravity of the situation. This verse highlights the difference between Peter's remorseful denial and Judas' irreversible path of treachery, reminding us that even in moments of weakness, there is potential for redemption.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The immediately subsequent acts are given in full only in Luke: 'And the Lord turned and looked upon Peter,' from the hall of judgment to the court, in the way already explained. But who can tell what lightning flashes of wounded love and piercing reproach shot from that 'look' through the eye of Peter into his heart!"
2. "How different from the sequel of Judas' act! Doubtless the hearts of the two men towards the Saviour were perfectly different from the first; and the treason of Judas was but the consummation of the wretched man's resistance of the blaze of light in the midst of which he had lived for three years, while Peter's denial was but a momentary obscuration of the heavenly light and love to his Master which ruled his life."
3. "Then the high priest rent his clothes, and saith, What need we any further witnesses? Ye have heard the blasphemy—'of his own mouth'; an affectation of religious horror."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The use of the article would seem to mark the time, cock - crowing, rather than the incident."
2. "Compare Matthew 27:1, Matthew 27:2; 11 - 14; Mark 14:1-6; Luke 23:1-5."
3. "The Greek has not the definite article. See on Matthew 26:34."

### John Calvin:
1. "The Evangelist mentions the crowing of the cock, in order to inform us that Peter was warned by God at the very time."
2. "Thus, when any person has once begun to fall through the suggestions of Satan, no voice, no sign, no warning, will bring him back, until the Lord himself cast his eyes upon him."
3. "The mere crowing of the cock did not produce any effect on Peter until Christ looked at him."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "We may only notice that a use of the pronoun ‘they’ exactly similar to its use in that verse meets us in Matthew 26:73 and Mark 14:70 when compared with Luke 22:59 and John 18:26."
2. "The structure of higher-class houses in Palestine, the relationship of the persons themselves, and the customs of the East, lead not unnaturally to such a view; and it was very early entertained."
3. "Thus, in the first group there is only one denial: in the second there are two. The first takes place at a moment when Jesus has passed out of Peter’s sight: the second and third at a moment when Jesus is under Peter’s eye, bound, yet patient and submissive."

### John Gill:
1. "Now he was more affrighted than before, lest should he be taken up, and it be proved upon him, that he was the person that cut off Malchus's ear, he should be sentenced to a fine, or it may be some capital punishment."
2. "The fine for plucking a man's ears, and which some understand of plucking them off, was four hundred 'zuzim' s, or, pence; which, as they answer to Roman pence, amount to twelve pounds ten shillings."
3. "That it might be believed he was not a disciple of Christ, so not the man; he swears in a profane manner, and imprecates the judgments of God upon him."
