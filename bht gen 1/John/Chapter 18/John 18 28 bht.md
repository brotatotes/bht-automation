## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1) "The Jews would not enter the Prætorium that they might not be defiled, but that they might eat the Passover."
2) "Possibly the law concerning Levitical defilements and purifications had in that age been made more stringent or otherwise modified; possibly, they called some other meal, besides the actual Passover, by its name."
3) "Thus, he says, any time after 3 P.M. on Thursday might be called by St. Mark 'the first day of unleavened bread, when they sacrificed the passover,' and by St. Luke, 'the day of unleavened bread, when the Passover must be killed,' it being killed after the first and before the second evening on Friday, and thus, loosely speaking, within the day, which commenced at 3 o’clock, and, strictly speaking, within that which commenced at sunset on Thursday."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The word here rendered 'hall of judgment' is from the Latin, and denotes 'the palace of the governor of a Roman province.'"
2. "They themselves went not into the judgment hall lest they should be defiled—by contact with ceremonially unclean Gentiles."
3. "These are questions which have occasioned immense research and learned treatises. But as the usages of the Jews appear to have somewhat varied at different times, and our present knowledge of them is not sufficient to clear up all difficulties, they are among the not very important questions which probably will never be entirely solved."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "They considered the touch of a Gentile to be a defilement, and on this occasion, at least, seemed to regard it as a pollution to enter the house of a Gentile." 

2. "Probably there is not anywhere to be found among men another such instance of petty regard to the mere ceremonies of the law and attempting to keep from pollution, at the same time that their hearts were filled with malice, and they were meditating the most enormous of all crimes." 

3. "It shows us how much more concerned men will be at the violation of the mere forms and ceremonies of religion than at real crime, and how they endeavor to keep their consciences at ease amid their deeds of wickedness by the observance of some of the outward ceremonies of religion by mere sanctimoniousness."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The term 'proetorium' originally referred to the general's tent, but in the Roman provinces, it became the official residence of the Roman governor. It later came to be applied to any spacious villa or palace." 

2. "The Sanhedrim could not hold a legal meeting, especially in capital cases, before sunrise. In capital cases, sentence of condemnation could not be legally pronounced on the day of trial. If the night proceedings were merely preliminary to a formal trial, they would have no validity; if formal, they were, inso facto, illegal." 

3. "The defilement in the present case was apprehended from entering a house from which all leaven had not been removed. Eating the Passover meal in such a house was considered a violation of purity laws."

### John Calvin:
1. "The trial was conducted by the priests, not that they had it in their power to pronounce a sentence, but that, after having excited a prejudice against him by their previous decision, they might deliver him to the governor, as if he had already been fully tried."
2. "Their religion, in this respect, deserves commendation. But there are two faults, and both of them are very heinous. The first is, they do not consider that they carry more pollution within their hearts, than they can contract by entering any place however profane; and the second is, they carry to excess their care about smaller matters, and neglect what is of the highest importance."
3. "In short, they observe the shadow of the passover with a false and pretended reverence, and yet not only do they violate the true passover by sacrilegious hands, but endeavor, as far as lies in their power, to bury it in eternal oblivion."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The hour, immediately after ‘cock-crowing,’ was certainly not later than 3 or 3:30 A.M."
2. "The Jews could have no fear that by entering into Pilate’s hall they would unfit themselves for eating a Paschal meal to be celebrated the following evening."
3. "They were scrupulous because they desired to eat without an hour’s delay."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "John gives no details of the trial before the Sanhedrin... but he gives much new material of the trial before Pilate."
2. "There were two violations of Jewish legal procedure... Besides, the Sanhedrin no longer had the power of death."
3. "For Jewish scruples about entering the house of a Gentile..."
4. "This phrase may mean to eat the passover meal... but it does not have to mean that."
5. "If we follow John's use of the word, it is the feast here, not the meal of John 13:2 which was the regular passover meal."

### John Gill:
1. "They did not think it lawful to rent out a house in Judea to an Heathen, or to assist in building a Basilica for them; which they explain to be a palace, in which judges sit to judge men: hence the reason of their caution, and which they were the more observant of, that they might eat the passover; pure and undefiled."
2. "It is easy to observe the consciences of these men, who were always wont to strain at a gnat and swallow a camel; they scruple going into the judgment hall, which belonged to an Heathen governor, and where was a large number of Heathen soldiers; but they could go along with these into the garden to apprehend Christ, and spend a whole night in consulting to shed innocent blood."
3. "No wonder that God should be weary of their sacrifices and ceremonious performances, when, trusting to these, they had no regard to moral precepts: however, this may be teaching to us, in what manner we should keep the feast, and eat of the true passover, Christ; not with malice and wickedness, as these Jews ate theirs, but with sincerity and truth."
