# John 18:29 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Pilate, the Roman procurator of Judea, went outside to the Sanhedrin to inquire about the accusation brought against Jesus, demonstrating his commitment to justice. Seeking clarity and a formal charge, Pilate desired to judge the matter fairly, distancing himself from personal bias. Though knowledgeable of the situation, he demanded a proper accusation, wanting to follow Roman law and maintain objectivity in the case. This exchange took place outside of Pilate's palace as the Sanhedrin refused to enter, potentially on a gallery overlooking the pavement.
