In this Bible verse, we see the dramatic scene unfold as Judas arrives accompanied by a multitude of soldiers and religious leaders. The soldiers carry lanterns and torches, ready to search for Jesus. Despite the full moon, they are prepared for the possibility of darkness and hiding places. Their presence emphasizes the power and authority of the Roman Empire, and the sword-wielding soldiers signify the seriousness of the situation. This moment showcases the oppressive nature of the Roman occupation and highlights the organization and discipline of their military presence.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Lanterns and torches were part of the utensils of the military on a night march." 
2. "φανοί appear to be strictly torches, any blazing substance held in the hand; and λαμπάδες, lights, fed with oil." 
3. "The fact of its being full moon did not make the lights unnecessary, as, in searching for a prisoner, they might have to enter dark places."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "He that was called Judas, one of the Twelve," says Luke, in language which brands him with peculiar infamy, as in the sacred circle while in no sense of it.
2. The impudence of this atrocious deed shows how thoroughly he had by this time mastered all his scruples.
3. "Betrayest thou the Son of man with a kiss"—imprinting upon the foulest act the mark of tenderest affection? What wounded feeling does this express!

### Albert Barnes:
1. "John passes over the agony of Jesus in the garden, probably because it was so fully described by the other evangelists."
2. "Their taking lights with them shows their determination to find him."
3. "This was the time of the full moon, but it might have been cloudy."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The band, or cohort, was from the Roman garrison in the tower of Antonia." 
2. "The Synoptists speak of the body which arrested Jesus as oclov, a multitude or rabble; but both Matthew and Mark mention the band [σπειρα] later in the narrative." 
3. "Though it was full moon, it was feared that Jesus might hide and escape."

### John Calvin:
1. "That Judas came accompanied by soldiers and by so large a retinue, is a sign of a bad conscience, which always trembles without any cause."
2. "It is certain that the band of soldiers was borrowed from the governor, who also sent a captain at the head of a thousand soldiers."
3. "John makes separate mention of the Pharisee, because they were more enraged than all the rest, as if they had cared more about religion."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The circumstances here mentioned are in contrast with those of John 18:1, constituting the obverse side of the picture, before the ‘went forth’ of that verse is again taken up in John 18:4, and thus illustrating the same principles of structure as those which met us in the opening verses of chap. 13."
2. "The mention of ‘the band’ has been made an object of ridicule, as if it could only mean ‘half a Roman army.’ The ridicule is groundless."
3. "The trees of the garden made ‘lanterns and torches’ necessary. Although the moon was near the full, the Jews would imagine that Jesus might hide Himself in the covert and so escape."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The Latin spira (roll or ball) was used for a military cohort (Polybius 11, 23, 1) as in Matthew 27:27; Acts 10:1, etc., here for a small band secured from the Tower of Antonia."
2. "Cometh (ερχετα). Dramatic historical present middle indicative."
3. "Both old words, φανος only here in N.T., λαμπας, an oil lamp (Matthew 25:1). It was full moon, but Judas took no chances for it may have been cloudy and there were dark places by the walls and under the olive trees."

### John Wesley:
1. "The mention of a 'troop of soldiers' emphasizes the power and authority of the Roman Empire, highlighting the oppressive nature of their presence in the region."
2. "The term 'troop' suggests a large group of soldiers, indicating that the situation described in the verse is not an isolated incident but a common occurrence during the Roman occupation."
3. "The use of the word 'troop' also implies a sense of organization and discipline, reflecting the military might of the Roman Empire and their ability to maintain control over the region."
