# John 18:30 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The commentators highlight the situation where Jesus is being brought before Pilate by the Jewish leaders. They are careful not to mention the charge of blasphemy against Him, fearing the rejection of their cause. The Jewish leaders seek Pilate's sanction, as they themselves have found Jesus worthy of death. However, the commentators also emphasize that Jesus is innocent, highlighting His miraculous healings and actions that demonstrate His righteousness. Despite the accusations, Jesus stands before Pilate with a sense of pride and dignity, even though they are about to sacrifice His importance and dignity.
