## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "This question probably arose out of what Pilate had previously heard, not from any charge to this effect being made between our John 18:31 ; John 18:34."
2. "Pilate summoned Jesus in, who had been as yet outside with the Jews. This was the formal reception of the case before him."
3. "In this case Pilate appears to have wished to obtain an account from Jesus apart from the clamours of the chief priests and the mob."

1. "Pilate . . . called Jesus, and said . . . Art thou the King of the Jews?" - This question from Pilate reveals the central conflict of Jesus' trial - the claim of kingship. It highlights the political implications of Jesus' ministry and the threat he posed to the Roman authorities.

2. "They charge our Lord before Pilate with 'perverting the nation, and forbidding to give tribute to Cæsar, saying that He Himself is Christ a king.'" - This accusation against Jesus reflects the false narrative created by his opponents.

### John Calvin:
1. "John dwells chiefly on a single point, that Pilate made a laborious inquiry whether Christ was justly or unjustly accused."
2. "He considers for what purpose he came down into the world, and to what he is now called by the Father. Of his own accord, therefore, he refrains from speaking, that he may not escape from death."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The emphasis of the question is remarkable. The word ‘thou’ stands in the original at the head of the sentence, as if Pilate would say: ‘Thou, thou so humbled, despised, handed over to me as a malefactor, art thou the King of the Jews?’"
2. "Pilate may not embrace the idea, but he at least thinks the question worthy of being asked."
