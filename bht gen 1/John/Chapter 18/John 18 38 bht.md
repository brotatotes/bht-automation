# John 18:38 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the midst of Jesus' trial before Pilate, the Roman governor, the question of truth emerges. Pilate's inquiry, "What is truth?" is fraught with skepticism and indifference, as if truth itself were a hopeless pursuit. Pilate's casual dismissal of truth stands in stark contrast to Jesus, who embodies truth as the Incarnate Word. Though Pilate acknowledges Jesus' innocence, he fails to recognize the gravity of the truth standing before him. Thus, the search for truth is met with mockery and missed opportunity.

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Jesus meant the absolute truth: Pilate, truth in any particular case."
2. "Pilate's exclamation is neither the expression of an ardent thirst for truth, nor that of the despair of a soul which has long sought it in vain; it is the profession of a frivolous skepticism, such as is frequently met with in the man of the world, and especially in the statesman."
