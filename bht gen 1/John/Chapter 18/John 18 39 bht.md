# John 18:39 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In John 18:39, we see the repeated accusation of Jesus by the chief priests and elders, to which He answered nothing, along with the sending to Herod and the second proclamation of His innocence by Pilate. The choice to release Barabbas at the Passover has symbolic significance, pointing to the ultimate sacrifice of Christ for the sins of humanity. This custom, by which the Roman governor delivered up to the Jews, every year, at the Passover, some criminal, involved a base and heinous crime.
