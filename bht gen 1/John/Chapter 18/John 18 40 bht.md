# John 18:40 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we witness a striking contrast as the crowd vehemently cries out for the release of Barabbas, a well-known robber and troublemaker, instead of Jesus. This choice, orchestrated by the priests and influenced by Pilate, highlights the guilty and desperate nature of the crowd's plea. Barabbas, depicted as an emblem of sinful humanity, is set free while Jesus, the holy Son of God, is condemned to die on the very cross intended for Barabbas. This momentous decision serves as a powerful display of God's divine grace, where even notorious sinners are released when Christ takes their place.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "There is a solemn irony in these words of the Apostle a Robber!"
2. "See the contrast strongly brought out, Acts 3:14."
3. "Thus was Jesus 'the goat upon which the Lord's lot fell, to be offered for a sin-offering.'"

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Cried [εκραυγασαν] . Peculiarly of a loud, importunate cry; a shout." 

2. "Robber [ληστης] . See on Matthew 26:55; Mark 11:17; Luke 10:30. Matt. calls him a 'notable prisoner' (xxvii. 16)."

3. "Bandits of this kind were numerous in the neighborhood of Jerusalem under the Roman dominion. Their leaders were well known."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The word 'again' is here peculiarly worthy of notice. No previous cry of the Jews had been mentioned by the Evangelist; and, had his story been constructed merely to illustrate an idea, he certainly would not have spoken of a second cry when he had said nothing of a first."
2. "The cry was, 'Not this man but Barabbas;' and the guilty nature of the cry is immediately intensified by a brief but emphatic statement, designed far more to bring out this guilt than to make us acquainted with a fact of history."
3. "A robber! and yet they preferred him to the holy Jesus, to the Only-Begotten of the Father, to their King!"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The priests put the crowd up to this choice and Pilate offered the alternative."
2. "The name Βαραββας in Aramaic simply means son of a father."
3. "They chose Barabbas in preference to Jesus and apparently Jesus died on the very cross planned for Barabbas."

### John Gill:
1. "Barabbas was a robber; who was an emblem of God's elect in a state of nature, released and set free when Christ was condemned."
2. "These, as he, many of them at least, are notorious sinners, the chief of sinners, robbers and murderers; who have robbed God of his glory, and destroyed themselves."
3. "These, though such criminals, and so deserving of punishment, were let go free, when Christ was taken, condemned, and died; and which was according to the wise and secret counsel of Jehovah, and is a large discovery of divine grace."
