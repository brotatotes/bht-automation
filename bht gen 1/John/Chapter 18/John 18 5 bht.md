# John 18:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As the scene unfolds in the garden, Jesus stands calmly before the soldiers and officers, affirming His identity. He willingly embraces the name given to Him, demonstrating His unwavering commitment. Although appearing contradictory, the various accounts reveal nuances within the moment. While Judas is seen both standing with the soldiers and giving a signal, the precise sequence is not immediately clear. Intervening words and actions occur, including the striking of a servant's ear and a discourse with the religious leaders. Through it all, Jesus remains resolute in fulfilling His Father's will.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Some among them knew Him, others probably not."
2. "John detected Judas standing among them, and notices the detail, as is his constant habit, by way of enhancing the tragic character of the history."
3. "John therefore adds this touch of exactness, to shew that the answer 'Jesus of Nazareth' was not given because they were ignorant of His Person, so as not to be able to say 'Thee;' but because they feared to say it."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Just the sort of blunt, straight forward reply one expects from military men, simply acting on their instructions."
2. "I am He."
3. "No more is recorded here of his part of the scene, but we have found the gap painfully supplied by all the other Evangelists."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Of Nazareth [τον ναζωραιον] . Literally, the Nazarene."

### John Calvin:
1. "There was no want of power in him, therefore, to restrain their hands, if he had thought proper; but he wished to obey his Father, by whose decree he knew that he was called to die."
2. "We may infer from this how dreadful and alarming to the wicked the voice of Christ will be, when he shall ascend his throne to judge the world."
3. "He intended, at that time, to give a proof of that efficacy which Isaiah ascribes to his voice... True, the fulfillment of this prophecy is declared by Paul to be delayed till the end of the world. Yet we daily see the wicked, with all their rage and pride, struck down by the voice of Christ."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The answer may perhaps reveal the light in which Judas had represented Jesus to the Roman authorities, ‘of Nazareth,’ a Galilean, prone to revolt."
2. "Jesus saith unto them, I am he. Before the effect produced by the reply is related, a parenthetical clause is introduced."
3. "We have before us Judas possessed by Satan. The powers of evil are concentrated in him; and to bring him thus prominently forward as sharing the fate of others illustrates in the most striking manner the victory of Jesus even in this hour of apparent defeat."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "A vivid picture of Judas in the very act of betraying Jesus." 
2. "John does not mention the kiss by Judas as a sign to the soldiers and police." 
3. "Jesus stepped forth and affirmed that he was the one whom they were seeking."

### John Gill:
1. "Jesus saith unto them, I am [he]; or 'I am', respecting his name Jehovah, averring himself to be the Christ, and owning himself under the name they were pleased to call him by; which shows how willing he was to be taken by them, and may teach us not to be ashamed of him, or of any nickname we may bear for his sake."

2. "The force of the objection seems to lie here; that, according to the other evangelists, Judas, as soon as he came into the garden, made up to Christ, and gave the signal by which he might be known, whereas he is here said to stand with the soldiers and officers; and that seeing such a signal was given, he must be, and was known by it, whereas he is here represented as if he was not known by them until he had made himself known to them; and that as soon as Judas had given the sign, they immediately seized him, whereas, according to this account, they did not, until some words had passed between Christ and them, and they first fell to the ground."

3. "It does not appear that Christ was immediately seized by the soldiers, upon the signal given them by Judas, without some intervening words and actions; for though the signal and the seizure lie very near together in the accounts of Matthew and Mark; yet Luke relates many things between them, as the question of the disciples, whether they should smite with the sword; Peter's cutting off the ear of the high priest's servant; Christ's rebuking him, and touching the servant's ear, and healing it; and some discourse which passed between him, and the chief priests, captains, and elders."
