# John 18:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the face of a miraculous incident, the commentators debate whether it was a deliberate act of Jesus or a result of His divine nature. The enemies of Jesus recoil and fall to the ground, struck by a power greater than their own. His bold and fearless manner leaves them amazed, unable to execute their wicked plan. They are overwhelmed by His divine majesty and power, confounded and intimidated. Yet, the respite they receive is not due to the indulgence of Jesus, but through the providence of God.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The question on the miraculous nature of this incident is not whether it were a miracle at all (for it is evident that it must be regarded as one), but whether it were an act specially intended by our Lord, or a result of the superhuman dignity of His person and the majestic calmness of His reply."
2. "I believe the latter alternative to be the right one. Commentators cite various instances of the confusion of the enemies of innocent men before the calmness and dignity of their victims, how much more was this likely to be the case when He in whom was no sin, and who spake as never man spake, came forth to meet His implacable foes as the self-sacrificing Lamb of God."
3. "Such incidents as this are not related by the Evangelists, and least of all by St. John, as mere astounding facts, but as grounds on which we are to enquire, and determine for ourselves, as to the 'glory, full of grace and truth,' which was in Him, whom, not having seen, we love."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "They went backward—recoiled." 
2. "Fell to the ground—struck down by a power such as that which smote Saul of Tarsus and his companions to the earth." 
3. "It was the glorious effulgence of the majesty of Christ which overpowered them."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The frank, open, and fearless manner in which Jesus addressed them may have convinced them of his innocence, and deterred them from prosecuting their wicked attempt."
2. "His disclosure of himself was sudden and unexpected; and while they perhaps anticipated that he would make an effort to escape, they were amazed at his open and bold profession."
3. "The expression of his unequalled power in knowing how to find the way to the consciences of men made them feel that they were in the presence of more than mortal man."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "It is the Divine majesty and innocence of Jesus that produced the effect."
2. "Like the buyers and sellers in the temple, the history of whose terror at the presence of the Redeemer is vouched for by the testimony of the earlier gospels as much as by that of the fourth."
3. "They are overwhelmed with awe, and fall before Him."
4. "As soon as they recover, Jesus repeats His question."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "This recoil made them stumble."
2. "But why did they step back? Was it the former claim of Jesus to be on an equality with God or mere embarrassment and confusion or supernatural power exerted by Jesus?"
3. "B adds Ιησους which must mean simply: 'I am Jesus.'"

### John Gill:
1. "They were confounded, surprised, and intimidated, and seemed as if they would have chose rather to have fled from him, than to have apprehended him."
2. "Sometimes the majesty of a man's person, or his fame for some remarkable things done by him, or the innocence and uprightness of his cause, have had such an influence upon his enemies, that they have not been able to execute upon him what they intended."
3. "Now, besides the above things, in their highest perfection, there was in our Lord something more than human; he was God as well as man, and he displayed his divine majesty, glory, and power."

### John Wesley:
1. "How amazing is it, that they should renew the assault, after so sensible an experience both of his power and mercy!"
2. "Probably the priests among them might persuade themselves and their attendants, that this also was done by Beelzebub."
3. "It was through the providence of God, not the indulgence of Jesus, that they received no farther damage."
