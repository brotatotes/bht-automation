# John 18:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, Jesus demonstrates his compassion and mercy by only temporarily disabling his adversaries to display his power, without causing them any lasting harm. Although the soldiers and officers recognize Jesus, their persistence in pursuing him reveals their unyielding wickedness and hardened hearts. This highlights the profound truth that even extraordinary miracles alone cannot change the hearts of hardened sinners without the work of powerful and efficacious grace.
