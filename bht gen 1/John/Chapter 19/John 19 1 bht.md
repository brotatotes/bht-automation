# John 19:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The passage describes the unjust scourging of Jesus, a brutal act meant to fulfill prophecy and appease the Jews. It symbolizes the deep sacrifice He made for humanity, taking on not only physical pain but also emotional and spiritual anguish. By being scourged, Jesus took the punishment we deserved, demonstrating the severity of sin and the grace and patience of Christ as our substitute. The verse also highlights the unjust actions of Pilate, who found no fault in Jesus yet still allowed the scourging to take place.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The reason or purpose of this scourging does not here appear; but in Luk 23:21-23 we read that after the choice of Barabbas, Pilate asked them what should be done with Jesus? And when they demanded that He should be crucified, Pilate, after another assertion of his innocence, said παιδεύσας αὐτὸν ἀπολύσω. Thus it is accounted for."

2. "The scourging of Jesus was a brutal act of punishment, meant to inflict pain and humiliation. It was a common practice in Roman times, often used as a precursor to crucifixion. This act of scourging was a fulfillment of the prophecy in Isaiah 53:5, which states that 'by his stripes we are healed.'"

3. "The scourging of Jesus serves as a powerful reminder of the extent of His sacrifice for humanity. It was not just the physical pain and suffering, but also the emotional and spiritual anguish that He endured on our behalf. Through His scourging, Jesus took upon Himself the punishment that we deserved, offering us forgiveness and salvation."

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Pilate took Jesus and scourged him—in hope of appeasing them."
2. "And the soldiers led Him away into the palace, and they call the whole band."
3. "The body of the military cohort stationed there—to take part in the mock coronation now to be enacted."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Scourging was the legal preliminary to crucifixion, but, in this case, was inflicted illegally before the sentence of crucifixion was pronounced, with a view of averting the extreme punishment, and of satisfying the Jews." 

2. "The punishment was horrible, the victim being bound to a low pillar or stake, and beaten, either with rods, or, in the case of slaves and provincials, with scourges, called scorpions, leather thongs tipped with leaden balls or sharp spikes." 

3. "The severity of the infliction in Jesus' case is evident from His inability to bear His cross."

### John Calvin:
1. "Yet his innocence is frequently attested by the testimony of the judge, in order to assure us that he was free from all sin, and that he was substituted as a guilty person in the room of others, and bore the punishment due to the sins of others."
2. "Thus, they who have not so much courage as to defend, with unshaken constancy, what is right, must be driven hither and thither, and led to adopt opposite and conflicting opinions."
3. "There are many who, for the purpose of saving the life of those who are persecuted for the sake of the Gospel, constrain them wickedly to deny Christ. What is this, but to expose Christ to ridicule, that he may lead a dishonorable life?"

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The punishment is itself the main point, the increasing sufferings of Jesus and His deepening humiliation and agony as, under the pressure of His sinful nation, He goes onward to the cross."
2. "In the first picture (chap. John 18:33-40) Jesus is simply the prisoner bound; in the second, that before us, He is the prisoner scourged and treated with contemptuous mockery of his royal claims."
3. "This mockery follows the scourging."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "For this redundant use of λαμβανω see also verse John 19:6."
2. "It is the causative use of μαστιγοω, for Pilate did not actually scourge Jesus."
3. "The Sanhedrin had previously mocked Jesus as the soldiers will do later."

Note: The commentary provides additional context and explanations for the actions described in the verse, shedding light on the significance of the scourging, the mock coronation, and the previous mocking of Jesus.

### John Gill:
1. "...it was a very unjust action in him to scourge a man that he himself could find no fault in..."
2. "...an emblem of those strokes and scourges of divine justice he endured, as the surety of his people, in his soul, in their stead..."
3. "...his being scourged, though innocent, shows, that it was not for his own, but the sins of others; and expresses the vile nature of sin, the strictness of justice, and the grace, condescension, and patience of Christ..."
