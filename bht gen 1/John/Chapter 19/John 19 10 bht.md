# John 19:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the verse described, a powerful judge, filled with pride and self-conviction of injustice, confronts a prisoner. The judge attempts to exert his authority, boasting of his power to sentence or release the prisoner. However, the prisoner, unmoved by fear or intimidation, recognizes the limited power of the judge, reminding him that all authority comes from a higher source. The judge's arrogance is met with the prisoner's unwavering faith and refusal to be swayed by worldly powers.
