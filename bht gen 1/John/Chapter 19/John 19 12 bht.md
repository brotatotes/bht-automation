# John 19:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, Pilate is struck by the words of majesty and mildness spoken by Jesus. He attempts to release Him, but the Jews persist in their accusation. Pilate fears being accused of unfaithfulness to the emperor if he does not condemn Jesus. However, Pilate's attempts to release Jesus continue, driven by his growing conviction of Jesus's innocence. The Jewish rulers, in their treachery, use the threat of accusing Pilate of lack of friendship with Caesar to manipulate him. Ultimately, Pilate seeks to release Jesus, but his efforts prove futile.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Pilate himself was deeply struck by these words of majesty and mildness, and almost sympathy for his [own] weakness, and made a last, and, as ἐκ τ . seems to imply, a somewhat longer attempt than before, to deliver Him."
2. "There does not seem to be any allusion to a title of honour, amicus Cæsaris; indeed, to judge from the citations in Wetstein, a good deal of fancy has been employed in making out the fact of such a title having been in use, any further than that the appellation would naturally arise and be accounted honourable."
3. "This was a terrible saying, especially under Tiberius, with whom (Tacit. Ann. iii. 38) 'majestatis crimen omnium accusationum complementum erat.'"
4. "This was true: their application of it to Christ a lie. But words, not facts, are taken into account by tyrants, and this Pilate knew."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "This was equivalent to a threat of impeachment, which we know was much dreaded by such officers as the procurators, especially of the character of Pilate or Felix."
2. "It also consummates the treachery and disgrace of the Jewish rulers, who were willing, for the purpose of destroying Jesus, to affect a zeal for the supremacy of a foreign prince."
3. "He brought Jesus forth, and sat down in the judgment seat—that he might pronounce sentence against the Prisoner, on this charge, the more solemnly."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He was more and more convinced of his innocence, and more unwilling to yield him to mere malice and envy in the face of justice."
2. "He feared that he would be accused of unfaithfulness to the interests of the Roman emperor if he did not condemn a man whom his own nation had accused of sedition."
3. "This emperor was, during the latter part of his reign, the most cruel, jealous, and wicked that ever sat on the Roman throne."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Caesar's friend. A title conferred, since the time of Augustus, upon provincial governors."
2. "Probably, however, not used by the Jews in this technical sense, but merely as a way of saying 'Thou art not true to the emperor.'"
3. "The term, which was at first a proper name, the surname of Julius Caesar, adopted by Augustus and his successors, became an appellative, appropriated by all the emperors as a title."

### John Calvin:
1. "His modesty is commendable on this ground, that, when he is severely reproved by Christ, he does not fly into a passion, but, on the contrary, is still more disposed to release him."
2. "He is a judge, and yet he meekly permits the accused person to be his reprover; and, indeed, scarcely one person in a hundred will be found, who so mildly suffers a reproof, even from one who is his equal."
3. "It is of great importance to us to know, that Pilate did not condemn Christ, before he had several times acquitted him with his own mouth, in order that we may learn from it, that it was for our sins that he was condemned, and not on his own account."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The attempts were vain."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "He was afraid to act boldly against the will of the Jews."
2. "A direct threat to Pilate. He knew all the time that the Sanhedrin might tell Caesar on him."

### John Gill:
1. "From the time that Christ spoke the above words; he sought by all means, and studied every way to bring the Jews to agree to his release: his reasons were, because of the consciousness of guilt, and the danger of contracting more." 

2. "The secret one in providence was, God would not have it so; and yet things must be carried to this pitch, that it might appear that Christ suffered not for his own sins, but ours, and that he suffered willingly."

3. "This was a piece of craftiness in them, for nothing could more nearly affect Pilate, than an insinuation of want of friendship and fidelity to Tiberius, who was then Caesar, or emperor."
