The significance of this moment is emphasized by the tension and urgency surrounding Jesus' crucifixion, highlighting the profound impact of these events.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "παρασκευὴ τοῦ π. answers to עֶרֶב הפֶּסַח, and is 'the vigil of the Passover,' i.e. the day preceding the evening when the passover was killed." 
2. "There is an insuperable difficulty as the text now stands. For Mark relates, ch. John 15:25, that the crucifixion took place at the third hour: and that it certainly was so, the whole arrangement of the day testifies."
3. "The words ἴδε ὁ βασ. ὑμ. seem to have been spoken in irony to the Jews in the same spirit in which afterwards the title was written over the cross."

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "The true reading here is probably, 'the third hour'—or nine A.M.—which agrees best with the whole series of events, as well as with the other Evangelists."
2. "He saith to the Jews, 'Behold your King!' Having now made up his mind to yield to them, he takes a sort of quiet revenge on them by this irony, which he knew would sting them."

2. "The sixth hour - Twelve o’clock noon."
3. "Mark says Mark 15:25 that it was the third hour. See the difficulty explained in the notes at that place."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The mention of the sixth hour is significant because it was the exact moment when Jesus was crucified. This detail emphasizes the precise timing of Jesus' sacrifice and highlights the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies."

2. "The sixth hour also symbolizes the darkness and despair that covered the land during Jesus' crucifixion. It serves as a reminder of the weight of sin and the magnitude of Jesus' sacrifice for humanity."

3. "By mentioning the sixth hour, the Gospel writer invites readers to reflect on the significance of the crucifixion and the profound impact it has on our lives. It prompts us to contemplate the depth of God's love and the redemption that is made available through Jesus' death on the cross."

### John Calvin:
1. "The Evangelists appear to differ, and even to contradict each other, in the computation of time."
2. "It is plain enough from other passages that the day was at that time divided into four parts."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The day now dawning, and the events now occurring, were ‘a preparation of the Paschal lamb’ yet not of the lamb of the Jewish feast, but of the true Paschal Lamb, Jesus Himself, of the Lamb now on His way to be sacrificed for the life of His people."
2. "If, on the other hand, the word denotes the weekly day of preparation (‘Friday’), it is clear that in John 19:31 any explanatory addition would be superfluous."

He would have set Him free had he possessed sufficient earnestness and depth of moral character to carry into effect what he knew to be right."

1. "The Preparation of the passover (παρασκευη του πασχα). That is, Friday of passover week, the preparation day before the Sabbath of passover week (or feast)."

3. "The sarcasm of Pilate is aimed at the Jews, not at Jesus."

### John Gill:
1. "The preparation of the passover was not of the passover lamb, for that had been prepared and eaten the night before."
2. "If any respect is had to the preparation for the passover, it must either design the preparation of the 'Chagigah', which was a grand festival, commonly kept on the fifteenth day, and which was sometimes called the passover; or else the preparation for the whole feast all the remaining days of it."
3. "It seems best of all to understand it only of the preparation for the sabbath, which, because it was in the passover week, is called the passover preparation day."
