# John 19:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the Jewish chief priests, who were meant to recognize God as their King, shockingly reject Jesus as their Messiah and proclaim allegiance to Caesar instead. This confession not only displays their degradation and hypocrisy, but it also reveals their shortsightedness and selfish motives. By rejecting Jesus as their King, they ultimately bring upon themselves the consequences of their choice - the loss of God's grace and the destruction of their own nation. Their rejection signifies the abandonment of their Messianic hope and the tragic rejection of God's authority.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "A degrading confession from the chief priests of that people of whom it was said, 'The Lord your God is your King.'" 
2. "However, it furthered the present purpose, and to this all was sacrificed, including truth itself." 
3. "The confession was not only degrading, but false in their mouths."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Crucify your King? . . . We have no king but Cæsar." - This quote highlights the irony of the situation, as the Jewish leaders, who were supposed to be waiting for the Messiah, rejected Jesus as their King and instead proclaimed their allegiance to Caesar. 

2. "Some of those who thus cried died miserably in rebellion against Cæsar forty years afterwards." - This quote points out the consequences of their decision to reject Jesus as their King. The Jewish people who rejected Jesus and chose Caesar eventually faced the wrath of Rome during the Jewish rebellion, resulting in their own destruction and suffering. 

3. "But it suited their present purpose." - This quote suggests that the Jewish leaders' proclamation of loyalty to Caesar was driven by their own selfish motives and political expediency rather than a genuine belief in Caesar's authority. It highlights the hypocrisy and shortsightedness of their decision.

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The pronoun of remote reference isolates and sharply distinguishes them from Jesus."
2. "These chief representatives of the theocratic government of Israel thus formally and expressly renounce it, and declare their allegiance to a temporal and pagan power."
3. "This utterance is 'the formal abdication of the Messianic hope.'"

### John Calvin:
1. "This is a display of shocking madness, that the priests, who ought to have been well acquainted with the Law, reject Christ, in whom the salvation of the people was wholly contained."
2. "They deprive themselves of the grace of God and of every blessing."
3. "The sole happiness of the godly is, to be subject to the royal authority of Christ, whether, according to the flesh, they are placed under a just and lawful government, under the oppression of tyrants."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Instinct tells them that the last moment when they may accomplish their object is arrived: and, roused to the utmost pitch of fury by the words of Pilate, they cry out, with a quick repetition of words corresponding to their feelings, Let him be hurried off to crucifixion."
2. "The chief priests, the heads of the Theocracy of Israel, give the answer, which thus comes upon us with a more terrible force than it could otherwise have done. What an answer is it! It is the utterance of self-condemnation, the renouncing of the chief honour of the chosen people, the casting away of what had most distinguished them in the past, of what they hoped most from in the future, ‘We have no king but Cæsar.’"
3. "God is rejected; Messianic hope is trampled under foot. In the moment of securing the death of their true King, ‘the Jews,’ by the mouth of their leaders and representatives, plunge themselves into the lowest depths of guilt and shame."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "This thing has gotten on the nerves of the crowd. Note the repetition." 
2. "Pilate weakly repeats his sarcasm: 'Your king shall I crucify?'" 
3. "The chief priests were Sadducees, who had no Messianic hope like that of the Pharisees. So to carry their point against Jesus they renounce the principle of the theocracy that God was their King."

### John Gill:
1. "They were impatient until he was ordered away for execution; and nothing would satisfy them but the crucifixion of him." 
2. "They rejected the government of the King Messiah, and tacitly confessed that the sceptre was departed from Judah." 
3. "After the crucifixion of him, all power was taken from them; the government was seized upon by the Romans entirely, and at last utterly destroyed."
