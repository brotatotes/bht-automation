## Choicest Commentary Quotes:

2. "By identifying the chief priests as the ones who handed Jesus over to Pilate, the verse emphasizes the role of religious leaders in the crucifixion of Jesus, highlighting the irony of those who should have recognized and accepted him as the Messiah being the ones who ultimately condemned him."

3. "The mention of the chief priests in this verse also serves as a reminder that Jesus' death was not just a political act, but a spiritual one. It was the religious leaders who rejected Jesus, and in doing so, played a significant role in the fulfillment of God's plan for salvation."
