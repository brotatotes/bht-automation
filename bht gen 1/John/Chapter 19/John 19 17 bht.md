# John 19:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, Jesus is depicted carrying the crossbeam of the cross for himself. The act of carrying the cross not only represents the physical burden that Jesus bore, but also serves as a symbol of the weight of sin that he would carry on behalf of humanity. This act of self-sacrifice demonstrates Jesus' willingness to take on the burdens of others and to fulfill the purpose for which he came into the world. His carrying of the cross is a powerful portrayal of his role as the perfect sacrifice and the fulfillment of God's plan for salvation.
