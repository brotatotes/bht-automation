# John 19:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
On the cross, a sign was displayed that read, "Jesus of Nazareth, the King of the Jews." This inscription, intended as a mockery, unknowingly proclaimed the profound truth of Jesus' identity as the true King and Savior. Pilate's purpose was to humiliate the Jews, yet God's providence turned this mockery into a proclamation of Jesus' royal authority. The inscription also highlights the contrasting innocence of Jesus and the guilt of the criminals crucified alongside him. Through these words, Jesus' kingdom, characterized by self-sacrifice and love, is revealed as not of this world.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
