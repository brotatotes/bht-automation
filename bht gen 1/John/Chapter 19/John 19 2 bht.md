# John 19:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this powerful verse, we witness the brutal mockery inflicted upon Jesus during his crucifixion. He is crowned with thorns, a symbol of the soldiers' contempt for his claim as a king. They go further, placing a purple robe on him, ridiculing his authority. The soldiers' insolence exceeds Pilate's orders, while the Jews remain unmoved. However, amidst this cruelty and wickedness, we find a deeper purpose - the reconciling of the world to God through the sacrificial death of his Son.
