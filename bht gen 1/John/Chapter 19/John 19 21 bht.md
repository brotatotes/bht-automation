# John 19:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, the commentators shed light on the reactions of the religious leaders and the political authorities to the inscription "King of the Jews" placed on Jesus' cross. They note the discomfort and offense taken by the chief priests due to the unintended implication that their mockery may have fallen back on them. The commentators also highlight the irony in the title, as it secretly affirmed Jesus' true identity while the religious leaders sought to mock him. Ultimately, this inscription both honored Jesus and brought shame upon the nation.
