# John 19:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the face of pressure and manipulation from the chief priests, Pilate's resolute decision stood firm. With a sense of finality, Pilate declared that his written accusation against Jesus could not and would not be altered. This unchanging inscription on the cross signifies the gravity of Jesus' condemnation and even unwittingly affirms his true identity as the King of the Jews. Pilate's words serve as a reminder that our choices have lasting consequences, and despite human efforts, the divine plan for Jesus' crucifixion could not be swayed or undone.

### John Calvin:
1. "Pilate’s firmness must be ascribed to the providence of God; for there can be no doubt that they attempted, in various ways, to change his resolution."
2. "And if, in the writing of Pilate, the kingdom of Christ was shown to be so firm that it could not be shaken by all the attacks of its enemies, what value ought we to attach to the testimonies of the Prophets, whose tongues and hands God consecrated to his service?"
3. "The example of Pilate reminds us, also, that it is our duty to remain steady in defending the truth."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "It is impossible to mistake the feeling of the Evangelist that in all this the finger of God is to be traced." 
2. "Those who refuse to ‘believe’ shall yet be compelled to own that Jesus is King."

It underscores the fact that Pilate had already passed judgment on Jesus based on the accusation brought by the chief priests.

### John Gill:
1. "He seems to say this, as one angry and displeased with them; either because they would not consent to release Jesus, which he was desirous of, but pressed him so very hard to crucify him; or at their insolence, in directing him in what form to put the superscription, which he determines shall stand unaltered, as he had wrote it."

2. "This he said, either because he could not alter it after it was written, for it is said that 'a proconsul's table is his sentence, which being once read, not one letter can either be increased or diminished; but as it is recited, so it is related in the instrument of the province;' or if he could have altered it, he was not suffered by God to do it; but was so directed, and overruled by divine providence, as to write, so to persist in, and abide by what he had wrote inviolably; which is the sense of his words."

3. "Dr. Lightfoot has given several instances out of the Talmud, showing that this is a common way of speaking with the Rabbins; and that words thus doubled signify that what is spoken of stands good, and is irrevocable."

1. "These words express the firmness and finality of Pilate's decision. He is declaring that his decision to have Jesus crucified is unchangeable and will not be overturned."

In his own way, Pilate is affirming the truth of Jesus' identity as the King, even though he may not fully understand or believe it himself."

4. "In a broader sense, Pilate's declaration serves as a reminder that our words and actions have consequences, and once they are spoken or done, they cannot be easily undone or erased."
