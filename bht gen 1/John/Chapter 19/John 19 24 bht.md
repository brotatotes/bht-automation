## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "That a prediction so exceedingly specific—distinguishing one piece of dress from others, and announcing that while those should be parted amongst several, that should be given by lot to one person—that such a prediction should not only be fulfilled to the letter, but by a party of heathen military, without interference from either the friends of the enemies of the Crucified One, is surely worthy to be ranked among the wonders of this all-wonderful scene."
2. "We thank you, O ye chief priests, scribes, and elders, for this triple testimony, unconsciously borne by you, to our Christ: first to His habitual trust in God, as a feature in His character so marked and palpable that even ye found upon it your impotent taunt; next, to His identity with the Sufferer of the twenty-second Psalm, whose very words ye unwittingly appropriate, thus serving yourselves heirs to the dark office and impotent malignity of Messiah's enemies; and again, to the true sense of that august title which He took to Himself, 'THE SON OF GOD,' which He rightly interpreted at the very first as a claim to that oneness of nature with Him, and dearness to Him, which a son has to his father."
3. "In the taunt of the soldiers we have one of those undesigned coincidences which so strikingly verify these historical records. While the ecclesiastics deride Him for calling Himself, 'the Christ, the King of Israel, the Chosen, the Son of God,' the soldiers, to whom all such phraseology was mere Jewish jargon, make sport of Him as a pretender to royalty ('KING of the Jews'), an office and dignity which it belonged to them to comprehend."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Let us not rend it - It would then have been useless." This quote emphasizes the importance of preserving the integrity of the outer garment, symbolizing the unity and completeness of the scripture. 

2. "The outer garment, being composed of several parts - fringes, borders, etc." This quote highlights the complexity and richness of the scripture, which consists of various elements that contribute to its overall significance. 

3. "That the scripture ... - Psalms 22:18." This quote references a specific verse from Psalms, suggesting that the scripture itself contains prophecies and foreshadowing that can be found and understood through careful study and interpretation.

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Vesture, or clothing, is not just a mere physical covering, but it represents our identity and status in society."
2. "The use of the word 'garments' instead of 'raiment' emphasizes the individual pieces of clothing that make up our overall attire."
3. "By understanding the significance of our vesture, we can appreciate the importance of presenting ourselves in a manner that reflects our values and beliefs."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Both in the dividing and in the casting of lots the Evangelist sees Scripture fulfilled."
2. "The quotation is from Psalms 22:18, and is accurately reproduced from the Septuagint."
3. "The words may either be intended to emphasize the presence of God in the scene, as He made the Roman soldiers fulfil His Scripture; or may simply arise out of the intense interest with which John narrates each particular of these eventful hours."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Let us not rend it (μη σχισωμεν αυτον). It was too valuable to ruin."
2. "Cast lots (λαχωμεν). The enemies of the Lord's Anointed treated him as already dead and so cast lots."
3. "John here quotes with the usual formula Psalms 22:18 (LXX verbatim) and finds a fulfillment here."

### John Gill:
1. "The whole psalm is to be understood of the Messiah, not of David, as some do; many passages in it cannot be applied to him, such as speak of the dislocation of his bones, the piercing of his hands and feet, and this of parting his garments, and casting lots for his vesture: all which had their literal accomplishment in Jesus." 
2. "The Scriptures are the garments of Christ; these exhibit and show forth Christ in his glory, and by which he is known and bore witness to, and are pure and incorrupt, fragrant, and savory."
3. "The righteousness of Christ may be signified by this robe, which is often compared to one, because it is put on the saints, and they are clothed with it: it covers, keeps warm, protects, beautifies, and adorns them; this is seamless, and all of a piece, and has nothing of men's works and services tacked unto it; is enjoyed by a divine lot by some men, and not all, and even such as have been sinful and ungodly; it is pure, perfect and will last forever."

### John Wesley:
1. "No circumstance of David's life bore any resemblance to this, or to several other passages in the 22nd Psalm."
2. "The prophet seems to have been thrown into a preternatural ecstacy, wherein, personating the Messiah."
3. "He spoke barely what the Spirit dictated, without any regard to himself."
