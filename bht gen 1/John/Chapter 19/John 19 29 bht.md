# John 19:29 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Combining insights from various commentators, the Bible verse describes the moment during Jesus' crucifixion where vinegar mixed with gall or myrrh was offered to Him on a sponge attached to a stalk of hyssop. This act of offering vinegar on the hyssop serves as a representation of Christ's humility and suffering. The use of hyssop, a lowly plant, emphasizes the contrast between Jesus' immense sacrifice and the ordinary means by which it was carried out. The reference to Psalm 69:21 further enhances the significance of the hyssop in relation to Jesus' crucifixion.
