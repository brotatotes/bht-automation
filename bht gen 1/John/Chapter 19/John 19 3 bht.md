# John 19:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we witness the relentless mockery and humiliation endured by Jesus. The soldiers approached him one after another, mockingly hailing him as the "King of the Jews." Their persistent actions of bowing and addressing him in a derisive manner emphasized their intent to belittle Jesus' kingly office. They further humiliated him by spitting on him and repeatedly slapping him. These acts showcased the rejection of Jesus as King by some, while others disregarded his authority. This painful scene, allowed by Pilate, pleased the wicked hearts of the Jews, who remained unmoved.
