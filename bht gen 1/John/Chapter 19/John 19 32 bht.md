# John 19:32 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, we see the soldiers carrying out a brutal act of breaking the legs of those crucified with Jesus, a detail uniquely recorded by John. Scholars note that this leg-breaking was a form of punishment, sometimes inflicted on slaves. The bodies of the criminals and Jesus were suspended on the cross, with Jesus positioned in the middle. The passive voice used in "crucified" emphasizes the believer's identification with Christ's death and the transformative power of this union. Overall, this verse highlights the physical suffering endured by Jesus and the unity of believers with Christ in his crucifixion.
