## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The spear perhaps pierced the pericardium or envelope of the heart, in which case a liquid answering the description of ὕδωρ may have flowed with the blood."
2. "It is more probable that the fact, which is here so strongly testified, was a consequence of the extreme exhaustion of the Body of the Redeemer."
3. "His view after all seems to be the safe and true one that the circumstance is related as a miraculous sign, having deep significance as to the work of the Redeemer, and shewing Him to be more than mortal."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "But one of the soldiers—to make assurance of the fact doubly sure."
2. "With a spear pierced his side—making a wound deep and wide."
3. "And forthwith came thereout blood and water."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "This man appears to have doubted whether he was dead, and, in order to see whether he was not yet sensible, he pierced him with his spear."
2. "It was, doubtless, to furnish this conclusive proof that he was actually dead, and that an atonement had thus been made for mankind, that John mentions so particularly this fact."
3. "This fact it was of importance to prove, that it might not be pretended that he had only suffered a syncope, or had fainted."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Used also, as here, for the spear itself."
2. "The verb used here, however, nussw, is also used to describe severe and deadly wounds."

### John Calvin:
1. "When the soldier pierced Christ’s side with his spear, he did so for the purpose of ascertaining if he was dead; but God had a higher object in view, as we shall immediately see."
2. "By these words he means that Christ brought the true atonement and the true washing; for, on the one hand, forgiveness of sins and justification, and, on the other hand, the sanctification of the soul, were prefigured in the Law by those two symbols, sacrifices and washings."
3. "The sacraments which Christ has left to his Church have the same design; for the purification and sanctification of the soul, which consists in newness of life, is pointed out to us in Baptism, and the Lord’s Supper is the pledge of a perfect atonement."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "With a spear (λογχη). Instrumental case of this old word, here only in the N.T."
2. "Pierced his side (αυτου την πλευραν ενυξεν). First aorist active indicative of νυσσω, old word to pierce, here only in N.T."
3. "Blood and water (αιμα κα υδωρ). Dr. W. Stroud argues that this fact proves that the spear pierced the left side of Jesus near the heart and that Jesus had died literally of a broken heart since blood was mixed with water."

### John Gill:
1. "This the soldier did, partly out of spite to Christ, and partly to know whether he was really dead; and which was so ordered by divine providence, that it might beyond all doubt appear that he really died, and was not taken down alive from the cross."
2. "This water and blood some make to signify baptism and the Lord's supper, which are both of Christ's appointing, and spring from him, and refer to his sufferings and death; rather they signify the blessings of sanctification and justification, the grace of the one being represented by water, as it frequently is in the Old and New Testament, and the other by blood, and both from Christ."
3. "That Christ was the antitype of the rock in the wilderness, the apostle assures us, in 1 Corinthians 10:4 and if the Jews are to be believed, he was so in this instance; Jonathan ben Uzziel, in his Targum on Numbers 20:11 says that 'Moses smote the rock twice, at the first time אטיפת אדמא, 'blood dropped out': and at the second time abundance of waters flowed out.'"

### John Wesley:
1. "Forthwith there came out blood and water" - This verse highlights the miraculous nature of Jesus' death, as it is unusual for both blood and water to flow out from a dead body. 

2. "It was strange, seeing he was dead, that blood should come out; more strange, that water also" - The commentary emphasizes the extraordinary nature of this event, as it defies the expectations of what would typically occur after death. 

3. "It was pure and true water, as well as pure and true blood" - This statement underscores the authenticity and significance of the blood and water that flowed from Jesus' side, emphasizing that they were not mere illusions or symbolic representations.
