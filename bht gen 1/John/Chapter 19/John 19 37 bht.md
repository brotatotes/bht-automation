1. "They pierced" - This phrase is a correct translation of the Hebrew in Zechariah 12:10, and it is used in the New Testament only in this verse and Revelation 1:7. 

2. "First aorist active" - The verb tense used here indicates that the piercing action was completed in the past. 

3. "Not like the LXX" - The translation of this phrase in the New Testament differs from the Septuagint (LXX), showing a unique interpretation or understanding of the verse.

### John Gill:
1. "Christ, who is Jehovah, is there speaking prophetically of himself, here the evangelist cites it as fulfilled in him, that is, that part of it which regards the piercing of him."
2. "And as the piercing of the Messiah has been literally fulfilled in Jesus, there is reason to believe, though the Jews are to this day hardened against him, that that part of the prophecy which concerns their looking to him, and mourning for him on account of his being pierced by them, will also, in God's own time, be fulfilled."
3. "From the citation of this passage it appears, that the writers of the New Testament did not always follow the Greek version of the Old Testament, which here renders the words very differently, and very wrongly; but John cites them according to the Hebrew text, even which we now have, and which is an instance of the truth, purity, and integrity of the present Hebrew books of the Old Testament."
