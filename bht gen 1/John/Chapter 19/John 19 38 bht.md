# John 19:38 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, we see Joseph of Arimathea and Nicodemus, both secret disciples of Jesus, displaying courage and boldness. Despite their fear and shame in the past, they now come forward to ask Pilate for permission to take down Jesus' body and give Him a proper burial. Their actions serve as a powerful example of the transformation that can take place in the hearts of believers, even in the face of adversity.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The narrative implies, though it does not mention (as Mark and Luke do), that Joseph himself took down the Body from the cross."
2. "The ἀρθῶσιν of Joh 19:31 need not imply, ‘by their hands.’"
3. "It was customary to grant the bodies of executed persons to their friends."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Marvellous it certainly is, that one who while Jesus was yet alive merely refrained from condemning Him, not having the courage to espouse His cause by one positive act, should, now that He was dead, and His cause apparently dead with Him, summon up courage to go in personally to the Roman governor and ask permission to take down and inter the body."
2. "The heroism of faith is usually kindled by desperate circumstances, and is not seldom displayed by those who before were the most timid, and scarce known as disciples at all."
3. "The reality of our Lord's death was attested by the party of all others most competent to decide on it, and certainly free from all bias—the officer in attendance—in full reliance on whose testimony Pilate surrendered the body."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "A disciple of Jesus. Matt. calls him a rich man; Mark, an honorable counselor, i.e., a member of the Sanhedrim; and Luke, a counselor, good and just."
2. "Mark adds that he went in boldly, which is suggestive in view of John's statement of his secret discipleship, a fact which is passed over by the Synoptists."
3. "Avaricious governors sometimes sold this privilege. Cicero, in one of his orations against Verres, has a terribly graphic passage describing such extortions."

### John Calvin:
1. "Till now, therefore, riches had prevented them from professing to be the disciples of Christ, and might afterwards have no less influence in keeping them from making a profession so much hated and abhorred."
2. "It is therefore certain that this was effected by a heavenly impulse, so that they who, through fear, did not render the honor due to him while he was alive, now run to his dead body, as if they had become new men."
3. "So long as ambition and the love of money reigned in them, the grace of Christ had no charms for them; but now they begin to disrelish the whole world."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Joseph of Arimathea, being a disciple of Jesus, but secretly for fear of the Jews, asked of Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus: and Pilate gave him leave." - This verse highlights Joseph's fear of the Jews and his secret discipleship, showing the risks and challenges faced by early followers of Jesus.

2. "It is easy to understand that Pilate should at once grant the permission asked... by giving it up to disciples of Jesus he would have a fresh opportunity of at once doing despite to, and exasperating, the Jews." - The commentary suggests that Pilate's decision to allow Joseph to take Jesus' body may have been motivated by a desire to provoke the Jews further.

3. "It seems not unlikely that in the fact that disciples receive the body of the Lord the Evangelist beholds a token of the care with which it was watched over by His Father in Heaven." - The commentator suggests that the fact that Jesus' body was entrusted to his disciples is seen as a sign of divine care and protection.

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "An example of the rulers described in John 12:41-43 who through cowardice feared to own their faith in Jesus as the Messiah."
2. "But it must be put down to the credit of Joseph that he showed courage in this darkest hour when the majority had lost heart."
3. "Pilate gladly consented."

1. "Joseph of Arimathea asked Pilate — And Nicodemus also came - Acknowledging Christ, when even his chosen disciples forsook him." 
2. "In that extremity Joseph was no longer afraid, Nicodemus no longer ashamed."
