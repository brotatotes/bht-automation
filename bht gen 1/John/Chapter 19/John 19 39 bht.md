The verse in question showcases the immense love and devotion of Nicodemus and Joseph of Arimathea towards Jesus. Their love for Him was ignited by His great love and sacrificial death.

This act of love served as a testimony for Jesus and His transformative power, as both men had previously lived in secrecy and darkness but now displayed a remarkable change and open discipleship.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Their love to Jesus was called out by the might of His love. His Death is the Power which constrains men."
2. "And thus this act of love on the part of both these men is a testimony for Jesus, and for the future effect of His death."
3. "Hence also it appears why the Evangelist mentions the weight of the spices, as a proof of the greatness of their love."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "This remark corresponds to the secrecy of Joseph's discipleship, just noticed, and calls attention to the similarity of their previous character and conduct, and the remarkable change which had now taken place."
2. "An immense quantity, betokening the greatness of their love."
3. "Part of it probably intended as a layer for the spot on which the body was to lie."

### Marvin Vincent:

2. "The large quantity may be explained by the intention of covering the entire body with the preparation."
3. "Extraordinary reverence in its sorrowful excitement does not easily satisfy itself."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The quantity of spices thus brought by Nicodemus is certainly remarkable; and hence some have shrunk from taking the words in their literal sense, holding that ‘a hundred pound’ (especially as here qualified by ‘about’) may be an expression merely denoting a great quantity."
2. "The distinct identification of this Nicodemus with the ruler who came to Jesus by night (chap. 3) is undoubtedly significant."
3. "The humiliation of the King of Israel (chap. John 3:3, John 12:13), so far from discouraging, does but strengthen the once weak faith of the true disciple; and in contrast with (and may we not add in expression of shame and penitence for) timorous hesitation, we read of the lavish offering of a love open and avowed."
