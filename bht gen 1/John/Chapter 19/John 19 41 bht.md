## BHT:
In a providential arrangement, Jesus was buried in a new sepulcher in close proximity to the site of His crucifixion. This choice of a garden tomb, untouched by any previous burial, underscored the uniqueness and separation of Jesus from sinners. The garden served as a symbolic reminder of hope, representing the possibility of resurrection and new life that would come through Jesus' sacrifice. The juxtaposition of the cross and the garden expressed the tension between suffering and hope, demonstrating that even in the midst of darkness, there is the promise of transformation and beauty emerging from pain.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The words ἐν τῷ τόπῳ ὅπου ἐσταυρώθη are so far in favour of the traditional site of the Holy Sepulchre, that Calvary and the Sepulchre are close together, under the roof of the same church." 
2. "The newness of the tomb was important, that it should be seen 'neminem præter Jesum, neque Jesum alterius virtute, ut olim circa sepulchrum Elisæi acciderat, resurrexisse' (Lampe): so that no room might be left for the evasions of unbelief." 
3. "And those who have found an objection in that circumstance have forgotten this testimony of John."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "There laid they Jesus therefore, because of the Jew's preparation day, for the sepulchre was nigh at hand." - The choice of the tomb near the crucifixion site was a providential provision, allowing for a quick burial. 

2. "But it was 'a new sepulchre,' wherein never man before was laid." - The fact that Jesus was laid in a tomb that had never been used before highlights His uniqueness and separation from sinners. 

3. "Thus as He rode into Jerusalem on an ass 'whereon never man before had sat,' so now He shall lie in a tomb wherein never man before had lain." - These parallel instances emphasize the exceptional nature of Jesus and His complete separation from sin.
