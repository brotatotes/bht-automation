# John 19:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Behold the scene as Jesus came forth, not hesitating to face the mocking crowd, who were unaware of the gravity of their actions. His appearance in regal attire was meant to evoke sympathy and expose the baselessness of the accusations against Him. Though Pilate's intentions were to soften their hearts, Jesus's dignified response to the mockery revealed His divine purpose amidst the shame. The image of Jesus, bearing the marks of brutality, served as a powerful reminder of His humanity and the call for compassion.

This is the man that you accuse; and he is now brought forth, that you may see that he is not guilty.'"
