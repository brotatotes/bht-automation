# John 19:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this passage, we see the intense hostility and injustice faced by Jesus. The mob, fueled by their own emotions and influenced by the religious leaders, cried out for his crucifixion despite Pilate's recognition of Jesus' innocence. Pilate, torn between his sense of justice and fear of the Jews, reluctantly handed Jesus over to their brutal desires. This heartbreaking scene exposes the depths of humanity's wickedness, as even those who claimed to be righteous were complicit in their desire for the death of one who was faultless.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The advance from what is stated at chap. John 18:40 to the present point is at once perceptible. Then the Jews refused to have Jesus released to them, and cried out for Barabbas. Now their cry reaches its culmination, ‘Crucify! Crucify!’"
2. "The words do not seem to contain any serious authorization on the part of Pilate to the Jews to crucify Jesus. The latter at least did not understand them in that sense, or they would probably have at once availed themselves of the permission given."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "First aorist active imperative of σταυροω for which verb see Matthew 29:19, etc. Here the note of urgency (aorist imperative) with no word for 'him,' as they were led by the chief priests and the temple police till the whole mob takes it up (Matthew 27:22)."
