# John 19:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this passage, Pilate's fear is heightened by the mention of the name "Son of God" which confirms his superstitious fears regarding Jesus' miraculous deeds and mysterious nature. This fear is not merely of the Jews or acting unjustly, but specifically focuses on the person of Jesus. Pilate's conscience is alarmed, recognising Jesus' innocence and dreading the possibility of divine retribution. The combination of his own convictions and the pressure from the Jews agitates Pilate, leading him to seek further clarification from Jesus.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "This charge served to increase the fear which Pilate had before."
2. "The name υἱὸς θεοῦ served also to confirm the omen already furnished by the dream of his wife."
3. "That this fear was not a fear of the Jews, nor of acting unjustly, but of the Person of Jesus, is evident from what follows."

3. "The dream of his wife."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He was the more afraid - What was the ground of his fear is not declared by the evangelist. It was probably, however, the alarm of his conscience, and the fear of vengeance if he suffered such an act of injustice to be done as to put an innocent man to death."
2. "He was convinced of his innocence. He saw more and more clearly the design of the Jews; and it is not improbable that a pagan, who believed that the gods often manifested themselves to people, dreaded their vengeance if he suffered one who claimed to be divine, and who might be, to be put to death."
3. "It is clear that Pilate was convinced that Jesus was innocent; and in this state of agitation between the convictions of his own conscience, and the clamors of the Jews, and the fear of vengeance, and the certainty that he would do wrong if he gave him up, he was thrown into this state of alarm, and resolved again to question Jesus, that he might obtain satisfaction on the subjects that agitated his mind."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The saying gives strength to a dreadful presentiment which was gradually forming within him."

3. "The truth naturally presents itself to his mind in the form of pagan superstitions and mythological legends."

### John Calvin:
1. "Pilate dreaded lest some blame should be imputed to him, if a tumult arose, because he had not condemned Christ."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "He was already afraid because of his wife's message." 
2. "The claim of Jesus to deity excited Pilate's superstitious fears." 
3. "The more afraid."

### John Gill:
1. "He was afraid to put him to death, or to consent to it before; partly on account of his wife's message to him, and partly upon a conviction of the innocence of Christ, in his own conscience."
2. "He was more afraid, since here was a charge brought against him he did not well understand the meaning of; and a law of theirs pretended to be violated hereby, which should he pay no regard to, might occasion a tumult."
3. "He might be the more uneasy, lest the thing they charged him with asserting, should be really fact; that he was one of the gods come down in the likeness of man; or that he was some demi-god at least, or so nearly related to deity, that it might be dangerous for him to have anything to do with him this way."

### John Wesley:
1. "He seems to have been afraid before of shedding innocent blood."
