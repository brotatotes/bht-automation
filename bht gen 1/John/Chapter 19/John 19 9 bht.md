# John 19:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this ambiguous and intense moment, the fear of Pilate becomes evident as he questions Jesus' origins, hoping to grasp the true nature of this remarkable Man. The silence of Jesus is intentional, for it contains a profound answer that reverberates beyond the surface. This unspoken response echoes His previous statement, serving as a powerful testimony to His divine origin. The reluctance of Jesus to engage in this line of questioning challenges the wavering governor, exposing both his inner turmoil and the weight of his impending decision.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The fear of Pilate is not mere superstition, nor does it enter into the Jewish meaning of υἱὸς θ .: but arises from an indefinite impression made on him by the Person and bearing of our Lord." 
2. "Our Lord, in His silence, was acting according to His own precept, Matthew 7:6."
3. "This silence was the most emphatic answer to all who had ears to hear it; was a reference to what He had said before, ch. John 18:37, and so a witness to His divine origin."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Whence art thou?—beyond all doubt a question relating not to His mission but to His personal origin."
2. "He had said enough; the time for answering such a question was past."
3. "The weak and wavering governor is already on the point of giving way."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Whence art thou?" - This question was asked to determine if Jesus claimed to be the Son of God, whether a mere man or divine.
2. "Jesus gave him no answer" - Jesus chose not to respond, possibly for strategic reasons.
3. "Pilate knew that he was a Galilean" - Pilate already had some knowledge about Jesus' background.

### John Calvin:
1. "Pilate, struck with the fear of God, was in perplexity and doubt as to what he ought to do; for he saw, on the one hand, the excitement of a mutiny, and, on the other hand, conscience held him bound not to offend God for the sake of avoiding danger."
2. "If reverence for God had so much influence on an irreligious man, must not they be worse than reprobate, who now judge of divine things in sport and jest, carelessly, and without any fear?"
3. "We ought not to think it strange that Jesus makes no reply; at least, if we keep in mind what I have formerly mentioned, that he did not stand before Pilate to plead his own cause, but rather to suffer condemnation; for it was proper that he should be condemned, when he appeared in our room."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Pilate knew that Jesus was from Galilee (Luke 23:6). He is really alarmed."
2. "The silence of Jesus, like that before Caiaphas (Mark 14:61; Matthew 26:63) and Herod (Luke 23:9), irritates the dignity of Pilate in spite of his fears."
3. "See a like question by the Jews in John 8:25."

### John Gill:
1. "Jesus gave him no answer; for his question was frivolous, and deserved none."
2. "He was not worthy of one, who had used him so ill, when he knew, in his own conscience, that he was innocent."
3. "Since Christ was come to die for the salvation of his people, it was not proper he should say anything that might be a means of hindering it."

### John Wesley:
1. "Whence art thou?": This question asks about the origin and lineage of the person. It seeks to understand the identity and background of the individual in question.

2. "That is, whose son art thou?": This clarification highlights that the question is specifically about the person's parentage. It emphasizes the importance of knowing one's ancestry and the significance it holds in understanding a person's character and purpose.

3. The question of "Whence art thou?" goes beyond mere curiosity; it delves into the deeper meaning of one's existence. It prompts us to reflect on our own origins and the role our heritage plays in shaping who we are. It reminds us that our identity is not solely determined by our own choices but is also influenced by the legacy passed down to us.
