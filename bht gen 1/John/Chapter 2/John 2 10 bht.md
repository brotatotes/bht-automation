### Albert Barnes:
1. "When men have well drunk - This word does not of necessity mean that they were intoxicated, though it is usually employed in that sense. It may mean when they have drunk sufficient, or to satiety; or have drunk so much as to produce hilarity, and to destroy the keenness of their taste, so that they could not readily distinguish the good from that which was worse."

2. "The wine referred to here was doubtless such as was commonly drunk in Palestine. That was the pure juice of the grape. It was not brandied wine, nor drugged wine, nor wine compounded of various substances, such as we drink in this land. The common wine drunk in Palestine was that which was the simple juice of the grape."

3. "No man should adduce This instance in favor of drinking wine unless he can prove that the wine made in the waterpots of Cana was just like the wine which he proposes to drink. The Saviour’s example may be always pleaded just as it was; but it is a matter of obvious and simple justice that we should find out exactly what the example was before we plead it."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The ruler of the feast means that when the palates of the guests have become less sensitive through indulgence, an inferior quality of wine is offered."
2. "In every instance of its use in the New Testament the word means intoxication."
3. "The metaphorical use of the word has passed into common slang, as when a drunken man is said to be wetted or soaked."

### John Gill:
1. "Every man at the beginning doth set forth good wine; that is, it is usual with men, when they make entertainments, first to give the guests the best, the most generous, and strongest bodied wine."
2. "And as the bridegroom here did, in the apprehension of the ruler of the feast, at this his marriage, so does the Lord, the husband of the church, in the marriage feast of the Gospel; and so he will do at the marriage supper of the lamb."
3. "The Gospel, which may be compared to wine for its purity, pleasant taste, and generous effects in reviving drooping spirits, refreshing weary persons, and comforting distressed minds, as also for its antiquity, was published before the coming of Christ, in the times of Adam, Noah, Abraham, Moses, David, and the prophets, but in a lower and weaker way."

### John Wesley:
1. "St. John barely relates the words he spoke, which does not imply his approving them."
2. "When they have well drunk — does not mean any more than toward the close of the entertainment."

These quotes highlight the commentator's perspective on the passage, emphasizing that the words spoken by the speaker are simply being reported and not necessarily endorsed by the author. Additionally, the phrase "when they have well drunk" is explained to mean the end of the entertainment, rather than implying excessive drinking.
