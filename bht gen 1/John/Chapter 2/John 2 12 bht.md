# John 2:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus left the higher ground and descended to Capernaum on the shore of the Sea of Galilee. This change marked a transition from His private life to His public ministry. Capernaum became Jesus' usual place of residence, and it was there that he manifested the glory of His deity and confirmed the faith of His disciples. Among His company were His mother and brethren, who were not only His close relatives but eventually became His apostles.
