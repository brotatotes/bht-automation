# John 2:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, Jesus entered the temple and observed a bustling market where oxen, sheep, and doves were being sold for sacrifice. Surrounding the area were changers of money, exchanging foreign currencies into the temple tax currency for the convenience of the pilgrims who came from distant lands. This scene, taking place specifically in the Court of the Gentiles, evoked Jesus' righteous anger and his desire to purify the sacred space from the worldly activities that had encroached upon it.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "This market appears to have sprung up since the captivity, with a view to the convenience of those Jews who came from a distance, to provide them with the beasts for offering, and to change their foreign money into the sacred shekel, which alone was allowed to be paid in for the temple capitation-tax."
2. "The very fact of the market being held there would produce an unseemly mixture of sacred and profane transactions, even setting aside the abuses which would be certain to be mingled with the traffic."
3. "It is to the former of these evils that our Lord makes reference in this first cleansing; in the second, to the latter."

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "In the temple—not the temple itself, but the temple-court." 
2. "Sold oxen, &c.—for the convenience of those who had to offer them in sacrifice." 
3. "Changers of money—of Roman into Jewish money, in which the temple dues had to be paid."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "On each occasion he showed that his great regard was for the pure worship of his Father; and one great design of his coming was to reform the abuses which had crept into that worship, and to bring man to a proper regard for the glory of God."
2. "If it be asked how it was that those engaged in this traffic so readily yielded to Jesus of Nazareth, and that they left their gains and their property, and fled from the temple at the command of one so obscure as he was, it may be replied..."
3. "Though Jesus thus purified the temple at the commencement of his ministry, yet in three years the same scene was to be repeated."

"Not in the holy place itself, nor in the court of the priests, where the sacrifices were offered, nor in the court of the women, nor in the court of the Israelites, where the people worshipped; but in the court of the Gentiles, or the outward court, even all that space of ground which was between the wall which divided the whole from common ground, and the buildings of the temple, and which was open to the air."
