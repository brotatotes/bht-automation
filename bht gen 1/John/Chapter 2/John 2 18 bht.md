# John 2:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Jews, lacking faith, demand Jesus to perform a miracle as proof of his authority. Ironically, they fail to recognize that his act of driving out the money changers from the temple was itself a miracle. Their skepticism reveals a deep-seated need for tangible evidence and a reluctance to accept Jesus' authority without further confirmation. This passage highlights the human tendency to doubt and seek validation, even when presented with extraordinary events.
