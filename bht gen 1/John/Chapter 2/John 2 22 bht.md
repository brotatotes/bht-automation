# John 2:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this passage, we encounter a profound understanding of the Scriptures and their prophecies. It is clear that the O.T. scriptures hold a deeper meaning and that the resurrection of the Lord is intricately connected to the words of the Old Testament. The belief in Jesus' resurrection is not a blind faith, but a deep conviction rooted in the Scriptures and recognized as the fulfillment of God's promises. The disciples themselves were slow to grasp this truth, but as they reflected on Jesus' words, their faith in the Scripture and in Him grew stronger.
