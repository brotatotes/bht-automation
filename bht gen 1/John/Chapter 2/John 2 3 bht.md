# John 2:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
At a marriage feast that had already been extended for several days, the wine had run out, causing embarrassment and concern. The people, filled with anticipation of Jesus' manifestation of power and glory, hinted at the need for a miraculous intervention. Recognizing the urgency of the situation, Mary, possibly expressing both compassion and a desire to avoid disruption, quietly approached her son, aware of his ability to help. Although she may not have known what exactly he would do, she trusted in his capacity to provide a solution.
