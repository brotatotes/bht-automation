# John 2:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this passage, Jesus responds to his mother, addressing her as "woman," not out of disrespect but to signal a change in their relationship, as noted by commentators. His use of this term, though highly respectful, indicates his intention to preserve the glory of God over the honor of his earthly mother. By asserting that his hour has not yet come, Jesus both gently rebukes her interference and emphasizes the proper timing of his ministry. Through his response, he affirms his ultimate obedience to God rather than any earthly authority, even that of his mother.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The answer of our Lord is beyond question one of reproof, and disclaimer of participation in the grounds on which the request was made."
2. "It has perhaps not been enough noticed, that in this answer the Lord declares His period of subjection to her as His earthly parent to be at an end."
3. "The Lord henceforth uses it towards her, not calling her ‘mother,’ even on the Cross, doubtless for the reason alleged above."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Woman—no term of disrespect in the language of that day." 
2. "In my Father's business I have to do with Him only." 
3. "It was a gentle rebuke for officious interference, entering a region from which all creatures were excluded."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Woman - This term, as used here, seems to imply reproof, as if she was interfering in that which did not properly concern her; but it is evident that no such reproof or disrespect was intended by the use of the term 'woman' instead of 'mother.'" 

2. "What have I to do with thee? - See the notes at Matthew 8:29. This expression is sometimes used to denote indignation or contempt. But it is not probable that it denoted either in this place; if it did, it was a mild reproof of Mary for attempting to control or direct him in his power of working miracles."

3. "Mine hour ... - My time. The proper time for my interposing. Perhaps the wine was not yet entirely exhausted. The wine had begun to fail, but he would not work a miracle until it was entirely gone, that the miracle might be free-from all possibility of suspicion."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Woman. Implying no severity nor disrespect. It was a highly respectful and affectionate mode of address."
2. "Though in a gentle and affectionate manner, Jesus rejects her interference, intending to supply the demand in His own way."
3. "Mine hour is not yet come. In every case the coming of the hour indicates some crisis in the personal life of the Lord, more commonly His passion."

### John Calvin:
1. "Her anxiety about the inconvenience endured by others, and her desire to have it in some way mitigated, proceeded from humanity, and ought to be regarded as a virtue; but still, by putting herself forward, she might obscure the glory of Christ."
2. "This saying of Christ openly and manifestly warns men to beware lest, by too superstitiously elevating the honor of the name of mother in the Virgin Mary, they transfer to her what belongs exclusively to God."
3. "He means that he has not hitherto delayed through carelessness or indolence, but at the same time he states indirectly that he will attend to the matter, when the proper time for it shall arrive."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The use of the Greek word for 'woman' is consistent with the utmost respect."
2. "The relation of mother, however precious in its own sphere, cannot be allowed to enter into that in which Jesus now stands."
3. "The words reprove, though mildly. They do more; in them Jesus warns even His mother against attempting henceforth to prescribe or suggest what He is to do."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "But the use of γυνα instead of μητερ (Mother) does show her she can no longer exercise maternal authority and not at all in his Messianic work."
2. "Literally the phrase means, 'What is it to me and to thee?' In this instance F.C. Burkitt interprets it to mean, 'What is it to us?' That is certainly possible and suits the next clause also."
3. "Here apparently it means the hour for public manifestation of the Messiahship, though a narrower sense would be for Christ's intervention about the failure of the wine."

### John Gill:
1. "Calling her 'woman', as it was no ways contrary to her being a virgin, Galatians 4:4, so it was no mark of disrespect; it being an usual way of speaking with the Jews, when they showed the greatest respect to the person spoken to; and was used by our Lord when he addressed his mother with the greatest tenderness, and strongest affection, John 19:26."
2. "The mother of Jesus is never called a woman in the New Testament, is not said by us Christians: it is certain she is so called, both here, and elsewhere; but then this is no contradiction to her being a virgin; one, and the same person, may be a virgin, and a woman."
3. "Though, as man, and a son of hers, he had been subject to her, in which he had set an example of obedience to parents; yet, as God, he had a Father in heaven, whose business he came to do; and in that, and in his office, as Mediator, she had nothing to do with him; nor was he to be directed by her in that work."

### John Wesley:
1. "He regarded his Father above all, not knowing even his mother after the flesh."
2. "A mild reproof of her inordinate concern and untimely interposal."
3. "May we not learn hence, if his mother was rebuked for attempting to direct him in the days of his flesh, how absurd it is to address her as if she had a right to command him, on the throne of his glory?"
