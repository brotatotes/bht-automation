### Albert Barnes:
1. "It was done by 'them,' so that there might be no opportunity of saying that the disciples of Jesus had filled them with wine to produce the 'appearance' of a miracle."
2. "The quantity was very considerable. The servants would know whether the 'wine' or 'water' had been put in these vessels."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Fill [γεμισατε] - The word used here is significant. It implies not merely to put in, but to fill up, to the full. It is the same word which is used in Mark 4:37, where it is said that the ship was 'filled' with water, or was full. It means that they were to fill it up to the full measure of its capacity." 

2. "Compare Mark 4:37 - The parallel passage in Mark 4:37 shows that this command was given to the disciples when they were in danger of being overwhelmed by the multitude, and when they had no means of providing for them. It was, therefore, a command to trust in God, and to believe that he would provide for them." 

3. "See on Luke 14:23 - The command to 'fill' the house with guests is an expression denoting that they were to invite as many as possible, or to use all proper means to induce them to come. So here, it means that they were to use all proper means to induce the people to come and partake of the blessings of the gospel."

### John Calvin:
1. "The servants might be apt to look upon this injunction as absurd; for they had already more than enough of water."
2. "But in this way the Lord often acts towards us, that his power may be more illustriously displayed by an unexpected result."
3. "When the servants drew wine out of vessels which had been filled with water, no suspicion can remain."

3. "They are able to furnish all that can be supplied for ‘the purifying of the Jews.’" - The filled waterpots represent the abundant grace and cleansing power of Jesus, capable of meeting all the needs of those seeking purification and redemption.

2. "He ordered them to be filled with water by the servants, that they might take notice, and be witnesses, that that, and nothing else, was put into them."
3. "And up to the brims, so that they could not he capable of having any other liquor infused into them."
