# John 20:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the heavenly hosts joyfully and visibly surround the scene. Angels, messengers of God, appear in human form and shining garments, symbolizing their purity and innocence. One angel stands at the head and the other at the feet of the empty tomb, emphasizing the divine guardianship over the body of Jesus. The appearance of angels signifies the divine involvement, the importance of the message being delivered, and a contrast to the shameful crucifixion. The presence of angels and the disposition of the graves in the tomb point to the extraordinary and significant nature of this event.
