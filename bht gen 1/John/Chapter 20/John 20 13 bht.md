# John 20:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, a lone woman named Mary is fearless and determined to find the lost body of her Lord. She is so absorbed in her grief and love for Jesus that supernatural manifestations and the presence of angels do not scare her. Despite her sorrow, she eagerly engages in conversation, seeking comfort and answers from anyone she encounters. Her deep faith and unwavering devotion will eventually lead her to a direct revelation from Jesus himself, reassuring her that there is no reason to weep, for he has risen from the dead.
