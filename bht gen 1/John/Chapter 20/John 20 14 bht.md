# John 20:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Amidst Mary's tears and searching, she turns and gazes upon the presence she feels behind her. Though she did not expect Him to be there, her spiritual fellowship and affinity with Jesus allows her to have an inward, conscious conviction of His identity. In her confusion and bewilderment, Mary's senses conceive of anything but the true Christ, and her eyes are holden from recognizing Him. However, her intuitive awareness and deep spiritual connection unveil the divine presence that stands before her.
