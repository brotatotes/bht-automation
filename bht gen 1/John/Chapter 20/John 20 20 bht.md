Through the visible wounds on his body, the risen Jesus provided tangible evidence of his resurrection, confirming his identity to the disciples and dispelling any doubt of his bodily resurrection. This display not only brought them joy and gladness but also connected his present glorification with his past suffering, emphasizing the depth of his love and sacrifice for humanity. The disciples, initially disbelieving for joy, were transformed by this manifestation and prepared for further revelations of his grace.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

2. "Through the visible wounds on his body, Jesus not only proved his resurrection but also demonstrated the transformative power of his resurrection, bringing peace to all who believe in him."

2. "He showed them that he was the same Being who had suffered; that he had truly risen from the dead, and had come forth with the same body."

### John Calvin:

1. "In whatever respects the glorified body of Jesus differed from what it had been before His death, there was at least enough of resemblance to make identification not only possible but the necessary result of careful observation." 
2. "We shall err, however, if we think that the only object which Jesus had in view in showing His hands and His side was identification. He would also connect His present glorification with His past sufferings."
