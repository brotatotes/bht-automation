# John 20:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse being described emphasizes the mission and authority given by Jesus to his disciples, who are sent as messengers of peace. The disciples' sending forth by Jesus, akin to his own mission from the Father, is a commission to preach the Gospel and imitate Christ's character. This commission holds divine authority and reflects the pattern of Christ's mission into the world to do God's will, preaching the Gospel and working miracles. The disciples are appointed as ordinary ministers, following the example of Jesus as the apostle of the Father and becoming apostles of Christ themselves.
