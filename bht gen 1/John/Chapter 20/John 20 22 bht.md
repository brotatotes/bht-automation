# John 20:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, the disciples receive a symbolic impartation of the Holy Spirit through Jesus breathing on them. This act is reminiscent of the breath of life given to Adam and signifies the Spirit's influence and power over their hearts. It is a foretaste of the abundant outpouring that would take place at Pentecost. Through this action, Jesus grants his disciples new life, vigor, and an inner transformation to prepare them for their important mission as ministers of the Gospel.
