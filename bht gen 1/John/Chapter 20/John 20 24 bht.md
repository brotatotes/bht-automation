# John 20:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Thomas, known as Didymus, was one of the twelve disciples who was absent when Jesus appeared to the others. The name Thomas carries significance, with some commentators suggesting deeper meaning to his character. Thomas' absence served as an opportunity for his slowness of belief to be addressed. Interestingly, Thomas was also referred to as a twin, and his absence when Jesus came showed a lack of faith. It is important to gather with fellow believers and not neglect the assemblies of Christ's disciples.
