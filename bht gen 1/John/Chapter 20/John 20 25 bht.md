# John 20:25 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse described in this commentary is one that deals with doubt and the need for tangible proof of Jesus' resurrection. The commentator remarks on the strength of Thomas' unbelief, stating that even though the other disciples testified to seeing Jesus alive, Thomas still required physical evidence. This doubting nature is attributed to a reluctance to make a mistake in such an important matter. However, the commentator also notes the sinfulness of unbelief, emphasizing that faith cannot always be based on personal understanding and sensory perception alone.
