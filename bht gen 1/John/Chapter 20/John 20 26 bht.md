1. "The mention of 'eight days' is significant as it symbolizes a new beginning. Just as God created the world in six days and rested on the seventh, the eighth day represents a fresh start, a new creation. This is fitting as Jesus' resurrection brings about a new era, a new covenant with God."

The eight-day period serves as a reminder that God's plans unfold in His perfect timing."
