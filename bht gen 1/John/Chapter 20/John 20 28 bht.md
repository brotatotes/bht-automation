## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The Socinian view, that these words, ὁ κύρ . μου κ . ὁ θεός μου, are merely an exclamation, is refuted (1) By the fact that no such exclamations were in use among the Jews."
2. "By the impossibility of referring ὁ κύριός μου to another than Jesus: see John 20:13."
