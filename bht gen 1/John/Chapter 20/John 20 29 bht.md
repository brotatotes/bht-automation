2. "Wonderful indeed and rich in blessing for us who have not seen Him, is this closing word of the Gospel."

### Albert Barnes:

2. "Jesus here approves the faith of Thomas, but more highly commends the faith of those who should believe without having seen."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The doubt of Thomas is not a sign of weakness or lack of faith, but rather a call for deeper understanding and a desire for tangible proof. It is a reminder that faith is not blind acceptance, but an ongoing journey of seeking and questioning."

2. "Jesus' response to Thomas' doubt is not one of condemnation, but of compassion. He invites Thomas to touch his wounds, to experience the reality of his resurrection. This encounter with Jesus transforms Thomas' doubt into a profound declaration of faith: 'My Lord and my God!'"

3. "Thomas serves as a representative of all believers who struggle with doubt. His story reminds us that it is okay to have questions and uncertainties. It is through these doubts that we can deepen our faith and encounter the risen Christ in a more personal and transformative way."

4. "The story of Thomas teaches us that faith is not about having all the answers, but about trusting in the midst of our doubts. It is about seeking a deeper relationship with God and being open to the ways in which he reveals himself to us, even in our moments of uncertainty."

### John Calvin:
1. "Christ blames nothing in Thomas, but that he was so slow to believe, that he needed to be violently drawn to faith by the experience of the senses; which is altogether at variance with the nature of faith."
2. "Faith cannot flow from a merely experimental knowledge of events, but must draw its origin from the word of God."
3. "Faith is not of a right kind, unless it be founded on the word of God, and rise to the invisible kingdom of God, so as to go beyond all human capacity."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The contrast is of a deeper kind, between a faith resting entirely upon outward evidence of Divine claims, and a faith rising higher and resting upon that intuitive perception of the Divine in Jesus which is afforded by the consideration of what He is in Himself as the Crucified and Risen Lord."
2. "Thus to us, who are separated by many centuries from the time when the Lord was personally present in the world, is the blessed assurance given that, though we have not seen Him, we may love Him; and that, though now we see Him not, we may rejoice in Him with a joy unspeakable and glorified."
3. "The more we penetrate through the outward to the inward, through the flesh to the spirit, through communion with the earthly to communion with the heavenly Lord, the more do we learn to know the fulness that is in Him, in whom ‘dwelled all the fulness of the Godhead bodily,’ and in whom we are ‘complete’."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "It was sight, not touch that convinced Thomas."
2. "Thomas made a noble confession, but he missed the highest form of faith without the evidence of the senses."
3. "Peter (1 Peter 1:8) uses language that seems like a reminiscence of the words of Jesus to Thomas which Peter heard."

### John Gill:
1. "Because thou hast seen me, thou hast believed; which carries in it a tacit and gentle reproof for his unbelief, and suggests, that if he had not seen, he would not have believed."
2. "Christ here allows that Thomas had believed, that he was risen from the dead, and that he was his Lord and God; and though his faith was late and slow, it was sure and certain, and was appropriating."
3. "From hence may be observed, that Christ allows of the epithets and titles given him by Thomas, and therefore must be Lord and God; and approves of Thomas's faith, and therefore that must be right; though he prefers faith without personal sight of him to it."
