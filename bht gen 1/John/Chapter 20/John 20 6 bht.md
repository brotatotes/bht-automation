# John 20:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, we witness Peter's careful observation of the linen clothes and folded napkin in the empty tomb. The placement of the napkin, not haphazardly thrown aside, but deliberately folded, speaks to the composed manner in which Jesus' resurrection took place. As two witnesses, Peter and John's accounts confirm the absence of the body and the significance of the remaining linen. The attention to detail exhibited by the angels in folding the napkin and clothes reflects their reverence and divine care for Jesus, emphasizing the divine nature of His resurrection.
