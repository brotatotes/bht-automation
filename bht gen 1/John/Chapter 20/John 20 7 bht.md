# John 20:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, it is evident that there was an orderly arrangement in the tomb, indicating a calm and deliberate rising from the dead. The mention of the napkin wrapped around the head disproves the false idea of the body being sewn up in one garment, as it was a separate piece. The napkin, often used to wipe off sweat, and the rolled-up nature of it signify the careful attention to detail. This orderly display unveils that the body was not hurriedly taken or stolen, adding to the overall decorum of the scene.
