# John 21:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
After Jesus’ resurrection, He appeared to His disciples multiple times. Although the usual state of the Lord was invisibility to them, He manifested Himself occasionally, unexpectedly, and in a way quite unearthly. In one specific appearance, Jesus exhibited Himself in a glory that the natural eye could not have discerned. These manifestations took place in various locations, including the shore of the Sea of Galilee, also known as the Sea of Tiberias. The purpose of these appearances was to disclose His character and work, impressing upon the disciples the truth of His resurrection.
