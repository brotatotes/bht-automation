# John 21:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, a careful counting takes place after a miraculous event, symbolizing the vast success of a forthcoming ministry. The multitude and size of the fishes caught foreshadow the abundance of disciples who will be gathered, with the net remaining intact. The significance of this event lies in the contrast between a ministry of trial and one of triumph, and it serves as an emblem of the power of God and the permanence and usefulness of the Gospel in gathering all of God's elect safely to Christ and heaven.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "This enumeration is singular, and not to be accounted for by any mystical significance of the number, but as betokening the careful counting which took place after the event, and in which the narrator took a part."
2. "The careful counting which took place after the event."
3. "Herein differing from what happened Luke 5:6, when it was broken."

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "The multitude and the size of the fishes they caught symbolically foreshadowed the vast success of their now fast approaching ministry, and this only as a beginning of successive draughts, through the agency of a Christian ministry, till, 'as the waters cover the sea, the earth should be full of the knowledge of the Lord.'"

2. "And whereas, at the first miraculous draught, the net 'was breaking' through the weight of what it contained—expressive of the difficulty with which, after they had 'caught men,' they would be able to retain, or keep them from escaping back into the world—while here, 'for all they were so many, yet was not the net broken,' are we not reminded of such sayings as these: 'I give unto My sheep eternal life, and they shall never perish, neither shall any pluck them out of My hand' [LUTHARDT]?"

3. "But it is not through the agency of a Christian ministry that all true disciples are gathered. Jesus Himself, by unseen methods, gathers some, who afterwards are recognized by the constituted fishers of men, and mingle with the fruit of their labors. And are not these symbolized by that portion of our Galilean repast which the fishers found, in some unseen way, made ready to their hand?"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The number is mentioned because it seems to have been a very unusual draught."
2. "It was particularly gratifying and striking to them after they had spent the whole night and had caught nothing."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "All authorities agree as to the abundance of fish in the Lake of Galilee."
2. "The fame of the lake in this particular reached back to very early times."
3. "The Talmud names certain kinds of fish which might be eaten without being cooked, and designates them as small fishes."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The fishes drawn to shore by means of the net were ‘great:’ yet neither by their sire nor by their number was the net rent. No fish was lost."
2. "The comparison of this miracle with that of the draught of fishes in Luke 5:4-7 supplies various points of contrast, at once bringing out and confirming what we have yet to speak of as the inner meaning of the section before us."
3. "The contrasts all point to the difference between a ministry of trial with a suffering Lord, and a ministry of triumph with a glorified Lord."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Peter now did what they had failed to do."
2. "The addition 'three' to the 'hundred and fifty' looks as if they were actually counted these 'large' fish."
3. "It was a great fish story that John recalls vividly."

### John Gill:
1. "An emblem of the whole number of God's elect being brought safe to shore, to Christ, and to heaven, through various tribulations and afflictions in the world, fitly signified by the waves of the sea."
2. "It may design a collection, out of all sorts of people, to Christ, and his church."
3. "An emblem of the power of God attending the Gospel to the regeneration, conversion, and salvation of his people, and of the great usefulness of it, however mean and despicable it may be in the eyes of men, and of its permanence and duration, until all the elect of God are gathered in by it."
