# John 21:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, Jesus appears to His disciples after His resurrection. The purpose of this appearance is to confirm and encourage Peter in his apostolic role. Jesus asks Peter if he loves Him more than the others, referring to Peter's previous boast of loyalty. This question serves as a gentle rebuke for Peter's earlier denial of Jesus. It also serves to restore Peter's confidence, reassuring him of his calling and reinstating him as a shepherd of the Church.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Surely every word would have been recorded. One great object of this appearance, observes Stier, certainly was the confirmation, and encouragement of the 'fisher of men,' in his apostolic office."
2. "Peter’s answer shows that he understood the question as above. He says nothing of the πλέον τούτων but dropping all comparison of himself with others, humbly refers to the Searcher of hearts the genuineness of his love, however the past may seem to have called it in question."
3. "Perhaps the feeding of the lambs was the furnishing the apostolic testimony of the Resurrection and facts of the Lord’s life on earth to the first converts; the shepherding or ruling the sheep, the subsequent government of the Church as shown forth in the early part of the Acts; the feeding of the προβάτια, the choicest, the loved of the flock, the furnishing the now maturer Church of Christ with the wholesome food of the doctrine contained in his Epistles."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Silence appears to have reigned during the meal; unbroken on His part, that by their mute observation of Him they might have their assurance of His identity the more confirmed."
2. "Referring lovingly to those sad words of Peter, shortly before denying his Lord... intending by this allusion to bring the whole scene vividly before his mind and put him to shame."
3. "He adds not, 'more than these,' but prefixes a touching appeal to the Saviour's own omniscience for the truth of his protestation, which makes it a totally different kind of speech from his former."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Lovest thou me more than these? Art thou now willing, from love to me, to forsake all these, and go and preach my gospel to the nations of the earth?"
2. "Jesus here slightly reproves him for that confident assertion, reminds him of his sad and painful denial, and now puts this direct and pointed question to him to know what was the present state of his feelings."
3. "The happiest and best state of feeling is when we can with humility, yet with confidence, look to the Lord Jesus and say, 'Thou knowest that I love thee.'"
4. "By the use of both these words, it is supposed that our Saviour intended that a shepherd was both to offer the proper food for his flock and to govern it; or, as we express it, to exercise the office of a pastor."
5. "The Lord Jesus saw, what has been confirmed in the experience of the church, that the success of the gospel among men depended on the care which the ministry would extend to those in early life."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "He never addresses him by the name of Peter, while that name is commonly used, either alone or with Simon, in the narrative of the Gospels." 
2. "Jesus uses the more dignified, really the nobler, but, as it seems to Peter, in the ardor of his affection, the colder word for love." 
3. "The question conveys a gentle rebuke for his former extravagant professions."

### John Calvin:
1. "Such a restoration was necessary, both for Peter and for his hearers; for Peter, that he might the more boldly execute his office, being assured of the calling with which Christ had again invested him; for his hearers, that the stain which attached to his person might not be the occasion of despising the Gospel."
2. "No man, therefore, will steadily persevere in the discharge of this office, unless the love of Christ shall reign in his heart, in such a manner that, forgetful of himself and devoting himself entirely to Christ, he overcomes every obstacle."
3. "All believers ought to draw from it no ordinary consolation, when they are taught that they are so dear and so precious in the sight of the Son of God, that he substitutes them, as it were, in his own room."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The words ‘more than these’ in our Lord’s question can hardly spring from any thing else than the remembrance of the apostle’s hasty assertion before his denial of his Master, ‘Though all men shall be offended because of Thee, yet will I never be offended.’"
2. "They were thus especially designed to expose to Peter’s view the pride and self-sufficiency by which his fall had been hastened; and that they effected this object we may infer from the absence of these words in his reply."
3. "Not only so; it is to be further noticed that the apostle does not use the same word for ‘love’ as had been employed by Jesus. He uses one that speaks of a more familiar and friendly affection, implying less depth of serious thought."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Peter had even boasted that he would stand by Christ though all men forsook him."
2. "Christ probes the inmost recesses of Peter's heart to secure the humility necessary for service."
3. "Peter makes no claim here to superior love and passes by the 'more than these' and does not even use Christ's word αγαπαω for high and devoted love, but the humbler word φιλεω for love as a friend."
