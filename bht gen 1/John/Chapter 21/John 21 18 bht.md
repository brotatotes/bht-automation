# John 21:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, an unnamed individual is addressed with solemnity and importance.

However, as they enter old age, they will face challenges and limitations that they did not expect.

This person's journey is marked by sacrifice, as they must go against their natural inclination to fulfill a greater purpose.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The end of his pastoral office is announced to him: a proof of the πάντα οἶδας which he had just confessed."
2. "thou girdedst thyself up for My work, and wentest hither and thither but hereafter there shall be a service for thee."
3. "in a more painful manner, on the transverse beam of the cross; and another the executioner shall gird thee, with the cords binding to the cross."

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "When thou wast young—embracing the whole period of life to the verge of old age." This quote highlights the significance of the phrase "when thou wast young" and explains that it refers to the entirety of one's life until old age. 

2. "Thou girdedst thyself, and walkedst whither thou wouldest—wast thine own master." This quote emphasizes the freedom and independence that Peter had in his youth, symbolized by the act of girding oneself and walking wherever one desired.

3. "When . . . old thou shalt stretch forth thine hands—to be bound for execution, though not necessarily meaning on a cross." This quote clarifies that the stretching forth of hands in old age signifies being bound for execution, but it does not necessarily imply crucifixion. It provides context to the verse and dispels any assumptions about the specific manner of Peter's death.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Thou girdedst - The expression here denotes freedom. He did as he pleased - he girded himself or not he went or remained, as he chose." 
2. "Thou shalt stretch forth thy hands - When Peter was put to death, we are told that he requested that he might be crucified with his head downward, saying that he who had denied his Lord as he had done was not worthy to die as he did."
3. "Another shall gird thee - Another shall bind thee. The limbs of persons crucified were often bound instead of being nailed, and even the body was sometimes girded to the cross."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Thou girdedst thyself... The imperfect tense signifies something habitual." 
2. "Walkedst... Peculiarly appropriate to describe the free activity of vigorous manhood." 
3. "Stretch forth thy hands... It is merely an expression for the helplessness of age."

### John Calvin:
1. "Christ intended to forewarn him of his death, that he might at all times ponder the thought, that the doctrine of which he was a minister must be at length ratified by his own blood."
2. "Old age appears to be set apart for tranquillity and repose... Peter might, therefore, have promised to himself at that age a peaceful life. Christ declares, on the other hand, that the order of nature will be inverted."
3. "The meaning is, that Peter did not die a natural death, but by violence and by the sword... But this must be understood as referring to the contest between the flesh and the Spirit, which believers feel within themselves."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The words, ‘verily, verily,’ with which the verse begins, mark, as always, the importance and solemnity of the declaration made, and thus prepare us to think that we have more in them than a simple announcement of the death which the apostle was to die."
2. "The allusion to the time when Peter girded himself and walked whither he would, becomes the expression of that self-will by which, before his present entire consecration to the service of Jesus, he had been marked."
3. "He will be so truly a partaker of the sufferings of Christ as to find in this fellowship with his dying Lord the very ground and beginning of his apostolic activity."

### Archibald T Robertson:

2. "So as to walkedst" - The use of the imperfect tense here emphasizes the continuous and ongoing nature of the person's actions. It implies that they consistently walked in a certain manner or direction.

3. "When thou shalt be old" - This phrase highlights the inevitability of aging and serves as a reminder that the person being addressed will face the challenges and limitations that come with old age. It emphasizes the need for preparation and readiness for the future.

### John Gill:
1. "Verily, verily, I say unto thee,.... A way of speaking often used by Christ, when about to deliver anything of considerable moment, partly to raise the attention, and partly for the more strong asseveration of what is spoken."
2. "thou girdest thyself, and walkest whither thou wouldst; that is, he could put on his clothes himself, and gird them about him with a girdle, as was the custom of the eastern nations, who usually wore long garments; and as he, a little before, had girt his fisher's coat about him, and walked where he pleased; denoting the liberty of his will in things natural and civil."
3. "thou shalt stretch forth thy hands, and another shall gird thee... either to the stretching out of his hands upon the cross, when he should be girt and bound to that; for persons were sometimes fastened to the cross with cords, and not always with nails."

### John Wesley:
1. "When thou art old" - This phrase indicates that the fulfillment of Peter's calling would extend into his old age, emphasizing the longevity and endurance required for his mission.

2. "Another shall gird thee" - This imagery highlights the loss of personal control and the submission to a higher authority that Peter would experience in his journey. It symbolizes the surrender of his own will to the will of God.
