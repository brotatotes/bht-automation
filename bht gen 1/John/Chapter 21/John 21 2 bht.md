# John 21:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we find a group of disciples eagerly waiting for the promise of the Holy Spirit. One commentator notes that the mention of Thomas being completely united with the other Apostles is significant, highlighting his growth in faith. Nathanael, who had previously doubted, now confesses Jesus as the Son of God and King of Israel, marking a turning point in his journey of faith. These disciples, including Peter, Thomas, and Nathanael, remain committed to their belief in Jesus and await his next encounter with them.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The junction of ἀπό with a proper name is in John’s style."
2. "The οἱ τοῦ Ζεβ may however be here mentioned as in reminiscence of the draught of fishes which occurred before."
3. "Who these were does not appear. Probably (as Luthardt) some two not named in the Gospel, and therefore not specified in its appendix."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Nathanael's skepticism and doubt are relatable, as many of us may have questioned the validity of our faith at some point. However, Jesus' response to Nathanael's doubt is a powerful reminder that God sees and knows us intimately, even before we come to believe in Him."

2. "Jesus' ability to see Nathanael under the fig tree before their encounter reveals His divine knowledge and omniscience. This demonstrates that Jesus is not just a mere man, but the Son of God who has the power to know and understand the depths of our hearts."

3. "Nathanael's confession of Jesus as the Son of God and the King of Israel is a significant turning point in his journey of faith. It shows that despite his initial doubts, Nathanael recognizes Jesus' true identity and submits to His authority."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "While they were waiting for the promise of the Holy Spirit, they still found it proper to be usefully employed."
2. "In the interval - before the promised Spirit was poured upon them - they chose not to be idle, and therefore returned to their former employment."
3. "Ministers of the gospel should be willing to labor, if necessary, for their own support, and should not esteem such labor dishonorable."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "There may be significance in the mention of Thomas as now (after chap. 20) completely at one with his brother Apostles." 

2. "Nathanael (comp. chap. John 1:51) is associated with the miracle." 

3. "It is doubtful whether the seven persons here referred to are arranged, as is often supposed, in two groups, one consisting of three, and the other of four members."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "These seven (Peter, Thomas, Nathanael, the sons of Zebedee, and two others)." 
2. "We know that the sons of Zebedee were James and John (Matthew 4:21), mentioned by name nowhere in John's Gospel, apparently because John is the author."
3. "It seems to me to be crass criticism in spite of Harnack and Bernard to identify the incident here with that in Luke 5:1-11."

### John Gill:
1. "Simon Peter, who though he had denied his Lord, dearly loved him, and truly believed in him, kept with the rest of his disciples, and was waiting for another interview with him."
2. "Thomas, called Didymus; who, though for a while an unbeliever with respect to the resurrection of Christ, was now fully assured of it, and, for the future, was unwilling to lose any opportunity of meeting with his risen Lord."
3. "Nathanael of Cana in Galilee; an Israelite indeed, in whom there was no guile. Dr. Lightfoot thinks he is the same with Bartholomew, and so one of the eleven."
