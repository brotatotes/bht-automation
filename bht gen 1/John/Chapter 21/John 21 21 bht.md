### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Peter's question reveals a natural curiosity about the fate of his fellow disciple. It is a common tendency to compare ourselves to others and wonder about their destiny.

2. "Jesus' response to Peter's question is a gentle rebuke, reminding him that each person has their own unique journey and relationship with God. It is not for us to judge or compare, but to faithfully follow our own calling and trust in God's plan for our lives."

3. "This exchange between Peter and Jesus serves as a reminder for all believers. Instead of being preoccupied with the fate of others, we should focus on our own walk with God. Our responsibility is to love and serve Him, leaving the judgment and outcome of others in His hands."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "What shall this man do?" - This question probably means, "What death shall he die?" But it is impossible to ascertain certainly why Peter asked this question.
2. Peter was grieved at the question of Jesus; he was probably deeply affected with the account of his own approaching sufferings; and, with perhaps a mixture of grief and envy, he asked what would be his lot.
3. Whatever the motive was, it was a curiosity which the Lord Jesus did not choose to gratify.
