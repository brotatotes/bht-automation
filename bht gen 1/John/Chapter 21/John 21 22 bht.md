# John 21:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, we are reminded of the distinctness of each person's position and duty before the Lord. It is emphasized that our main responsibility is to follow the Lord Jesus Christ and not be unduly concerned or curious about the fate of others. While Christ's response may not be clear or what we desire, it serves as a rebuke to remind us to focus on our own duty in following Him. Ultimately, we are to look to our neighbors, drawing them along with us to Christ, and not allow the offenses of others to hinder our own progress.
