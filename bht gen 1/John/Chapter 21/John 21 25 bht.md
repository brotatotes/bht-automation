## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The purpose of this verse seems to be to assert and vindicate the fragmentary character of the Gospel, considered merely as a historical narrative."
2. "In every part of it, his hand is plain and unmistakeable: in every part of it, his character and spirit is manifested in a way which none but the most biassed can fail to recognize."
3. "On the whole, I am persuaded that in this chapter we have a fragment, both authentic and genuine, added, for reasons apparent on the face of it, by the Apostle himself."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "And there are many other things which Jesus did" - This phrase emphasizes that the recorded actions of Jesus are just a fraction of all that he did during his time on earth. It suggests that there is much more to Jesus' life and ministry that is not included in the written accounts.

2. "Even the world itself would not hold the books" - This statement conveys the vastness and richness of Jesus' life and teachings. It implies that if every detail of Jesus' actions were to be written down, it would require an impossibly large number of books to contain them all.

3. "In the limitation of these matchless histories, in point of number, there is as much of that divine wisdom" - This phrase highlights the divine wisdom behind the selection and inclusion of the recorded events in the Gospels. It suggests that the chosen accounts, though limited in number, contain a profound depth of divine wisdom and purpose.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The figure of speech called a hyperbole...convey[s] no falsehood. The statement is to be taken as it would be understood among the persons to whom it is addressed; and as no one supposes that the author means to be understood literally, so there is no deception in the case, and consequently no impeachment of his veracity or inspiration."
2. "This gospel contains in itself the clearest proof of inspiration...It contains the purest and most elevated views of God to be found anywhere, as far exceeding all the speculations of philosophers as the sun does the blaze of a taper."
3. "If John has preserved the record of what has occurred so many years before, then it shows that he was under the divine guidance, and is himself a proof, a full and standing proof, of the fulfillment of the promise which he has recorded that the Holy Spirit would guide the apostles into all truth."

### John Calvin:
1. "He does not speak of Christ’s actions of every kind, but of those which relate to his public office; nor ought we to think that the hyperbole is absurd, when we bear with many figures of speech of the same kind in heathen authors."
2. "The majesty of Christ, which by its infinity swallowed up, if I may so speak, not only the senses of men, but heaven and earth, gave a miraculous display of its own splendor in those works."
3. "Yet we ought to remember what we formerly stated, that the summary which the Evangelists have committed to writing, is sufficient both for regulating faith and for obtaining salvation."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "They seem to contain the Evangelist’s own explanation of that principle of selection which he has followed throughout his work."
2. "But is it not at once more reverent and more true to say that the language here used expresses the infinitude which the apostle beheld in the life of Jesus, the fathomless depths which he knew his Lord’s every work and every word to contain?"
3. "What apostle or disciple of Jesus, known to us as belonging to the first age of the Christian Church, could have so spoken but that apostle whom Jesus loved?"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "If they should be written one by one" - This phrase emphasizes the immense amount of detail and information contained in the words and works of Jesus.
2. "Would not contain the whole world" - This hyperbolic statement highlights the vastness and magnitude of Jesus' teachings and actions.
3. "The greatest of all the books produced by man" - This comment underscores the significance and importance of the Gospel of John, elevating it above all other human-authored books.

### John Gill:
1. "The Holy Ghost has not thought fit to lay such a burden on men they could not bear, as to read such numbers of volumes; but has reduced them into a brief compendium, which may be read with ease, delight, and pleasure."
2. "The intention of this expression, supposing it hyperbolical, is to show that but a few of the wonderful things done by Christ were recorded by the evangelist, in comparison of the many which he every day did."
3. "These that were written are sufficient to prove him to be the true Messiah, and to require faith in him as such."

### John Wesley:
1. "If they were to be written particularly — Every fact, and all the circumstances of it." This quote highlights the meticulous attention to detail that the author suggests would be required to fully capture the events being described in the verse.

2. "I suppose — This expression, which softens the hyperbole, shows that St. John wrote this verse." This quote suggests that the use of the word "suppose" indicates that the author of the verse is likely St. John, providing insight into the possible authorship of the text.

3. "This expression, which softens the hyperbole." This quote draws attention to the presence of hyperbole in the verse, indicating that the author may have used exaggerated language to emphasize the significance of the events being described.
