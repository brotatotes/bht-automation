# John 21:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this passage, the disciples, feeling unsure of their purpose after Jesus' resurrection, decide to go fishing. Their lack of success during the night symbolizes their current state of uncertainty and highlights the need for divine intervention. Although their efforts seem fruitless, this experience serves to prepare them for the miraculous catch that follows. God often allows His servants to face challenges and disappointments to remind them of their dependence on His guidance and demonstrate His power.
