# John 21:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The passage in question addresses a group of individuals, referred to as "children," illustrating a close and affectionate relationship. The word "meat" is not inquiring about catching fish, but rather refers to the provision of food. Fish was a common addition to bread and held cultural significance. The use of this term evokes tenderness and care, as Jesus offers himself as the sustenance for believers, welcoming them and blessing them with his provisions.

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Children—This term would not necessarily identify Him, being not unusual from any superior; but when they did recognize Him, they would feel it sweetly like Himself."
2. "Have ye any meat?—provisions, supplies, meaning fish."
3. "They answered... No—This was in His wonted style, making them tell their case, and so the better prepare them for what was coming."

2. "The interrogative mh ti indicates that a negative answer is expected: you have not, I suppose, anything."

1. "It is hardly possible to imagine that the word ‘children’ is here used because Jesus is addressing Himself as ‘a master to his workmen,’ or because He is speaking with the dignity of a superior. It is a word of tenderness and affection."
2. "There is at least a striking coincidence between the word (‘children’) here used and that used in Hebrews 2:13 (Isaiah 8:18). He who speaks is engaged in the same occupation, takes the same position, is called to the same work as they."
3. "The question which He asks is important, especially the word which is rendered in the Authorised Version ‘meat,’ but which we have rendered by ‘to eat.’ For thus we observe the true point of the question, not, ‘Have you caught fish?’ but, ‘Have you fish to eat?’"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
