# John 21:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When the disciples saw Jesus on the shore, there was a sense of recognition as they scrutinized His person and remembered previous encounters. Peter, eager and zealous, quickly girded on his fisher's coat before casting himself into the sea to reach Jesus. This act of tying on the garment symbolized reverence and preparation for service. Just as Jesus had girded Himself for service, Peter, in his love for the Lord, was willing to go through any obstacle, even water, to be near Him.

### Henry Alford:
1. "The οὖν here seems distinctly to allude to the former occasion the similarity of the incident having led the beloved Apostle to scrutinize more closely the person of Him who spoke to them."

3. "Peter is actuated by a peculiar zeal in comparison to the others.
