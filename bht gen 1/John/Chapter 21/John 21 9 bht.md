## Choicest Commentary Quotes:

2. "Let any child reading the chapter be the judge."
3. "And what difficulty is there in such a fire and fish being provided either by the Lord Himself, or by the ministry of angels at His bidding?"

2. "The fire of coals, fish, and bread symbolize the miraculous provision of Jesus."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "We have no knowledge whence this was produced" - The commentary acknowledges the lack of information about the origin of the fire, leaving room for speculation and interpretation.

2. "As no miracle is mentioned, however, there is no reason for supposing that any existed in the case" - The commentary highlights the absence of explicit mention of a miracle, suggesting that the fire could have been a natural occurrence rather than a supernatural event.

3. "Whether it was a place occupied by other fishermen, where they also might cook the fish which they had caught" - The commentary presents an alternative explanation, suggesting that the fire could have been in a location where other fishermen were cooking their catch, indicating a possible practical reason for its presence.

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "They got out upon the land." - This clarifies that the phrase "they were come to land" refers to the boatmen going ashore, not the arrival of the boat itself.
2. "A fire of coals." - This suggests that the fire mentioned in the verse was made of charcoal, as seen in John 18:18. This detail adds depth to the scene.
3. "Bread, or a loaf." - This highlights that the word used for bread in the verse can also be translated as a loaf, providing a more specific understanding of the food being mentioned.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "No intimation is given where the fire of charcoal had been obtained, or how it had been brought there. The thoughts of the Evangelist are so entirely occupied with the meal, that it is a matter of no consequence to him to give explanations upon such points."
2. "Upon one fact he desires us to fix our attention - the meal is provided by Jesus, whether miraculously or in some ordinary way he does not ask."
3. "It is impossible not to notice the words 'a fish' and 'a loaf,' not 'fish' and 'bread:' the contrast with 'the fishes' of John 21:10 is obviously designed."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "They see (βλεπουσιν). Vivid historical present."
2. "A fire of coals (ανθρακιαν). See John 18:18 for this word. Cf. our 'anthracite.'"
3. "Fish (οψαριον). As in John 6:9; John 6:11, like προσφαγιον above."

### John Gill:
1. "They saw a fire of coals there: on the shore, to their great surprise." This detail highlights the unexpected provision and preparation of Jesus, emphasizing his divine power and care for his disciples.

2. "Fish laid there; which could not be any that they had taken." This statement emphasizes that the fish Jesus provided was not caught by the disciples, further emphasizing the miraculous nature of the provision.

3. "A representation of that spiritual and eternal refreshment they shall have with him in heaven." This phrase points to the deeper symbolism of the meal, illustrating the future eternal fellowship and nourishment that believers will experience with Jesus in heaven.
