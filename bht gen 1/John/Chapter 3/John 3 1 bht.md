# John 3:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, we encounter a man named Nicodemus, a ruler among the Jews and a member of the Sanhedrin, the great council of the nation. Though belonging to the strict sect of the Pharisees, Nicodemus displayed sincerity, timidity, and a desire for personal understanding of Jesus, even coming to Him at night. Despite his wealth and position, Nicodemus stood out from his contemporaries, exemplifying Christ's knowledge of men and the need for a newness of heart to become true disciples.
