## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "I believe the E. V. is right in rendering ὁ διδ . a master; the article is inserted as required by τοῦ before Ἰσραήλ, which is expressed as giving a solemnity to Ἰσρ. as the people of God."
2. "Or is it possible that ὁ διδάσκαλος may merely be meant as one of οἱ διδάσκαλοι?"
3. "Still less can I with Bp. Middleton, Gr. Art. pp. 242 3, believe any blame conveyed in the title."

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "The question clearly implies that the doctrine of regeneration is so far disclosed in the Old Testament that Nicodemus was culpable in being ignorant of it."
2. "Nor is it merely as something that should be experienced under the Gospel that the Old Testament holds it forth—as many distinguished critics allege, denying that there was any such thing as regeneration before Christ."
3. "For our Lord's proposition is universal, that no fallen man is or can be spiritual without a regenerating operation of the Holy Ghost, and the necessity of a spiritual obedience under whatever name, in opposition to mere mechanical services, is proclaimed throughout all the Old Testament."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It may seem surprising that a man whose business it was to teach the people should be a stranger to so plain and important a doctrine."
2. "When worldly-minded men are placed in offices of religion when they seek those offices for the sake of ease or reputation, it is no wonder that they are strangers to the plain truths of the Bible."
3. "No man can understand the Bible fully unless he is a humble Christian, and the easiest way to comprehend the truths of religion is to give the heart to God and live to his glory."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "A master is more correctly rendered by Rev., the teacher."
2. "The article marks Nicodemus' official relation to the people, and gives additional force to the contrast in the following words."
3. "Nicodemus is not reproved for the want of previous knowledge, but for the want of perception or understanding when these truths are expounded to him."

### John Calvin:
1. "Such hesitation, certainly, is base and shameful. For what religion have we, what knowledge of God, what rule of living well, what hope of eternal life, if we do not believe that man is renewed by the Spirit of God?"
2. "There is an emphasis, therefore, in the word these; for since Scripture frequently repeats this part of doctrine, it ought not to be unknown even to the lowest class of beginners."
3. "It is utterly beyond endurance that any man should be ignorant and unskilled in it, who professes to be a teacher in the Church of God."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "He has assumed the office of teacher, teacher of God’s people Israel, and yet he does not recognise these truths." 
2. "No word so clearly brings into view the nation of God’s special choice." 
3. "Nicodemus is not blamed for any want of previous knowledge of these things, but because he does not perceive the truth of the teaching when presented to him."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "The well-known or the authorized (the accepted) teacher of the Israel of God."
2. "His Pharisaic theology had made him almost proof against spiritual apprehension."
3. "It was outside of his groove (rote, rut, rot, the three terrible r's of mere traditionalism)."

### John Gill:
1. "Upbraiding him with his continued and invincible ignorance, which was aggravated by his dignified character."
2. "He was not a common teacher, not a teacher of babes, nor a teacher in their synagogues, but in their great sanhedrim."
3. "Yet was he ignorant of the first and most important things in religion."
