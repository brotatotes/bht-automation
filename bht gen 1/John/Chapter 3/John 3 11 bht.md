### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "We speak that we know, and . . . have seen—that is, by absolute knowledge and immediate vision of God." 

2. "The 'we' and 'our' are here used, though Himself only is intended, in emphatic contrast, probably, with the opening words of Nicodemus, 'Rabbi, we know.'"

3. "Ye receive not, &c.—referring to the class to which Nicodemus belonged, but from which he was beginning to be separated in spirit."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "We do not deliver doctrines which we do not practically understand."
2. "Every successful minister of the gospel thus becomes a witness of the saving power of the gospel."
3. "Men reject revelation though it is attested by the strongest evidence, and though it is constantly producing the most desirable changes in the hearts and lives of men."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The new birth imparts a new vision."
2. "The man who is born of the Spirit hath eternal life."
3. "Jesus meets the 'we know' of Nicodemus, referring to the class to which he belonged, with another 'we know,' referring to another class, of which He was the head and representative."

### John Calvin:
1. "Christ claims it as peculiar to himself and all the servants of God, that they deliver no doctrine but what is certain."
2. "Let every man, therefore, see what the Lord has revealed to him, that no man may go beyond the bounds of his faith."
3. "Though you do not receive my doctrine, it remains nevertheless certain and durable; for the unbelief of men will never prevent God from remaining always true."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The connecting link between John 3:10-11 is reproof. The last verse laid stress on the knowledge which should have prepared the teacher of Israel for the reception of the word of Jesus; in this the emphasis lies on the dignity of the Teacher whose word he had been so slow to receive."
2. "Every one who dwells in the spiritual world of which Jesus has been speaking is a witness to its reality and its wonders."
3. "The words closely correspond (knowing to speaking; seeing to bearing witness), while there is at the same time an advance in the thought, since bearing witness rises above speaking, and we have seen is more expressive than we know."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Jesus simply claims knowledge of what he has tried to make plain to the famous Rabbi without success."
2. "He is bearing witness from personal knowledge, strange as this may seem to Nicodemus."
3. "This is the tragedy of the matter... Jesus probably associates here with himself ('we') those who have personal experience of grace and so are qualified as witnesses."

### John Gill:
1. "We speak that we do know... the Gospel dispensation, he declared was just at hand."
2. "Christ must needs thoroughly, and certainly know what he spoke... since he was not only the omniscient God, but... had all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge in him."
3. "Seeing and knowing are qualifications in a witness... though these were eminently in Christ, the generality of the Jews gave no credit to his testimony."

### John Wesley:
1. "This statement emphasizes the intimate connection between Jesus and his followers. It implies that those who truly believe in him will share in his knowledge and understanding."
2. "By saying 'we speak what we know,' Jesus is asserting that his teachings are not based on mere speculation or hearsay. He is speaking from a place of authority and personal experience."
3. "This verse also highlights the importance of faith in Jesus as the key to receiving this knowledge. It is through belief and trust in him that his followers can access the deeper truths he imparts."
