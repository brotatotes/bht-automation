## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The comparison lies between the exalted serpent of brass, and the exalted Son of Man. The brazen serpent sets forth the Redeemer."
2. "The 'serpent' is in Scripture symbolism, the devil, from the historical temptation in Genesis 3:0. downwards."
3. "Now was not the Lord Jesus made ἐν ὁμοιώματι σαρκὸς ἁμαρτίας, Rom 8:3? Was not He made 'Sin for us, who knew no sin' (2Co 5:21)? Did not He, on His Cross, make an open shew of, and triumph over, the Enemy, so that it was as if the Enemy himself had been nailed to that Cross (Col 2:15)?"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "In both cases the remedy was divinely provided. In both the way of cure strikingly resembled that of the disease."
2. "But as the uplifted serpent had none of the venom of which the serpent-bitten people were dying, so while the whole human family were perishing of the deadly wound inflicted on it by the old serpent, 'the Second Man,' who arose over humanity with healing in His wings, was without spot or wrinkle, or any such thing."
3. "Both methods are stumbling to human reason. What, to any thinking Israelite, could seem more unlikely than that a deadly poison should be dried up in his body by simply looking on a reptile of brass? Such a stumbling-block to the Jews and to the Greeks foolishness was faith in the crucified Nazarene as a way of deliverance from eternal perdition."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Men are sinners. There is no cure by human means for the maladies of the soul; and as the people who were bitten might look on the image of the serpent and be healed, so may sinners look to the Saviour and be cured of the moral maladies of our nature."
2. "Lifted up - Erected on a pole. Placed on high, So that it might be seen by the people."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Jesus draws a vivid parallel between the act of Moses and the Cross on which he himself 'must' be lifted up." 

2. "In John, 'υψοω' always refers to the Cross, though to the Ascension in Acts." 

3. "Jesus is complimenting the standing and intelligence of Nicodemus as 'the teacher of Israel' by telling him this great truth and fact that lies at the basis of the work of the kingdom of God."

### John Gill:
1. "There is, in many things, an agreement between this serpent, and Jesus Christ: as in the matter of it, it was a brazen serpent; it was made not of gold, nor of silver, but of brass, the meaner metal, and was a very unlikely means, of itself, to heal the Israelites; and might be despised by many: this may denote the meanness of Christ in his human nature, in his birth and parentage, and place of education and converse; and especially in his crucifixion and death; and which, to an eye of carnal sense and reason, seemed a very improbable means of saving sinners; and therefore were to some a stumbling block, and to others foolishness."
2. "The brazen serpent had the form of a serpent, but not the poison and venomous nature of one; so Christ was sent, in the likeness of sinful flesh, and was found in fashion as a man, as a sinful man, but was without sin, and was perfectly holy; and yet being in this form, was made both sin and a curse, that he might redeem his people both from sin, and from the curse of the law, by dying a death which denominated him accursed, of which the serpent was, an emblem."
3. "And whereas brass is both a strong and durable metal, it may signify the strength of Christ, who is the mighty God, and mighty to save; and his duration, as a Saviour, being the same today, yesterday, and for ever."

### John Wesley:
1. "And even this single witness will soon be taken from you" - The commentary highlights the impending loss of Moses as a witness, emphasizing the significance of his departure and the need to heed his words while he is still present.

2. "Yea, and in a most ignominious manner" - This quote underscores the humiliation and dishonor that will accompany Moses' departure, suggesting that his absence will have a profound impact on the people.

3. "Numbers 21:8,9" - This reference serves as a reminder of the specific biblical passage being discussed, allowing readers to easily locate and further explore the context of the commentary.
