## BHT:
This verse speaks of the necessity to believe in Jesus, the Son of God, as the means to obtain eternal life. It emphasizes the importance of faith in Him as the way to salvation, and how this belief brings about spiritual healing. Just as the Israelites who looked at the brazen serpent were saved from physical death, so too those who believe in Jesus are saved from spiritual death and receive eternal life through Him. This salvation is available to all who come and believe, regardless of their past or present state.
