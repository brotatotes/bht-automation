## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "This discourse would be altogether fragmentary, and would have left Nicodemus almost where he was before, had not this most weighty concluding part been also spoken to him. This it is, which expands and explains the assertions of John 3:14-15, and applies them to the present life and conduct of mankind."
2. "The Lord here reveals Love as the one ground of the divine counsel in redemption, salvation of men, as its one purpose with regard to them."
3. "By the repetition of this final clause verbatim from John 3:15, we have the identity of the former clauses established: i.e. the uplifting of the Son of Man like the serpent in the wilderness is the manifestation of the Divine Love in the gift of the Son of God."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "What proclamation of the Gospel has been so oft on the lips of missionaries and preachers in every age since it was first uttered?"
2. "What has been honored to bring such multitudes to the feet of Christ?"
3. "How would Nicodemus' narrow Judaism become invisible in the blaze of this Sun of righteousness seen rising on 'the world' with healing in His wings!"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "God hates wickedness, but he still desires the Happiness of those who are sinful. 'He hates the sin, but loves the sinner.'"
2. "A parent may love his child and desire his welfare, and yet be strongly opposed to the conduct of that child."
3. "His love for the world, or for all mankind, in giving his Son, was shown by these circumstances: That he gave - It was a free and unmerited gift."

These quotes highlight the benevolent nature of God's love, his ability to separate the sin from the sinner, and the selfless act of giving his Son as a gift to humanity.

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "This attitude of God toward the world is in suggestive contrast with that in which the gods of paganism are represented."
2. "Man has no assurance of forgiveness even when he offers the sacrifices in which the gods especially delight."
3. "Human life is a life without the certainty of grace."

### John Calvin:
1. "Our minds cannot find calm repose, until we arrive at the unmerited love of God."
2. "Scripture everywhere extols his pure and unmingled mercy, which sets aside all merits."
3. "The love of Christ must intervene for the purpose of reconciling God to us, before we have any experience of his fatherly kindness."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Jesus had said ‘must be lifted on high,’ but had given no reason. His disciple, whose message to the church was ‘God is love’ (1 John 4:16), refers back the necessity to this truth." 

2. "Whatever remains still hidden, so much as this is certain, that the humiliation and exaltation of Him who came down out of heaven were the expression of God’s love to the whole world."

3. "The universality of the blessing is marked with twofold emphasis; designed, not for Israel only, but for the whole world, it is the actual possession of every believer."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "This 'Little Gospel' as it is often called, this 'comfortable word' (the Anglican Liturgy), while not a quotation from Jesus is a just and marvellous interpretation of the mission and message of our Lord."

2. "Loved (ηγαπησεν). First aorist active indicative of αγαπαω, the noble word so common in the Gospels for the highest form of love, used here as often in John of God's love for man."

3. "The world (τον κοσμον). The whole cosmos of men, including Gentiles, the whole human race. This universal aspect of God's love appears also in 2 Corinthians 5:19; Romans 5:8."

4. "His only begotten Son (τον υιον τον μονογενη). 'The Son the only begotten.' For this word see on John 1:14; John 1:18; John 3:18."

5. "The rest of the sentence, the purpose clause with ινα-εχη precisely reproduces the close of John 3:15 save that εις αυτον takes the place of εν αυτω and goes certainly with πιστευων and the added clause 'should not perish but' (μη απολητα αλλα)..."

### John Gill:
1. "For God so loved the Gentiles, as well as Jews, that he gave his only begotten Son; to, and for them, as well as for the Jews; to be a covenant of the people, the Gentiles, the Saviour of them, and a sacrifice for them; a gift which is a sufficient evidence of his love to them." 

2. "God's love is not limited to a select few, but extends to whosoever believes in him, whether Jew or Gentile. This love is not a temporary sentiment, but an everlasting love that grants the believer eternal life."

3. "The gift of God's Son is a demonstration of his deep and incomprehensible love for all people, regardless of their nationality or background. It is a gift that surpasses human understanding and is a testament to the boundless nature of God's love."

### John Wesley:
1. "Whosoever believeth on him — With that faith which worketh by love, and hold fast the beginning of his confidence steadfast to the end."
2. "God so loved the world — That is, all men under heaven; even those that despise his love, and will for that cause finally perish."
3. "He gave his only Son — Truly and seriously. And the Son of God gave himself, Galatians 4:4, truly and seriously."
