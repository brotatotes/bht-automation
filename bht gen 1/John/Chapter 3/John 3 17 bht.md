# John 3:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The true purpose of Jesus' arrival on Earth was not to bring condemnation, as some may believe. Instead, God sent His Son to offer salvation and redemption to humanity, bringing love, grace, and forgiveness to a fallen world. This mission was fueled by God's great love, and it is important to understand that Jesus came not to judge, but to save. The misconception surrounding Jesus' purpose highlights the need for a deeper understanding of His message of love and redemption.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The κόσμος, the Gentile world, was according to Jewish ideas to be judged and condemned by the Messiah. This error our Lord here removes."
2. "The κρῖμα there, as here, results from the separation of mankind into two classes, those who will and those who will not come to the light; and that result itself is not the purpose why the Son of God came into the world, but is evolved in the accomplishment of the higher purpose, viz. Love, and the salvation of men."
3. "Observe, the latter clause does not correspond to the former it is not ἵνα σώζῃ τὸν κόσμον, but ἵνα σωθῇ ὁ κόσμος διʼ αὐτοῦ: the free will of the κόσμος is by this strikingly set forth, in connexion with John 3:19-20."

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Though 'condemnation' is to many the issue of Christ's mission, it is not the object of His mission, which is purely a saving one."
2. "The purpose of Christ's mission is not to condemn, but to save."
3. "This statement emphasizes the compassionate and redemptive nature of Christ's mission."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "To condemn the world - Not to judge, or pronounce sentence on mankind. God might justly have sent him for this."
2. "Man deserved condemnation, and it would have been right to have pronounced it; but God was willing that there should be an offer of pardon, and the sentence of condemnation was delayed."
3. "Although Jesus did not come then to condemn mankind, yet the time is coming when he will return to judge the living and the dead."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Sent rather than gave (ver. 16), because the idea of sacrifice is here merged in that of authoritative commission."
2. "The verb krinw means, originally, to separate. So Homer, of Ceres separating the grain from the chaff."
3. "The threefold repetition of the word has a certain solemnity."

Note: The commentary is about John 3:17.

### John Calvin:
1. "For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world." - It is a confirmation of the preceding statement; for it was not in vain that God sent his own Son to us. He came not to destroy; and therefore it follows, that it is the peculiar office of the Son of God, that all who believe may obtain salvation by him.

2. "We ought not, therefore, to look at any thing else in Christ, than that God, out of his boundless goodness chose to extend his aid for saving us who were lost." - We should hold out this shield, that God is unwilling that we should be overwhelmed with everlasting destruction, because he has appointed his Son to be the salvation of the world.

3. "When Christ says, in other passages, that he is come to judgment, this may be regarded as accidental, or as arising from a different cause; for they who reject the grace offered in him deserve to find him the Judge and Avenger of contempt so unworthy and base." - The Gospel is especially, and in the first instance, appointed for believers, that it may be salvation to them; but that afterwards believers will not escape unpunished who, despising the grace of Christ, chose to have him as the Author of death rather than of life.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "To ‘may perish (John 3:16) here corresponds’ may judge the world, to ‘have eternal life’ answers ‘may be saved.’ This alone is sufficient to show that the word ‘judge,’ though not in itself equivalent to ‘condemn,’ has reference to a judgment which tends to condemnation."
2. "The Jews believed that Messiah would come to glorify Israel, but to judge the Gentiles; the solemn and emphatic repetition of ‘the world’ rebukes all such limitations."
3. "He came to save, not to judge the world. He came to judge the world in so far as it will not allow itself to be saved; and this judgment is one that takes place even now (because even now there is wilful unbelief), though it will only be consummated hereafter."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "For God sent not the Son... John uses both αποστελλω and πεμπω for God's sending the Son... with no real difference in meaning." 
2. "The Messiah does judge the world as Jesus taught, but this was not the primary or the only purpose of his coming." 
3. "But that the world should be saved through him... the common verb to save... often used for physical health, but here of the spiritual salvation."

### John Gill:
1. "God did send his Son into the world in the likeness of sinful flesh, being made of a woman, and made under the law; and which is an instance of his great love, and not of any disrespect to his Son, or of any inequality between them."
2. "He sent his Son now, not to destroy them for their idolatry, and wickedness, but to be the Saviour of them."
3. "The end of his mission, and first coming is, that the world through him might be saved; even the world of the elect in general, whom God determined to save, and has chosen, to obtain salvation by Jesus Christ."

### John Wesley:
1. "God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world" - This quote emphasizes the true purpose of Jesus' arrival on Earth, which was not to bring condemnation but rather to offer salvation and redemption to humanity.

2. "Although many accuse him of it" - This quote acknowledges the misconception that Jesus came to condemn the world, highlighting the misunderstanding and misinterpretation of his mission by some individuals.

3. "God's intention was to bring love, grace, and forgiveness to a fallen world through his Son" - This quote underscores the divine intention behind Jesus' coming, emphasizing the transformative power of love, grace, and forgiveness that he brought to a broken world.
