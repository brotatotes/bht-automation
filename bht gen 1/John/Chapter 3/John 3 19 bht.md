# John 3:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the commentators describe the condition of mankind, highlighting the perversion of their affections and will, the state of sin and unbelief they find themselves in. The verse conveys the powerful message that despite the light of divine revelation that has come into the world, people often choose darkness over truth, sin over holiness. It further emphasizes that condemnation is not arbitrary but based on the rejection of Christ and the deliberate preference for error and wickedness. God's judgment is portrayed as clear and the blame for condemnation is to be imputed to oneself.
