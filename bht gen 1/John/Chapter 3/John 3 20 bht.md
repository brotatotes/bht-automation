# John 3:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, the light represents the Lord Jesus and His salvation. The verse talks about how people who practice evil deeds hate the light because it exposes and convicts them. They prefer to remain in darkness, avoiding the truth and rejecting the remedy for their wrongdoing. The light of the gospel reveals their wickedness and condemns their actions, but they choose to hide in darkness to avoid being reproved and held accountable. Ultimately, their rejection of the light stems from their desire to conceal their sins and continue living in unrighteousness.
