# John 3:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, we find John the Baptist baptizing at Ænon and Salim, locations west of the Jordan. The specific whereabouts of these places remain uncertain, but they were near each other and close to the Jordan. Aenon seems to refer to a place with an abundance of water, making it a suitable location for baptism. John's baptism aimed to lead people to Jesus, and his willingness to humbly accept and redirect those who came to him highlights his role as a forerunner pointing people to the transformative power of Christ.
