3. "Between Matthew 4:11-12, there seems to be a wide hiatus, in which the first chapters of this Gospel should be inserted."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The word 'prison' in this verse refers to a physical place of confinement, similar to the prisons mentioned in Acts 5:18 and Acts 5:21."

2. "By using the term 'prison,' the author emphasizes the literal aspect of the confinement, highlighting the physical and tangible nature of the place where the individuals were held."
