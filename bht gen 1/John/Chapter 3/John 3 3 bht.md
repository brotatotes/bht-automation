# John 3:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The commentators offer insights into the Bible verse without directly disclosing which verse is being described. They emphasize the concept of being born anew, not just in a physical sense but as a spiritual transformation. The verse warns that without this new birth, one cannot truly see or experience the kingdom of God. It is crucial for individuals to grasp the need for a change of heart and life, as being born anew is essential to escape a state of sin and condemnation. Rejecting this renewal would lead to everlasting and intensified condemnation.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "My teaching is not of doing and leaving undone, but of a change in the man...so that it is, not new works done, but a new man to do them; not another life only, but another birth." 
2. "The true meaning is to be found by taking into account the answer of Nicodemus, who obviously understood it of a new birth in mature life."
3. "Born afresh would be a better rendering than 'born again,' being closer to the meaning of ἄνωθεν, 'from the very beginning; unless a man begin his life anew altogether, he cannot..."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "This blunt and curt reply was plainly meant to shake the whole edifice of the man's religion, in order to lay a deeper and more enduring foundation."
2. "Had the man been less sincere, this would certainly have repelled him but with persons in his mixed state of mind... such methods speed better than more honeyed words and gradual approaches."
3. "Be born again... undergo a fundamental and permanent revolution."
4. "Cannot see... have no part in the kingdom of God."
5. "The kingdom of God... whether in its beginnings here or its consummation hereafter."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It is no part of Christianity to conceal anything. Jesus declared to every man, high or low, rich or poor, the most humbling truths of the gospel."
2. "Except a man - This is a universal form of expression designed to include all mankind. Of 'each and every man' it is certain that unless he is born again he cannot see the kingdom of God."
3. "To escape from sin, to be happy in the world to come, it is necessary that man should be changed in his principles, his feelings, and his manner of life. This change, or the beginning of this new life, is called the 'new birth,' or 'regeneration.'"

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The word is used in the following senses in the New Testament, where it occurs thirteen times: 1. From the top: Matthew 27:51; Mark 14:38; John 19:23. 2. From above: John 3:31; John 19:11; James 1:17; James 3:15, James 3:17. 3. From the beginning: Luke 1:3; Acts 26:5. 4. Again: Galatians 4:9, but accompanied by palin, again." 
2. "In favor of the rendering from above, it is urged that it corresponds to John's habitual method of describing the work of spiritual regeneration as a birth from God." 
3. "If we translate anew or again, the logical order is preserved, the nature of the birth being described in ver. 5."

### John Calvin:
1. "For as it is useless to sow seed in a field which has not been prepared by the labors of the husbandman, so it is to no purpose to scatter the doctrine of the Gospel, if the mind has not been previously subdued and duly prepared for docility and obedience."
2. "So long as thou art destitute of that which is of the highest importance in the kingdom of God, I care little about your calling me Master; for the first entrance into the kingdom of God is, to become a new man."
3. "This expression shows briefly what is the beginning of Christianity, and at the same time teaches us, that we are born exiles and utterly alienated from the kingdom of God, and that there is a perpetual state of variance between God and us, until he makes us altogether different by our being born again."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The Pharisee’s conception of the Messianic promise was false. In great measure, at least, his ‘kingdom of God’ was outward and carnal, not inward and spiritual, a privilege of birth, belonging of right to Israel." 
2. "Our Lord’s words, then, teach the fundamental truth, that not natural birth, descent from the stock of Israel, but a second birth, the being begotten anew, a complete spiritual change, admits into the kingdom of God."
3. "To a state of outward earthly privilege rights of natural birth might give admittance. In declaring that without a complete inward change none can possibly see (have a true perception of) ‘the kingdom of God,’ Jesus declares the spiritual character of His kingdom."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Except a man be born anew" - The phrase "born anew" suggests a second birth, a regeneration, but not a physical birth. It implies a spiritual transformation or rebirth from above, by the Spirit. (Quote 1)

2. "Which is the meaning here?" - The meaning of "born anew" in this context is debated. Nicodemus misunderstood it as a second physical birth, but other passages in John suggest it means "from above" or "from heaven." (Quote 2)

3. "He cannot see the kingdom of God" - This phrase indicates that without being born anew, one cannot fully participate in or experience the kingdom of God. It implies that spiritual transformation is necessary to enter into the realm of God's rule and reign. (Quote 3)

### John Gill:
1. "Christ assures him, that he must be 'born again'; in distinction from, and opposition to his first birth by nature; in which he was vile, polluted, carnal, and corrupt."
2. "By this phrase our Lord signifies, that no man... can have any true knowledge of, or right unto, the enjoyment of the kingdom of God, unless he is born again or regenerated, and quickened by the Spirit of God."
3. "If this is not the case, a man can have no true knowledge of the kingdom of the Messiah, which is not a temporal and carnal one; it is not of this world, nor does it come with observation."

### John Wesley:
1. "That an entire change of heart as well as of life was necessary for that purpose."
2. "Every man born into the world was by nature in a state of sin, condemnation, and misery."
3. "If they rejected him, their eternal, aggravated condemnation would be the certain consequence."
