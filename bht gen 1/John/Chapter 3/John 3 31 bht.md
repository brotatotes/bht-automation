1. "He that cometh from above is above all: he that is out of the earth is out of the earth, and out of the earth he speaketh." - This verse highlights the distinction between Jesus and all other prophets or teachers.

2. "Jesus is the one that comes out of heaven (ο εκ του ουρανου ερχομενος) as he has shown in John 1:1-18."
