## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "John's disciples had said, 'All come to Him'... The Baptist here virtually says, Would it were so, but alas! they are next to 'none'." 
2. "They were far readier to receive himself, and obliged him to say, I am not the Christ, and he seems pained at this." 
3. "The Baptist here virtually says, Would it were so, but alas! they are next to 'none'."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "No man receiveth his testimony - The words 'no man' are here to be understood in the sense of 'few.' Though his doctrine is pure, plain, sublime, yet 'few,' comparatively, received it in faith."
2. "Though multitudes came to him, drawn by various motives, yet 'few' became his 'real' disciples."
3. "Often many persons 'appear' for a time to become the followers of Christ, who in the end are seen to have known nothing of religion."

### John Calvin:
1. "Seeing and hearing are contrasted with doubtful opinions, unfounded rumors, and every kind of falsehoods; for he means that Christ teaches nothing but what has been fully ascertained."
2. "This word denotes that Christ has been taught by the Father, so that he brings forward nothing but what is divine, or, in other words, what has been revealed to him by God."
3. "Whenever we see such obstinacy in the world, let this admonition hold us in constant obedience to the Gospel, that it is truth which came from God."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Jesus alone belongs to this sphere: all the prophets before His coming, though divinely commissioned, had ‘the earth’ as the starting-point of their utterances, spoke of what they had received on earth, spoke truly but not perfectly."
2. "The Divine light was reflected from the prophets to the world around. In Jesus the heavenly light itself came into the world."
3. "Jesus alone, then, beareth witness to that which He hath seen and which He heard, and (here again is the mournful cadence of this Gospel) no one receiveth His witness."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "What he hath seen and heard (ο εωρακεν κα ηκουσεν). Perfect active indicative followed by aorist active indicative, because, as Westcott shows, the first belongs to the very existence of the Son and the latter to his mission."
2. "There is no confusion of tenses here."
3. "No man (ουδεις). There were crowds coming to Jesus, but they do not really accept him as Saviour and Lord (John 1:11; John 2:24). It is superficial as time will show. But 'no one' is not to be pressed too far, for it is the rhetorical use."

### John Gill:
1. "The phrases express the clear and perfect knowledge Christ has of all truths and doctrines; he having all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge in him."
2. "He withholds nothing, but declares the whole counsel of God; and is deservedly called the faithful witness."
3. "No one person can receive the testimony of Christ, and believe in him, unless it be given him from above, by the grace of God."

### John Wesley:
1. "None comparatively, exceeding few; receiveth his testimony." - This quote highlights the rarity of true faith, emphasizing that only a small number of people truly receive and believe in the testimony of Jesus. 

2. "No man...receiveth his testimony." - This quote emphasizes the universal rejection of Jesus' testimony by the majority of people. It underscores the challenge of spreading the message of faith and the resistance faced by those who believe in Jesus. 

3. "With true faith." - This quote emphasizes the importance of genuine and sincere faith in receiving and accepting Jesus' testimony. It implies that mere intellectual acceptance is not enough; true faith requires a deep and personal connection with Jesus and his teachings.
