### John Calvin:
1. "The Father loveth the Son. But what is the meaning of this reason? Does he regard all others with hatred?

1. "The Father loveth the Son,.... There is such a relation as that of Father and Son subsisting between the first and second persons in the Trinity; which is not by constitution and appointment: or arbitrary, arising from, and depending on the will of the first, but is natural and necessary; the second person being begotten by the first, and is of the same nature, and equally a divine person."
2. "And hence he continues to love him in every form and appearance of his; in every office he sustains; in every state and condition into which he comes: he delighted in him as his elect, as chosen and appointed by him to be the Saviour of his people; he took pleasure in him as the surety of them, and when he saw him engaging as such, and declaring it was his heart to do his will, and work out their salvation."
3. "And this love is a love of complacency and delight, and is from everlasting to everlasting; the evidence of which flows, and hath given all things into his hand; or 'by his hand'; as the doctrines of the Gospel, the gifts of the Spirit, grace, and glory."
