# John 3:36 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, it is made clear that belief in Jesus as the Son of God is the key to receiving everlasting life. Those who believe already possess this life, as it is a present reality for them. Conversely, those who do not believe, and therefore do not obey, face the consequence of not having this eternal life. The emphasis here is on the transformative power of faith and the everlasting consequences of disbelief.
