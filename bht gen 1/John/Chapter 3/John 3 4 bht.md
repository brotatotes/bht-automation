### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The figure of the new birth, if it had been meant only of Gentile proselytes to the Jewish religion, would have been intelligible enough to Nicodemus, being quite in keeping with the language of that day."
2. "But that Jews themselves should need a new birth was to him incomprehensible."

### John Calvin:
1.

2. "Popery exhibits to us, at the present day, an instance of the same kind in her Theologians. For while they weary out their whole life with profound speculations... they know no more on these subjects than a cobbler or a cowherd knows about the course of the stars."
3. "We need not wonder, therefore, to find here that Nicodemus stumbles at a straw; for it is a just vengeance of God, that they who think themselves the highest and most excellent teachers, and in whose estimation the ordinary simplicity of doctrine is vile and despicable, stand amazed at small matters."
