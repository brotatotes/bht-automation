# John 3:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, commentators highlight the significance of both water and the Spirit. They emphasize that being born again requires both an inward spiritual transformation, brought about by the Holy Spirit, as well as the outward act of baptism. This baptism serves as a symbol and public declaration of the inner change that has taken place. It is through this combination of the Spirit's work and the visible act of baptism that one enters into the kingdom of God and experiences newness of life.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "There can be no doubt, on any honest interpretation of the words, that γεννηθῆναι ἐξ ὕδατος refers to the token or outward sign of baptism, γ . ἐκ πνεύματος to the thing signified, or inward grace of the Holy Spirit."
2. "All the better and deeper expositors have recognized the co-existence of the two, water and the Spirit."
3. "Baptism, complete, with water and the Spirit, is the admission into the kingdom of God."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "To a Jewish ecclesiastic, so familiar with the symbolical application of water, in every variety of way and form of expression, this language was fitted to show that the thing intended was no other than a thorough spiritual purification by the operation of the Holy Ghost."
2. "Indeed, element of water and operation of the Spirit are brought together in a glorious evangelical prediction of Ezekiel."
3. "Already had the symbol of water been embodied in an initiatory ordinance, in the baptism of the Jewish expectants of Messiah by the Baptist, not to speak of the baptism of Gentile proselytes before that; and in the Christian Church it was soon to become the great visible door of entrance into 'the kingdom of God,' the reality being the sole work of the Holy Ghost."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Baptism was practiced by the Jews in receiving a Gentile as a proselyte... Jesus here says that it is an ordinance of his religion, and the sign and seal of the renewing influences of his Spirit." 
2. "Jesus meant, undoubtedly, to be understood as affirming that this [baptism] was to be the regular and uniform way of entering into his church; that it was the appropriate mode of making a profession of religion." 
3. "By this is clearly intended that the heart must be changed by the agency of the Holy Spirit; that the love of sin must be abandoned; that man must repent of crime and turn to God; that he must renounce all his evil propensities, and give himself to a life of prayer and holiness, of meekness, purity, and benevolence."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "That the former of these two factors is not to be merged in the latter; that the spiritual element is not to exclude or obliterate the external and ritual element." 
2. "Jesus' words opened to Nicodemus a new and more spiritual significance in both the ceremonial purifications and the baptism of John which the Pharisees had rejected."
3. "Thus Jesus' words included a prophetic reference to the complete ideal of Christian baptism - 'the washing of regeneration and the renewing of the Holy Ghost' (Titus 3:5; Ephesians 5:26)."

### John Calvin:
1. "The meaning would then be, that by baptism we enter into the kingdom of God, because in baptism we are regenerated by the Spirit of God."
2. "He connects the Water with the Spirit, because under that visible symbol he attests and seals that newness of life which God alone produces in us by his Spirit."
3. "It is a simple statement, that we must be born again, in order that we may be the children of God, and that the Holy Spirit is the Author of this second birth."

### Philip Schaff:
1) "The words ‘water and spirit’ are most closely joined, and placed under the government of the same preposition."
2) "It is very possible that this testimony was well known to others besides John’s disciples, to all indeed in Judea who were roused to inquiry respecting the Baptist and his relation to Jesus."
3) "Here again, therefore, we have some confirmation of the view that in the words before us there is in some sort a reference to baptism, at all events, to the baptism of John."
4) "The two contrasted elements in the baptisms of chap. John 1:33 are (a) the covering and removal of past sin; and (b) the inbreathing of a new life."
5) "Here, therefore, our Lord says that no man can enter into the kingdom of God unless he have been born anew, the elements of the new birth being the removal by cleansing of the old sinful life, and the impartation by the Holy Spirit of a new holy principle of life."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Nicodemus had failed utterly to grasp the idea of the spiritual birth as essential to entrance into the Kingdom of God."
2. "By using water (the symbol before the thing signified) first and adding Spirit, he may have hoped to turn the mind of Nicodemus away from mere physical birth and, by pointing to the baptism of John on confession of sin which the Pharisees had rejected, to turn his attention to the birth from above by the Spirit."
3. "That is to say the mention of 'water' here may have been for the purpose of helping Nicodemus without laying down a fundamental principle of salvation as being by means of baptism."

### John Gill:
1. "By 'water' is meant, in a figurative and metaphorical sense, the grace of God, as it is elsewhere; see Ezekiel 36:25. Which is the moving cause of this new birth, and according to which God begets men again to a lively hope, and that by which it is effected."
2. "Regeneration is sometimes ascribed to God the Father, as in 1 Peter 1:3, and sometimes to the Son, 1 John 2:29 and here to the Spirit, as in Titus 3:5, who convinces of sin, sanctifies, renews, works faith, and every other grace; begins and carries on the work of grace, unto perfection."
3. "Unless a man has this work of his wrought on his soul, as he will never understand divine and spiritual things, so he can have no right to Gospel ordinances, or things appertaining to the kingdom of God; nor can he be thought to have passed from death to life, and to have entered into an open state of grace, and the kingdom of it; or that living and dying so, he shall ever enter into the kingdom of heaven."

### John Wesley:
1. "Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit" - This phrase emphasizes the necessity of both an inward spiritual transformation and the outward act of baptism as a symbol of that transformation.

2. "Except he experience that great inward change by the Spirit" - The commentary highlights the importance of a personal encounter with the Holy Spirit, which brings about a profound inner transformation in a person's life.

3. "Be baptized (wherever baptism can be had) as the outward sign and means of it" - Baptism is seen as a visible representation of the inward change that has taken place, serving as a public declaration of one's faith and commitment to follow Christ.
