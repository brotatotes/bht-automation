# John 3:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verses being described here discuss the concept of birth, but not in the literal sense. The commentators emphasize the contrast between the physical and the spiritual aspects of human existence. They highlight that human nature, as born of the flesh, is limited, corrupted, and in opposition to the spiritual realm. However, they also emphasize the transformative power of the Spirit, which can generate a new birth resulting in a spiritual nature that aligns with the divine. Through this new birth, individuals can discern and understand spiritual truths.
