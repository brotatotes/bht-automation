# John 3:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this passage, Jesus speaks to Nicodemus, explaining the necessity of being born again.

They emphasize that being born again entails a spiritual rebirth from above, a complete inward change from sinfulness to holiness. This transformative experience is not merely about reforming one's life, but about having a new nature and disposition of mind. It is a divine work that brings about a profound change in the heart.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The Lord did not, could not, say this of Himself. Why? Because in the full sense in which the flesh is incapacitated from entering the kingdom of God, He was not born of the flesh."
2. "He inherited the weakness of the flesh, but His spirit was not, like that of sinful man, alien from holiness and God; and therefore on Him no second birth passed."
3. "His obedience was accepted as perfect, and the good pleasure of the Father rested on Him. Therefore He includes not Himself in this necessity for the new birth."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "If a spiritual nature only can see and enter the kingdom of God if all we bring into the world with us be the reverse of spiritual; and if this spirituality be solely of the Holy Ghost, no wonder a new birth is indispensable."
2. "Ye, says Jesus, not we."
3. "This is remarkable, showing that our Lord meant to hold Himself forth as 'separate from sinners.'"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Marvel not - Wonder not."
2. "It is possible that Nicodemus in some way still expressed a doubt of the doctrine."
3. "Jesus took occasion in a very striking manner to illustrate it."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Unto thee - ye must." - This quote highlights the change in pronouns from singular to plural, indicating that the message is not only for Nicodemus but also for those he represents. It emphasizes the inclusivity of the message and the shared responsibility of the group.

2. "In his address to Nicodemus (thee) the Lord had spoken also to those whom Nicodemus represented." - This quote explains that the Lord's words to Nicodemus were not only directed at him but also at the larger group he belonged to. It suggests that Nicodemus' error was not just his own but a common mistake among his peers.

3. "His error was the error of his class." - This quote suggests that Nicodemus' mistake was not an individual failing but a reflection of the mindset and beliefs of the group he belonged to. It implies that his error was a shared misconception among his social or religious circle.

### John Calvin:
1. "To prevent him from entertaining any scruple of this sort, Christ shows that even in the bodily life there is displayed an amazing power of God, the reason of which is concealed."
2. "If in this frail and transitory life God acts so powerfully that we are constrained to admire his power, what folly is it to attempt to measure by the perception of our own mind his secret work in the heavenly and supernatural life, so as to believe no more than what we see?"
3. "When Christ says to Nicodemus that he ought not to wonder, we must not understand it in such a manner as if he intended that we should despise a work of God, which is so illustrious, and which is worthy of the highest admiration; but he means that we ought not to wonder with that kind of admiration which hinders our faith."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The use of ‘marvel’ in other passages would seem to show that in this Gospel the word indicates much more than amazement."
2. "It is certainly not the astonishment of admiration, but incredulous and sometimes angry surprise."
3. "'Ye must be born again' the necessity is absolute."

These quotes highlight the astonishment and disbelief of Nicodemus upon hearing Jesus' words, emphasizing the radical departure from traditional teachings. They also emphasize the absolute necessity of being born again.

### John Gill:
1. "It was altogether new to him, and unheard of by him; nor could he understand, nor conceive in what manner it could be." 
2. "There is a necessity of the regeneration of those, who are the chosen of God, and the redeemed of the Lamb." 
3. "It is necessary they should have a nature, temper, and disposition of mind, suitable to the inheritance they are to enjoy."

### John Wesley:
1. "To be born again, is to be inwardly changed from all sinfulness to all holiness."
2. "It is fitly so called, because as great a change then passes on the soul as passes on the body when it is born into the world."
3. "To be born again is not merely to reform our lives, but to have a new nature wrought in us; it is not a change of the will only, but a change of the heart."
