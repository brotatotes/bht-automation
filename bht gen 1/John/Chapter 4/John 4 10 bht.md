# John 4:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, Jesus engages in a conversation with a Samaritan woman, revealing to her the gift of God, Himself. If she only knew the favor and opportunity that God was offering her, she would have asked Jesus for the living water, which represents the gift of the Holy Spirit and its life-giving effects. This interaction showcases the compassion of Christ, as He displays His willingness to impart salvation and grace to those who recognize their need for Him. The living water symbolizes the transforming power of God's grace, bringing new life to those who receive it.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The WATER is, in this first part of the discourse, the subject, and serves as a point of connexion, whereby the woman’s thoughts may be elevated, and her desire aroused."
2. "He who speaks with thee is no ordinary Ἰουδαῖος, nor any ordinary man, but One who can give thee the gift of God; One sent from God, and God Himself."
3. "Designedly used in a double sense by our Lord, that the woman may lay hold of the material meaning, and by it be awakened to the higher one."

2. "Gladly suing of Him living water—nor shouldst thou have sued in vain." 

3. "Gently reflecting on her for not immediately meeting His request."

### Albert Barnes:

### John Calvin:
1. "This is certainly an astonishing instance of his goodness. For what was there in this wretched woman, that, from being a prostitute, she suddenly became a disciple of the Son of God? Though in all of us he has displayed a similar instance of his compassion."
2. "The Lord showed us, as in a model, that those to whom he imparts the doctrine of salvation are not selected on the ground of merit."
3. "The only true and profitable knowledge of the grace of God is, when we know that it is exhibited to us in Christ, and that it is held out to us by his hand."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "We may well believe that there was something in the manner of Jesus, when uttering His first words, that invited conversation, and was intended to lead the woman to inquiry."
2. "Her answer had told of her recognition of Him as a Jew: His reply declares her ignorance of Him and of what He was able to give."
3. "'Living water,' then, denotes the gift of the Holy Spirit. This was pre-eminently the promised gift of the Father, beautifully and most aptly symbolized by the fresh springing water, which wherever it comes makes the desert rejoice, and everything live."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "The first aorist passive (απεκριθη) is deponent, no longer passive in sense."

3. "This Messianic self-consciousness of Jesus is plain in John, but it is early in the Synoptics also."

### John Gill:
1. "Jesus answered and said unto her,.... In a very serious manner, in a different way from hers: if thou knewest the gift of God; meaning, not the Holy Spirit with his gifts and graces, as some think, but himself."
2. "thou wouldst have asked of him; a favour and benefit; for such who truly know Christ, the worth and value of him, and their need of him, will apply to him for grace, as they have encouragement to do; since all grace is treasured up in him, and he gives it freely, and upbraideth not."
3. "and he would have given thee living water; pardoning and justifying grace, every branch of sanctifying grace, and all the supplies of it; so called, because his grace quickens sinners dead in sin, and dead in law, and in, their own apprehensions; and causes them to live in themselves, and before God."

### John Wesley:
1. "If thou hadst known the gift... thou wouldst have asked of him." 
2. "Water... the most simple, necessary, common, and salutary things in nature."
3. "Living water... The Spirit and its fruits."
