# John 4:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Bible verse being described portrays the soul's thirst for happiness, seeking it in various places but finding no satiation. The verse introduces the concept of living water, which, when drank, satisfies all holy desires and becomes a perennial fountain within the believer. The living water is superior to any other source, inexhaustible, and flowing with an ever-present freshness and life. It quenches the soul's thirst, leading to an abiding fellowship with Christ and the beginning of eternal life.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The soul by nature is like such a desert, or like a traveler wandering through such a desert. It is thirsting for happiness, and seeking it everywhere, and finds it not."

3. "It shall bubble or spring up like a fountain. It is not like a stagnant pool - not like a deep well, but like an ever-living fountain, that flows at all seasons of the year, in heat and cold, and in all external circumstances of weather, whether foul or fair, wet or dry."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The drinking of the living water is put as a single act, in order to indicate the divine principle of life as containing in itself alone the satisfaction of all holy desires as they successively arise; in contrast with human sources, which are soon exhausted, and drive one to other fountains."
2. "Holy desire, no matter how large or how varied it may become, will always seek and find its satisfaction in Christ, and in Christ only."
