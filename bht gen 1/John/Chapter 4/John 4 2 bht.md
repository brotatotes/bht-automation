# John 4:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we see that Jesus did not personally baptize people, as it was not His primary role and He had other responsibilities such as preaching and performing miracles. Instead, He entrusted His disciples with the task of physically baptizing individuals. This decision likely prevented potential divisions and arguments among those who were baptized. Moreover, Jesus's baptism was not just a physical act, but a spiritual transformation through the baptism of the Holy Spirit. His baptism held greater efficacy and power, and its significance should not be diminished by the fact that it was administered by mortal men.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:

1. "His office was to preach and teach; and the disciples as yet had no office of this kind."
2. "To assume a further reason, e.g. that there might not be ground for those whom the Lord himself had baptized to boast of it, is arbitrary and unnecessary."
3. "Johannes, minister, sua manu baptizavit; discipuli ejus, ut videtur, neminem. At Christus baptizat Spiritu Sancto." (Translation: "John, the minister, baptized with his own hand; his disciples, it seems, no one. But Christ baptizes with the Holy Spirit.")

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Jesus baptized notâ€”John being a servant baptized with his own hand; Christ as the Master." This quote highlights the distinction between John the Baptist and Jesus.

2. "Baptizing with the Holy Ghost." This quote emphasizes that Jesus' baptism was not merely a physical act, but a spiritual one. He offered the transformative power of the Holy Spirit to those who believed in Him.
3. "Administered the outward symbol only through His disciples." This quote reveals that Jesus delegated the task of physically baptizing individuals to His disciples. It underscores the importance of discipleship and the role of believers in carrying out the work of Jesus.

2. "Hence we derive a remarkable consolation, when we know that our baptism has no less efficacy to wash and renew us, than if it had been given by the hand of the Son of God."
3. "Not only does Christ baptize inwardly by his Spirit, but the very symbol which we receive from a mortal man ought to be viewed by us in the same light as if Christ himself displayed his hand from heaven, and stretched it out to us."
