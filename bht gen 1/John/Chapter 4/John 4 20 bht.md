# John 4:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, there is a dispute between the Jews and the Samaritans regarding the proper place of worship. The Samaritans claimed that Mount Gerizim, which held religious significance to them, was the true holy mountain. They believed that their ancestors, including Abraham and Isaac, worshipped there. On the other hand, the Jews asserted that Jerusalem was the designated place of worship, as commanded by God. The woman, seeking clarity on this matter, approached Jesus, recognizing Him as a prophet, to determine the correct place of worship.
