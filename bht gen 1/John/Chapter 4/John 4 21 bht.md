# John 4:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, Jesus speaks to a Samaritan woman and emphasizes the importance of believing in him. He also foretells that the time is approaching when worship will no longer be limited to a particular place, such as Jerusalem or the Samaritan mountain. Instead, believers from both backgrounds will have the opportunity to worship God without the confines of a specific location. Jesus's words signify a broader, more inclusive understanding of worship that transcends cultural and geographic boundaries.
