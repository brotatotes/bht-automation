# John 4:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
True worship is not confined to a specific location or time but is a continuous and universal act of devotion to God. It is not limited to a specific physical place, such as a temple or church, but can be expressed anywhere and everywhere. True worship should be a constant and consistent practice, not limited to specific moments or circumstances, expressing a heartfelt and sincere devotion to the Father.
