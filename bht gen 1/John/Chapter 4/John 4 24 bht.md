## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "God being pure spirit, cannot dwell in particular spots or temples, cannot require, nor be pleased with, earthly material offerings nor ceremonies, as such: on the other hand, is only to be approached in that part of our being, which is spirit, and even there, inasmuch as He is pure and holy, with no by-ends nor hypocritical regards, but in truth and earnestness."
2. "How is the spirit of man to be brought into communion with God? 'In templo vis orare; in te ora. Sed prius esto templum Dei.' And how is this to be? Man cannot make himself the temple of God. So that here comes in the gift of God, with which the discourse began, the gift of the Holy Spirit, which Christ should give to them that believe on Him."
3. "So beautifully does the expression 'ὁ πατήρ' here bring with it the new birth by the Spirit, and for us, the readers of the Gospel, does the discourse of ch. 3 reflect light on this. And so wonderfully do these words form the conclusion to the great subject of these first chapters: 'GOD IS BECOME ONE FLESH WITH US, THAT WE MIGHT BECOME ONE SPIRIT WITH HIM.'"

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "The point raised will very soon cease to be of any moment, for a total change of dispensation is about to come over the Church."
2. "The Samaritans are wrong, not only as to the place, but the whole grounds and nature of their worship, while in all these respects the truth lies with the Jews."
3. "As God is a Spirit, so He both invites and demands a spiritual worship, and already all is in preparation for a spiritual economy, more in harmony with the true nature of acceptable service than the ceremonial worship by consecrated persons, place, and times."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "God is without a body; that he is not material or composed of parts; that he is invisible, in every place, pure and holy." 
2. "This is one of the first truths of religion, and one of the sublimest ever presented to the mind of man."
3. "A pure, a holy, a spiritual worship, therefore, is such as he seeks - the offering of the soul rather than the formal offering of the body - the homage of the heart rather than that of the lips."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "God is a Spirit [πνευμα ο θεος]. Spirit is the emphatic word; Spirit is God."
2. "The phrase describes the nature, not the personality of God."
3. "Compare the expressions, God is light; God is love (1 John 1:5; 1 John 4:8)."

### John Calvin:
1. "We ought first of all to consider that we have to do with God, who can no more agree with the flesh than fire with water."
2. "God is so far from being like us, that those things which please us most are the objects of his loathing and abhorrence."
3. "Let us know that this modesty does not hold the lowest place in the true worship of God, to regard with suspicion whatever is gratifying according to the flesh."

### Philip Schaff:

2. "No other worship than that which is offered in spirit and truth can possibly be actual worship of God."
3. "Not the outward action of the worshipper, not the forms he uses or the gifts he brings, but his spirit alone can be brought to meet the spiritual presence of God."

These quotes emphasize the importance of genuine worship that is rooted in the spirit and truth, rather than external actions or rituals. They highlight that true worship is a matter of the heart and the connection between the worshipper and the spiritual presence of God.

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "God is a Spirit" - The verse emphasizes the non-corporeal nature of God, highlighting that God is not a physical being but rather a spiritual entity. 

2. "God is Spirit" - This statement parallels other descriptions of God, such as "God is Light" and "God is Love," emphasizing the essence of God's nature rather than equating these qualities with God Himself. 

3. "Here is the real necessity" - The word "must" signifies a genuine and essential requirement, in contrast to the superficial necessity mentioned by the woman regarding the proper place of worship. This highlights the significance and importance of understanding God as a Spirit.

### John Gill:
1. "God is a spirit, and not a body, or a corporeal substance: the nature and essence of God is like a spirit, simple and uncompounded, not made up of parts; nor is it divisible; nor does it admit of any change and alteration."
2. "God, as a spirit, is immaterial, immortal, invisible, and an intelligent, willing, and active being."
3. "Worship is due to him on account of his nature and perfections, both internal and external; with both the bodies and souls of men; and both private and public; in the closet, in the family, and in the church of God; as prayer, praise, attendance on the word and ordinances."
