### John Calvin:
1. "When she says that the Messiah is about to come, she seems to speak of the time as near at hand; and, indeed, it is sufficiently evident from many arguments, that the minds of men were everywhere aroused by the expectation of the Messiah, who would restore the affairs which were wretchedly decayed, or rather, which were utterly ruined."
2. "First, that the doctrine of the Law was not absolutely perfect, and that nothing more than first principles was delivered in it; for if there had not been some farther progress to be made, she would not have said that the Messiah will tell us all things."

1. "There is nothing surprising in her avowal that a Deliverer was looked for...this people had waited in expectation of ‘the Converter’ or ‘the Guide.’"
