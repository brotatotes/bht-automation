# John 4:26 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, Jesus compassionately responds to the woman's desire for understanding and fulfills her need before the disciples arrive. While he openly declares himself as the Messiah to her, he avoids doing so with the Jews, as they were focused on a temporal kingdom. Jesus skillfully uses titles like "Son of man" and "Son of God" to subtly reveal his identity as the Messiah. This interaction exemplifies his grace, wisdom, and ability to meet people where they are in order to bring them closer to him.
