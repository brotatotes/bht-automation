## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

2. "Their interview was too sacred, and the effect on the woman too overpowering (not to speak of His own deep emotion) to allow of its being continued."
3. "But this one artless touch—that she 'left her water-pot'—speaks volumes. The living water was already beginning to spring up within her; she found that man doth not live by bread nor by water only, and that there was a water of wondrous virtue that raised people above meat and drink, and the vessels that held them, and all human things."

### Albert Barnes:

### John Calvin:

3. "The 'living water' has banished the thought of that which came from Jacob’s well." - The encounter with Jesus and the promise of "living water" had such a profound impact on the woman that she completely forgot about her water-pot and the physical water she had come to fetch. This emphasizes the spiritual significance of the encounter and the woman's newfound priorities.
