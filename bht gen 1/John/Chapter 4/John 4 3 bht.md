# John 4:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, Jesus chooses to leave Judea and go to Galilee to avoid persecution and the growing envy and malice of the Pharisees, who were becoming a threat to His life. He did not want to provoke them or bring the conflict to a head yet, as His time had not come and He had other work to do elsewhere. This journey to Galilee was a strategic move to protect Himself from their hostility and continue His ministry effectively.
