# John 4:32 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus speaks of having sustenance that goes beyond physical food, a spiritual nourishment that comes from fulfilling God's will. His reference to "meat" symbolizes the conversion of the Samaritan woman and the gathering of souls. Jesus finds great satisfaction and delight in bringing people to faith, to the point where he is consumed by these spiritual matters and has no desire for physical nourishment.

2. "Christ, having now in his hands such an opportunity which might pass away, embraces it with open arms, and holds it fast."
3. "If we propose it as our object not to lose the causes of life on account of life itself, it will not be difficult to preserve the proper medium; for he who shall place it before him as the end of life to serve the Lord, from which we are not at liberty to turn aside even for the immediate danger of death, will certainly reckon it to be of more value than eating and drinking."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "I have meat to eat that ye know not." - This statement by Jesus suggests that he has a spiritual sustenance that the disciples are unaware of. It goes beyond physical food and points to a deeper nourishment that comes from fulfilling God's will.
2. "The common rendering entirely obscures the meaning: our Lord does not say 'know not of, but 'know not,' ye have no experience of it." - The commentary highlights that the disciples lacked the experiential understanding of the satisfaction that comes from doing God's work. It emphasizes the importance of personal experience in comprehending spiritual truths.
3. "As yet, they had not learned the power of such work as His (the complete fulfillment of His Father's will, John 4:34) to satisfy every want." - This quote underscores that Jesus' work of fulfilling God's will has the power to satisfy all needs. It suggests that true fulfillment and satisfaction come from aligning oneself with God's purpose.
