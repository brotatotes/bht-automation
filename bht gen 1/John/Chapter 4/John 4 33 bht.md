# John 4:33 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we see the disciples grappling with their limited understanding of Jesus' teachings, as they are slow to comprehend the spiritual meaning behind his words. They are focused on physical needs rather than recognizing the deeper spiritual nourishment that Jesus provides. Like the Samaritan woman at the well, the disciples struggle to grasp the true nature of Jesus' mission and purpose, revealing their unreceptivity to spiritual truth. Despite their lack of understanding, this verse reminds us that faith is a journey that requires patience and a willingness to grow in spiritual understanding.
