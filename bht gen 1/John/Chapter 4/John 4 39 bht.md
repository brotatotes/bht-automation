# John 4:39 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we see the foundation of the Church being built among the Samaritans, who were initially expectant of the promised Messiah. The Samaritans' faith in Jesus is ignited by the powerful testimony of the woman who encountered Him, leading many to believe in Him through her clear and honest witness. Their belief is further strengthened by their recognition that Jesus has supernatural knowledge and could only be the long-awaited Savior of the world. This passage highlights the impact of personal testimony and the transformative power of faith in Jesus.
