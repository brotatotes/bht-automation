However, it was not just about convenience or speed, for Jesus made a deliberate two-day stop along the way. By choosing to go through Samaria, Jesus displayed his willingness to break societal norms, reach out to despised Samaritans, and challenge prevailing prejudices. It was a journey driven by a divine necessity and a compassionate desire to bridge divides and bring about redemption.
