# John 4:40 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we see a powerful contrast as Jesus is rejected by His own people in Judea, yet warmly received by the Samaritans, who invite Him to stay with them. The commentators emphasize the unexpected nature of this encounter, highlighting the historical tension between Jews and Samaritans. The Samaritans, captivated by Jesus' teachings, eagerly sought His company, recognizing Him as the Messiah. Jesus, in His wisdom, granted their request, not wanting to discourage them, but also being mindful of causing offense. The result was a joyful and fruitful time spent with the Samaritans.
