# John 4:42 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse being described speaks of the belief in Jesus as the Savior, not solely based on the words of the woman, but from hearing him directly. This belief is significant because it is the recognition that Jesus is the Christ, the true Messiah, and the Saviour of the world. The Samaritans grasp the profound understanding that Jesus' salvation extends beyond boundaries, embracing all people, regardless of their background or nationality. This concept challenges the prevailing notion of exclusivity and affirms the timeless and universal impact of Jesus' redemptive mission.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The Samaritans distinguish between the more authoritative and dignified word of Jesus, and the talk of the woman."
2. "John uses the word [Savior] only here and 1 John 4:14."

### John Calvin:
1. "We believe. This expresses more fully the nature of their faith, that it has been drawn from the word of God itself, so that they can boast of having the Son of God as their Teacher; as, indeed, it is on his authority alone that we can safely rely."
2. "In faith, therefore, the first thing necessary is, to know that it is Christ who speaks by his ministers; and the next is, to give him the honor which is due; that is, not to doubt that he is true and faithful, so that, relying on so undoubted a guarantee, we may rely safely on his doctrine."
3. "And Christ testified that the salvation, which he had brought, was common to the whole world, that they might understand more fully that it belonged to them also; for he did not call them on the ground of their being lawful heirs, as the Jews were, but taught that he had come to admit strangers into the family of God, and to bring peace to those who were far off."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "No longer because of thy talk," good and effective as that was.

### John Wesley:
1. "This verse emphasizes the universal significance of Jesus as the Savior. It highlights that his role extends beyond the Jewish people and encompasses the entire world."
2. "By stating that Jesus is the Savior of the world, the author emphasizes the inclusive nature of his salvation. This challenges the notion that salvation is limited to a particular group or ethnicity."
