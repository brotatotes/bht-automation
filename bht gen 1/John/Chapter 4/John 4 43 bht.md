1. "The two days of Jesus' stay at Sychar serve as a reminder that God's timing is not always our timing. Sometimes, we may feel like we are waiting for a long time for God to answer our prayers or fulfill His promises. But just as Jesus had a purpose for those two days, God has a purpose for every season of waiting in our lives."
