# John 4:44 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we see the contrast between the Samaritans, who believed in Jesus for His word, and His own countrymen, who only received Him because of the miracles they had seen. Jesus, knowing that a prophet is not honored in his own country, left Judea for Galilee to avoid the growing public attention. However, in His own hometown, Jesus faced rejection and contempt, which hindered His ability to perform miracles. This verse serves as a reminder that familiarity can sometimes blind us to the greatness and power of God, requiring us to examine our own hearts and faith.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "It stands as a preliminary explanation of the ‘Except ye see signs and wonders, ye will not believe;’ and as indicating the contrast between the Samaritans, who believed on Him for His word, and His own countrymen, who only received Him because they had seen the miracles which He did at Jerusalem."
2. "The reason (Joh 4:1) why He left Judæa for Galilee was, because of the publicity which was gathering round Himself and his ministry."
3. "He betakes Himself to Galilee therefore, to avoid fame, testifying that His own country (Galilee) was that where, as a prophet, He was least likely to be honoured."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "For it seems strange, if 'His own country' here means Nazareth, which was in Galilee, that it should be said He came to Galilee because in one of its towns He expected no good reception."
2. "But all will be simple and natural if we fill up the statement thus: 'He went into the region of Galilee, but not, as might have been expected, to that part of it called 'His own country,' Nazareth.'"
3. "He acted on the maxim which He oft repeated, that 'a prophet,'"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Jesus went to Galilee, 'although' he had said that a prophet had no honor in his own country."
2. "He foreknew that the Galileans would many of them believe on him."
3. "Jesus went to Galilee, but not to Nazareth, for he testified."

### Marvin Vincent:
be meant, as distinguished from Galilee, where He had been before. He left Judaea, because the Jews there sought to kill Him, and went into Galilee, where He would be safer. (1)

But - a prophet is not without honor, save in his own country, and in his own house [ει μη εν τη ιδια πατριδι και εν τη ιδια οικια] . This proverbial saying expresses the common experience that men are not valued in their own neighborhood and by their own relatives. The reason why this is so is not stated, but it is often the case that familiarity breeds contempt. (2)

And He did not many mighty works there because of their unbelief [και ουκ εποιησεν εκει δυναμεις πολλας δια την απιστιαν αυτων] . The reason why He did not do many mighty works there is given. It was because of their unbelief. Their unbelief was a moral hindrance to the exercise of His miraculous power. (3)

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "A prophet hath no honour in his own country." - This proverb, often used by Jesus, highlights the lack of recognition and respect that prophets often receive in their own hometown or among their own people. It emphasizes the challenges and difficulties faced by those who are called to speak the truth and deliver God's message.

2. "What is meant by πατριδ?" - The commentator raises an important question about the meaning of "his own country" in this context. While in the Synoptics it refers to Nazareth, where Jesus was rejected, John's intention here may be different. It could refer to Judea or even Galilee, where Jesus had not yet gained the same level of fame as in Judea and Samaria.

3. "He had already explained that Jesus was leaving Judea because he was too popular there." - The commentator points out that Jesus had to leave Judea because of his popularity, which contradicts the idea that "his own country" refers to Judea. This raises further questions about John's intended meaning and the application of the proverb in this specific context.

### John Gill:
1. "A prophet hath no honour in his own country": This verse highlights the lack of recognition and respect that Jesus faced in his hometown of Nazareth. It emphasizes the difficulty for individuals to be acknowledged and appreciated in familiar surroundings.

2. "These words must not be understood as a reason why Christ left Judea, and went into Galilee": The commentary clarifies that Jesus' departure from Judea to Galilee was not solely due to the lack of honor in Judea. It helps to contextualize the verse and prevent misinterpretation.

3. "They treated him with great disrespect and contempt": This phrase reveals the negative reception Jesus received from the people of Nazareth. It underscores the rejection and disregard he faced, adding depth to the understanding of his ministry and the challenges he encountered.

### John Wesley:
1. "This verse reminds us that familiarity can sometimes blind us to the greatness and power of God. The people in Jesus' hometown thought they knew him, but their familiarity prevented them from recognizing his true identity and the authority with which he spoke."

2. "Jesus' response to their lack of faith is a reminder that faith is not automatic or guaranteed. It requires an open heart and a willingness to believe in something beyond what we can see or understand."

3. "This verse challenges us to examine our own hearts and ask ourselves if we have become too familiar with Jesus, too comfortable with our own understanding of him. Are we truly open to the power and authority of God in our lives, or have we become complacent in our faith?"
