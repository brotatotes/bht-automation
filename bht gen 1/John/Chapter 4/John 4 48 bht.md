# John 4:48 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus challenges the Galileans to move beyond mere belief in signs and wonders and to have a deep, genuine faith in him. Despite their persistent unbelief and demand for more miracles, Jesus calls them to trust in his words and teachings without the need for extraordinary signs. The Samaritans, on the other hand, were commended for their faith that went beyond the miraculous, demonstrating that true belief is grounded in a personal relationship with Jesus and an understanding of his character and teachings.
