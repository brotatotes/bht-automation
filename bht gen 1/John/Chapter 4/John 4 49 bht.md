# John 4:49 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse being described portrays a desperate father seeking Jesus' help for his dying son. The father's plea reveals his deep faith in Jesus' healing power and his urgent need for immediate intervention. However, he lacks a complete understanding of Jesus' abilities, thinking that Jesus must physically come to his son to effect the healing, unaware of the possibility of Jesus raising the dead. Jesus responds to the father's faith but also seeks to deepen and correct his understanding, leading to a transformative growth in faith.

1. "While we talk, the case is at its crisis, and if Thou come not instantly, all is over." - This quote highlights the urgency and desperation of the man's plea to Jesus.

### John Calvin:
1. "Since he perseveres in asking, and at length obtains what he wished, we may conclude that Christ did not reprove him in such a manner as if he intended altogether to reject him, and refused his prayers."
2. "In this manner, whatever is improper, or distorted, or superfluous, in our prayers, must be corrected or removed, that dangerous obstructions may be taken out of the way."
3. "It deserves notice, that this man, humbled by his necessitous case, and by the dread of losing his son, does not burst into a passion, or murmur, when Christ speaks to him roughly, but passes by that reproof in modest silence."

### Philip Schaff:
