## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The bringing out and strengthening of the man’s faith by these words was almost as great a spiritual miracle, as the material one which they indicated."
2. "Thus (as Trench observes, after Chrysostom) the weak faith of the nobleman is strengthened, while the humility of the centurion is honoured."
3. "When the sign (║) occurs in a reference, it is signified that the word occurs in the parallel place in the other Gospels, which will always be found indicated at the head of the note on the paragraph."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The man believed the word" - The immediate belief of the man in Jesus' word demonstrates the power of faith and its ability to bring about miraculous healing.
2. "The cure, shooting quicker than lightning from Cana to Capernaum, was felt by the dying youth" - The speed at which the healing took place highlights the instantaneous and powerful nature of Jesus' miracles.
3. "His whole house believed" - The faith of the father not only resulted in the healing of his son but also had a ripple effect, leading to the belief of his entire household. This emphasizes the transformative power of faith and its ability to impact others.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Go thy way - This was a kind and tender address. It was designed to convince him that he could word a miracle though not personally present."
2. "The man believed - The manner in which Jesus spoke it, and the assurance which he gave, convinced the man that he could heal him there as well as to go to Capernaum to do it. This is an instance of the power of Jesus to convince the mind, to soothe doubts, to confirm faith, and to meet our desires."
3. "God will hear our prayers and grant our requests, but often not in the precise manner in which we ask it. It is his to judge of the best way of doing us good."

### John Calvin:
1. "He requested that Christ would come to the place and cure his son. He thought it possible that his son could be freed from sickness and disease, but not that he could be raised up after he was dead; and therefore he urges Christ to make haste, that his son’s recovery may not be prevented by his death."
2. "Thus it frequently happens that our Heavenly Father, while he does not comply with our wishes in every particular, proceeds to relieve us by unexpected methods, that we may learn not to prescribe to him in anything."
3. "The man believed the word which Jesus had spoken to him. Having come with the conviction that Christ was a prophet of God, he was on that account so much disposed to believe, that, as soon as he had heard a single word, he seized it and fixed it in his heart."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Jesus does not need the passionate appeal: the prayer has been already granted."
2. "'Thy son liveth' does not mean, 'is made to live now after thy second petition'; but, 'even while the word is in thy mouth, or before it was so, thy son liveth.'"
3. "The meaning, in short, is not, 'I perform the cure at this instant; but rather, I have performed it, the work is done, thy son is recovered."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Thy son is living," and will not now die, Jesus means. Words too good and gracious to be true.
2. His son is healed without Jesus even going to Capernaum, "absent treatment" so to speak, but without the cure being absent.
3. Instantaneous faith (aorist active indicative), trusted the word (dative case λογω).
4. "Started on his way," acted on his faith.

### John Gill:
1. "Leave it with me, I will take care of it; all will be well."
2. "Do not be solicitous for my presence, or urge me to go with thee; depart alone, there is no necessity for my being upon the spot."
3. "Such power went along with the words of Christ, as not only cured the son at that distance, who lay at the point of death, but also the father of his unbelief."
