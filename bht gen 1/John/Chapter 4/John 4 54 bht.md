# John 4:54 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This is the second miracle that Jesus performed, taking place in Cana of Galilee after he had traveled from Judea. By performing this miracle in Galilee, Jesus demonstrated that His mission extended beyond Judea and was also meant for the Gentiles. This miracle further strengthened the weak faith of the people, leading them to a deep conviction of the personal power and love of Jesus.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "By both, half-belief was strengthened into faith in Him: but in each case it is of a different kind."
2. "The inner kernel of the history is, in our case here, the elevation of a weak and mere wonder-seeking faith into a deep conviction of the personal power and love of our Lord."
3. "And the external point brought out in the commendation, οὐδὲ ἐν τῷ Ἰσραήλ, is not only different from, but stands in absolute contrast with, the depreciating charge here, ἐὰν μὴ σημεῖα καὶ τέρατα ἴδητε, οὐ μὴ πιστεύσητε."

### Philip Schaff:
1) "The two points upon which our attention is fixed seem to be (1) that this miracle was wrought in Galilee; (2) that it was a second miracle there."
2) "The first of these points receives importance from the fact that the ‘sign’ now related was done after Jesus had left ‘His own country,’ rejected by ‘His own’ to be accepted by Galileans."
3) "From the first Jesus showed that His mission was not confined to Judea. It included Galilee, a province representative not of Jews only but of Gentiles, out of which the Jews thought that no prophet could come."
