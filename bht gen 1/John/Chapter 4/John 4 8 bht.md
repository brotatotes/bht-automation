# John 4:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this passage, we witness a captivating interaction between Jesus and a Samaritan woman. As the disciples were away in the city, Jesus took this opportunity to engage with her, demonstrating his humility and dedication to his mission. By asking where his disciples were, Jesus showed that he didn't rely on their presence to carry out his divine purpose. This question also served as an invitation for the woman to open up, paving the way for a deeper conversation about her personal experiences and beliefs.
