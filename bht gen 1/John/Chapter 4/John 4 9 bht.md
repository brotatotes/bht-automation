# John 4:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, a conversation takes place between Jesus and a Samaritan woman. The woman, in her lively and naive disposition, expresses surprise that a Jew like Jesus would ask for a drink from her, a Samaritan woman. There is a deep animosity between Jews and Samaritans due to religious and racial differences. However, Jesus' instruction to his disciples not to have any dealings with Samaritans is not a personal reflection of his feelings towards them, but rather a strategic approach to prioritize spreading the Gospel among their own people first.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1) "There seems to be a sort of playful triumph in the woman’s question, q. d. ‘even a Jew, when weary and athirst, can humble himself to ask drink of a Samaritan woman.’"
2) "The fact is abundantly illustrated in the Rabbinical writings: see Schöttg. h. l."
3) "The question of the woman shews a lively naïve disposition, which is further drawn out and exemplified by Him who knew what is in man, in the following dialogue."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "His dress and dialect would at once discover Him to be, to a Samaritan." 
2. "It is this national antipathy that gives point to the parable of the good Samaritan." 
3. "The thankfulness of the Samaritan leper."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The Samaritans were a group of people who were considered outcasts by the Jews. They were seen as impure and unclean, and there was a deep animosity between the two groups. Jesus' instruction to his disciples not to have any dealings with the Samaritans highlights the social and religious divisions of that time." 

2. "By excluding the Samaritans from their ministry, Jesus was emphasizing the exclusivity of his message to the Jews. He wanted his disciples to focus on spreading the Gospel among their own people before reaching out to others. This shows the strategic approach Jesus took in his ministry, prioritizing the salvation of the Jewish people first." 

3. "However, it is important to note that Jesus' command to avoid the Samaritans was not a reflection of his personal feelings towards them. In fact, we see instances in the Gospels where Jesus interacts with Samaritans and shows compassion towards them. This instruction was more about the specific mission and timing of his disciples' ministry."

### Marvin Vincent:

### Philip Schaff:
1. "It is evident that Jesus was at once recognised as a Jew, probably through some difference of accent, or language, or dress."
2. "We may rather imagine her as hastening to procure what was asked for, whilst not failing to point out how inconsistent with Jewish principles it was to ask even for such a favour as this."
3. "The repetition of the well-known maxim gives a piquant emphasis to her words, bringing out with sharp distinctness the contrast between the principles of the countrymen of Jesus and the request which necessity had extorted."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The Samaritans were a mixture by intermarriage of the Jews left in the land with colonists from Babylon and other regions sent by Shalmaneser."

2. "The reason of this distance and aversion, was religion."
3. "Manasseh, brother to Jaddua the high priest, having married Sanballat's daughter, governor of Samaria, was for it removed from the priesthood; who applying to his father-in-law, he proposed building for him a temple on Mount Gerizim, and making him an high priest; for which he obtained leave of Alexander the Great, and accordingly built one, and made his son-in-law high priest; which drew a great many profligate Jews over to him, who mixing with the Samaritans, set up a worship, religion, and priesthood, in distinction from the Jews; and this was ever after a matter of contention and quarrel between these people."
