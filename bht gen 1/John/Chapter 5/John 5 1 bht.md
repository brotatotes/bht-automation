# John 5:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
On one of the major Jewish feasts, possibly Pentecost, Jesus enters Jerusalem. The omission of the specific feast allows for various interpretations and symbolic meaning. Jesus' presence during the festival presents an opportunity for him to proclaim his doctrine to a vast crowd. His arrival at the temple signifies his role as the true Temple of God. John supplements the Synoptic Gospels, focusing on the spiritual significance of the event rather than specific details. The feast serves as a reminder of the transformative power of the Holy Spirit and the ongoing work in the lives of believers.
