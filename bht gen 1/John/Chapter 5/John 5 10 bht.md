## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "John ever puts forward [the Jews in authority] as the representatives of the whole people in their rejection of the Lord."
2. "The bearing of burdens on the Sabbath was forbidden not only by the glosses of the Pharisees, but by the law itself."
3. "The whole kernel of this incident and discourse is not that it is lawful to do works of mercy on the Sabbath: but that the Son of God is Lord of the Sabbath."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "A glorious testimony to the cure, as instantaneous and complete, from the lips of the most prejudiced!"
2. "In ordinary circumstances, the rulers had the law on their side... But when the man referred them to 'Him that had made him whole' as his authority, the argument was resistless."
3. "Yet they ingeniously parried the thrust, asking him, not who had 'made him whole'... but who had dared to order a breach of the Sabbath?"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Not lawful - It was forbidden, they supposed, in the Old Testament."
2. "The Jews were very strenuous in the observation of the external duties of religion."

These quotes highlight the misconception held by the Jews that it was forbidden to do what Jesus was doing. It shows their strict adherence to the external aspects of religion, rather than understanding the true essence of the law.

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Cured [τεθεραπευμενω]. See on Matthew 8:7; Luke 5:15; Acts 17:25." 
2. "To carry [αραι]. Rev., more correctly, to take up." 
3. "It is Jesus' own word in ver. 8."

### John Calvin:
1. "We are therefore taught by this example to avoid every rash judgment, until the reason of each action be fully known."
2. "Whatever contradicts the word of God deserves to be condemned without hesitation; but, as it frequently happens that there are mistakes in this matter, we ought first to inquire modestly and calmly, that our decision may be sound and sober."
3. "The defense is, that he who had been cured replies that he does nothing but by the command of him who had power and authority to command; for, though he did not yet know who Christ was, yet he was convinced that he had been sent by God, because he had received a proof of his divine power, and learns from it that Christ is endued with authority, so that it must be his duty to obey him."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Were they faithfully carrying out the letter of the law of Moses, or were they enforcing one of those traditions by which they destroyed its spirit? We have no hesitation in adopting the former view." 
2. "The law of Moses forbade any work on that day; and the special enactments in the Pentateuch show how this law was to be interpreted." 
3. "Our Lord’s answer to the Jews makes no reference to their casuistical distinctions or to traditions by which the law was overlaid. It differs altogether in tone and spirit from the reproofs which we read in Luke 13:15; Luke 14:5."

### Archibald T Robertson:
