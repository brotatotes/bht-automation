# John 5:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, a man who was healed by Jesus defends his actions of carrying his bed on the Sabbath. Commentators note that the man's excuse is important because it goes to the heart of the matter and is accepted by others. They explain that since Jesus had the power to heal, he also had the authority to suspend the law and determine what was permissible. Despite not knowing who Jesus was, the man recognized Him as having divine power and therefore worthy to be listened to and obeyed.
