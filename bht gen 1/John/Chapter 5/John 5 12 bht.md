# John 5:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The commentators reveal a malicious intent among the people in this Bible verse, as they focus on the negative aspects and seek to cast doubt and discredit the healing that took place. Instead of acknowledging the miracle, they emphasize what they perceive as a violation of the law. They exhibit a contemptuous attitude and are more concerned with finding fault and scandalizing the situation rather than recognizing the power and mercy of the healing. This passage serves as a reminder of how some individuals are quick to undermine and obscure the work of God due to their hardened hearts.

1. "They take no notice of the cure, being unwilling to give any glory to Christ, and still less to spread it; but chose rather that it should be obscured, hid, and unobserved."
2. "They laid hold on that, which they thought might be improved to his reproach and scandal."
3. "And so the Jews since, though they cannot find fault with the cure, which they put an 'if' upon, yet are highly displeased with the order, to take up his bed and carry it."
