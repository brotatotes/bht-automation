The miracle of healing unfolded in a way that left the man unaware of the identity of his benefactor, highlighting Jesus' humility and the unexpected nature of his miracles.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "He that was healed [ιαθεις] . Compare ver. 10, and note the different word for healing. See references there."
2. "Who it was [τις εστιν] . The present tense, who it is."
3. "Had conveyed Himself away [εξενευσεν] . The verb means, literally, to turn the head aside, in order to avoid something. Hence, generally, to retire or withdraw. Only here in the New Testament."

### John Calvin:
1. "Christ certainly did not intend that the glory of so great a work should pass away, but he intended that it should become generally known before that he acknowledged himself to be the Author of it."
2. "He therefore withdrew for a little, that the Jews might have it in their power to judge of the fact itself, without reference to any person."
3. "And hence we learn that the cure of this man cannot be ascribed to his faith, since, even after having been cured, he does not acknowledge his Physician; and yet, when he was ordered, he carried his bed, which appears to have been done by the guidance of faith."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "We need not wonder that this man, unable to move from place to place, perhaps only recently come to Jerusalem, had no previous knowledge of Jesus."
2. "After his cure, too, he could hear nothing of his benefactor, for, to avoid the recognition and enthusiasm of the multitude, Jesus withdrew, literally ‘slipped aside,’ became suddenly lost to sight."
3. "The conflict between Jesus and the Jews has begun: all His actions deepen their hatred against Him. The ‘multitude,’ on the other hand, is the object of His compassion: from time to time they follow Him eagerly, however slight may be their knowledge of His true teaching and aims."

### Archibald T Robertson:
