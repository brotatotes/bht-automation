# John 5:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, a man obediently informs the authorities about the healing he received, not out of ingratitude or treachery. His intention was to honor Jesus and show gratitude for the miraculous cure. Despite his good intentions, his act of sharing the news leads to opposition and cruelty from the Jews. However, John sees this man's action as part of a divine mission. The suddenness and immediacy of his decision highlight the unexpected and unwelcome reception he receives for testifying to the truth.
