# John 5:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The commentators shed light on a Bible verse where Jesus refers to God as His own Father. They emphasize that this statement reveals Jesus' claim of equality with God, indicating His divine nature and unique relationship with the Father. The vehement response of the Jews further highlights their understanding of Jesus' assertion. The commentators also note that Jesus' consistent violation of Sabbath laws and miracles strengthened the hostility towards Him, culminating in the escalating conflict that ultimately led to His crucifixion.

Note: The commentary provided is quite lengthy, so I had to condense it into three quotes that capture the essence of the author's thoughts.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "He who could thus speak, and who justified His works by the works of God, was calling God His own Father in the highest sense which these words can bear, and was claiming equality with God."
2. "The meaning which we gather from those that stand written before us probably could not be conveyed by spoken words without repetition and enlargement."
3. "From this point onwards we have the conflict that nothing could reconcile, the enmity of the Jews which would not and could not rest until they had compassed the death of Him who had come to save them."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "They sought to kill him" - John repeats this clause multiple times throughout the passage, emphasizing the intense and relentless effort of the religious leaders to put Jesus to death. 

2. "He was now a common and regular Sabbath-breaker" - Jesus' actions of healing on the Sabbath had made him a consistent violator of the religious laws, further fueling the anger and accusations against him. 

3. "Making himself equal with God" - The Jews understood Jesus' claim to be equal with God, as evidenced by their accusation. This claim of equality with the Father was a central point of contention between Jesus and the religious leaders.

### John Gill:
1. "They were the more desirous to take away his life, and were more bent and resolute upon it, and studied all ways and means how to bring it about."
2. "If they had known what that means, that God will have mercy, and not sacrifice, they would have been convinced that he had not broke it by this act of mercy to a poor distressed object."
3. "They rightly understood him, that he asserted his equality with him; for had he intended no more, and had they imagined that he intended no more by calling God his Father, than that he was so by creation, as he is to all men, or by adoption, as he was to the Jews, they would not have been so angry with him."

### John Wesley:
1. "His own Father" - The Greek word emphasizes the unique and intimate relationship between Jesus and God the Father, a relationship that no creature can claim. This highlights the divine nature of Jesus and sets him apart from all others.

2. "Making himself equal with God" - The statement implies that Jesus is claiming equality with God, and this understanding is shared by all who hear him. Jesus does not deny or correct this interpretation, but instead affirms it, further solidifying his divine identity.

3. "Confirmed it" - The fact that Jesus does not contradict or reject the notion of being equal with God serves as evidence that he indeed sees himself as divine. This reinforces the belief that Jesus is not merely a prophet or a teacher, but the Son of God who shares in the same divine nature as the Father.
