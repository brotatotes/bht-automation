# John 5:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Near the Sheep Gate stood a pool, known as Bethesda, or the House of Mercy. This pool was located by the temple in Jerusalem, where sheep and oxen would be brought for sacrifice. It was a place of healing, with its strong curative properties, providing hope and restoration for the sick and infirm. The pool had five porches, where people would find shelter and where the ministry of the word would proclaim God's abundant grace and mercy.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The use of the present tense, there is, may seem to indicate that the pool still remained after the destruction of Jerusalem; unless indeed we adopt the opinion that, as John in all probability committed to writing very early his recollections of his Lord’s discourses and works, an incidental mark of his practice is left us in this verse."
