# John 5:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the commentator mentions the profound love between the Father and the Son, which serves as the foundation for their intimate unity and perfect communion. The Father reveals all things to the Son and works through him, demonstrating their inseparable relationship. This love and fellowship between the Father and the Son result in divine works and miracles that go beyond human comprehension, leading to a sense of wonder and amazement. These greater works signify the redemption and salvation brought about by Christ, surpassing any miracles performed in the past.

Note: The commentary provided is quite lengthy, so I have selected three quotes that I believe provide valuable insights into the different aspects of love discussed in the commentary.

### John Calvin:
1. "What is more, we know that it is by this excellent title that he is distinguished both from angels and from men, This is my beloved Son." 
2. "Christ is loved by the Father, as he is the Head of the Church. He shows that this love is the cause why the Father does all things by his hand." 
3. "By these words he means that the miracle, which he had performed in curing the man, was not the greatest of the works enjoined on him by the Father; for he had only given in it a slight taste of that grace of which he is properly both minister and Author; namely, to restore life to the world."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The principle of the relation between the Father and the Son, out of which this communion springs, is 'love,' an eternal and continuous and infinite love, the source of an eternal and continuous and perfect communion."
2. "The one (Φίλίω) denotes rather the tender emotional affection, that the other (άγαπάω) is never dissociated from intellectual preference, esteem, choice."
3. "The design of these greater works, of this higher and more complete manifestation of Jesus, is 'that ye may marvel.'"

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Sometimes a distinction (John 21:17) is made, but not here, unless φιλεω presents the notion of intimate friendship (φιλος, friend), fellowship, the affectionate side, while αγαπαω (Latin diligo) is more the intelligent choice."
2. "John often uses εργα for the miracles of Christ... It is the Father who does these works (John 14:10). There is more to follow. Even the disciples will surpass what Christ is doing in the extent of the work (John 14:12)."
3. "Wonder belongs to childhood and to men of knowledge. Modern science has increased the occasion for wonder. Clement of Alexandria has a saying of Jesus: 'He that wonders shall reign, and he that reigns shall rest.'"

1. "For the Father loveth the Son,.... As being his Son, his image, the brightness of his glory, and the express image of his person; as being of the same nature, and having the same perfections, and so equal to him."
2. "He drew the plan of peace, reconciliation, and salvation in him; he made the worlds by him; and he does nothing in the government of the world without him."
3. "The redemption of God's people, by Christ, from sin, Satan, the world, the law, death, and hell, the publishing of the Gospel, the effusion of the Spirit, and setting up of the Gospel dispensation, are greater works than these; and more and greater miracles were wrought by Christ than by Moses, or any prophet under the former dispensation."

### John Wesley:
1. "The Father showeth him all things that himself doth — A proof of the most intimate unity."
2. "And he will show him — By doing them. At the same time (not at different times) the Father showeth and doth, and the Son seeth and doth."
3. "Greater works — Jesus oftener terms them works, than signs or wonders, because they were not wonders in his eyes."
4. "Ye will marvel — So they did, when he raised Lazarus."
