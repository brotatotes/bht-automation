## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "It is a kind of hearing which awakens to life, one accompanied by πιστεύειν τῷ πέμψαντί με. And this last is not barely ‘Him who sent Me,’ but Him, the very essence of belief in Whom is in this, THAT HE SENT ME."
2. "The πιστεύων and the ἔχει ζ. αἰ. are commensurate: where the faith is, the possession of eternal life is: and when the one remits, the other is forfeited."
3. "In this sense, the believers in Christ will not be judged according to their works: they are justified before God by faith, and by God θεὸς ὁ δικαιῶν, τίς ὁ κατακρίνων? Their ‘passage over’ from death into life has already taken place, from the state of spiritual death into that ζωὴ αἰώνιος, which in their believing state they ἔχουσι already."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "I have spoken of the Son's right not only to heal the sick but to raise from the dead, and quicken whom He will." 
2. "That life-giving operation has already passed upon all who receive My words as the Sent of the Father on the great errand of mercy." 
3. "What a transition!"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "To 'hear,' in this place, evidently denotes not the outward act of hearing, but to receive in a proper manner; to suffer it to make its proper impression on the mind; to obey."
2. "The belief of one of the true doctrines of religion is connected with, and will lead to, the belief of all."
3. "The Christian lives with God, and feels and acts as if there was a God. Religion, and its blessings here and hereafter, are one and the same."

### John Calvin:
1. "For the doctrine of the Gospel seems as a scepter to Christ, by which he governs believers whom the Father has made his subjects."
2. "But here Christ demands from us no other honor than to obey his Gospel. Hence it follows, that all the honor which hypocrites bestow on Christ is but the kiss of Judas, by which he betrayed his Lord."
3. "By these words he likewise commends the fruit of obedience, that we may be more willing to render it. For who ought to be so hardened as not to submit willingly to Christ, when the reward of eternal life is held out to him?"

### Philip Schaff:

3. "The believer has passed into a state to which judgment does not apply; he has received into himself that word which will at the last day judge all who reject it." - This quote explains that through faith in Christ, believers are exempt from judgment and have received the word that will ultimately judge those who reject it.

These quotes from the commentary provide insights into the significance of hearing and believing in Jesus, the transformative power of His word, and the assurance of eternal life and freedom from judgment for those who have faith in Him.

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Hath eternal life (εχε ζωην αιωνιον). Has now this spiritual life which is endless."
2. "In this passage (John 5:21-29) Jesus speaks now of physical life and death, now of spiritual, and one must notice carefully the quick transition."
3. "But hath passed out of death into life (αλλα μεταβεβηκεν εκ του θανατου εις την ζωην). Perfect active indicative of μεταβαινω, to pass from one place or state to another."

### John Gill:
1. "He that heareth my word; by which is meant the Gospel, and is so called, both because it is spoken by Christ, and first began to be spoken by him; and because he is spoken of in it; his person, office, and work, peace, pardon, righteousness, life, and salvation by him, being the sum and substance of it."
2. "But an internal hearing it is here designed, so as to understand it spiritually, or to have an experimental knowledge of it; so as to approve of it, love, and like it; to distinguish it from that which is not his doctrine, and to feel the power of it on the heart, and yield the obedience of faith unto it."
3. "For such a person that hears the one, and believes on the other, hath everlasting life; not only in the purpose of God, and in the covenant of his grace, and in the hands of Christ, and in faith and hope; but he has a right unto it, and a claim of it, according to the declaration of the Gospel; and besides, has the principle of it in himself, the grace of God, which springs up into, is the beginning of, and issues in eternal life."
