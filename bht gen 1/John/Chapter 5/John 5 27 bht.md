# John 5:27 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Bible verse being described is about Jesus being appointed as the judge of mankind because He became man. This appointment displays divine wisdom and serves as a display of God's power and authority. Jesus, referred to as the Son of Man, possesses the moral right and physical power to execute judgment as the one who understands our weaknesses and has the authority to pronounce doom. As a compassionate and just judge, Jesus imparts life to those who have heard His voice and stands as the ultimate authority in both the present and the final judgment.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "What Christ had properly in view was the indwelling of the Son's essential life in humanity as the great theater and medium of divine display." 
2. "The appointment of a Judge in our own nature is one of the most beautiful arrangements of divine wisdom in redemption." 
3. "The Son of Man signifies not only the humanity of Christ, but also His divine authority and power."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The word 'authority' here implies all that is necessary to execute judgment - all the physical power to raise the dead, and to investigate the actions and thoughts of life; and all the 'moral right' or authority to sit in judgment on the creatures of God, and to pronounce their doom."

2. "He has appointment to 'do justice;' to see that the universe suffers no wrong, either by the escape of the guilty or by the punishment of the innocent."

3. "The phrase 'Son of man' here seems to be used in the sense of 'because he is a man,' or because he has human nature. It is to be remarked here that the word 'son' does not have the article before it in the original: Because he is A son of man - that is, because he is a man."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The authority is assigned to Him as being very man."
2. "John uses the article everywhere with this phrase, except here and Revelation 1:13; Revelation 14:14."
3. "See on Luke 6:22."

### John Calvin:
1. "The Father hath given him dominion, that he may have full power over all things in heaven and in the earth."
2. "He comes forth to men, adorned with such magnificence of power, that he may impart to them what he has received from the Father."
3. "Christ, so far as he is man, was appointed by the Father to be the Author of life, that it may not be necessary for us to go far to seek it; for Christ did not receive it for himself, as if he needed it, but in order to enrich us by his wealth."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The Son ‘maketh to live,’ but He maketh to live ‘whom He will’(John 5:21), or (as we read in John 5:25), He giveth life to those who have heard His voice, and not to all."
2. "The Father who gave to the Son the possession of life gave Him judgment also."
3. "God’s will is to judge the world by ‘a man whom He ordained’ (Acts 17:31); and the verse before us, though comprehending much more than the last judgment, seems, as may be inferred from the peculiarity of the expression ‘execute’ or ‘perform judgment’ (literally ‘do judgment’), and from the presence of this thought in the immediate context (John 5:28-29), to look especially towards the final scene."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Because he is a son of man" - The absence of articles indicates that Jesus is being referred to as a son of man, not specifically as the Messiah. This highlights the idea that the judge of men must partake in human nature himself.

2. "John is here giving his own reflections" - Bernard suggests that John is expressing his own thoughts rather than quoting Jesus directly. However, this interpretation is questionable since the passage appears to present Jesus' own words.

3. "υιον ανθρωπου means 'a son of man'" - In other instances in the Gospels, Jesus uses the phrase "υιος ανθρωπου" to refer to himself. However, in this context, it seems to imply the broader meaning of "a son of man."

### John Gill:
1. "Both in his church and kingdom, in the present state of things, and at the last day, when all shall stand before his judgment seat."
2. "Because he is the son of man; truly and properly man... and therefore the authority of executing judgment, according to the council and covenant of peace, is committed to him."
3. "By whom is meant the Messiah, as the Jews themselves allow, and who was not a mere man, but the man God's fellow; and so being omniscient and omnipotent, was equal to such a work."

### John Wesley:
1. "He is appointed to judge mankind because he was made man."
2. "The fact that Jesus is the Son of man emphasizes his humanity and his identification with humanity."
3. "As the Son of man, Jesus understands our weaknesses and struggles, making him a compassionate and just judge."
