### John Gill:
1. "Marvel not at this,.... Either at the cure of the man that had been diseased thirty and eight years, as some think; or at the Son of God being also the son of man, as the Syriac version suggests; or rather at the dead hearing the voice of the Son of God, and living upon it; and at his having authority to execute judgment upon all, to govern and defend his own church and people, and in the last day acquit them, and to take vengeance on his and their enemies, both now and hereafter."
2. "for the hour is coming, in which all that are in their graves shall hear his voice. This respects the general resurrection; for there will be a resurrection both of the just and unjust, of all that are in their graves; and though all that are dead are not in graves, or interred in the earth, as some are in the sea; yet, because the greater part are in graves, this phrase is chosen to express the universality of the resurrection."
3. "and this is also a proof of the resurrection of the same body; for what else are in the graves but bodies? and what else can come forth from them but the same bodies? and the time is hastening on when these bodies shall be quickened, and hear the voice of the Son of God; which whether the same with the voice of the archangel in 1 Thessalonians 4:16; and whether an articulate voice, or a violent clap of thunder, which is the voice of God, or only the exertion of Christ's mighty power is intended, is not easy to determine, and may be needless to inquire."

### John Wesley:
1. "The time is coming" - This phrase emphasizes the certainty and inevitability of the event being described, indicating that there is no doubt that the predicted event will occur.

2. "Not two or three, but all shall rise" - This statement highlights the universal nature of the resurrection, suggesting that it will not be limited to a select few but will encompass all individuals.

3. "All shall rise" - This phrase underscores the idea that every person will experience resurrection, emphasizing the inclusivity and equality of this event. It suggests that no one will be left out or excluded from this divine act.
