This resurrection is a triumph of God's power and grace, giving hope to those who face trials, knowing that their ultimate victory over death is assured.

3. "The resurrection of damnation - Those who have done evil will be raised up 'to be condemned or damned.' This will be the object in raising them up - this the sole design...
