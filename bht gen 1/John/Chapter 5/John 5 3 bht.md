# John 5:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In a specific location with five porches, there were sick and weak individuals, depicted as emblematic of the spiritually feeble and incapable. These people signified those under the law of works, lacking regeneration, burdened by sin, and powerless to accomplish anything on their own. Furthermore, they represented those in a state of nature, ignorant and blind to spiritual matters, and carnal individuals devoid of grace, faith, hope, love, and knowledge. Their condition was lifeless, helpless, and on the path to ruin.
