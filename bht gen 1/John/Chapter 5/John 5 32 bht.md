# John 5:32 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we find a reference to an additional witness, highlighting the presence and authority of God. The witness being mentioned here is the Father, distinct from John the Baptist, whose testimony is not the sole reliance of Jesus. It is clear that the words spoken by Jesus reflect his deep awareness of his own divine dignity and union with the Father. This witness, coming from the Father, is regarded as unquestionable and stands as a powerful testament to the truth and righteousness of God.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "It cannot be John, from whom our Lord took not his testimony." 
2. "The reason why our Lord mentions John is not ‘as ascending from the lesser witness to the greater,’ but purposely to remove the idea that He meant him only or principally by these words, and to set his testimony in its right place."
3. "This is the Son’s testimony to the Father’s truth: It testifies to the full consciousness on the part of the Son, even in the days of his humiliation, of the righteousness of the Father."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "How brightly the distinction of the Persons shines out here!"
2. "It testifies to the full consciousness on the part of the Son, even in the days of His humiliation, of the righteousness of the Father."
3. "And thus He cheered His spirit under the cloud of human opposition which was already gathering over His head."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "There is another" - This phrase refers to God, emphasizing His existence and presence in the context of the verse.

2. "God" - This word signifies the divine nature and authority, highlighting the ultimate source of power and wisdom.

3. "See John 5:36" - This reference directs readers to another verse in the Bible that further supports the idea of God's involvement and influence in the given context.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Not 'There is another,' as if He would merely cite an additional witness. He would lay the whole stress of the witnessing upon this 'other witness.'" 
2. "This witness is the Father, not John the Baptist, who is mentioned in the next verse only that it may be shown that his testimony is not that on which Jesus relies."
3. "These words are not said in attestation of the Father's truth, a point admitted by all: they are the utterance of the Son's profound consciousness of His own dignity and union with the Father."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The Father, not the Baptist who is mentioned in verse John 5:33."
2. "This continual witness of the Father is mentioned again in verses John 5:36-38 as in John 8:17."
3. "The Father is bearing witness, present active indicative."

### John Gill:
1. "This is indeed the sense of some interpreters; but the Father is particularly mentioned in John 5:37; and the thread of the discourse, and the climax, or gradation, here used, show, that it is to be understood of 'another man', as Nonnus paraphrases it; of John the Baptist, who is spoken of by name in the next verse, as a witness."
2. "John was now alive, though in prison, and continued to bear a testimony to Christ; and therefore he speaks of him as now bearing witness of him, and abiding by that which he had bore."
3. "Christ knew not only that what he testified of him was true in itself, but that his testimony was a valid and authentic testimony, with the generality of the Jews; who held John to be a prophet, and looked upon him as a man of great probity and integrity, and whose word was to be taken."

### John Wesley:
1. "The Father, John 5:37"
2. "I know that, even in your judgment"
3. "his testimony is beyond exception"
