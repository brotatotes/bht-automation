# John 5:34 Commentary Help Text

Jesus, equipped with divine testimony, offers salvation to those who believe in Him. The purpose of such testimonies is to guide individuals towards Christ and His teachings. By recognizing and accepting this higher testimony, one can be led towards salvation and liberation from sin.
