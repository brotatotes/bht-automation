# John 5:35 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Described as a burning and shining light, this individual held a significant role in guiding others and illuminating the truth. With an inner fire and passionate devotion, they exuded a distinct brightness that was not solely derived from themselves. Their light was both transitory and purposeful, serving as a temporary source of intrigue to some who failed to grasp its true significance. However, their true purpose was to bear witness and point others to the ultimate Light - the Son of God.
