# John 5:37 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, Jesus refers to the testimony given by the Father, affirming his identity and mission. This testimony is not limited to a specific event, but can be found throughout the Old Testament Scriptures, inviting deeper reflection and understanding. It aligns with the message and revelation of Jesus as the Word of God. Despite this testimony, many fail to recognize or acknowledge Jesus' true nature, remaining estranged from the knowledge of God. The witness of the Father serves as evidence of Jesus' divine sonship and should be received with utmost importance and validity.
