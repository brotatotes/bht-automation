# John 5:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, a series of miraculous healings take place periodically when the troubled waters are stirred. The cures, performed one patient at a time, unequivocally demonstrate their supernatural nature. The involvement of angels is highlighted, emphasizing their role as instruments of divine assistance. The troubling of the water, though seemingly ordinary, serves as a testimony to God's sovereignty and his power to employ the elements according to his will. Through the preaching of the Gospel, those who come to Christ find healing for their souls, regardless of the afflictions they carry.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "This miracle differed in two points from all other miracles recorded in Scripture: (1) It was not one, but a succession of miracles periodically wrought: (2) As it was only wrought 'when the waters were troubled,' so only upon one patient at a time, and that the patient 'who first stepped in after the troubling of the waters.' But this only the more undeniably fixed its miraculous character."
2. "Any of these peculiarities—much more all taken together—must have proclaimed the supernatural character of the cures wrought."
3. "The want of :- and part of John 5:3 in some good manuscripts, and the use of some unusual words in the passage, are more easily accounted for than the evidence in their favor if they were not originally in the text."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The Jews were in the habit of attributing all favors to the ministry of the angels of God."
2. "There is no more absurdity in the belief that a pure spirit or holy 'angel' should aid man, than that a physician or a parent should."
3. "What man can prove that all his temporal blessings do not come to him through the medium of others - of parents, of teachers, of friends, of 'angels'?"

### John Calvin:
1. "We ought to guard against the foolish speculations of Plato, for the distance between us and God is too great to allow us to go to the angels, that they may obtain favor for us; but, on the contrary, we ought to come direct to Christ, that, by his guidance, protection, and command, we may have the angels as assistants and ministers of our salvation."
2. "But the manner of curing, which is here described, shows plainly enough that nothing is more unreasonable than that men should subject the works of God to their own judgment; for pray, what assistance or relief could be expected from troubled water? But in this manner, by depriving us of our own senses, the Lord accustoms us to the obedience of faith."
3. "Yet the troubling of the water was a manifest proof that God freely uses the elements according to his own pleasure, and that He claims for himself the result of the work. For it is an exceedingly common fault to ascribe to creatures what belongs to God alone; but it would be the height of folly to seek, in the troubled water, the cause of the cure."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "All of this verse is wanting in the oldest and best manuscripts like Aleph B C D W 33 Old Syriac, Coptic versions, Latin Vulgate."
2. "It is undoubtedly added, like the clause in verse John 5:3, to make clearer the statement in verse John 5:7."
3. "The Jews explained the healing virtues of the intermittent spring by the ministry of angels. But the periodicity of such angelic visits makes it difficult to believe."

### John Gill:
1. "This angel may represent a minister of the Gospel, for such are called angels, Revelation 1:20; being called of God, and sent by him, with messages of grace to the sons of men."
2. "The preaching of the Gospel by such, may be aptly signified by the troubling of the waters, as it is by the shaking of heaven, earth, and sea."
3. "Whoever now, upon the preaching of the Gospel, are enabled to step forth and come to Christ, and believe in him, are cured of all their soul maladies and diseases, be they what they will."

### John Wesley:
1. "Yet many undoubtedly thought the whole thing to be purely natural."
2. "God might design this to raise expectation of the acceptable time approaching, to add a greater lustre to his Son's miracles, and to show that his ancient people were not entirely forgotten of him."
3. "The first — Whereas the Son of God healed every day not one only, but whole multitudes that resorted to him."
