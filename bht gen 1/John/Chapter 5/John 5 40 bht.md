# John 5:40 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This verse portrays the tragedy of the rejection of Messiah by the Messianic race, highlighting the stubbornness and resistance of the people towards accepting Jesus as their Savior. Despite having the Scriptures that testify of Christ and point to Him as the way of life, they willfully choose not to come to Him. By refusing to come, they reject the very source of life and salvation, missing out on the opportunity to experience the love, grace, and forgiveness offered by Jesus.
