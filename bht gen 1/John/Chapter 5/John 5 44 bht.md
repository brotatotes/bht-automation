# John 5:44 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse being described emphasizes the importance of believing in the only God and seeking His approval rather than the honor and praise of men. It highlights the inability of the natural human heart to believe in Jesus due to deep-seated rebellion, attachment to human honors, and pride. Divine intervention is necessary for a person to truly believe and submit to the gospel, as it requires a turning away from worldly desires and a recognition of our need for God's approval rather than the praise of men.

### Henry Alford:
1. "The words τοῦ μόνου θεοῦ are very important, because they form the point of passage to the next verses; in which the Jews are accused of not believing the writings of Moses, the very pith and kernel of which was the unity of God, and the having no other gods but Him." 
2. "παρὰ τοῦ μόνου θεοῦ, not 'from God only', but from the only God: in contradistinction to the idolatry of the natural heart, which is ever setting up for itself other sources of honour, worshipping man, or self, or even Satan, instead of God."
3. "πῶς δύνασθε (emphatic) is grounded on οὐ θέλετε is the consequence of the carnal regards in which they lived."
