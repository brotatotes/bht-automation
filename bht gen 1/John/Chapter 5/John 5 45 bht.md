# John 5:45 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, it is made clear that Jesus does not come to condemn nor accuse but to save. However, there is one who accuses, the devil, who seeks to undermine our faith and bring condemnation. The devil distorts the truth, highlights our past sins, and tries to make us doubt our worthiness. Thankfully, Jesus is our advocate, interceding for us before God, defending us from the enemy's accusations. By standing firm in God's Word and declaring His promises, we can resist the devil's tactics and walk in the freedom and victory found in Christ.

### Henry Alford:

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "John uses no other verb for accuse, and this only here, John 8:6, and Revelation 12:10." 
2. "Aijtiaomai occurs once in the compound prohtiasameqa, we before laid to the charge (Romans 3:9). This has reference especially to the ground of accusation [αιτια]." 
3. "In whom ye trust [εις ον υμεις ηλπικατε] . A strong expression. Literally, into whom ye have hoped. Rev., admirably, on whom ye have set your hope."

### John Calvin:
1. "There are few persons, indeed, who openly mock God, but there are very many who, believing that God, whom they oppose as enemies, is gracious to them, amuse themselves at their ease with empty flatteries."
2. "Let us also learn from it, that we ought not to glory in the Scriptures without a good reason; for if we do not honor the Son of God by the true obedience of faith, all whom God hath raised up to be his witnesses will rise up against us as accusers at the last day."
3. "When he says, that they trust in Moses, he does not accuse them of superstition, as if they ascribed to Moses the cause of their salvation; but his meaning is, that they do wrong in relying on the protection of Moses, as if they had him to defend their wicked obstinacy."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Think not" - Prohibition with μη and the present imperative. See on verse John 5:39 for δοκεω for mistaken opinions in John.
2. "I will accuse you" - Emphasis on εγω (I). Future active indicative of κατηγορεω (κατα, against, αγορευω, to speak in the assembly αγορα, to bring an accusation in court, a public accusation). See Romans 3:9 for προαιτιαομα for making previous charge and Luke 16:1 for διαβαλλω, a secret malicious accusation, and Romans 8:33 for εγκαλεω, for public charge, not necessarily before tribunal.
3. "On whom ye have set your hope" - Perfect active indicative of ελπιζω, state of repose in Moses. Only example of ελπιζω in John. See 2 Corinthians 1:10 for use of εις with ελπιζω instead of the usual επ (1 Timothy 4:10).

### John Gill:
1. "Christ is no accuser of men no, not of the worst of men; he came not into the world to bring charges against men and condemn them, but to save them; to be an accuser is not agreeable to his characters of a Surety, a Saviour, an Advocate, and Judge."
2. "There were enough to accuse these persons of; as their perverseness and stubbornness, in not coming to Christ for life; their want of love to God; their rejection of him, though he came in his Father's name; their reception of another, that should come in his own name; their taking honour one of another, and not seeking the true spiritual and eternal honour, which God gives."
3. "However, there was no need for Christ to accuse them; for as it follows, there is one that accuseth you, even Moses, in whom ye trust; by whom is meant, not Moses personally; but either the writings of Moses, or the doctrine of Moses, or rather the law of Moses."

### John Wesley:
1. "The one who accuses you refers to the devil, who is known as the accuser of the brethren. He uses his cunning and deceitful tactics to bring false accusations against believers, seeking to undermine their faith and cause them to doubt their standing with God."

2. "The devil accuses believers by distorting the truth and highlighting their past sins and failures. He seeks to bring condemnation and shame upon them, making them feel unworthy of God's love and forgiveness."

3. "However, as believers, we can take comfort in the fact that Jesus Christ is our advocate. He stands before the Father on our behalf, interceding for us and defending us against the accusations of the enemy. Through Christ, we have the assurance of our righteousness and forgiveness."

4. "It is important for believers to be aware of the enemy's tactics and to stand firm in the truth of God's Word. By knowing and declaring the promises of God, we can resist the accusations of the devil and walk in the freedom and victory that Christ has won for us."
