# John 5:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we see Jesus approaching a man who has been lying by a pool, in need of healing. Jesus, with his divine knowledge, singles him out and asks, "Wilt thou be made whole?" His question is not out of doubt, but to ignite in the man a desire for the grace that Jesus offers. Furthermore, this inquiry serves to capture the attention of the witnesses and instill hope in the man's heart. Through the use of supernatural knowledge and compassionate inquiry, Jesus establishes a connection between the man's spirit and his own gracious purposes.
