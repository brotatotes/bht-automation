# John 6:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, Jesus is depicted as crossing the sea of Galilee, also known as the lake of Gennesaret or Tiberias. This journey holds significance as it marks a departure from the chaos and challenges of the world. Jesus's call to his disciples to leave behind the familiar and comfortable and embrace the unknown reflects the symbolic power of the sea. It also serves as a reminder that following Jesus requires trust in God's plan and a willingness to leave our comfort zones, even in the face of obstacles and distractions.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The fragmentary character of this Gospel as relates to mere narration."
2. "The last appellation is probably inserted for the sake of Gentile readers."
3. "We must not adopt the reading of [88] &c., εἰς τὰ μέρη τ . Τιβ ., for the fact was just otherwise."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Jesus went over - Went to the east side of the sea." 
2. "The place to which he went was Bethsaida." 
3. "John has added a few circumstances omitted by the other evangelists."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The sea is a powerful symbol in the Bible, representing chaos, unpredictability, and the unknown. In Matthew 4:18, the sea serves as a backdrop for Jesus calling his disciples to follow him. This signifies that Jesus is calling them to leave behind the familiar and comfortable, and step into the unknown and uncertain."

2. "The sea also represents the challenges and obstacles that we face in our spiritual journey. Just as the disciples had to navigate the rough waters of the sea to follow Jesus, we too must be willing to face the storms of life and trust in God's guidance."

3. "In this verse, the sea can be seen as a metaphor for the world and its distractions. Jesus calls his disciples away from the busyness and distractions of their daily lives, inviting them to focus on a higher purpose and to follow him wholeheartedly."

4. "The sea in Matthew 4:18 reminds us that following Jesus requires a willingness to leave behind our comfort zones and embrace the unknown. It is a call to trust in God's plan and to have faith that He will guide us through the storms of life."

### John Calvin:
1. "The other Evangelists (Matthew 14:13; Mark 6:32; Luke 9:10) state that this happened shortly after the death of John the Baptist, by which circumstance of time they point out the cause of Christ’s departure; for when tyrants have once imbrued their hands in the blood of the godly, they kindle into greater cruelty, in the same manner as intemperate drinking aggravates the thirst of drunkards."
2. "Christ therefore intended to abate the rage of Herod by his absence."
3. "He uses the term, Sea of Galilee, as meaning the lake of Gennesareth. When he adds that it was called the Sea of Tiberias, he explains more fully the place to which Christ withdrew; for the whole lake did not bear that name, but only that part of it which lay contiguous to the bank on which Tiberias was situated."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The three Evangelists seem to have been led rather to give a full description of certain parts than an outline of the whole of our Lord’s ministry in Galilee." 
2. "John’s omission of all that happened during our Lord’s sojourn in Galilee until the point to which this verse relates is in accord with the general structure of his Gospel." 
3. "Nothing can more strikingly illustrate the twofold character of our Lord’s teaching, as addressed to ‘the Jews’ and the doctors of the law on the one hand and to the multitudes of Galilee on the other, than a comparison of the discourse in Jerusalem which we have just considered with the Sermon and the Parables spoken but a few days later."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The phrase does not mean immediate sequence of events. As a matter of fact, a whole year may intervene between the events of chapter 5 in Jerusalem and those in chapter 6 in Galilee."
2. "The feeding of the five thousand is the only event before the last visit to Jerusalem recorded in all Four Gospels."
3. "Luke explains that it was the eastern Bethsaida (Julias) to which Jesus took the disciples, not the western Bethsaida of Mark 6:45 in Galilee."

### John Gill:
1. "After these things, in process of time, Jesus went over the sea of Galilee; the same with the lake of Gennesaret, Luke 5:1; which is [the sea] of Tiberias." 
2. "And these are the waters which the Jews call דימוסין דטבריא, or, חמי, the hot baths of Tiberias." 
3. "The sea took its name from the city of Tiberias built by Herod, and called so in honour of Tiberius Caesar."
