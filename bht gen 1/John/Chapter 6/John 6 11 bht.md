## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "John describes the διάδοσις as being the act of the Lord Himself, and leaves the intervention of the disciples to be understood."
2. "εὐχαριστήσας here answers to εὐλόγησεν in the other Gospels. It was the ‘ grace ’ of the father of the family; perhaps the ordinary one in use among the Jews."

### Marvin Vincent:

2. "Perhaps he used the familiar formula, 'Blessed art thou Jehovah our God, King of the world, who causes to come forth bread from the earth.'"

1. "The Synoptics use 'blessed' ευλογησεν (Mark 6:41; Matthew 14:19; Luke 9:16)."
