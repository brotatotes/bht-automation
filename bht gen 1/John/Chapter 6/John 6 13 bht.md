# John 6:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse being described is a detailed account found in the book of John. The emphasis is on the identity and significance of the fragments of bread that were left over after the miraculous feeding of the multitude. The abundance of food and the gathering of the fragments symbolize the blessings of God and the importance of frugality. The use of specific terms like "stout wicker baskets" and "soft and frail σφυριδες" highlight the meticulous attention to detail in John's narrative and the uniqueness of this verse in the New Testament.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Marvin Vincent:
1. "John goes into fuller detail than the Synoptists."
2. "A detail peculiar to John, emphasizing the identity of the fragments with the original loaves."
3. "Unto them that had eaten (bebrwkosin). Only here in the New Testament."

### John Calvin:
1. "Since, therefore, a smaller quantity is sufficient for a greater number of men, and since the quantity left is nearly double, hence we see more clearly of what value is that blessing of God, against the sight of which we deliberately shut our eyes."
2. "We ought also to observe, in passing, that though Christ commands them to fill the baskets for illustrating the miracle, yet he likewise exhorts his disciples to frugality, when he says, Gather the fragments which are left, that nothing may be lost."
3. "Let those, therefore, who have abundance, remember that they will one day render an account of their immoderate wealth, if they do not carefully and faithfully apply their superfluity to purposes which are good, and of which God approves."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The repetition of the words, ‘the five barley loaves,’ is remarkable; the writer wishes to lay emphasis on the identity of the fragments with the loaves of the original supply."
2. "Nor is it fanciful to see in this a token that what was symbolized by the precious bread was destined for each tribe of Israel."
3. "John’s agreement with the other Evangelists in so minute a point as the use of cophinus in connection with this miracle is interesting and important."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Stout wicker baskets (coffins, Wycliff) in distinction from the soft and frail σφυριδες used at the feeding of the four thousand."
2. "The same distinction between κοφινο and σφυριδες is preserved in the allusion to the incidents by Jesus."
3. "Unto them that had eaten (τοις βεβρωκοσιν). Articular perfect active participle (dative case) of βιβρωσκω, old verb to eat, only here in N.T., though often in LXX."

### John Gill:
1. "The several broken bits of bread, which lay about upon the grass, which the people had left, after they had been sufficiently refreshed."
2. "Every disciple had a basket filled: with the fragments of the five barley loaves; and it may be of the fishes also."
3. "Such a marvellous increase was there, through the power of Christ going along with them; insomuch that they multiplied to such a degree, either in the hands of the distributors, or of the eaters."
