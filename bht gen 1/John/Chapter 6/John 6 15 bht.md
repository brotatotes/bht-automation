# John 6:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the people are eager to take Jesus with them and proclaim Him as the king of the Jews in Jerusalem. However, their understanding of the Messiah is misguided, as they expect a temporal prince rather than the humble and solitary leader that Jesus truly is. Jesus, being aware of their intentions, retreats to a mountain alone to seek solitude and communion with God. This episode serves as a reminder for believers to prioritize moments of solitude and prayer in their own lives, seeking guidance and strength from God in quiet reflection.
