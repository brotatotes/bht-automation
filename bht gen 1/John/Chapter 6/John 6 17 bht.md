## BHT:
As night fell and the sea grew stormy, the disciples found themselves waiting for Jesus, feeling both anticipation and danger.

Despite their obedience and expectation, Jesus had not yet joined them, leaving them to navigate the challenges and uncertainties without His presence. The tenses used in these verses vividly capture this sense of waiting, darkness, and the longing for Jesus' arrival.
