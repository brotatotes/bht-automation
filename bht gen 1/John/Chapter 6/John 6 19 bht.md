# John 6:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, the disciples find themselves in a storm on a boat, struggling against the wind and waves. Rowing without success, they are filled with fear and confusion as they observe Jesus approaching on the water. Their initial fear stems from mistaking him for a spirit, but as they listen to his voice, their terror eases and they are filled with knowledge, joy, and peace. Through their rowing efforts and keen observation, the disciples witness a miraculous encounter with Jesus, who intentionally draws near to them in the midst of the storm.
