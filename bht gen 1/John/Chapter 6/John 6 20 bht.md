# John 6:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, Jesus appears to His disciples in a moment of fear and uncertainty. His presence dispels their fears, as He reassures them with the words "It is I; be not afraid." This statement not only comforts and encourages the disciples, but it also reminds them of Jesus' divine identity and power. Jesus' command to "be not afraid" serves as a powerful reminder to the disciples, and to us, that fear is not from God and that we can find peace and courage in Him.

1. "It is I; be not afraid." - This statement from Jesus reassures his disciples that he is present with them, dispelling their fear and instilling a sense of comfort and security.

### John Calvin:
1. "We learn from them that it is in Christâ€™s presence alone that we have abundant grounds of confidence, so as to be calm and at ease."
2. "Believers, who know that he is given to them to make propitiation, as soon as they hear his name, which is a sure pledge to them both of the love of God and of their salvation, take courage as if they had been raised from death to life."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Be not afraid." - This phrase is a prohibition, urging the disciples to not give in to fear. It emphasizes the need for trust and faith in Jesus, even in the face of uncertainty or danger.

2. "John does not tell that the disciples thought Jesus was an apparition." - Unlike the accounts in Mark and Matthew, John's Gospel does not mention the disciples mistaking Jesus for a ghost. This omission highlights John's focus on the divinity and power of Jesus, rather than the disciples' initial confusion.

3. "Nor does he give the account of Peter walking on the water." - John's Gospel also does not include the well-known story of Peter walking on water. This omission suggests that John's purpose is not to recount every detail of the event, but rather to emphasize the miraculous nature of Jesus' presence and the disciples' response to it.

1. "These words of Jesus remind us that in the midst of our fears and anxieties, He is present with us and offers us comfort and reassurance."
