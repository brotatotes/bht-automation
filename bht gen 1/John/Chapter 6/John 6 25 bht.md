# John 6:25 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
On the other side of the sea, Jesus left the multitude astonished and puzzled as to how He had crossed over. Capernaum, located on the western coast, was the destination He secretly reached. The people marveled, not only by the timing of His arrival but also the mode of His transportation, as the journey by land was long and indirect. Although the question of how He arrived was left unanswered, their eager search for Him opened the way for deeper instruction about the miracle that had drawn them to follow Him.
