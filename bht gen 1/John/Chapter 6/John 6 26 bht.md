# John 6:26 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The people sought after Jesus, not because they recognized the significance of his miracles or truly desired him, but rather out of a selfish desire for physical satisfaction. Jesus used this moment to redirect their focus from the earthly provision of bread to the spiritual sustenance he offers as the Bread of Life. Through profound discourse and rebuke, Jesus challenged their shallow motives and urged them to seek a deeper understanding of his mission and the eternal salvation he provides. He sought to transform their curiosity into sincere faith and commitment.

1. "The seeking Him, on the part of these people, to Him, who saw the hearts, was merely a low desire to profit by His wonderful works, not a reasonable consequence of deduction from His miracles that He was the Saviour of the world."
