2. "the perpetuity of the manna floating perhaps in their minds" - This quote suggests that the disciples may have been thinking about the lasting provision of manna in the wilderness when they asked for this bread. It highlights their understanding of the need for sustenance that endures.

3. "much like the Samaritan woman, when her eyes were but half opened, 'Sir, give Me this water'" - This quote draws a parallel between the disciples' request for bread and the Samaritan woman's request for living water.

### John Calvin:
1. "They speak ironically, to accuse Christ of vain boasting, when he said that he was able to give the bread of life."
2. "Wretched men, while they reject the promises of God, are not satisfied with this evil alone, but put Christ in their room, as if he were chargeable with their unbelief."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Jesus said unto them, I am the bread of life, the bread, that is, that contains life in itself, and thus is able to give life unto the world." 
2. "He that is coming to me shall in no wise hunger. The original words are chosen with exquisite delicacy...the ‘true bread,’ that which gives real sustenance, is received."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Lord (Κυριε). Used now instead of Rabbi (25) though how much the people meant by it is not clear."
2. "Evermore give us this bread (παντοτε δος ημιν τον αρτον τουτον). Second aorist active imperative second singular like δος in Matthew 6:11 (urgent petition)."
3. "Like the woman at the well (John 4:15) they long 'always' to have 'this bread,' a perpetual supply."

### John Gill:
1. "These words are said by them either seriously, and to be understood of bread for their bodies, of which they imagined Christ was speaking; and so sprung from ignorance of his sense; and from sensuality in them who followed him for the loaves; and from a covetous disposition, being desirous of being supplied with such excellent food without charge; and from idleness, to save labour and pains in working for it; and from a vain desire of the continuance of this earthly life, being willing to live for ever, and therefore would have this bread evermore; and from a gross opinion of plenty and delicacy of corporeal food in the times of the Messiah."
2. "However, the words may be improved, when considered as a petition coming from, and suitable to, a sensible and enlightened soul: for such who are sensible of their famishing condition by nature, and of their need of Christ, the bread of life, and whose taste is changed, and have tasted how good this bread is, will earnestly desire always to be supplied with it, and to live upon it; for nothing is more grateful to them, and more nourishing and satisfying to their souls; they are never weary of it; it is always new and delightful to them, and they always stand in need of it, and wait in the use of means and ordinances for it; and this has always an abiding, lasting, virtue in it, to feed their souls, and nourish them up to everlasting life."
3. "And to this agrees what is said in the apocryphal book of Wisdom, 16:20,21: 'Thou feddest thine own people with angels' food, and didst send them from heaven bread, prepared without their labour, able to content every man's delight, and agreeing to every taste; for thy sustenance (or manna) declared thy sweetness unto thy children, and serving to the appetite of the eater, tempered itself to every man's liking.' All which must be understood of that pleasure, satisfaction, and contentment which they had in it; for it was a very uncommon case to eat it, and live upon it as their common food for forty years together."

### John Wesley:
1. "Give us this bread" - The disciples' request for bread is a plea for sustenance, both physical and spiritual. It reflects their growing recognition of Jesus as the source of nourishment for their lives.

2. "Meaning it still, in a literal sense" - The disciples initially understand Jesus' statement about bread in a literal sense, focusing on their immediate physical needs. This highlights their limited understanding of the deeper spiritual meaning behind Jesus' words.

3. "Yet they seem now to be not far from believing" - Despite their initial misunderstanding, the disciples' request for bread indicates a growing openness to Jesus' teachings. They are beginning to grasp the idea that Jesus has something more profound to offer them, and they are on the verge of embracing a deeper faith.
