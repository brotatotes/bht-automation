# John 6:41 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, Jesus addresses a group of disapproving Jews who murmur amongst themselves due to their lack of understanding and resistance to His words. The scene remains unchanged, and the murmuring is directed towards Jesus Himself, as the Jews grow uneasy and displeased with His claim to be the bread that came down from heaven. Their murmuring reveals their failure to perceive the profound meaning and glory behind His words, leading to a missed opportunity to grasp the boundless love and grace demonstrated in His self-emptying and servanthood.
