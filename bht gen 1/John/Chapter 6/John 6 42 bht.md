## BHT:
This verse describes the confusion and skepticism of Jesus' contemporaries as they question his origin and claim of coming from heaven. They mock his parentage, not understanding his divine lineage and the significance of his birth. Despite their lack of knowledge about his miraculous conception and divine sonship, they fail to comprehend the profound nature of Jesus' claim and his heavenly mission. Their doubts and ignorance demonstrate the challenge in comprehending Jesus' true identity and purpose on earth.

2. "Meyer gathers from the οἴδαμεν, that our Lord’s reputed father was then still alive."
3. "But surely the verb will bear the sense of knowing as a matter of fact who they were, and need not be confined to personal knowledge."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The recognition of Joseph as the father of Jesus is not to be understood as implying that Joseph was still alive, but rather as a recognition of the role he played in Jesus' life."

2. "They suggest that it was great arrogance in him to claim a heavenly origin, and to ascribe such things to himself, that he was the bread of God, and the bread of life, and came from heaven."
3. "They could not tell how to reconcile these things, not knowing either his miraculous conception and incarnation, nor his divine sonship; otherwise his being made of a woman, or born of a virgin on earth, is consistent with his being the Lord from heaven."
