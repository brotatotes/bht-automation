# John 6:44 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, it is explained that the understanding and belief in Christ is not purely a human endeavor, but rather requires the divine intervention of God's drawing. The act of drawing is not forceful, but rather a gentle and inviting movement of God's grace that can still be resisted by human will. God initiates this process by implanting within individuals good desires and inclinations towards Him, sparking the longing to seek and believe in Christ.
