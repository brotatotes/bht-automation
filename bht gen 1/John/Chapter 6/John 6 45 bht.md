## Choicest Commentary Quotes:

2. "The beginning is, the Father draws him: the progress, he hears and learns here is the consenting will 'Speak, Lord, for thy servant heareth:'"
3. "The end, he cometh to Christ here is the will acting on the whole man."

3. "Every man therefore, who hath been thus efficaciously taught of Him, cometh unto me."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Shall be all taught of God - This explains the preceding verse. It is by the teaching of his Word and Spirit that men are drawn to God." 

2. "This shows that it is not compulsory, and that there is no obstacle in the way but a strong voluntary ignorance and unwillingness." 

3. "It is probable that Jesus had reference only to the place in Isaiah, as this was the usual way of quoting the prophets."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Taught of God" refers to those who have received divine instruction and guidance in their lives. It implies a personal and intimate relationship with God, where He imparts wisdom and understanding to His followers.

2. The compound adjective "qeodidaktoi" emphasizes that the teaching comes directly from God Himself. It highlights the authority and reliability of the instruction received, as it originates from the divine source.

3. This phrase suggests that believers who are "taught of God" have a unique understanding of spiritual truths and are able to discern God's will in their lives. It signifies a deeper level of knowledge and insight that sets them apart from those who rely solely on human wisdom or learning.

### John Calvin:
1. "The passage which is here quoted is to be found in Isaiah 54:13, where, speaking of the restoration of the Church, he promises to her, sons taught by the instruction of God. Hence it may easily be inferred, that the Church cannot be restored in any other way than by God undertaking the office of a Teacher, and bringing believers to himself."
2. "The way of teaching, of which the prophet speaks, does not consist merely in the external voice, but likewise in the secret operation of the Holy Spirit. In short, this teaching of God is the inward illumination of the heart."
3. "For if it be only when the Father has drawn us that we begin to come to Christ, there is not in us any commencement of faith, or any preparation for it. On the other hand, if all come whom the Father hath taught, He gives to them not only the choice of believing, but faith itself."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The use of the plural ‘prophets’ has been thought to prove that the reference does not belong to any one passage; and we may certainly say that an inclusive expression like this may have been used designedly, as implying that there are many such promises, and that this tone of promise is characteristic of the book of the Prophets."
2. "The truth of that verse is set in a new light, presented on its human rather than on its Divine side. The ‘drawing’ is a ‘teaching:’ he that hath been drawn by the Father, is he that hath truly received the teaching of the Father."
3. "Not one allows us to think of compulsion or the forcing of man’s will: all with one voice give glory to the Father as the source of every impulse towards the light and the life."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "It is not enough to hear God's voice. He must heed it and learn it and do it."
2. "This is a voluntary response."
3. "This one inevitably comes to Christ."

### John Gill:
1. "All that are ordained to eternal life; all that are given to Christ, and are chosen in him; all the children of Zion, and who are the children of God; these are all, sooner or later, in a special manner, taught of God."
2. "This is to be understood of their being taught in the Gospel of Christ, and not in the law."
3. "Every man, whether a Jew or a Gentile, that is taught of God, will come to him in a spiritual way, and trust in him for eternal life and happiness."

### John Wesley:
1. "The secret voice of God" refers to the personal and intimate communication between God and an individual. It is a divine revelation that is not audible to others, but only to the one who truly listens with an open heart and mind.

2. "He, and he only believeth" emphasizes the exclusivity of this belief. It is not a superficial or intellectual acceptance of God's existence, but a deep and genuine trust in His words and promises. It is a faith that goes beyond mere knowledge and transforms one's entire being.

3. Isaiah 54:13 reminds us that true faith is not based on external factors or the opinions of others. It is a personal encounter with God that leads to a profound conviction and unwavering trust in His guidance and wisdom. It is a reminder that faith is a gift from God, and those who truly hear His voice are blessed with the ability to believe.
