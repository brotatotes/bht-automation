### Henry Alford:
1. "The Bread of Life is Himself: and, strictly treated, when we come to enquire what, of that body, soul, and spirit, which constituted Himself, this Bread specifically is, we have His answer that it is His Flesh which He will give on behalf of the life of the world." 
2. "The flesh here, and the eating of the flesh, are distinct from the blood, and the drinking of the blood. It is then only through or after the Death of the Lord, that by any propriety of language, His Flesh could be said to be eaten."
3. "But this Bread is living Bread; not dead flesh, but living Flesh. And therefore manducation by the teeth materially is not to be thought of here; but some kind of eating by which the living Flesh of the Son of God is made the living sustenance of those who partake of it."

This connection deepens the understanding of the significance of Jesus' words.
