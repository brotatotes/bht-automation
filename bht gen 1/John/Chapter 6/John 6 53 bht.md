## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "But observe, this Blood is not to be eaten in the Flesh, which was the forbidden thing...but to be drunk, separate from the flesh: again presupposing death." 
2. "To eat the flesh of Christ, is to realize, in our inward life, the mystery of His Body now in heaven, to digest and assimilate our own portion in that Body."
3. "To drink His Blood, is to realize, in our inward life, the mystery of His satisfaction for sin, to digest and assimilate our own portion in that satisfaction, the outpouring of that Blood."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "He says they must not only 'eat His flesh' but 'drink His blood,' which could not but suggest the idea of His death—implied in the separation of one's flesh from his blood."
2. "And as He had already hinted that it was to be something very different from a natural death, saying, 'My flesh I will give for the life of the world' (John 6:51), it must have been pretty plain to candid hearers that He meant something above the gross idea which the bare terms expressed."
3. "The truth really conveyed here is no other than that expressed in John 6:51- :, though in more emphatic terms—that He Himself, in the virtue of His sacrificial death, is the spiritual and eternal life of men; and that unless men voluntarily appropriate to themselves this death, in its sacrificial virtue, so as to become the very life and nourishment of their inner man, they have no spiritual and eternal life at all."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Eat the flesh. Appropriate the life." 
2. "Drink His blood. Appropriate the saving merit of His death." 
3. "All true life must be in Christ."

### John Calvin:
1. "The vengeance that awaits all despisers of the grace of Christ is, that with their pride they miserably perish; and the reason why they must be urged with plainness and severity is, that they may not continue to flatter themselves."
2. "Despise me as much as you please, on account of the mean and despicable appearance of my flesh, still that despicable flesh contains life; and if you are destitute of it, you will nowhere else find anything else to quicken you."
3. "The ancients fell into a gross error by supposing that little children were deprived of eternal life if they did not dispense to them the eucharist, that is, the Lord’s Supper; for this discourse does not relate to the Lord’s Supper, but to the uninterrupted communication of the flesh of Christ, which we obtain apart from the use of the Lord’s Supper."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The only possible meaning is the spiritual appropriation of Jesus Christ by faith... Life is found only in Christ." 

2. "Jesus repeats the statement in verses John 6:50; John 6:51. Note change of μου (my) in verse John 6:51 to του υιου του ανθρωπου with same idea." 

3. "This addition makes the demand of Jesus seem to these Jews more impossible than before if taken in a baldly literal sense."

### John Gill:
1. "The 'flesh' and 'blood' of Christ do not design those distinct parts of his body; much less as separate from each other; nor the whole body of Christ, but his whole human nature; or Christ, as having united a perfect human nature to him, in order to shed his blood for the remission of sin, and to offer up his soul and body a sacrifice for it."
2. "To eat the flesh, and drink the blood of Christ, is to believe that Christ is come in the flesh, and is truly and really man; that his flesh is given for the life of his people, and his blood is shed for their sins, and this with some view and application to themselves."
3. "Without this there, is no evidence of life in them not such live as feed on sinful pleasures, or on their own righteousness; only such that believe in Christ are living souls; and without this there is nothing to support life; everything else that a man eats tends to death; but this is what will maintain and preserve a spiritual life."

### John Wesley:
1. "Eating his flesh is only another expression for believing."
2. "Drawing continual virtue from him by faith."
3. "Unless ye draw continual virtue from him by faith."
