# John 6:54 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, believers partake of Christ, receiving spiritual sustenance and eternal life through faith. This eternal life is both present and future, with a connection to resurrection. The imagery of eating Christ's flesh and drinking His blood conveys the spiritual appropriation of His sacrifice. This communion, understood through faith, assures believers of their right and readiness to receive the eternal life promised by Jesus. Through faith, believers find abiding and permanent grace that sustains them.
