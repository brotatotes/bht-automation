### Marvin Vincent:
1. "To prove [πειραζων]. This word carries the idea of testing or proving something. It implies a deliberate attempt to see if something or someone is genuine or reliable."
2. "Literally, proving. This emphasizes the intention behind the action of testing. It suggests that there is a purpose behind the temptation, perhaps to reveal the true character or strength of the person being tested."
3. "Wyc., tempting. The Wycliffe Bible translation uses the word 'tempting' instead of 'proving.' This highlights the potential negative connotation of the word, suggesting that the temptation may be intended to lead someone astray or into sin."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The mention of the circumstance may be only the graphic touch of an eye-witness, and there may be nothing important in the Master’s choice of the disciple whose faith He is to try."
2. "Philip may have had something to do with making provision for the wants of the company of disciples."

### John Gill:
1. "And this he said to prove him,.... Or 'tempting him', trying his faith, and not only his, but the rest of the disciples; not as ignorant of it himself, but in order to discover it to him and them, and to prepare them for the following miracle; and that it might appear the more illustrious and marvellous."

2. "For he himself knew what he would do; Christ had determined to work a miracle, and feed the large number of people that were with him, with that small provision they had among them; and being God omniscient, he knew that he was able to do it, and that he was determined to do it, and it would be done."

3. "But he was willing first to try the faith of his apostles."
