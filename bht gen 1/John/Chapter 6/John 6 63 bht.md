# John 6:63 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse in question emphasizes the importance of the spiritual meaning of Jesus' words, rather than a literal interpretation. The commentators highlight that the flesh alone, devoid of the Spirit, is of no value and cannot impart life. Instead, the focus is on the spiritual nature of Christ's teachings, which have the power to nourish and quicken the soul. The words of Jesus are described as the means through which God imparts life, and they are characterized as both spiritual and life-giving.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Such eating of My flesh as you imagine and find hard to listen to, could profit you nothing, for it will have ascended up, &c. and besides, generally, it is only the Spirit that can vivify the spirit of man: the flesh (in whatever way used) can profit nothing towards this."
2. "He does not say 'My Flesh profiteth nothing,' but 'the flesh.' To make Him say this, as the Swiss anti-sacramentalists do, is to make Him contradict His own words in John 6:51."
3. "They are πνεῦμα and ζωή: spirit, not flesh only: living food, not carnal and perishable. This meaning has been missed by almost all Commentators: Stier upholds it, iv. 281 (2nd edn.): and it seems to me beyond question the right one."

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Flesh as such, mere flesh, could profit nothing, much less impart that life which the Holy Spirit alone communicates to the soul."
2. "The whole burden of the discourse is 'spirit,' not mere flesh, and 'life' in its highest, not its lowest sense."
3. "The words I have employed are to be interpreted solely in that sense."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "My doctrine is spiritual; it is fitted to quicken and nourish the soul. It is from heaven."
2. "Your doctrine or your views are earthly, and may be called flesh, or fleshly, as pertaining only to the support of the body."
3. "They are not to be understood literally, as if you were really to eat my flesh, but they are to be understood as denoting the need of that provision for the soul which God has made by my coming into the world."

### John Calvin:
1. "The flesh profiteth nothing...if it be separated from the Spirit, it will then be useless." 
2. "Whoever confines his whole attention to the earthly nature of the flesh, will find in it nothing but what is dead; but they who shall raise their eyes to the power of the Spirit, which is diffused over the flesh, will learn from the actual effect and from the experience of faith, that it is not without reason that it is called quickening." 
3. "The words which I speak to you...are spiritual...because it calls us upwards to seek Christ in his heavenly glory, through the guidance of the Spirit, by faith, and not by our carnal perception."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Jesus has spoken of ‘giving life,’ of the ‘eating of His flesh,’ as the means of gaining eternal life. In all this He has not the flesh but the spirit in view, not the material reception of the flesh by the flesh but the appropriation of His spirit by the spirit of man." 

2. "The emphasis which Jesus here and elsewhere lays upon His sayings is very remarkable. He is the Word, the expression of the Father’s nature and will; His sayings are to man the expression of Himself."

2. "Never man spoke like Jesus."

2. "It is spiritual eating, or eating the flesh, and drinking the blood of Christ in a spiritual sense, which quickens, refreshes, and comforts the minds of believers."
3. "The Gospel, and the truths of it, which are the wholesome words of our Lord Jesus Christ, are the means of conveying the Spirit of God, as a spirit of illumination and sanctification, into the hearts of men, and of quickening sinners dead in trespasses and sins."

1. "It is the Spirit — The spiritual meaning of these words, by which God giveth life."

3. "The words which I have spoken, they are spirit — Are to be taken in a spiritual sense and, when they are so understood, they are life."
