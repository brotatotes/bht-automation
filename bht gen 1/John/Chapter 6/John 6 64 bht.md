### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The word 'betray' in this verse is the Greek word 'παραδωσων' which can also be translated as 'hand over' or 'deliver'. This emphasizes the intentional and deliberate act of Judas in betraying Jesus." 

2. "The use of the term 'traitor' to describe Judas in Luke 6:16 further highlights the magnitude of his betrayal. It signifies that his actions were not merely a mistake or a momentary lapse of judgment, but a conscious act of treachery." 

3. "The parallel references to betrayal in Matthew 4:12 and Mark 4:29 provide additional context to understand the significance of Judas' actions. It suggests that his betrayal was part of a larger plan or purpose, rather than a random act of betrayal."

### John Calvin:
1. "For otherwise they might have objected: 'You boast, indeed, that what you speak is quickening, but we experience nothing of that nature.' He therefore says, that by themselves it is prevented; for unbelief, as it is always proud, will never understand any thing in the words of Christ which it despises and disdains."
2. "If we wish to profit at all under this Teacher, let us bring minds well disposed to listen to him; for if the entrance to his doctrine be not opened up by humility and reverence, our understandings are harder than stones, and will not receive any part of sound doctrine."
3. "For Jesus knew from the beginning... that none might think that Christ formed an opinion at random about his hearers. Many professed to belong to his flock, but a sudden apostasy exposed their hypocrisy."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Even of these who had heard the last words, so mercifully spoken for the removal of their difficulties, there were some who continued in unbelief."
2. "Another remarkable declaration by the Evangelist of the Saviour’s penetrating discernment of all hearts."
3. "The words seem to imply that the germ of the traitor-spirit was already in the heart of Judas, who, like many others, loved rather the glory and honour which Jesus set aside than the spirit and the life of His words."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Failure to believe kills the life in the words of Jesus." 
2. "From the first Jesus distinguished between real trust in him and mere lip service."
3. "Jesus was not taken by surprise and soon saw signs of treason in Judas."

1. "Their faith was not a living faith, or of a spiritual kind, but a mere historical and temporary one, and was feigned and hypocritical."
2. "He could see through all those masks they put on, and knew they had no true faith of him in them."

2. "God does foresee future contingencies."
3. "His foreknowledge causes not the fault."
