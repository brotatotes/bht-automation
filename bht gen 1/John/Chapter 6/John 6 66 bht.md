# John 6:66 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Upon this, many of his disciples went back, turned away from him and left him. Not all people fall into the category of those who do not believe. It is a dreadful thing that the light of Christ could have alienated the minds of many, a crisis that drew a line of cleavage between true and false believers. Those who remained were the ones who were meet for the Master's use, while the others returned to their quondam teachers and sought righteousness by their own works.
