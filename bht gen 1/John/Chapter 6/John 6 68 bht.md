## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "We cannot deny that we have been staggered as well as they, and seeing so many go away who, as we thought, might have been retained by teaching a little less hard to take in, our own endurance has been severely tried, nor have we been able to stop short of the question, Shall we follow the rest, and give it up?"
2. "But when it came to this, our light returned, and our hearts were reassured. For as soon as we thought of going away, there arose upon us that awful question, 'TO WHOM shall we go?'"
3. "Nay, Lord, we are shut up. They have none of that 'ETERNAL LIFE' to offer us whereof Thou hast been discoursing, in words rich and ravishing as well as in words staggering to human wisdom."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Peter was probably one of the oldest of the apostles, and it was his character to be first and most ardent in his professions."
2. "There was no one else who could teach them. The Pharisees, the Sadducees, and the scribes were corrupt, and unable to guide them aright; and, though the doctrines of Jesus were mysterious, yet they were the only doctrines that could instruct and save them."
3. "Thou teachest the doctrines which lead to eternal life. And from this we may learn: 1.That we are to expect that some of the doctrines of the Bible will be mysterious. 2.That, though they are difficult to be understood, yet we should not therefore reject them. 3.That nothing would be gained by rejecting them. The atheist, the infidel - nay, the philosopher, believes, or professes to believe, propositions quite as mysterious as any in the Bible. 4.That poor, lost, sinful man has nowhere else to go but to Jesus."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Assailants of the authenticity of John's Gospel have asserted that it reveals an effort on the part of the writer to claim for the disciple whom Jesus loved a pre-eminence above Peter."

3. "Words of life are words which carry life with them."

1. "Lord; or 'my Lord'; as the Syriac version renders it; which was either a title of respect, and the same with 'Sir' with us; or else, as acknowledging the dominion and authority of Christ, as Lord of all, and especially of the saints, and as claiming his interest in him." 
2. "There is no other Saviour, but Christ, to look to; no other Mediator between God and man, to make use of; no other physician of value, for diseased and sin sick souls to apply unto; no other fountain but his blood, for polluted souls to wash in, and be cleansed."
3. "Thou hast the words of eternal life: meaning, either the promises of eternal life, which were made before the world began, and were put into Christ's hands, for his people, and are yea and amen in him; or the doctrines of eternal life; for so the Gospel, and the truths of it, are called."
