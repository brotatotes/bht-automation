# John 6:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
One of the disciples, who happens to be Philip, answers Jesus, and it is later specified that Andrew was the one who spoke. Andrew, well-known for bringing Simon Peter to Jesus, had a pragmatic role in the group of disciples. The association between Philip and Andrew is not uncommon, as they are often mentioned together in the Gospels. Although Andrew's faith may have been lacking, he still played a significant role as a disciple of Christ.
