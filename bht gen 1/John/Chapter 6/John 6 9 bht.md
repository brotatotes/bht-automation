In this verse, the passage describes the presence of barley bread, a type of bread that was considered inferior and associated with poverty.

The inclusion of two small fishes portrays the limited provisions available, and yet the miracle of feeding the multitude showcases the abundance and provision of the Gospel, likened to the bread of life that Christ offers to all who believe.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "κριθίνους, the usual barley bread of the lower orders."
2. "ὀψάρια = ἰχθύδια, Suidas, but of later Greek usage: at first used to signify any thing subsidiary to bread as a relish, such as meat of all kinds, and condiments."
3. "Later however, from fish being, in the deeply coast-indented country of Greece, the most common animal food, it came to be applied to that alone or principally."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "An inferior sort of bread is indicated by the term [barley]. Pliny and some of the Jewish writers describe barley as food fit for beasts."
2. "The word [fishes] means anything that is eaten with bread, and may apply to meat generally, or to what is eaten with bread as a relish."
3. "Fish became among the Greeks a chief dainty to gourmands, so that Demosthenes describes a glutton and spendthrift as one who is extravagant in fish."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "John shows Andrew as standing somewhat in advance of Philip, in that he does not hesitate to think that their little store may be set before the multitude." 
2. "This is in accordance with the fact that in the lists of the apostles Andrew takes precedence of Philip." 
3. "Andrew's willingness to offer their meager resources demonstrates his faith and trust in Jesus' ability to provide for the multitude."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "A lad here (παιδαριον ωδε). Old word, diminutive of παις, here only in N.T., not genuine in Matthew 11:16."
2. "Barley (κριθινους). Adjective, here and verse John 6:13 only in N.T., in the papyri, from κριθη, barley (Revelation 6:6). Considered an inferior sort of bread."
3. "Fishes (οψαρια). Late diminutive of οψον, common in papyri and inscriptions for delicacies with bread like fish. In N.T. only here, verse John 6:11; John 21:9-13. Synoptics have ιχθυας."

### John Gill:
1. "The lad here is an example of the meanness and poverty of Christ and his followers, as they relied on barley bread, the coarsest sort of bread, which was even used as food for horses and dromedaries."
2. "The fact that there were only five barley loaves and two small fishes for five thousand people is truly amazing, as it seemed impossible for everyone to have even a taste, let alone be fully satisfied."
3. "This miracle of feeding the multitude with such meager provisions highlights the abundance and provision of the bread of life, which is the Gospel, that Christ offers to all who believe in him."
