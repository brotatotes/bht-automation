# John 7:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
After the events in Judea, the commentary reiterates that Jesus continues his ministry in Galilee, actively preaching and healing. Despite the dangers he faced from the Jews seeking to kill him, Jesus intentionally stays in Galilee for a prolonged period. This choice is significant, as it demonstrates his dedication to fulfilling his mission and the importance of continuing his work in less prominent areas. The commentary also highlights the necessity for believers to make use of proper means to preserve their lives for further usefulness in the cause of God and the benefit of others.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "μετὰ ταῦτα cannot apply emphatically to ch. 6, but must be referred back to ch. 5, as indeed must the Jews seeking to kill Him, and the miracle alluded to in John 7:23."
2. "It will not follow from this, that ch. 6 is not in its right place: it contains an independent memoir of a miracle and discourse of our Lord in Galilee which actually happened in the interval."
3. "This Gospel is made up of such memoirs, more or less connected with one another, and selected by the Evangelist for their higher spiritual import, and the discourses arising from them."

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "After these things" refers to all that is recorded after John 5:18, indicating a continuation of Jesus' ministry in Galilee instead of going to Judea as expected.
2. By stating that the Jews sought to kill him, the commentary refers back to John 5:18, highlighting the ongoing hostility towards Jesus.
3. The mention of Jesus not attending the Passover in John 6:4, if it was indeed a Passover, indicates a deliberate choice by Jesus to remain in Galilee and continue his ministry there.

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Its significance was twofold. It was a harvest - home festival, and hence was called the Feast of Ingathering, and it commemorated the dwelling of Israel in tents or booths in the wilderness."
2. "The association of the latter event with harvest was designed to remind the people in their prosperity of the days of their homeless wandering, that their hearts might not be lifted up and forget God, who delivered them from bondage."
3. "The festival was also known as the Feast of Jehovah, or simply the Festival, because of its importance and being the most joyful of all festivals."

### John Calvin:
1. "If any person think it strange that Christ sought a place of concealment, who, by the mere act of his will, could break and render powerless all the efforts of his enemies, it is easy to reply, that he remembered the commission which he had received from the Father, and determined to confine himself within the limits which belonged to him as man."
2. "In encountering dangers, it is not our business to inquire what God has determined respecting us in his decree, but what he commands and enjoins on us, what our office requires and demands, and what is the proper method of regulating our life."
3. "When a small and despised corner of Galilee grants a lodging to Christ, whom Judea cannot endure, we learn from it that piety and the fear of God are not always to be found in the chief places of the Church."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "During that time Jesus ‘was walking in Galilee,’ for in Judea His enemies ‘were seeking to kill Him.’" 
2. "The ministry in Galilee is in the main passed over, partly, no doubt, because the Evangelist well knew that the types of Gospel teaching that were most widely current chiefly presented the Saviour’s work in Galilee." 
3. "The principal outward characteristics of this portion of our Lord’s public ministry are the wider range of His travels and the comparative privacy which He seems usually to have maintained."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "John simply supplements the narrative in the Synoptics at points deemed important."
2. "He now skips the period of withdrawal from Galilee of about six months."
3. "He had been avoiding Galilee as well as Judea for six months."

### John Gill:
1. "He did not sit still, or lie at home, and live an inactive indolent life, but went about from place to place, preaching the Gospel, and healing diseases; he walked, and walked about; but not as the enemy of souls, seeking to do all mischief, but to do all good, to the bodies and souls of men."
2. "His reason for it was because the Jews sought to kill him; for healing a man on the sabbath day, and for asserting his equality with God: not that he was afraid to die, but his time was not come; and he had work to do for the glory of God, and the good of men."
3. "And very lawful and advisable it is for good men, when their lives are in danger, to make use of proper means to preserve them, for further usefulness in the cause of God, and for the benefit of men."
