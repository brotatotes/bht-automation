# John 7:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Not in the usual caravan-company or by the usual way, Jesus went secretly to Jerusalem, likely with the Twelve. He intentionally avoided public attention, not wanting to manifest himself to the world yet. His purpose was to fulfill all righteousness and observe every precept of the law, going privately to the feast to escape those who sought to kill him. This journey was one of his last before his final and ultimate sacrifice.
