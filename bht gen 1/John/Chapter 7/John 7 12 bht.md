## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The different groups of which ὁ ὄχλος was composed would include the Galilæan disciples, and those who had been baptized by the disciples in Judæa, whose view ἀγαθός ἐστιν would represent, as expressed mildly in protest against His enemies."
2. "ἀγαθός ἐστιν" - their view that Jesus is good, expressed as a mild protest against His enemies.
3. "πλανᾷ τὸν ὄχλον" - possibly in reference to the feeding of and then the discourse to the multitude, which had given so much offence.

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "much murmuring—buzzing."
2. "the natural expression of a Jewish writer, indicating without design the crowded state of Jerusalem at this festival."
3. "a good man . . . Nay . . . deceiveth the people—the two opposite views of His claims, that they were honest, and that they were an imposture."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Murmuring - Contention, disputing."
2. "He deceiveth the people - That is, he is deluding them."
3. "Drawing them away by pretending to be the Messiah."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Murmuring." - This suggests that the people were expressing their discontent or dissatisfaction with something.
2. "The people...said." - The imperfect tense indicates that the people were continuously expressing their thoughts or opinions.
3. "Deceiveth...leadeth astray." - This implies that the people believed they were being misled or led astray by someone or something.

### John Calvin:
1. "The diversity of opinion, which is here related, proves that it is not a new evil, that men should differ in their opinions about Christ, even in the very bosom of the Church."
2. "Again, we may perceive how great is the rashness of men in the things of God. In a matter of no importance, they would not have taken so great liberty, but when the question relates to the Son of God and to his most holy doctrine, they immediately hasten to give judgment respecting it."
3. "This passage shows likewise that in a great multitude, even when the whole body is in a state of confusion, there are always some who think aright; but those few persons, whose minds are well regulated, are swallowed up by the multitude of those whose understandings are bewildered."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The speculation, the hesitation, the inquiry, were general, but all outward expression was suppressed."
2. "The use of the plural 'multitudes' seems to point to crowds rather than individuals as the disputants."
3. "The word 'multitude,' however, at the close of the verse is not without a contemptuous force, it is the common crowd that He leads astray."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Much murmuring (γογγυσμος πολυς). This Ionic onomatopoetic word is from γογγυζω for which verb see John 6:41; John 6:61; John 7:32, for secret displeasure (Acts 6:1) or querulous discontent (Philippians 2:14)."

2. "Among the multitudes (εν τοις οχλοις). 'The multitudes' literally, plural here only in John. These different groups were visitors from Galilee and elsewhere and were divided in their opinion of Jesus as the Galileans had already become (John 6:66)."

3. "Not so, but he leadeth the multitude astray (ου, αλλα πλανα τον οχλον). Sharp clash in the crowd. Present active indicative of πλαναω, to go astray (Matthew 18:12), like our 'planets,' to lead others astray (Matthew 24:4; Matthew 24:5; Matthew 24:11, etc.). In the end the rulers will call Jesus 'that deceiver' (εκεινος ο πλανος, Matthew 27:63). The Jewish leaders have a following among the crowds as is seen (John 7:31)."

### John Gill:
1. "There was a general whisper, and a private controversy and contention among the people about him."
2. "Some said he is a good man; a man of a good principle, of a good life and conversation."
3. "But he deceiveth the people; drawing them off from the law of Moses, teaching them to break the sabbath, setting himself up for the Messiah, and asserting himself to be the son of God."

### John Wesley:
1. "The murmuring among the multitude reflects the underlying tension and confusion that often accompanies moments of great significance. It is a reminder that even in the presence of miracles, doubts and debates can arise among people who come from different backgrounds and perspectives."

2. "Whispering and private debates signify the intimate and personal nature of the discussions taking place. It highlights the individual struggle to make sense of the extraordinary events unfolding before them, as each person grapples with their own beliefs and understanding."

3. "The murmuring among the multitude serves as a reminder that faith is not always a straightforward journey. It acknowledges the diversity of opinions and the need for dialogue and reflection as individuals seek to reconcile their own experiences with the profound teachings and actions of Jesus."
