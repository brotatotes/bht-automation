## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Both are seeking one aim: the glory of God."
2. "The humility of him, whose will it is to do God's will, can best appreciate that more perfect humility of the divine Son."
3. "All true teaching is from God."

Note: The commentary is quite lengthy and complex, so I have selected three quotes that capture the essence of the author's thoughts on the verse.

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Seeketh his own glory" - This phrase refers to someone who is primarily concerned with promoting and exalting themselves, rather than seeking the glory and honor of God. It highlights the selfishness and self-centeredness of such individuals.

2. (See on John 5:41) - This reference points to another verse in the Gospel of John, where Jesus rebukes the religious leaders for seeking their own glory instead of recognizing and honoring the true glory that comes from God. It emphasizes the importance of humility and recognizing that true glory comes from God alone.

3. The commentary suggests that this phrase serves as a reminder for believers to examine their motives and intentions. It challenges them to prioritize God's glory above their own and to seek to honor Him in all they do. It serves as a caution against pride and self-centeredness, encouraging a mindset of humility and selflessness.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "That speaketh of himself - This does not mean about or concerning himself, but he that speaks by his own authority, without being sent by God, as mere human teachers do."

2. "Seeketh his own glory - His own praise, or seeks for reputation and applause. This is the case with mere human teachers, and as Jesus in his discourses manifestly sought to honor God, they ought to have supposed that he was sent by him."

3. "No unrighteousness - This word here means, evidently, there is no falsehood, no deception in him. He is not an impostor. It is used in the same sense in 2 Thessalonians 2:10-12. It is true that there was no unrighteousness, no sin in Jesus Christ, but that is not the truth taught here. It is that he was not an impostor, and the evidence of this was that he sought not his own glory, but the honor of God."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "His own glory [την δοξαν την ιδιαν] . Literally, the glow which is His own; the second article throwing His own into sharp contrast with His that sent Him."
2. "On His own, see on Acts 1:7; Matthew 22:5; Matthew 25:15."
3. "The same [ουτος] . Notice the characteristic use of the pronoun taking up and emphasizing the principal subject of the sentence."

### John Calvin:
1. "For every thing that displays the glory of God is holy and divine; but every thing that contributes to the ambition of men, and, by exalting them, obscures the glory of God, not only has no claim to be believed, but ought to be vehemently rejected."
2. "He who shall make the glory of God the object at which he aims will never go wrong; he who shall try and prove by this touchstone what is brought forward in the name of God will never be deceived by the semblance of right."
3. "We are also reminded by it that no man can faithfully discharge the office of teacher in the Church unless he be void of ambition, and resolve to make it his sole object to promote, to the utmost of his power, the glory of God."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "If a man speaks from himself, giving out all that he says as coming from himself, it is clear that he is seeking the glory of no one but himself."
2. "But every word of Jesus shows that He seeks His Father’s glory: hence it cannot be that He is speaking from Himself."
3. "He that seeketh the glory of him that sent him, the same is true, and there is no unrighteousness in him."

These quotes highlight the importance of seeking God's glory rather than one's own. They emphasize that Jesus, as the true messenger of God, always sought to glorify the Father and fulfill His will. This commentary also suggests that those who have a genuine desire to do God's will can discern the authenticity of Jesus as the messenger of God.

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "This kind of teacher is self-taught, pushes his own ideas, presses his own claims for position and glory, 'blows his own horn' as we say."
2. "Jesus is the other type of teacher, seeks the glory of the one who sent him, whose herald and ambassador he is."
3. "Unrighteousness, in contrast with 'true,' refers to the deceit of unrighteousness in contrast with truth."

### John Gill:
1. "He that speaketh of himself...seeketh his own glory." - This quote highlights the danger of self-centered teachings that lack divine authority. It emphasizes the importance of seeking God's glory rather than personal recognition or applause from others.

2. "He that seeketh his glory that sent him...the same is true." - This quote emphasizes the integrity and trustworthiness of those who speak with the authority and commission given to them by God. It implies that those who seek to glorify God in their words and actions can be relied upon for truthful teachings.

3. "He is an upright and faithful man...there is no fraud or imposture in him." - This quote underscores the character of someone who seeks to bring glory to God. It assures the reader that such individuals are trustworthy, sincere, and devoid of any deceitful intentions.

### John Wesley:
1. "There is no unrighteousness in him" - This phrase emphasizes the absolute purity and righteousness of God. It highlights the fact that God is completely free from any form of deceit or falsehood, setting Him apart from the flawed nature of humanity.

2. "No deceit or falsehood" - This statement underscores the trustworthiness and integrity of God. It assures us that God's character is unwavering and that His actions are always in alignment with His righteous nature.

3. "No unrighteousness in him" - This declaration reminds us that God's righteousness is not just a part of His character, but it defines who He is. It assures us that God's judgments and actions are always just and fair, giving us confidence in His perfect nature.
