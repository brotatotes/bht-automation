## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Moses on this account gave you circumcision, not because it is of Moses, but of the fathers; i.e. it is no part of the law of Moses, properly so called, but was adopted by Moses, and thereby becomes part of his law." 
2. "If this may be done on the Sabbath: if an ordinance strictly Mosaic (which the Sabbath in its Jewish mode of observance was) may be set aside by another, Mosaic also, but more ancient, and borrowed from a more general and direct command of God." 
3. "How much more may it be a deed of mercy, a benevolent exercise of divine power, the approval of which is anterior to and deeper than all ceremonial enactment?"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "How much less ought fault to be found with One who had made a man 'every whit whole'—or rather, 'a man's entire body whole'—on the sabbath-day?" 

2. "What a testimony to the reality of the miracle, none daring to meet the bold appeal."

3. "None dared to question or challenge Jesus' authority and power to heal, even on the Sabbath, because the evidence of the man's complete restoration was undeniable."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Moses on this account gave you circumcision, not because it is of Moses, but of the fathers."
2. "Though Jesus spoke in accordance with the custom of the Jews, yet he is careful to remind them that it was in observance long before Moses."

3. "Moses, who so rigidly demanded the keeping of the Sabbath, commanded that infants should be circumcised on the eighth day, even though it should fall on the day of Rest."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The very law was intended to teach them the fundamental principle upon which Jesus rested His defence, to look beyond the letter to the spirit, and to see that sometimes an ordinance is most honoured when its letter is broken."
2. "They felt that to receive the sign of God’s covenant, the token of consecration and of the removal of uncleanness could never be really inconsistent with any command of God."
3. "This passage is of great interest as showing that in many respects the law, even whilst seeming to deal in positive precepts only, was intended to become, and in some measure actually was, a discipline, preparing for the ‘dispensation of the Spirit.’"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
