## BHT:
In the bustling city of Jerusalem, where tensions were high and plots were brewing, Jesus fearlessly stood teaching amidst a crowd. This scene unfolds against the backdrop of a populace that was aware of the authorities' sinister intentions. These city-dwellers, distinguished by their deeper understanding, contrasted with the multitude of pilgrims who were less familiar with the inner workings of the religious leaders. Despite the risks and dangers, Jesus boldly continued in His mission, undeterred by the threat to His life.
