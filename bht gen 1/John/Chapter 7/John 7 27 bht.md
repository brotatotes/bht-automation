# John 7:27 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Description:
The commentators offer insights into the perception of the Messiah's origin and identity. There are misconceptions about the Messiah's mysterious coming, but Jesus' familiar upbringing in Nazareth creates doubt among the people. However, the prophecies about his birth in Bethlehem and his Davidic ancestry are disregarded. Despite the expectation of hiddenness and uncertainty, Jesus' true lineage and birthplace were foretold. In the midst of confusion and skepticism, the mystery of Christ's divine nature remains, as he embodies both human and divine origins.

2. "They knew he would come from Bethlehem, and they knew that he would come out of the seed of David; but then he was to be born of a virgin, according to Isaiah 7:14, and such a coming into the world was not to be known, reasoned upon, and accounted for."
3. "Their meaning is, that Christ should not be gotten of man, or come into the world in the ordinary way of generation, but should be born of a virgin; and so it could not be known, and accounted for from whence he was, or from whence that seed was of which he was made."
