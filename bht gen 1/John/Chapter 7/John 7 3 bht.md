# John 7:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, Jesus' biological brothers question him, expressing their skepticism and impatience for him to make himself known openly. They mention his disciples and the miracles he has performed, highlighting the diverse following he has gathered. Jesus' brothers, who were not initially believing in him, mock his actions and advise him, revealing their own doubts and desire for him to leave the secluded region where he is currently situated. This interaction sheds light on the complex dynamics within Jesus' own family and their struggle to understand his mission.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "But as they were in the 'upper room' among the one hundred and twenty disciples who waited for the descent of the Spirit after the Lord's ascension, they seem to have had their prejudices removed, perhaps after His resurrection."
2. "Indeed here their language is more that of strong prejudice and suspicion (such as near relatives, even the best, too frequently show in such cases), than from unbelief."
3. "There was also, probably, a tincture of vanity in it. 'Thou hast many disciples in Judea here in Galilee they are fast dropping off; it is not like one who advances the claims Thou dost to linger so long here, away from the city of our solemnities, where surely 'the kingdom of our father David' is to be set up: 'seeking,' as Thou dost, 'to be known openly,' those miracles of Thine ought not to be confined to this distant corner, but submitted at headquarters to the inspection of 'the world.'"

### John Calvin:
1. "He says that they mocked at Christ, because he shunned to be seen or known, and concealed himself in a mean and despised district of Judea."
2. "There is reason to doubt, however, if they were excited by ambition to desire that Christ should obtain celebrity. But granting this, still it is evident that they ridicule him, because they do not think that his conduct is rational and judicious."
3. "They even upbraid him with folly, because, while he wishes to be something, he wants confidence in himself, and does not venture to appear openly before men."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "It is important to keep this in mind if we would understand the position occupied by the brothers of Jesus."

2. "The feast of tabernacles being at hand, they put him upon going up to it, being willing to be rid of him...like the Gergesenes, who preferred their swine to Christ, and desired him to depart out of their coasts."
