2. "Where I am. In absolute, eternal being and fellowship with the Father."
3. "I am [εγω ειμι] is the formula of the divine existence (viii. 58). The phrase carries a hint of the essential nature of Jesus, and thus prepares the way for ye cannot come (see on ver. 7). The difference in character will make it essentially impossible."
