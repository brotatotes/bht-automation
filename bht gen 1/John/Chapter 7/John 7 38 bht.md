# John 7:38 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Out of the believer's innermost being shall flow rivers of living water, as scripture has proclaimed. This water is a representation of the grace and blessings that believers receive through faith in Jesus Christ. This abundant and life-giving water not only satisfies their own spiritual thirst, but also overflows to bring refreshment and blessings to others. It is a continual outpouring of the Holy Spirit, like a living and constantly flowing fountain, that nourishes and brings life to all who encounter it.
