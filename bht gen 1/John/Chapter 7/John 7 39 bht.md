# John 7:39 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse being described is about the expectation and anticipation of the full manifestation of the Holy Spirit's power and gifts in the lives of believers. It highlights the idea that even though believers had the Holy Spirit dwelling in them, they did not yet experience the fullness of His transformative work and the manifestation of His fruits. However, this verse also points to the promise that with Jesus' departure and the coming of the Spirit, believers would receive the complete outpouring and empowerment of the Spirit.

2. "And the symbolism of the N.T. is fully satisfied by the interpretation. Granted that the water is the water of life, what is that life but the life of the Spirit?"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "For the Holy Ghost was not yet given - Was not given in such full and large measures as should be after Jesus had ascended to heaven."

3. "It was a part of the arrangement in the work of redemption that the influences of the Holy Spirit should descend chiefly after the death of Jesus, as that death was the procuring cause of this great blessing."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The word spirit, standing thus alone, marks, not the personal Spirit, but His operation or gift or manifestation."
2. "We have here one of John's characteristic terms, even as the idea is central to his Gospel - to show forth Jesus as the manifested glory of God."
3. "The passion is the way to glory."

These quotes highlight the interpretation of the word "spirit" in the verse as referring to the operation or manifestation of the Holy Spirit.

### John Calvin:
1. "The word water is sometimes applied to the Spirit on account of its purity, because it is his office to cleanse our pollutions."

2. "Those fruits of the Spirit were not yet given even to true believers" - This emphasizes that even though believers had the Holy Spirit dwelling in them, they did not experience the fullness of His transformative work and the manifestation of His fruits.
