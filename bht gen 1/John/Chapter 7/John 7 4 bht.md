### Marvin Vincent:
1. "No man can assert the position which Christ claims, and at the same time keep secret the works which go to vindicate it."

3. "The works which go to vindicate it."

### John Calvin:
1. "If thou dost these things, that is, since thou art endued with so great power as to procure reputation for thyself by miracles, do not throw them away; for all that has been given to thee by God thou spendest here to no purpose, because there are none to bear thee testimony, or to hold thee in just estimation."
2. "Hence we perceive how great is the indolence of men in considering the works of God; for the relations of Christ would never have spoken in this manner, if they had not — as it were — trampled under foot the manifest proofs of his Divine power, which they ought to have beheld with the greatest admiration and reverence."
3. "What is here told us concerning Christ happens in daily experience, that the children of God suffer greater annoyance from their near relations than from strangers; for they are instruments of Satan which tempt, sometimes to ambition, and sometimes to avarice, those who desire to serve God purely and faithfully."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "To be in boldness" may seem a singular expression...the form of the phrase is chosen so as to be in correspondence with what precedes, 'doeth anything in secret.'"
2. "The meaning is 'to take a bold position.' Working miracles in secret and a bold claim of personal dignity and office are, in the view of these men, things incompatible with one another."
3. "The brothers would use them as meaning 'to all men,' i.e. 'to all Israel' gathered together at the feast...but we cannot doubt that the Evangelist sees here the language of unconscious prophecy."

1. "In secret" (εν κρυπτω) - This phrase is used in Matthew 6:4 and Matthew 6:6, emphasizing the importance of performing good deeds without seeking recognition or praise from others.

2. "Openly" (εν παρρησια) - This term, meaning "in public" or "telling it all," is contrasted with "in secret." It highlights the need for a public teacher to allow inspection of their actions, even though the motive behind it may be malicious.

3. "Manifest thyself" (φανερωσον σεαυτον) - This imperative phrase urges Jesus to reveal Himself openly to the world, not just to His disciples. It echoes the idea of making His actions and teachings known to the public at large, as seen in the feast of tabernacles.

1. "For there is no man that doeth anything in secret" - This highlights the skepticism of the people towards Jesus' miracles, as they believed that such extraordinary acts should be performed openly and in the presence of important figures.

2. "he himself seeketh to be known openly" - This refutes the misconception that Jesus was seeking personal fame or glory, emphasizing that his intentions were pure and selfless.

3. "shew thyself to the world" - The people challenge Jesus to perform his miracles in front of a larger audience, suggesting that if his miracles were genuine, it would bring him greater credibility and if not, he would be exposed.

These quotes shed light on the doubts and misunderstandings surrounding Jesus' actions and intentions, highlighting the need for clarification and further revelation.
