# John 7:41 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The people's limited understanding of the Scriptures and their preconceived notions about Jesus' origin led to confusion and debate. However, this verse reminds us to approach Scripture with humility and open-mindedness, willing to let go of our own ideas and allow God to reveal His truth to us. The skepticism of those who denied Jesus as the Messiah was based on his Galilean origin, while those who boldly proclaimed him as the Christ saw his miracles and his promise of living water.
