# John 7:42 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus' birth in Bethlehem is a crucial aspect of his identity as the Messiah. It not only fulfills the prophecy of Micah 5:2, but also serves as a reminder of Herod's brutal attempt to extinguish the hope and redemption that Jesus brings. Despite objections from some, the evidence of Jesus' lineage, birthplace, and fulfillment of ancient prophecies solidifies his identity as the David-descended, Bethlehem-born Savior.
