# John 7:44 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we see the intense opposition and hostility that surrounded Jesus during his ministry. The religious leaders actively sought to seize him, driven by their aversion to his teachings and authority. However, their attempts were in vain, as God's providence and perfect timing protected and guided Jesus. The desire to capture him was driven by a deep-seated rejection of Jesus and a determination to silence him, but ultimately, they were restrained and diverted from their intentions.
