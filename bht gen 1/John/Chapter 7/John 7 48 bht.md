# John 7:48 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse in question raises the inquiry as to whether any of the rulers or Pharisees believed in Jesus. This challenges the prevailing idea that only the common people embraced Him, highlighting the skepticism and disbelief among those in positions of power and authority. The lack of faith among these individuals signifies the depth of their unbelief and the significance of Jesus' message. It serves as a reminder that true belief in Jesus is not limited by social status or religious credentials, but rather requires humility and a willingness to let go of preconceived notions.

"It must be owned, there were but very few of this sort, and perhaps not an instance of this kind had as yet occurred to them; there was Nicodemus, who is mentioned in the context, who was both a ruler and a Pharisee; and Joseph of Arimathea, a rich counsellor; but they neither of them openly showed themselves to be the disciples of Christ till his death."
