# John 7:51 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, commentators emphasize the vital importance of fairness and justice. They highlight the need to hear someone's side of the case before passing judgment, as it is a violation of proper legal procedure and a violation of the principles of justice to condemn someone without understanding their actions or giving them a chance to defend themselves. Additionally, there is a suggestion of a hidden admiration for Christ, even though it may not have been openly expressed.
