# John 7:52 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the face of Jesus' Galilean identity, the people answered with personal attacks instead of addressing the argument. They scornfully questioned Nicodemus for being associated with Jesus and falsely claimed that no prophet could arise from Galilee. However, their claims were unfounded, for prophets such as Jonah had indeed come from Galilee. The people's contempt for Galilee blinded them to the truth and prevented them from engaging in a meaningful discussion.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Whether we read ἐγείρεται or ἐγήγερται, the assertion is much the same: for προφ. cannot mean the Prophet, or the Messiah."
2. "It was not historically true; for two Prophets at least had arisen from Galilee: Jonah of Gathhepher, and the greatest of the Prophets, Elijah of Thisbe; and perhaps also Nahum and Hosea."
3. "Their contempt for Galilee made them lose sight of historical accuracy."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Even a word of caution, or the gentlest proposal to inquire before condemning, was with them equivalent to an espousal of the hated One."
2. "But rage is blind, and deep prejudice distorts all facts."
3. "It was just because he had 'searched,' as they advised him, that he went the length even that he did."

### John Calvin:
1. "They say that all who favor Christ are from Galilee, and this is spoken reproachfully, as if he could not have any person among his followers except from the small and unknown corner of Galilee."
2. "The extreme violence to which they are excited against Nicodemus shows with what furious hatred they burned against Christ."
3. "Thus among the Papists in our own day, no man can show the slightest token of candour that the Gospel may not be oppressed, but immediately the enemies fly into a passion, and exclaim that he is a heretic."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "No answer to the argument was possible: they can but turn on Nicodemus himself."
2. "They assume that no one but a Galilean can take the side of Jesus."
3. "In their scorn of Galilee, and their arrogant assumption of complete knowledge of 'the law,' they regard it as impossible that out of that land any prophet should arise; least of all can it be the birthplace of the Messiah."

3. "And if no prophet had, as yet, arose from thence, it did not follow that no one should arise: besides, there is a prophecy in which it was foretold, that a prophet, and even the Messiah, the great light, should arise in Galilee; see Isaiah 9:1; and they themselves say, that the Messiah should be revealed in Galilee."
