# John 7:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, Jesus tactfully delays attending a feast, avoiding attention and maintaining His prudence. He willingly foregoes the advantages of attending, not wanting to provoke envy or jealousy. The verse emphasizes the importance of timing, as Jesus acknowledges His intention to attend the festival in the near future. Scholars note that His resistance to embark on a grand procession contrasts with His brothers' misguided advice. This passage also highlights the need for unregenerate individuals to participate in outward means of spiritual nourishment, even if they do not fully comprehend their significance.
