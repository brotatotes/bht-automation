# John 7:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, we see the cousins of our Lord Jesus Christ, who intertwine with unbelievers while still pretending to worship God. Meanwhile, Jesus Himself, despised by the world, discreetly enters the city until His duty necessitates revealing Himself openly. While Jesus remains in Galilee, His stay is continuous, lasting for a significant period of time, indicating His firmness and resolution of mind. His abode in Galilee covers more than just a few hours or days, signifying a dedicated and unchanging commitment.
