# John 8:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, Jesus addresses the objections of his opponents who question the validity of his self-testimony. They argue that his witness alone is not trustworthy and lacks sufficient evidence. The commentators shed light on the technicality raised by the Pharisees, who relied on a rabbinical rule that no one can testify for themselves. However, Jesus challenges this objection by affirming that his testimony is supported by the Father's witness, highlighting his inseparable union with the Father. While his opponents try to divert attention and belittle his testimony, Jesus asserts the truthfulness and authority of his declaration.
