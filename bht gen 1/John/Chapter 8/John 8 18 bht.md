# John 8:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, we find Jesus speaking about the testimony regarding his identity and purpose. Commentators note that Jesus himself bears witness to his own motives, highlighting his sincerity and sacrificial nature. Additionally, the Father's witness is emphasized, demonstrated through the voice from heaven at Jesus' baptism, his miracles, and the prophecies of the Old Testament. Two distinct divine persons, the Father and the Son, stand as witnesses, reinforcing the validity of their testimony. This combined witness carries great weight, surpassing even the reliability of two human testimonies.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Albert Barnes:
1. "When one has no party ends to serve; when he is willing to deny himself; when he makes great sacrifices; and when, by his life, he gives every evidence of sincerity, his own testimony may be admitted in evidence of his motives and designs." 
2. "Though in a legal or criminal case such testimony would not be admitted, yet, in an argument on moral subjects, about the will and purpose of him who sent him, it would not be right to reject the testimony of one who gave so many proofs that he came from God." 
3. "The Father ...beareth witness of me - By the voice from heaven at his baptism Matthew 3:17, and by the miracles which Jesus performed, as well as by the prophecies of the Old Testament."

### Philip Schaff:

2) "He may mean either (1) that they should themselves have discerned in Him, over and above that which in a holy human prophet they would have accepted as 'witness,' a higher presence which could only be Divine."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "The Father (ο πατηρ). Clearly genuine here." 
2. "So these are the two witnesses that Jesus presents to the Pharisees in defence of his claim to be the Light of the World."

### John Gill:
1. "The Father that sent me, beareth witness of me; as he did, by the descent of the Spirit upon him at his baptism, and by a voice from heaven." 
2. "Here were two testifiers, his Father and himself; which show them to be two distinct divine persons, and equal to each other."
