# John 8:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, the Jews mockingly challenge Jesus, displaying their ignorance and malice. They taunt him, believing they are greater than him and speculating that he may go where they cannot. Their scornful remarks reveal their rejection of his message and their spiritual blindness. Jesus endures their contradiction with remarkable patience, setting an example for us to respond with grace in the face of contempt. This interaction showcases the profound truth that some fail to grasp, leading to foolish and wicked consequences.
