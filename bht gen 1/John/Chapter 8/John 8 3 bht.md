# John 8:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this scene, the scribes and Pharisees persistently plot to trap Jesus, seeking any opportunity to discredit him. Their relentless pursuit is evident, as they bring forth a woman caught in adultery, knowing of Jesus' reputation for forgiving sinners. The authenticity and authority of this account have been debated, but it remains a vivid and dramatic episode, highlighting the wickedness and deceitfulness of those who oppose Jesus. Though absent in some ancient copies, its inclusion sheds light on the relentless opposition Jesus faced and the power of his teachings.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "John does not usually connect with δέ, more commonly with οὖν."
2. "Nor does he ever mention οἱ γραμματεῖς elsewhere, but usually calls the opponents of Jesus οἱ Ἰουδαῖοι, or οἱ ἄρχοντες."
3. "The account gives no light as to the capacity in which these Scribes and Pharisees acted when they brought the woman."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The scribes and Pharisees were relentless in their pursuit to trap Jesus and discredit Him. Their failed attempt from the previous day did not deter them; instead, it fueled their determination to find fault in His teachings." 

2. "Jesus, however, was not easily deceived or intimidated by their cunning tactics. He saw through their hypocrisy and exposed their true motives, revealing their insincere hearts." 

3. "The scribes and Pharisees were experts in the law, yet they lacked true understanding and righteousness. Their focus was on outward appearances and self-righteousness, rather than on genuine faith and obedience to God."

### John Calvin:
1. "It is found in many old Greek manuscripts, and contains nothing unworthy of an Apostolic Spirit."
2. "In adopting this pretense for slander, they display enormous wickedness."
3. "Their intention was to constrain Christ to depart from his office of preaching grace, that he might appear to be fickle and unsteady."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The scene described in the words before us must have been in a high degree impressive and exciting."
2. "Their faces bearing all the marks of eager passion to entrap the object of their hatred."
3. "Without the slightest feeling of compunction, they compel the woman to stand in the midst of the throng."

Note: The commentary provided is quite long, so I had to condense it into three quotes that capture the essence of the scene and the emotions involved.

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "The scribes and the Pharisees...Bring...Their purpose is to entrap Jesus." 
2. "Taken in adultery...Having let her in the midst...They knew his proneness to forgive sinners."

### John Gill:
1. "The members of the sanhedrim, who had been so miserably disappointed the day before, were no less diligent and industrious in their wicked way, seeking all opportunities, and taking all advantages against Christ."
2. "This history of the woman taken in adultery, is wanting in the Alexandrian copy, and in other ancient copies; nor is it in Nonnus, Chrysostom, and Theophylact; nor in any of the editions of the Syriac version, until it was restored by De Dieu, from a copy of Archbishop Usher's; but was in the Arabic and Ethiopic versions, and in the Harmonies of Tatian and Ammonius."
3. "Nor need the authenticness of it be doubted of; Eusebius says, it is in the Gospel according to the Hebrews; nor should its authority be called in question."
