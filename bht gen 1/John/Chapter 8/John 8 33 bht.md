# John 8:33 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the dialogue between Jesus and the Jews reveals their pride in being descendants of Abraham, yet their misunderstanding of true freedom. While the Jews claimed to be free and belonging to Abraham's lineage, they overlooked their history of bondage in Egypt, Babylon, and under the Roman rule. Jesus challenges their narrow perspective, emphasizing a deeper, spiritual bondage they were unaware of. The exchange highlights their lack of distinction as true disciples and their need for liberation from sin's enslavement.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "They had not yet become ἀληθῶς μαθηταί, were not yet distinct from the mass of the unbelieving; and therefore, in speaking to them, He ascribes to them the sins of their race, and addresses them as part of that race."
2. "The assertion οὐδενὶ δεδουλεύκαμεν was so contrary to historical truth, that we must suppose some technical meaning to have been attached to δεδουλεύκαμεν, in which it may have been correct."
3. "As usual, they take the words of our Lord in their outward literal sense. Perhaps this was not always an unintentional misunderstanding."

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "The pride of the Jewish nation, even now after centuries of humiliation, is the most striking feature of their character."
2. "Had they forgotten their long and bitter bondage in Egypt? their dreary captivity in Babylon? their present bondage to the Roman yoke, and their restless eagerness to throw it off?"
3. "Our Lord, therefore, though He knew what slaves they were in this sense, drives the ploughshare somewhat deeper than this, to a bondage they little dreamt of."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "They meant that they were the direct descendants of Abraham by Isaac, his heir. Ishmael, also Abraham’s son, was the son of a bondwoman Galatians 4:21-23, but they were descended in a direct line from the acknowledged heir of Abraham."
2. "This is a most remarkable declaration, and one evidently false. Their fathers had been slaves in Egypt; their nation had been enslaved in Babylon; it had repeatedly been subject to the Assyrians; it was enslaved by Herod the Great; and was, at the very time they spoke, groaning under the grievous and insupportable bondage of the Romans."
3. "But we see here:"

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "In the light of the promises given to Abraham, the Jews claimed not only freedom, but dominion over the nations." 
2. "Beside the fact that their words were the utterance of strong passion, it is to be remembered that the Romans, from motives of policy, had left them the semblance of political independence." 
3. "As in so many other cases, they overlook the higher significance of Jesus' words, and base their reply on a technicality."

### John Calvin:
1. "It is a mode of expression very customary in Scripture, whenever the body of a people is mentioned, to ascribe generally to all what belongs only to a part."
2. "They think, therefore, that they are insulted, when freedom is exhibited to them as a blessing which they do not yet possess."
3. "Yet they had this plausible excuse, that the unjust sway of their enemies did not hinder them from continuing to be free by right."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The promise 'shall make you free' cannot but imply that now they have no freedom, but are slaves."
2. "To be of Abraham's seed and to be a slave were discordant ideas."
3. "Theirs was a religious pre-eminence above all nations of the world, a freedom which no external circumstances could affect."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "We are Abraham's seed," the proudest boast of the Jews, of Sarah the freewoman and not of Hagar the bondwoman (Galatians 4:22).
2. God made Gentiles the spiritual children of Abraham by faith (Matthew 3:7; Matthew 9:6).
3. "These poor believers soon come to the end of their faith" (Stier).

1. "The Jews always valued themselves upon being Abraham's seed, reckoning themselves on this account, on a level with the nobles and the princes of the earth."
2. "It is a very great falsehood for them to claim that they were never in bondage to any man, as they were in fact enslaved in Egypt, Babylon, and under the Roman yoke."
3. "With an haughty air, they questioned Jesus, 'How sayest thou, ye shall be made free?' as they believed themselves to be already free and in no need of liberation."

2. "We were never enslaved to any man — A bold, notorious untruth."
3. "At that very time they were enslaved to the Romans."
