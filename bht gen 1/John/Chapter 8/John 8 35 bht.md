# John 8:35 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, commentators reveal that there are two contrasting types of individuals in God's house: the son and the slave. The slave, representing sinners or those who serve sin, does not have a permanent place and may be cast out. On the other hand, the son, symbolizing the Son of God or those who have been adopted into God's family, has an everlasting presence and cannot be separated from God's house. This verse emphasizes the importance of the Son's role and the eternal security that comes with being a part of God's family.
