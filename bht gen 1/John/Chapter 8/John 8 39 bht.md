# John 8:39 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This verse addresses the relationship between believers and their identity as children of Abraham. It highlights the distinction between physical lineage and spiritual adoption. The commentators emphasize that true sonship is not based on bloodline alone, but on faith and imitation of Abraham's character. They also note that rejection of God's word and lack of mercy are indicators of a false claim to belonging to Abraham's lineage. True children of Abraham are those who exhibit faith, mercy, and obedience, reflecting the character of their father.
