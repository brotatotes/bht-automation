# John 8:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, a difficult question is posed to Jesus, tempting Him to make a compromising statement. Jesus avoids giving a direct answer, treating it as a purely civil matter. The cunning hypocrites hoped to put Him in the wrong, but Jesus skillfully exposes their ill intentions. The woman caught in adultery is guilty and there is no possibility of denying it. Her shameful consciousness and lack of defense betray her guilt.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The difficulty is even greater than the last, to say, in what sense this was a temptation, to lead to His accusation."
2. "But what reason had any of His sayings, who came to fulfil the Law, not to destroy it, given them to expect such mildness in this case?"
3. "Since Jesus seems to avoid every kind of decision on the question put to Him, it follows that He found in it no reference to the great subjects of His teaching, but treated it as a purely civil or political matter, with which in His ministry He had no concern."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
