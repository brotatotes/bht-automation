# John 8:41 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, Jesus confronts the Jews about their true spiritual lineage and relationship with God. The commentators emphasize that the people speaking, though claiming to be descendants of Abraham, are actually following the example and deeds of the devil. They are warned not to falsely claim a relationship with God, as it could align them with evil. Jesus makes it clear that their actions reveal their true identity, and the stark contrast between the ways of God and the ways of the devil is highlighted.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "They now let fall Abraham as their father, being convicted of unlikeness to him."
2. "They see that a spiritual paternity must be meant, and accordingly refer to God as their Father."
3. "And spiritually the τέκνα πορνείας, ref. Hosea, are idolaters."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "We be not born of fornication." - This phrase emphasizes that the people speaking are not illegitimate in their religious heritage. They are not merely pretending to be God's people, but are truly descended from Abraham, God's chosen. 

2. "We have one Father, God." - This statement highlights the unity and common ancestry of the people. They all share the same Father, God, which strengthens their claim to be the true children of God.

3. "They were not an illegitimate race in point of religion." - This phrase further emphasizes that the people are not illegitimate or false in their religious identity. They are not a fabricated or counterfeit race, but are genuinely connected to God through their lineage.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "When the Saviour delivered an awful or an offensive truth, he always approached the mind so that the truth might make the deepest impression."
2. "We have the evidence of our genealogy. We are worshippers of the true God, descended from those who acknowledged him, and we acknowledge no other God and Father than him."
3. "To be children of fornication is an expression denoting in the Scriptures idolatry, or the worship of other gods than the true God."

Note: The commentary is referring to John 8:38, where Jesus confronts the Jews about their true spiritual lineage and their relationship with God.

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Ye do." - This phrase emphasizes the ongoing and active nature of the action being described. It suggests that the individuals addressed are currently engaged in the behavior mentioned, highlighting the need for immediate attention and change.

2. "Fornication [πορνειας]." - The Greek word "πορνειας" refers to sexual immorality or illicit sexual behavior. This term carries a broader connotation than just physical acts of adultery or premarital sex. It encompasses any form of sexual activity that goes against God's design for human relationships.

3. "From pernhmi, to sell." - The root word for "fornication" in Greek, "pernhmi," carries the idea of selling oneself. This suggests that engaging in sexual immorality involves a transaction or exchange, where individuals are giving up their purity, integrity, and self-worth for temporary pleasure or personal gain. It highlights the destructive nature of such behavior and the need for repentance and restoration.

### John Calvin:
1. "They who have corrupted the seed of life are at the farthest remove from being the children of God, though, according to the flesh, they are not bastards, but pretend a right to the plausible title of the Church."
2. "Let them go about the bush as much as they please, still they will never avoid the discovery that the only ground of their arrogant boasting is, 'We have succeeded the holy fathers; therefore, we are the Church.'"
3. "Never indeed will hypocrites cease to employ the name of God falsely, with most wicked effrontery; but those false grounds of boasting, on which they plume themselves, will never cease to appear ridiculous in the eyes of all who shall abide by the decision of Christ."

### Philip Schaff:
1) "The words of Jesus have made two things clear: (1) He is not referring to national origin, but to spiritual descent; and (2) the father whose sons Jesus declares them to be is not good but evil."
2) "Their spiritual is as undoubted as their natural descent. 'Whatever may be the case with others (the word 'we' is strongly emphatic), there is no stain on our origin.'"
3) "And if we bear in mind the regular meaning which the word 'fornication' bears in Old Testament prophecy, when used in such a connection as this, viz. the unholy alliance with idols instead of Jehovah (Jeremiah 3:1, etc.), it will appear very probable that John 8:48 gives the clue to the meaning here."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Ye do the works of your father. Who is not Abraham and not God as Jesus plainly indicates."
2. "This they said as a proud boast. Jesus had admitted that they were physical descendants of Abraham, but now denies that they are spiritual children of Abraham."
3. "It is vaguely possible that in this stern denial the Pharisees may have an indirect fling at Jesus as the bastard son of Mary."

Note: The provided commentary is an analysis of John 8:41-42.

### John Gill:
1. "Ye do the deeds of your father,.... Not Abraham, but the devil."
2. "we be not born of fornication: meaning either literally, that they were not a brood of bastards, children of whoredom, illegitimately begotten in unlawful copulation, or wedlock; or figuratively, that they were not the children of idolaters, idolatry being called fornication in Scripture."
3. "we have one Father, [even] God; Israel being called by God his Son, and firstborn to them belonged the adoption, in a national sense, and of this they boasted; though few of them were the children of God by special adoption, or God their Father by regenerating grace."

### John Wesley:
1. "Ye do the deeds of your father" - This statement implies that actions speak louder than words, and one's true identity is revealed through their behavior.
2. "When they presumed to call God their Father" - This highlights the danger of falsely claiming a relationship with God, as it can lead to aligning oneself with evil.
3. "He is expressly called the devil" - This direct identification of the devil as the father of those who oppose Jesus emphasizes the stark contrast between the ways of God and the ways of the devil.
