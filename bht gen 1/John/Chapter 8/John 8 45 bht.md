# John 8:45 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The commentators provide insights on a Bible verse that emphasizes the opposition to Jesus' message of truth. They highlight the irony that people's disbelief stems not from Jesus speaking falsehoods, but from His unwavering commitment to the truth. The commentators suggest that the rejection of truth reveals a deeper spiritual condition, characterized by a preference for deceit and a resistance to confronting one's own lies. In a world filled with falsehoods, speaking the truth requires courage and integrity, as it disrupts established narratives and forces individuals to confront uncomfortable realities.
