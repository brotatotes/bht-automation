# John 8:48 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, individuals direct intense and virulent scorn towards Jesus, accusing him of being a Samaritan and having a devil, implying his divergence from their interpretation of the law. The term "Samaritan" carries the weight of contempt and reproach, as Samaritans were regarded as heretics and schismatics. Calling Jesus a Samaritan not only questions his lineage but also suggests that he is hostile to the true law and kingdom of God. The accusers resort to these insults in their rage and fury, grasping for any means to discredit Jesus.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "They imply, that He differed from their interpretation of the law, or perhaps, as He had convicted them of not being the genuine children of Abraham, they cast back the charge with a senseless ‘Tu quoque.’" 
2. "There may perhaps be a reference to the occurrence related in ch. John 4:5 ff.; but Schöttgen (p. 371) has shewn that 'Samaritanus es' is found in the Rabbis as addressed to one whose word is not to be believed."
3. "As in the first clause they sundered Him from the communion of Israel, so now from that of Israel’s God."

2. "The 'say we not well' refers to Hebrews 12:3" - This quote suggests that the phrase "say we not well" is a reference to Hebrews 12:3, which encourages believers to consider Jesus' endurance of hostility from sinners.

3. "It is possible that the Jews may have heard something of our Lord’s short sojourn in Samaria, and of the favour which He had then shown to that despised people: such a parable as that of the Good Samaritan may have been so used by enemies as to give colour to an accusation of favouring Samaria and slighting Judea."

### Archibald T Robertson:
