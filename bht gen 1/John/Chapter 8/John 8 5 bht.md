# John 8:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the time of Jesus' ministry, there arose a debate about the punishment for adultery. The Law of Moses commanded death for the guilty party, but the specific method of punishment was disputed among commentators. Some believed it was by stoning, as prescribed for a betrothed woman. Others proposed strangulation for married women. Regardless, the woman brought before Jesus was a betrothed virgin, making stoning a likely outcome. Jesus' response to her accusers foreshadowed the defeat of his enemies and demonstrated his authority over the interpretation of the Law.
