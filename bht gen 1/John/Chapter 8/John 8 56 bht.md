# John 8:56 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Abraham, the father of many nations, had a spiritual understanding of the coming of Christ's kingdom. He rejoiced and eagerly desired to see the day when the Messiah would come, though he did not witness it in his lifetime. Through faith and the promises given to him, he saw the fulfillment of God's plan for salvation, symbolically represented in the binding of Isaac and the sacrifice of the ram. Abraham's joy and anticipation testify to his faith in the promised blessing for all nations through his "seed."
