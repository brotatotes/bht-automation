# John 8:57 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, the skepticism and disbelief of the people towards Jesus are evident. They question his authority and wisdom based on his supposed age of not yet fifty years. This age is significant, representing completed manhood and maturity according to Jewish tradition. However, the people misunderstood Jesus' words, twisting his teachings and failing to grasp His true meaning. Despite their doubts, Jesus asserts his superiority over Abraham to reveal His divine nature.
