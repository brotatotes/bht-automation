## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "All unbiassed exegesis of these words must recognize in them a declaration of the essential præ-existence of Christ."
2. "The distinction between γενέσθαι and εἰμί is important. 'Antequam nasceretur Abraham, ego sum' (Erasmus)."
3. "In this verse the God-head of Christ is involved; and this the Jews clearly understood, by their conduct to Him."

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "The statement therefore is not that Christ came into existence before Abraham did (as Arians affirm is the meaning), but that He never came into being at all, but existed before Abraham had a being; in other words, existed before creation, or eternally."
2. "In that sense the Jews plainly understood Him, since 'then took they up stones to cast at Him,' just as they had before done when they saw that He made Himself equal with God."
3. "hid himself—(See on John 1:1- :)."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Verily, verily - This is an expression used only in John. It is a strong affirmation denoting particularly the great importance of what was about to be affirmed."
2. "The expression I am, though in the present tense, is clearly designed to refer to a past time. Applied to God, it denotes continued existence without respect to time, so far as he is concerned."
3. "The question here was about his pre-existence. The objection of the Jews was that he was not 50 years old, and could not, therefore, have seen Abraham. Jesus replied to that that he existed before Abraham. As in his human nature he was not yet 50 years old, and could not, as a man, have existed before Abraham, this declaration must be referred to another nature."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Abraham 's life was under the conditions of time, and therefore had a temporal beginning."
2. "Jesus ' life was from and to eternity."
3. "Hence the formula for absolute, timeless existence, I am [εγω ειμι]."

### John Calvin:
1. "Before Abraham was, I am." - By these words, Christ claims a power more than human, a power heavenly and divine, that reaches from the beginning of the world through all ages. It is a testimony of his Divine essence and the eternal Divinity of Christ.

2. "The power and grace of Christ, so far as he is the Redeemer of the world, was common to all ages." - The efficacy of Christ's grace and redemption extends throughout history, making his presence and work relevant and powerful in every era.

3. "He does not say, Before Abraham was, but, Before Abraham was made; which implies that Abraham had a beginning." - Christ's use of the phrase "Before Abraham was made" emphasizes that Abraham, like all human beings, had a beginning, while Christ himself existed eternally. This highlights the distinction between the eternal Divinity of Christ and the temporal nature of humanity.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "In the clearest possible manner Jesus declares, not only His existence before Abraham, but also the essential distinction between His being and that of any man."
2. "He claims for Himself that absolute, unchanging existence which is the attribute of God alone."
3. "The conduct of the Jews...clearly understood them to be a distinct (and in their mind a blasphemous) claim of that which belonged to God alone."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Before Abraham came into existence or was born."
2. "Jesus claims eternal existence."
3. "The contrast between the entrance into existence of Abraham and timeless being is complete."

### John Gill:
1. "Before Abraham was, I am; which is to be understood, not of his being in the purpose and decree of God, foreordained to sufferings, and to glory; for so all the elect of God may be said to be before Abraham, being chosen in Christ before the foundation of the world."
2. "This is to be understood of the deity, eternity, and immutability of Christ, and refers to the passage in Exodus 3:14. 'I am that I am--I am hath sent me unto you', the true Jehovah."
3. "He appeared in an human form to our first parents before Abraham was, and was manifested as the Mediator, Saviour, and living Redeemer, to whom all the patriarchs before Abraham looked, and by whom they were saved."
