# John 8:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this passage, a woman is brought before Jesus by the scribes and Pharisees, seeking to trap him. His response is one of intentional inattention, as he stoops down and begins writing on the ground. This act causes the accusers to persist, hoping to accuse Jesus either of contradicting Moses or usurping Roman authority. Jesus' silence and writing demonstrate his unwillingness to engage in their trap, instead highlighting their unworthiness of being heard. Through his actions, Jesus conveys his mission to save rather than condemn.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The habit was a usual one to signify pre-occupation of mind, or intentional inattention."
2. "The additions προσποιούμενος or μὴ προσπ . are glosses."
3. "This minute circumstance speaks strongly for the authenticity of the narration."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "He wished to show them His aversion to enter on the subject."
2. "But as this did not suit them, they 'continue asking Him,' pressing for an answer."
3. "At last, raising Himself He said."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "They might allege that it was not the giving an opinion about an abstract case, but that she was formally before him, that he decided her case judicially, and that without authority or form of trial."
2. "By this Jesus showed them clearly that he was not solicitous to pronounce an opinion in the case, and that it was not his wish or intention to intermeddle with the civil affairs of the nation."
3. "The most probable reason seems to be that he did not wish to intermeddle; that he designed to show no solicitude to decide the case; and that he did not mean to decide it unless he was constrained to."

### John Calvin:
1. "Christ rather intended, by doing nothing, to show how unworthy they were of being heard."
2. "Thus in the present day, when Satan attempts, by various methods, to draw us aside from the right way of teaching, we ought disdainfully to pass by many things which he holds out to us."
3. "Delays of this sort, which do nothing but hinder the progress of the Gospel, are wisely disregarded."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The common answer is that, if Jesus pronounced for the sparing of the woman, His enemies would raise an outcry against Him as contradicting Moses; that if, on the contrary, He pronounced her worthy of death, they would accuse Him to the Roman Government as usurping powers which belonged to it alone."
2. "Will Jesus reply to their question, No? They will instantly rouse the multitude against Him as contradicting Moses. Will He reply. Yes? They will stone the woman on the spot. Then the Roman Government will itself interpose, and Jesus will be seized as the instigator of the deed of blood."
3. "Jesus will not heed them at the first: it will lend more weight to His reply if it be not too quickly given. We are not to imagine that what He wrote was a sentence to be pronounced. He was not thus to assume the office of a judge. What He wrote was probably some text or precept of Divine truth which, had He not been interrupted, He would have proceeded to explain to the people."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "This laying of traps for Jesus was a common practice of his enemies."
2. "The use of κατω (down) gives a vivid touch to the picture."
3. "Certainly Jesus knew how to write."

### John Gill:
1. "For they brought this woman, and exposed her in this manner, not because of their abhorrence and detestation of the sin; nor did they put the above question to Christ, out of their great respect to the law of Moses; which in many instances, and so in this, they in a great measure made void, by their traditions." 

2. "Their view in this was, that they might have to accuse him; that should he agree with Moses, then they would accuse him to the Roman governor, for taking upon him to condemn a person to death, which belonged to him to do; or they would charge him with severity, and acting inconsistently with himself, who received such sort of sinners, and ate with them."

3. "But Jesus stooped down, and with his finger wrote on the ground; some think he wrote in legible characters the sins of the woman's accusers; and the learned Wagenseil makes mention of an ancient Greek manuscript he had seen, in which were the following words, 'the sins of everyone of them'."

(Note: The commentary is quite lengthy, but these quotes provide a concise summary of the main points discussed.)

### John Wesley:
1. "That they might have to accuse him — Either of usurping the office of a judge, if he condemned her, or of being an enemy to the law, if he acquitted her."
2. "Jesus stooping down, wrote with his finger on the ground — God wrote once in the Old Testament; Christ once in the New: perhaps the words which he afterward spoke, when they continued asking him."
3. "By this silent action, he, 1, fixed their wandering, hurrying thoughts, in order to awaken their consciences: and, 2, signified that he was not then come to condemn but to save the world."
