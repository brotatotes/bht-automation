# John 9:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The neighbors, out of hostility to Jesus, bring the formerly blind man to the Pharisees for examination. These religious leaders, considered knowledgeable and self-proclaimed guardians of Israel's religious institutions, deliberate as a group. Their focus is on external observance rather than understanding Jesus' teachings and recognizing his divine works. In their reluctance to acknowledge the truth, they prioritize their own traditions and rules over the evidence of miracles and the message of the Gospel. Such hypocrisy and pride obstruct their ability to see God's work and hinder their recognition of Jesus' true identity.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The neighbours appear to have brought him to the Pharisees, out of hostility to Jesus."
2. "The Pharisees here may have been the court presiding over the synagogue, or one of the lesser local courts of Sanhedrim."
3. "Meyer regards them as some formal section of the Pharisees, as a body: but were there such?"

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "The Pharisees, being the religious leaders of the time, were often consulted on matters of religious significance. Their position of authority and influence made them a natural choice for people to bring their concerns or questions to."

2. "Sitting in council suggests that the Pharisees were deliberating and making decisions as a group. This indicates that the matter brought to them was of importance and required their collective wisdom and judgment."

3. "The fact that the Pharisees were mainly from the same sect highlights their shared beliefs and practices. This unity within their group would have influenced their decision-making process and the outcome of the matter at hand."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The Pharisees' intention in questioning Jesus was not to seek the truth or understand his teachings, but rather to find fault with him and accuse him of breaking the Sabbath."

### John Calvin:
1. "The restoration of sight to the blind man ought undoubtedly to have softened even hearts of stone; or, at least, the Pharisees ought to have been struck with the novelty and greatness of the miracle, so as to remain in doubt for a short time, until they inquired if it were a divine work."
2. "Hypocrisy is always proud and cruel. Being swelled with a false opinion of their holiness, they were chiefly wounded by the doctrine of the Gospel, which condemned all their counterfeit righteousnesses; and above all, they fought for their power and kingdom, under the pretense of endeavoring to maintain the Law."
3. "It is a foolish superstition of the common people that, under the pretense of honoring God, they adore the wicked tyrants of the Church, and despise God himself, both in his word and in his works, or, at least, do not deign to look at him."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "They bring him to the Pharisees as the especial guardians of the religious institutions of Israel."
2. "The less formal and judicial their action was, the better does it illustrate the conflict of Jesus with the spirit of Judaism."
