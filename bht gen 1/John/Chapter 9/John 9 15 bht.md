# John 9:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Amidst the inquiry conducted by the Pharisees, they question the blind man who was healed by Jesus. The man's response to their questioning aligns with the details conveyed to his neighbors, showing consistency in his testimony. However, his account to the Pharisees is less comprehensive, perhaps due to prior interactions between them. Notably, he omits specific details regarding Jesus' actions, focusing solely on the undeniable fact of his miraculous healing.
