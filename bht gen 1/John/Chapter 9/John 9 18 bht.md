# John 9:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this particular Bible verse, a hostile party disbelieves in a miraculous healing performed by Jesus. They question the authority figures and parents involved, hoping to cast doubt on the authenticity of the healing. Despite the clear evidence before them, their own blind hatred of Christ prevents them from accepting the truth. Their persistent refusal to believe and their attempts to find alternative explanations only serve to expose their own malice and ignorance. This interaction highlights the division and persecution faced by those who follow Jesus.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The hostile party, disappointed at his direct testimony against them." 
2. "Those in authority among these variously-minded Pharisees." 
3. "The parents are summoned as witnesses."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Foiled by the testimony of the young man himself, they hope to throw doubt on the fact by close questioning his parents, who, perceiving the snare laid for them, ingeniously escape it by testifying simply to the identity of their son, and his birth-blindness, leaving it to himself, as a competent witness, to speak as to the cure."
2. "They prevaricated, however, in saying they 'knew not who had opened his eyes,' for 'they feared the Jews,' who had come to an understanding... that whoever owned Him as the Christ would be put out of the synagogueâ€”that is, not simply excluded, but excommunicated."
3. "The fear of man brings a snare; but he who puts his trust in the Lord shall be safe (Proverbs 29:25)."

### Marvin Vincent:

2. "The change from the Pharisees to the Jews highlights the division on this miracle."

2. "If the reason be asked, there can be no doubt that their blindness was voluntary. For what prevents them from seeing an obvious work of God placed before their eyes; or, after having been fully convinced, what prevents them from believing what they already know, except that the inward malice of their heart keeps their eyes shut?"
3. "Warned by such examples, let us learn not to bring upon ourselves those obstacles which drive us away from the faith."
