# John 9:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Pharisees, in an attempt to challenge the authenticity of the blind man's healing, cleverly employ a string of questions. By targeting the identity, past condition, and cause of the man's sight, they hope to find a flaw to discredit the miracle. Their interrogations not only expose their desperate disbelief, but also reveal their ulterior motives to accuse both the man and Jesus. This line of questioning serves to highlight the power of Jesus' miracles and expose the stubbornness and unbelief of the religious leaders.

1. "Had they answered to this in the negative, they would have got an advantage against him, and would have convicted him of a lie, since he had given out that he was the son of such parents; and proving such a lie upon him, would at once have brought the whole affair into suspicion at least."
