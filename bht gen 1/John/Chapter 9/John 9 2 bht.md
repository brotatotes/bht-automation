# John 9:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
It was believed by the Jews that physical ailments and calamities were often punishments for sin, either committed by the individual himself or by his parents. They even held the belief that an unborn child could sin and suffer consequences. However, not all commentators agreed with this notion. Some questioned how an unborn child could have sinned, while others noted that individual responsibility for sin was important. Jesus emphasized that not all afflictions were directly tied to personal sin, highlighting his power to heal the blind.
