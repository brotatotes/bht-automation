# John 9:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, we see a significant event take place, hinting at an interval between previous incidents. It involves a resolution made by the Sanhedrim, the Jewish council. The resolution, possibly related to a confession of Christ, leads to a form of excommunication, excluding the confessor from the synagogue. Being excommunicated meant not only exclusion from religious gatherings but also social isolation, instilling fear in others. This severe punishment aimed to maintain religious purity and authority, demonstrating the consequences of going against the religious leaders' teachings and decisions.
