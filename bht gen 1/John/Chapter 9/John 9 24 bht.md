# John 9:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the midst of a heated discussion, the Pharisees confront a man who was healed by Jesus, urging him to "give God the praise" but with the underlying intention of denying the authenticity of the miracle and discrediting Jesus. The phrase serves as an adjuration to speak the truth and acknowledge the presence of God. Despite the Pharisees' skepticism and false accusations against Jesus, the man is called to glorify God and acknowledge His divine power as the source of the miraculous healing.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Not, ‘Give God the praise’ (E. V.), i.e. ‘the glory of thy healing:’ for the Pharisees want to overawe the man by their authority, and make him deny the miracle altogether."
2. "The words are a form of adjuration (see ref. Josh.), to tell the truth, q. d. ‘Remember that you are in God’s presence, and speak as unto Him.’"
3. "Remember that you are in God’s presence, and speak as unto Him."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Give God the praise; we know that this man is a sinner." - This quote highlights the skepticism and disbelief of the Pharisees towards Jesus' miracle. They refuse to acknowledge the divine power at work and instead focus on labeling Jesus as a sinner.
2. "Not wishing him to own, even to the praise of God, that a miracle had been wrought upon him." - This quote reveals the Pharisees' unwillingness to accept the truth and give credit to God for the miracle. Their pride and prejudice blind them from recognizing the work of God.
3. "To show more regard to the honor of God than ascribe any such act to one who was a sinner." - This quote emphasizes the Pharisees' misguided priorities. They prioritize their own reputation and the honor of God over acknowledging the miraculous power of Jesus. Their focus on the sinfulness of Jesus blinds them from seeing the divine nature of his actions.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Give God the praise" - It is equivalent to an adjuration in the presence of God to acknowledge the truth; as the truth would be giving God praise, confessing the case before him, and trusting to his mercy.

2. "The meaning here is not 'give God praise for healing you,' but confess that there is imposture in the case; that you have declared to us a falsehood, that you have endeavored to impose on us; and by thus confessing your sin, give praise and honor to God, who condemns all imposture and falsehood, and whom you will thus acknowledge to be right in your condemnation."

3. "To induce him to do this, they added that they knew, or were satisfied that Jesus was a sinner. As they considered that point settled, they urged him to confess that he had attempted to impose on them."

4. "We know - We have settled that. He has broken the Sabbath, and that leaves no doubt."

5. "A sinner - A violator of the law respecting the Sabbath, and an impostor."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Give God the praise [δος δοξαν τω θεω]. Rev., give glory to God." - This quote highlights the importance of acknowledging and honoring God in our words and actions. It emphasizes the need to give credit and praise to God for His works and blessings.

2. "This phrase addressed to an offender implies that by some previous act or word he has done dishonor to God, and appeals to him to repair the dishonor by speaking the truth." - This quote explains the context of the phrase, indicating that it is used when someone has spoken or acted in a way that dishonors God. It serves as a call to repentance and a reminder to speak the truth.

3. "In this case, it is also an appeal to the restored man to ascribe his cure directly to God, and not to Jesus." - This quote suggests that the phrase is used to redirect the focus and credit to God, rather than attributing it solely to Jesus. It highlights the importance of recognizing God's power and involvement in our lives.

### John Calvin:
1. "In this way, the more fiercely they struggle against God, the more numerous are the cords which they put about their neck, and the more strongly do they bind themselves."
2. "They put the questions in such a manner as to endeavor to make the man say what they wish."
3. "By these words they reminded him that no slight insult is offered to God, when any person, in His name, commits falsehood."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Give glory to God: we know that this man is a sinner." - The Jews use this phrase to intimidate the blind man and elicit a confession. It is a reminder that speaking the truth honors God and acknowledges His watchful eye.
2. "Remembering that the eye of God was upon him, let him give honour to God by speaking truth." - This quote emphasizes the importance of truth-telling, as it is an act of honoring God and recognizing His presence in our lives.
3. "The authorities... possessed of deeper insight and wider knowledge than himself, know that Jesus is a breaker of the law." - The Jews' claim that Jesus is a lawbreaker highlights their biased perspective and refusal to acknowledge the possibility of Jesus performing miracles. It reveals their closed-mindedness and unwillingness to consider alternative explanations.

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "It was really the third time... Now it was like a joke unless the Pharisees meant to imply that his previous story was untrue." 
2. "This phrase does not mean gratitude to God... It is rather an adjuration to speak the truth." 
3. "They can no longer deny the fact of the cure... He must accept their ecclesiastical authority as proving that Jesus had nothing to do with the cure since Jesus is a sinner."

### John Gill:
1. "Give God the praise; confess this fraud and imposture before the omniscient God, the searcher of hearts, and in so doing glorify that perfection of his." 
2. "Give all the glory of it to God, to whom alone it is due, and not to him. God sometimes works by wicked instruments, when the glory of what is done ought not to be ascribed to them, but to him."
3. "They concluded from his breaking the sabbath, as they supposed; though they also aspersed his character, and accused him of other things, yet falsely."
