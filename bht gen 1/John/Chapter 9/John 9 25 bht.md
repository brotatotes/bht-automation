# John 9:25 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, a blind man boldly testifies to his miraculous healing by stating, "Being blind, I now see." He resists the Pharisees' attempts to trap him, maintaining his certainty in his personal experience. His simple yet powerful testimony not only exposes the insincerity of the Pharisees but also highlights his gratitude for the man who enabled his sight. This reminds us that, like the blind man, our spiritual enlightenment may not come with full knowledge, but we can confidently know the transformative power of Christ in our lives.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Bear in mind, that ὤν must here be strictly kept to its present sense, as being joined with a present verb βλέπω: the rule for the construction of a pres. part. being, that it is contemporaneous with the verb which rules the time of the sentence."
2. "So that we must render, not ‘whereas I WAS blind, now I see,’ as E. V.: but as A.V.R., being a blind man [or, though a blind man], now I see."
3. "The shrewd and naïve disposition of the man furnishes the key to the ænigmatical expression. He puts it to them as the problem, the fact of which he knows for certain but the reason of which it was for them to solve, that he, whom they all knew as a blind man, now saw."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Not that the man meant to insinuate any doubt in his own mind on the point of His being 'a sinner,' but as his opinion on such a point would be of no consequence to others."
2. "He would speak only to what he knew as fact in his own case."
3. "Whether he be a sinner or no, &c."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "By his saying that he did not know whether he was a sinner may be meant that though he might be a prophet, yet that he might not be perfect; or that it did not become him, being an obscure and unlearned man, to attempt to determine that question."
2. "What follows shows that he did not believe that he was a sinner, and these words were probably spoken in irony to deride the Pharisees."
3. "The man reminded them that the question was not whether Jesus was a sinner; that, though that might be, yet it did not settle the other question about opening his eyes, which was the chief point of the inquiry."

### John Calvin:
1. "The blind man appears not to have been at all prevented by fear from giving a sincere testimony."
2. "He had already confessed that Christ was a Prophet, (verse 17.) Perceiving that he gains nothing by doing so, he suspends his judgment about the person."
3. "While he makes this admission in their favor, he is not free from ridiculing them."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "His simplicity leaves them no real excuse for condemning."
2. "By his steel fast adherence to the one testimony which he alone was competent to render, he most effectually brings condemnation on his judges."
3. "Had they been sincere, they would first have sought certain knowledge of the fact."

Note: The commentary provides insight into the blind man's response to the Pharisees' questioning. It highlights the simplicity and certainty of his testimony, which exposes the insincerity and lack of genuine investigation on the part of the Pharisees.

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "One thing I know (εν οιδα). This man is keen and quick and refuses to fall into the trap set for him."
2. "He passes by their quibbling about Jesus being a 'sinner' (αμαρτωλος) and clings to the one fact of his own experience."
3. "Whereas I was blind, now I see (τυφλος ων αρτ βλεπω). Literally, 'Being blind I now see.'"

### John Gill:
1. "Whatever charges you bring against the person that has done me this favour, which I am not able to answer to, you cannot reason me out of this; this I am sure of, that once I had no eyes to see with, and now I have, and that by the means of this man you reproach."
2. "And so it is with persons enlightened in a spiritual sense, whatever things they may be ignorant of, though they may not know the exact time of their conversion, nor have so much Gospel light and knowledge as others... yet this they know, that they were once blind, as to the knowledge of spiritual things..."
3. "Now they are comfortably assured, they see the exceeding sinfulness of sin, the plague of their own hearts, the insufficiency of their righteousness to justify them before God, and the beauty, fulness, suitableness, and ability of Christ as a Saviour."
