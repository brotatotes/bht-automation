2. "Not wishing him to own, even to the praise of God, that a miracle had been wrought upon him." - This quote reveals the Pharisees' unwillingness to acknowledge the divine intervention in the blind man's healing. They were more concerned with discrediting Jesus than recognizing the power of God at work.

3. "To show more regard to the honor of God than ascribe any such act to one who was a sinner." - The commentary highlights the Pharisees' misplaced priorities.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "His defense of Jesus they regarded as proof that he was his follower, and this they now attempted to show was inconsistent with being a friend of Moses and his law."

### John Calvin:
1. "For, in their opinion, he could not be a disciple of Christ without revolting from the Law of Moses; and they expressly represent these two things as inconsistent with each other."
2. "It is a very plausible pretence, that they are afraid of revolting from the doctrine of Moses. For this is the true rule of piety, that we ought to listen to the prophets, by whom we certainly know that God has spoken; that our faith may not be carried about by any doctrines of men."
3. "If Christ be the soul of the Law, as Paul tells us, what will the Law be when separated from him, but a dead body?"

"Whether the man distinctly intended such reference to himself or not, it is thus that they understood his words." - This quote emphasizes the misunderstanding and misinterpretation of the man's words by the people.
