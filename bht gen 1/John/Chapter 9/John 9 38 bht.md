### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The word 'worshipped' in this verse comes from the Greek word 'προσεκυνησεν' which implies a deep reverence and adoration towards someone or something. It signifies an act of bowing down and paying homage to a higher authority." 

2. "The act of worship is not just about external gestures, but it is a reflection of the heart's posture towards God. It is an expression of our love, respect, and submission to Him." 

3. "When we worship God, we acknowledge His greatness, His sovereignty, and His worthiness. It is an act of surrendering ourselves to Him and recognizing His authority over our lives."

### John Calvin:
1. "The word which the Evangelist employs (προσέκυνησει) means nothing more than to express respect and homage by bending the knee, or by other signs."
2. "I think that it denotes something rare and uncommon; namely, that the blind man gave far more honor to Christ than to an ordinary man, or even to a prophet."
3. "The blind man, convinced that Jesus was the Son of God, nearly lost the command of himself, and, in rapturous admiration, bowed down before him."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The simple and immediate answer shows how little remained to be done to make his faith complete."
2. "Not with bodily senses only, but in his heart, he has seen Jesus; he has heard His word: he believes and worships the Son of man, the Messiah, his Lord."
3. "The Light will attract some out of the darkness: the Light will repel others into yet deeper darkness."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Lord, I believe (Πιστευω, κυριε). Κυριε here = Lord (reverence, no longer respect as in John 9:36). A short creed, but to the point."
2. "And he worshipped him (κα προσεκυνησεν αυτω). Ingressive first aorist active indicative of προσκυνεω, old verb to fall down in reverence, to worship."
3. "It is tragic to hear men today deny that Jesus should be worshipped. He accepted worship from this new convert as he later did from Thomas who called him 'God' (John 20:28)."
