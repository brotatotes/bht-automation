# John 9:39 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, Jesus speaks about the transformative power of His coming. Commentators explain that He came not only to restore physical and spiritual sight but also to reveal the true nature of humanity. His presence brings judgment, separating those who humbly acknowledge their blindness and seek the light from those who arrogantly think they can see but are spiritually blind. Through His coming, Jesus exposes the need for redemption and offers the illumination and salvation that can only be found in Him.
