# John 9:40 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Pharisees, with their pride and self-assuredness, ask the question with indignation, taking offense at being compared to the ignorant common people. Their arrogance is evident in their perception of themselves as wise and learned, watching Jesus closely to find ways to challenge him. However, deep down, they suspect that Jesus is referring to them, exposing their own spiritual blindness and questioning their esteemed position as leaders.
