# John 9:41 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
If the people truly acknowledged their blindness and lack of knowledge, they would not be held accountable for their sin. However, because they claim to see and reject the light of Jesus, their sin remains and they are without excuse. Their obstinacy and willful rejection of truth leaves them without remedy for their guilt.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:

1. "If ye were blind, ye would not have sin: but now ye say, We see; your sin abideth." - Jesus highlights the irony that if they were truly blind, they would not be held accountable for rejecting the light.

2. "They are their own judges. They themselves say, We see; and yet they come not to Him." - The commentary emphasizes that the people are aware of their ability to see, yet they refuse to come to Jesus. They are their own judges, accountable for their actions and choices.
