# John 9:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, Jesus performs a miraculous healing of a blind man. Although the methods Jesus uses seem unconventional, they serve a purpose. By spitting on the ground and making clay, Jesus challenges the religious traditions and interpretations of the law. He shows that true healing power comes from Him alone, not from physical means or rituals. This miracle also demonstrates the essence of faith, as the blind man displays unwavering trust in Jesus and willingly follows His instructions. Ultimately, this passage reinforces the notion that God's power extends beyond human understanding and the limitations of worldly methods.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The virtue especially of the saliva jejuna, in cases of disorders of the eyes, was well known to antiquity."
2. "No rule can be laid down which our Lord may seem to have observed, as to using, or dispensing with, the ordinary human means of healing."
3. "Whatever the means used, the healing was not in them, but in Him alone."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "These operations were not so incongruous in their nature as might appear" - The commentator suggests that although the actions of spitting on the ground and making clay may seem strange, they were not completely unrelated to the miracle that followed.

2. "It were absurd to imagine that they contributed in the least degree to the effect which followed" - The commentator dismisses the idea that the physical actions performed by Jesus had any direct impact on the healing of the blind man.

3. "See on John 7:33" - The commentator refers to another passage in the book of John that may provide further insight or context to the actions of Jesus in this particular miracle.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Jesus, therefore, by making this spittle, showed them that their manner of keeping the day was superstitious, and that he dared to do a thing which they esteemed unlawful."
2. "He showed that their interpretation of the law of the Sabbath was contrary to the intention of God, and that his disciples were not bound by their notions of the sacredness of that day."
3. "In such instances the prophet showed that the miracle was performed by power communicated through him; so, in this case, Jesus by this act showed to the blind man that the power of healing came from him who anointed his eyes."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The spittle was regarded as having a peculiar virtue, not only as a remedy for diseases of the eye, but generally as a charm, so that it was employed in incantations."
2. "Persius, describing an old crone handling an infant, says: 'She takes the babe from the cradle, and with her middle finger moistens its forehead and lips with spittle to keep away the evil eye.'"
3. "Pliny says: 'We are to believe that by continually anointing each morning with fasting saliva (i.e., before eating), inflammations of the eyes are prevented.'"

### John Calvin:
1. "It certainly was no ordinary proof of faith, that the blind man, relying on a bare word, is fully convinced that his sight will be restored to him, and with this conviction hastens to go to the place where he was commanded."
2. "And this is the trial of true faith, when the devout mind, satisfied with the simple word of God, promises what otherwise appears incredible."

3. "The kneading of the clay and spittle added another offence against the Sabbath rules of the rabbis."

### John Gill:
1. "This may be an emblem of the word of God, the eye salve of the Gospel; which is a very unlikely means in the opinion of a natural man, who counts it foolishness, of enlightening and saving sinners; and yet by this foolishness of preaching God does save those that believe."
2. "However, spittle, especially fasting spittle, might be thought proper in some disorder of the eyes, to be used, as it was by the Jews."
