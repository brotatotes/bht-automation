# John 9:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse describes a blind man being directed by Jesus to go and wash his eyes in a pool named Siloam. Commentators mention that the act of washing in the pool was symbolic and not the cause of the man's healing. The use of clay and water may symbolize the grace of the Spirit and the power of God. The blind man's obedience in following Jesus' instructions demonstrates faith and willingness to obey, even in the face of uncertainty. The commentators highlight the significance of the miracle and emphasize the importance of trust and submission to God's methods of grace.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The former is most probable, especially as the εἰς must be taken with νίψαι, not with ὕπαγε, and thus would imply immersion in the pool."
2. "A beggar blind from his birth would know the localities sufficiently to be able to find his way; so that there is no necessity to suppose a partial restoration of sight before his going."
3. "I should rather regard the healing virtue imparted to the water to be denoted, as symbolical of Him who was sent, and whose mission it was to give the healing water of life."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The prescribed action was purely symbolical in its design."
2. "The Evangelist notices the symbolical name of the pool as in this case bearing testimony to him who was sent to do what it only symbolized."
3. "The pool is used figuratively to denote 'the streams that make glad the city of God,' and which, humble though they be, betoken a present God of Israel."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It is clear that the waters had no efficacy themselves to open the eyes of a blind man, but it is probable that he directed him to go there to test his obedience, and to see whether he was disposed to obey him in a case where he could not see the reason of it."
2. "This case shows us that we should obey the commands of God, however unmeaning or mysterious they may appear."
3. "God has always a reason for all that he directs us to do, and our faith and willingness to obey him are often tried when we can see little of the reason of his requirements."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The water flows into it through a subterraneous conduit from the Fountain of the Virgin, and the waters are marked by an ebb and flow." 
2. "Many expositors find a typical significance in the fact of Christ's working through the pool of this name."
3. "Jesus, in sending the man away from Him, is keeping Himself before him in everything connected with his cure."

### John Calvin:
1. "Christ freely made use of those outward symbols, on various occasions, for adorning his miracles, either to accustom believers to the use of signs, or to show that all things were at his disposal, or to testify that every one of the creatures has as much power as he chooses to give them."
2. "As man was at first made of clay, so in restoring the eyes Christ made use of clay, showing that he had the same power over a part of the body which the Father had displayed in forming the whole man."
3. "He perhaps ordered the blind man to wash in it, in order to reprove the Jews for not being able to discern the power of God when present."


### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Certainly bathing the eyes is good for eye trouble, and yet we are not to infer that the cure was due to the use of the clay or to the washing."
2. "The word κολυμβηθρα (from κολυμβαω, to swim) is a common word for swimming-pool, in N.T. only here and John 5:2; John 5:7."
3. "Jesus had healed him. He was tested by the demand to bathe his eyes."

### John Gill:
1. "This blind man was sent, not to wash himself all over, but only his face or eyes; and so the Arabic and Persic versions read, 'wash thy face'; the clay from it: this may be emblematical of the grace of the Spirit, sometimes signified by water and washing, which accompanying the word, makes it effectual to the salvation of souls."
2. "This interpretation of the word Siloam does not determine which of the pools is meant, the upper or lower, 'Siloah' or 'Shelah', since they both come from the word שלח, which signifies to 'send'; but by the flexion of the word, the upper pool 'Siloah' seems plainly intended, which was not so forenamed, as Nonus suggests, from the sending this man thither, but rather from the sending forth its waters, which flowed softly and gently for the supply of the city of Jerusalem."
3. "He did as he was commanded; he was obedient to the directions and orders of Christ, though they seemed so unlikely to answer the end; and yet that was brought about through the divine power of Christ, which appeared the more in making use of such unlikely means."

### John Wesley:
1. "Perhaps our Lord intended to make the miracle more taken notice of."
2. "He believed, and obeyed, and found a blessing."
3. "Lord, may our proud hearts be subdued to the methods of thy recovering grace!"
