# choicest prompt v1 X bht prompt v3; ['Henry Alford', 'Jamieson Fausset Brown', 'Albert Barnes', 'Marvin Vincent', 'John Calvin', 'Philip Schaff', 'Archibald T Robertson', 'Adam Clarke']

## Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Jude therefore calls himself modestly 'brother of James.'" 
2. "God the Father’s love is the element in which they are 'beloved.'" 
3. "Jude, beforehand, mentions the source and guarantee for the final accomplishment of believers’ salvation; lest they should be disheartened by the dreadful evils which he proceeds to announce."

## Albert Barnes:
1. "Jude sustained a near relation to the Lord Jesus, being, as James was, 'the Lord's brother.'"
2. "We may learn from the fact that Jude merely calls himself 'the servant of the Lord Jesus,' that is, a Christian, (a)That this is a distinction more to be desired than, would be a mere natural relationship to the Saviour."
3. "The meaning is, that they owed their preservation wholly to him; and if they were brought to everlasting life, it would be only by him."

## Marvin Vincent:
1. "He does not call himself an apostle, as Paul and Peter in their introductions, and seems to distinguish himself from the apostles." 
2. "That Jude does not allude to his relationship to the Lord may be explained by the fact that the natural relationship in his mind would be subordinate to the spiritual." 
3. "He would shrink from emphasizing a distinction to which none of the other disciples or apostles could have a claim, the more so because of his former unbelief in Christ's authority and mission."

## John Calvin:
1. "Whosoever is not called, arrogates to himself presumptuously the right and authority of teaching."
2. "It is a confirmation to the faith, when the integrity of the man who undertakes the office of a teacher is made certain to us."
3. "He intimates that men do not anticipate God, and that they never come to him until he draws them."

## Philip Schaff:
1. "If he were, as suggested in the Introduction, the brother of our Lord as well as of James, neither of whom speaks of his relation to Christ, the omission is probably owing to the fact that the human relation was temporary and entirely subordinate to the higher relation of spiritual fellowship."
2. "Our affection for Christians springs from their relation to Christ and their likeness to Him, as our love for God’s children rests on the same grounds. This is the brotherly love of the Gospel as distinguished from the love of good-will."
3. "The safety of all who believe is the Father’s answer to the Son. God keeps us as we keep His word. 'God keeps us for Jesus Christ;' we 'keep ourselves in the love of God'."

## Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Precisely as James, only James added κυριου (Lord)." 
2. "But not the 'Judas of James' (Luke 6:16; Acts 1:13)." 
3. "Beloved in God the Father."

## Adam Clarke:
1. "Sanctified signifies here consecrated to God through faith in Christ."
2. "Preserved in (or by) Jesus Christ — Signifies those who continued unshaken in the Christian faith."
3. "Saints is the same as Christians; to become such they were called to believe in Christ by the preaching of the Gospel, and having believed, were preserved by the grace of Christ in the life and practice of piety."


# BHT:
The verse being described speaks of a humble writer, who emphasizes his spiritual relationship rather than his natural one to the Lord. Through this relationship, believers find their source of salvation and are protected by God's love. It focuses on the distinction of being called, the importance of integrity in teachers, and the drawing of believers to God. The verse holds the message of consecration, preservation, and the unity of believers as they are beloved in God's grace through faith in Jesus Christ.
