### Albert Barnes:
1. "Jude sustained a near relation to the Lord Jesus, being, as James was, 'the Lord's brother.'"
2. "We may learn from the fact that Jude merely calls himself 'the servant of the Lord Jesus,' that is, a Christian, (a)That this is a distinction more to be desired than, would be a mere natural relationship to the Saviour."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "He does not call himself an apostle, as Paul and Peter in their introductions, and seems to distinguish himself from the apostles." 
2. "That Jude does not allude to his relationship to the Lord may be explained by the fact that the natural relationship in his mind would be subordinate to the spiritual."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "If he were, as suggested in the Introduction, the brother of our Lord as well as of James, neither of whom speaks of his relation to Christ, the omission is probably owing to the fact that the human relation was temporary and entirely subordinate to the higher relation of spiritual fellowship."
2. "Our affection for Christians springs from their relation to Christ and their likeness to Him, as our love for God’s children rests on the same grounds. This is the brotherly love of the Gospel as distinguished from the love of good-will."

### John Gill:
1. "He styles himself 'the servant of Jesus Christ'; though this is a title common to all believers, yet here, and in some other places, it is peculiar to an apostle, or minister of the Gospel; and therefore is used not merely in humility, and to acknowledge obedience to Christ, but as a title of dignity and honour."
2. "The elect of God are by God the Father sanctified and set apart in the act of election, which is expressed by this word; partly because of its separating nature, men being by it separated from the rest of the world, to the use and service of God, and for his glory, so that they are a distinct and peculiar people."
3. "Those who are sanctified, or set apart by God the Father in election, are in Christ, for they are chosen in him; they have a place in his heart, and they are put into his hands, and are in him, and united to him as members to an head, and were represented by him in the covenant of grace; and being in him, they are preserved by him."
