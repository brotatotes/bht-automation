## Henry Alford:
1. "These on the other hand, whatever things they know not, speak evil of."
2. "But whatever things naturally, as the irrational animals, they understand."
3. "In 2 Peter 2:12, the comparison to irrational creatures is not confined to the sort of knowledge which they have, but is extended to the persons themselves and their conduct."

## Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "They understand not, namely, the things of the spiritual world."
2. "Whatever things naturally (by natural, blind instinct), as the unreasoning animals, they know."
3. "The former 'know' implies deeper knowledge; the latter 'know,' the mere perception of the animal senses and faculties."

## Albert Barnes:
1. "These false and corrupt teachers employ reproachful language of those things which lie wholly beyond the reach of their vision."
2. "Their knowledge was confined to those things. They did not rise above them to the intelligent contemplation of those higher things, against which they used only the language of reproach."
3. "They live only for sensual indulgence, and sink deeper and deeper in sensual gratifications."

## Marvin Vincent:
1. "They know not [ουκ οιδασιν]. Mental comprehension and knowledge, and referring to the whole range of invisible things."
2. "The other verb in this verse, also translated by A. V. know (ejpistantai, originally of skill in handicraft), refers to palpable things; objects of sense; the circumstances of sensual enjoyment."
3. "Naturally [φυσικως]. Only here in New Testament. Compare fusika, natural, 2 Peter 2:12."

## Philip Schaff:
1. "They rail at whatever they know not the whole range of invisible and heavenly things, and even the nobler sentiments of our nature." 
2. "Even these they abuse, for they surrender themselves to them, and in these destroy (or corrupt) themselves; and so they are worse than brutes." 
3. "Drunkenness and like abuses of natural appetite are sins of man only."

## Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Whatsoever things they know not" - This phrase highlights the ignorance of those being referred to in the verse, emphasizing their lack of knowledge or understanding. 

2. "Naturally" - The use of this word suggests that the actions or behaviors being described are inherent or instinctive, rather than learned or intentional. 

3. "The rest of the sentence is smoother" - This comment suggests that the sentence structure or wording in this particular verse flows more smoothly or seamlessly compared to another verse in the Bible.

## Adam Clarke:
1. "They do not understand the origin and utility of civil government; they revile that which ever protects their own persons and their property."
2. "They are destitute of reflection; their minds are uncultivated; they follow mere natural instinct, and are slaves to their animal propensities."
3. "In the indulgence of their animal propensities, they corrupt themselves, beyond the example of the brute beasts."

# BHT:
The verse being described discusses those who speak evil of things they do not understand, behaving like irrational animals. Their knowledge is limited to worldly, sensory experiences, lacking comprehension of spiritual truths. These individuals live solely for indulgence, sinking deeper into sensual gratification. Their ignorance pertains not only to their understanding, but also extends to their conduct, resembling that of wild creatures. Their minds are uncultivated, devoid of reflection, and they corrupt themselves through their pursuit of base instincts.
