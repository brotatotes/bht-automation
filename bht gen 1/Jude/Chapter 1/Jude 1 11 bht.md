# choicest prompt v1 X bht prompt v3; ['Henry Alford', 'Jamieson Fausset Brown', 'Albert Barnes', 'Marvin Vincent', 'John Calvin', 'Philip Schaff', 'Archibald T Robertson', 'Adam Clarke']

## Henry Alford:
1. "Woe unto them...for they went by the way of Cain" - The comparison to Cain highlights the selfish regard and envy that was at the root of his sin.

2. "and rushed after the error of Balaam for reward" - This phrase emphasizes the reckless pursuit of personal gain, similar to how Balaam was deceived by the promise of reward.

3. "and perished in the gainsaying of Korah" - The reference to Korah illustrates how they, like Korah, despised God's ordinances and perished as a result.

## Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "The root of [Cain's] sin was hatred and envy of the godly, as it is the sin of these seducers."
2. "Reckless of what it costs, the loss of God's favor and heaven, on they rush after gain like Balaam."
3. "When we read of Korah perishing by gainsaying, we read virtually also of these perishing in like manner through the same: for the same seed bears the same harvest."

## Albert Barnes:
1. "They have gone in the way of Cain...they have shown that they are proud, corrupt, and wicked." 
2. "They ran greedily after the error of Balaam for reward...that they give themselves up to anything." 
3. "They are 'identified' with him in their character and doom...perish...often used to denote future punishment."

## Marvin Vincent:
1. "Woe [ουαι]. Often used by our Lord, but never elsewhere except here and in Revelation." 
2. "A strong expression, indicating a reckless, abandoned devotion of the energies, like the Latin effundi."
3. "In the practice of gainsaying like Korah's."

Note: The commentary is discussing the usage of the word "woe" in the Bible, the meaning of the phrase "ran greedily," and the significance of the term "gainsaying" in relation to Korah's actions.

## John Calvin:
1. "He only shewed briefly, by the example of Michael, how intolerable was their madness when they insolently reproached what God honored."
2. "But when Michael forbore extreme severity (otherwise lawful), what madness was it to observe no moderation towards those excelling in glory?"
3. "He says that they were deceived like Balaam by a reward, because they adulterated the doctrine of true religion for the sake of filthy lucre."

## Philip Schaff:
1. "Woe is to them, a description of their miserable condition, present or future, uttered as a warning to others." 
2. "Their sin is strongly condemned, and they are said to have been punished; but a cry of horror on taking in at one glance the whole course of their ungodliness, and its final plunge into the dark abyss."
3. "Like [Cain] have they lived, gratifying the passions and selfish instincts of their nature, in contempt of the warnings of God and His word."

## Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Woe to them" - Interjection with the dative as is common in the Gospels (Matthew 11:21).
2. "In the way of Cain" - Cain is Jude's fourth example, not in II Peter, but in Hebrews 11:4; 1 John 3:11. From Genesis 4:7.
3. "Ran riotously" - First aorist passive indicative of εκχεω, to pour out, "they were poured out," vigorous metaphor for excessive indulgence. But it is used also of God's love for us (Romans 5:5).

## Adam Clarke:
1. "They have gone in the way of Cain — They are haters of their brethren, and they that are such are murderers; and by their false doctrine they corrupt and destroy the souls of the people." 
2. "The error of Balaam — For the sake of gain they corrupt the word of God and refine away its meaning, and let it down so as to suit the passions of the profligate."
3. "Gainsaying of Core. — See the account of the rebellion of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram, and their company, in Numbers 22:0. It appears that these persons opposed the authority of the apostles of our Lord, as Korah and his associates did that of Moses and Aaron; and St. Jude predicts them a similar punishment."


# BHT:
Woe to those who have gone astray, following in the selfish and envious footsteps of Cain, exhibiting hatred and corrupting the souls of others. They recklessly pursue personal gain, distorting the word of God to suit their own desires, just as Balaam did. Like Korah, they defy authority and oppose the message of truth, leading to their inevitable destruction. The warning of woe serves as a reminder of the consequences that await those who engage in such sinful behavior.
