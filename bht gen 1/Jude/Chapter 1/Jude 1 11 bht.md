### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The root of [Cain's] sin was hatred and envy of the godly, as it is the sin of these seducers."
2. "Reckless of what it costs, the loss of God's favor and heaven, on they rush after gain like Balaam."
3. "When we read of Korah perishing by gainsaying, we read virtually also of these perishing in like manner through the same: for the same seed bears the same harvest."

Note: The commentary is discussing the usage of the word "woe" in the Bible, the meaning of the phrase "ran greedily," and the significance of the term "gainsaying" in relation to Korah's actions.

### John Calvin:
1. "He only shewed briefly, by the example of Michael, how intolerable was their madness when they insolently reproached what God honored."
2. "But when Michael forbore extreme severity (otherwise lawful), what madness was it to observe no moderation towards those excelling in glory?"

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Woe is to them, a description of their miserable condition, present or future, uttered as a warning to others." 
2. "Their sin is strongly condemned, and they are said to have been punished; but a cry of horror on taking in at one glance the whole course of their ungodliness, and its final plunge into the dark abyss."
3. "Like [Cain] have they lived, gratifying the passions and selfish instincts of their nature, in contempt of the warnings of God and His word."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Woe to them" - Interjection with the dative as is common in the Gospels (Matthew 11:21).
2. "In the way of Cain" - Cain is Jude's fourth example, not in II Peter, but in Hebrews 11:4; 1 John 3:11. From Genesis 4:7.
3. "Ran riotously" - First aorist passive indicative of εκχεω, to pour out, "they were poured out," vigorous metaphor for excessive indulgence. But it is used also of God's love for us (Romans 5:5).

1. "For they have gone in the way of Cain; which was a way of envy... destitute of grace... in an unregenerate estate, and upon the brink of ruin and destruction."
