# choicest prompt v1 X bht prompt v3; ['Henry Alford', 'Jamieson Fausset Brown', 'Albert Barnes', 'Marvin Vincent', 'John Calvin', 'Philip Schaff', 'Archibald T Robertson', 'Adam Clarke']

## Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "The reference to 'clouds...winds...waves of the sea' accords with this image of rocks." 
2. "Feasting is not faulty in itself, but it needs to be accompanied with fear of forgetting God." 
3. "Professors without practice."

## Albert Barnes:
1. "They were as dangerous in the church as hidden rocks are in the ocean."
2. "The Lord’s Supper, called a feast or festival of love, because it revealed the love of Christ to the world."
3. "They are not cut down - leaving a stump that might sprout again - but they are extirpated root and branch; that is, they are wholly worthless."

## Marvin Vincent:
1. "These men were no longer mere blots, but elements of danger and wreck."
2. "Feeding themselves; and so Rev., shepherds that feed themselves; further their own schemes and lusts instead of tending the flock of God."
3. "As clouds which seem to be charged with refreshing showers, but are born past and yield no rain."

## John Calvin:
1. "For he calls those feasts charities, (ἀγάπαις,) which the faithful had among themselves for the sake of testifying their brotherly unity."
2. "These unprincipled men, though promising much, were yet barren within and empty, like clouds driven by stormy winds, which give hope of rain, but soon vanish into nothing."
3. "He then calls them trees unfruitful, rooted up, and twice dead; as though he had said, that there was no sap within, though leaves might appear."

## Philip Schaff:
1. "These are they who are sunken rocks, seen indeed, but their true nature concealed, in your feasts of charity." 
2. "Feeding themselves as they do without fear, and in contempt of the woe which is pronounced against such shepherds." 
3. "Clouds without water, empty, useless, easily carried along therefore by the wind, ostentatious and deceptive wherever they go."

## Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Hidden rocks (σπιλαδες). Old word for rocks in the sea (covered by the water), as in Homer, here only in N.T." 
2. "Love-feasts (αγαπαις). Undoubtedly the correct text here, though A C have απαταις as in 2 Peter 2:14. For disorder at the Lord's Supper (and love-feasts?) see 1 Corinthians 11:17-34."
3. "Shepherds that feed themselves (εαυτους ποιμαινοντες). 'Shepherding themselves.' Cf. Revelation 7:17 for this use of ποιμαινω."

## Adam Clarke:
1. "The feasts of charity, the αγαπαι or love feasts, of which the apostle speaks, were in use in the primitive Church till the middle of the fourth century, when, by the council of Laodicea, they were prohibited to be held in the Churches; and, having been abused, fell into disuse." 
2. "Feeding themselves without fear — Eating, not to suffice nature, but to pamper appetite. It seems the provision was abundant, and they ate to gluttony and riot. This abuse is never likely to take place among the Methodists, as they only use bread and water; and of this the provision is not sufficient to afford the tenth part of a meal."
3. "Clouds - without water — The doctrine of God is compared to the rain, Deuteronomy 32:2, and clouds are the instruments by which the rain is distilled upon the earth. These false teachers are represented as clouds; they have the form and office of the teachers of righteousness, and from such appearances pure doctrine may be naturally expected: but these are clouds without water-they distil no refreshing showers, because they have none; they are carried away and about by their passions, as those light fleecy clouds are carried by the winds."


# BHT:
In this verse, a group of false teachers is portrayed using vivid imagery. They are like hidden rocks in the sea, dangerous and treacherous. These individuals feast in the name of love, but their lack of reverence for God is the root of their downfall. They are depicted as shepherds who only feed themselves, neglecting their duty to care for God's flock. Like clouds without water, they give the appearance of refreshment, but ultimately offer nothing beneficial. These deceptive figures may seem genuine, but they lack substance and their teachings are empty.
