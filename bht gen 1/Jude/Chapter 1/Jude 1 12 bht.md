# Jude 12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we encounter a vivid description of false teachers and their detrimental influence on the church. These teachers are likened to hidden rocks, disguised amidst the waves of the sea, posing a hidden danger. They participate in love feasts, but instead of fostering brotherly love as intended, they selfishly feed themselves, disregarding the needs of others. Like clouds without water, they promise refreshment but ultimately bring disappointment and deception. They are unfruitful trees, uprooted and devoid of life, having no genuine substance or impact. These individuals are twice dead, living in sin and having forsaken their initial faith.

1. "The reference to 'clouds...winds...waves of the sea' accords with this image of rocks." 
2. "Feasting is not faulty in itself, but it needs to be accompanied with fear of forgetting God." 
3. "Professors without practice."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "They were as dangerous in the church as hidden rocks are in the ocean."
2. "The Lord’s Supper, called a feast or festival of love, because it revealed the love of Christ to the world."
3. "They are not cut down - leaving a stump that might sprout again - but they are extirpated root and branch; that is, they are wholly worthless."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "These men were no longer mere blots, but elements of danger and wreck."
2. "Feeding themselves; and so Rev., shepherds that feed themselves; further their own schemes and lusts instead of tending the flock of God."
3. "As clouds which seem to be charged with refreshing showers, but are born past and yield no rain."

### John Calvin:
1. "For he calls those feasts charities, (ἀγάπαις,) which the faithful had among themselves for the sake of testifying their brotherly unity."
2. "These unprincipled men, though promising much, were yet barren within and empty, like clouds driven by stormy winds, which give hope of rain, but soon vanish into nothing."
3. "He then calls them trees unfruitful, rooted up, and twice dead; as though he had said, that there was no sap within, though leaves might appear."

1. "Hidden rocks (σπιλαδες). Old word for rocks in the sea (covered by the water), as in Homer, here only in N.T." 
2. "Love-feasts (αγαπαις). Undoubtedly the correct text here, though A C have απαταις as in 2 Peter 2:14. For disorder at the Lord's Supper (and love-feasts?) see 1 Corinthians 11:17-34."
3. "Shepherds that feed themselves (εαυτους ποιμαινοντες). 'Shepherding themselves.' Cf. Revelation 7:17 for this use of ποιμαινω."

### John Gill:
1. "The design of [the love feasts] was to maintain and promote brotherly love, from whence they took their name; and to refresh the poor saints, that they might have a full and comfortable meal now and then."
2. "They were quickly abused... by excluding the poor, for whose benefit they were chiefly designed; and by setting up separate meetings for them, and by admitting unfit persons unto them."
3. "They are compared to clouds for their number, being many false prophets and antichrists that were come out into the world; and for their sudden rise, having at once, and at an unawares, crept into the churches; and for the general darkness they spread over the churches, making it, by their doctrines and practices, to be a dark and cloudy day."

### John Wesley:
1. "Feeding themselves without fear — Without any fear of God, or jealousy over themselves." 
2. "Twice dead — In sin, first by nature, and afterwards by apostasy." 
3. "Plucked up by the roots — And so incapable of ever reviving."
