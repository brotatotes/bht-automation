# choicest prompt v1 X bht prompt v3; ['Henry Alford', 'Jamieson Fausset Brown', 'Albert Barnes', 'Marvin Vincent', 'John Calvin', 'Philip Schaff', 'Archibald T Robertson', 'Adam Clarke']

## Henry Alford:
1. "The wicked are like the troubled sea, whose waters cast up mire and dirt."
2. "These professing Christians, by their profession lights in the world, instead of letting that light shine on more and more into the perfect day, are drifting about in strange errors of doctrine and practice."
3. "They are like wandering stars, for whom the blackness of darkness is reserved for ever."

## Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Raging - wild. Jude has in mind the shame - plural in Greek, 'shames'." 
2. "Wandering stars - instead of moving on in a regular orbit, as lights to the world." 
3. "Bursting forth on the world like erratic comets, or rather, meteors of fire, with a strange glare, and then doomed to fall back again into the blackness of gloom."

## Albert Barnes:
1. "They are like the wild and restless waves of the ocean... as wild and ungovernable in their passions as the billows of the sea."
2. "What they impart is as unsubstantial and valueless as the foam of the ocean waves, and the result is in fact a proclamation of their own shame."
3. "The sense seems to be, that the aid which we derive from the stars, as in navigation, is in the fact that they are regular in their places and movements, and thus the mariner can determine his position."

## Marvin Vincent:
1. "Raging waves, by nature untamed."
2. "Foaming out, like the wild expression of nature."
3. "Wandering stars, shining briefly before fading into darkness."

## John Calvin:
1. "Being inflated with pride, they breathed out, or rather cast out the scum of high-flown stuff of words in grandiloquent style."
2. "They brought forth nothing spiritual, their object being on the contrary to make men as stupid as brute animals."
3. "With the more care and reverence ought the simplicity of Scripture to be studied, lest, by reasoning more refinedly than is right, we should not draw men to heaven, but on the contrary be involved in manifold labyrinths."

## Philip Schaff:
1. "They are at once rocks and waves, wild waves of the sea, which ‘cannot rest,’ and throw up only ‘mire and dirt’ (Isaiah 57:20)." 
2. "Foaming out their own shame, their lusts ‘disgraceful.’"
3. "Wandering stars (comets or meteors, not planets), which neither light the world nor guide the mariner, but after blazing awhile drift into ‘the blackness and darkness which is kept (‘in reserve’) for them, and into which they sink and sink ‘for ever.’"

These quotes highlight the vivid imagery used in the commentary to describe the character and destiny of the individuals being referred to in the verse. They emphasize the destructive nature and ultimate fate of these individuals.

## Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Wild waves, like untamed animals of the forest or the sea." 
2. "Foaming out, like the foaming waves." 
3. "Wandering stars, stars wanderers."

## Adam Clarke:
1. "Raging waves of the sea, foaming out their own shame... These are like the sea in a storm, where the swells are like mountains; the breakers lash the shore, and sound like thunder; and the great deep, stirred up from its very bottom, rolls its muddy, putrid sediment, and deposits it upon the beach." 

2. "Wandering stars... are uncertain, anomalous meteors, ignes fatui, wills-o'-the-wisp; dancing about in the darkness which themselves have formed, and leading simple souls astray."

3. "The blackness of darkness... are such as are going headlong into that outer darkness where there is wailing, and weeping, and gnashing of teeth."


# BHT:
The verse described speaks of individuals who are like untamed waves, turbulent and uncontrollable, casting up mire and dirt. These individuals are compared to wandering stars, shining briefly before fading into darkness, leading others astray. Their words and actions are like foaming waves, empty and disgraceful, ultimately leading to their own shame. Their destiny is described as sinking into the blackness of darkness, a place of eternal suffering and regret. The vivid imagery used by the commentators paints a picture of the destructive nature and ultimate fate of these individuals.
