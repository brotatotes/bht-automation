3. "Jude thus shows the antiquity of the prophecies. There were only five fathers between Enoch and Adam. The seventh from Adam prophesied the things which shall close the seventh age of the world."

1. "He wished to repeat from the oldest antiquity what the Spirit had pronounced respecting them: and this is what the words intimate; for he says expressly that he was the seventh from Adam, in order to commend the antiquity of the prophecy, because it existed in the world before the flood." (quote 1)

2. "The past tense, after the manner of the prophets, is used for the future. He says, that the Lord would come with ten thousand of his saints; and by saints he means the faithful as well as angels; for both will adorn the tribunal of Christ, when he shall descend to judge the world." (quote 2)

3. "He says, ten thousand, as Daniel also mentions myriads of angels, in order that, the multitude of the ungodly may not, like a violent sea, overwhelm the children of God; but that they may think of this, that the Lord will sometime collect his own people, a part of whom are dwelling in heaven, unseen by us, and a part are hid under a great mass of chaff."
