## Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Enoch foretold Jehovah’s coming to judgment, so Lamech presumes on impunity in polygamy and murder."

## John Calvin:

3. "Their words were hard, on account of the refractory audacity, by which, being elated, they acted insolently."

## Philip Schaff:
1. "The characteristic of the antediluvians, as of those whom Jude addresses, is ungodliness: four times is this quality named, first and last and midst, in the description."
2. "The double meaning of the Greek word is only half represented by ‘convince,’ and only half by ‘convict;’ both meanings are in the word, though the second meaning is the predominant one here."
3. "The book contains many absurdities (e.g. the women with whom the angels had intercourse brought forth giants six thousand feet high, who first devoured all the produce of the earth, and then began to devour men themselves); and it differs in several particulars from Jude’s statements."

# BHT:
In a mysterious and loaded verse, the coming of judgment and the ungodliness of the antediluvians are intertwined. Impunity in polygamy and murder is presumed, while hard and rough speeches characterize the ungodly sinners. The wicked actions and words of men are called into judgment, causing fear and watchfulness in the elect. Despite the doubts cast on its composition and Analogy, the verse serves as a refrain, reminding us of the impending justice and conviction.
