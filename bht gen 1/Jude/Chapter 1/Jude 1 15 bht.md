# Jude 15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This biblical verse describes the coming judgment of God, foretold by Enoch, where both the righteous and the ungodly will be held accountable for their actions and words. The judgment will be a definitive sentence, granting life and happiness to the righteous and condemning the wicked to death and misery. It will serve to convict the ungodly in their own consciences, as their ungodly deeds and hard speeches against God will be brought to light. This judgment is a cause for fear and watchfulness for the elect, as the wicked's audacious and insolent behavior is called into account.
