# Jude 16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse describes a group of individuals who constantly find fault with their circumstances and complain against both God and fellow men. They indulge their own desires without restraint and are characterized by a chronic discontentment. They hold those of wealth and influence in high regard, hoping to gain some advantage from their association. Their words are full of grandiosity, but their true nature is marked by a mean and fawning disposition.

2. "Complainers [μεμψιμοιροι] . From memfomai, to find fault with, and moira, a part or lot. Lit., blamers of their lot." 

3. "Having men's persons in admiration [θαυμαζοντες προσωπα] . The Rev., shewing respect of persons, is neater, but the A. V. more literal : admiring the countenances. Compare Genesis 19:21, Sept., 'I have accepted thee :' lit., have admired thy face."

Nowhere else in N.T. with προσωπα, but a Hebraism (in Leviticus 19:15; Job 13:10) like λαμβανειν προσωπον (Luke 20:21) and βλεπειν προσωπον (Matthew 22:16) and προσοπωλεμπτεω (James 2:9)."
