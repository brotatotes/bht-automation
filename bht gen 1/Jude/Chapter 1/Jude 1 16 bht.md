# choicest prompt v1 X bht prompt v3; ['Henry Alford', 'Jamieson Fausset Brown', 'Albert Barnes', 'Marvin Vincent', 'John Calvin', 'Philip Schaff', 'Archibald T Robertson', 'Adam Clarke']

## Henry Alford:
1. "These are murmurers, dissatisfied with their lot, walking according to their lusts."
2. "Their mouth speaking great swelling things, admiring men's persons."
3. "For the sake of advantage, holding mere outward appearances, dignities, of men in admiration."

## Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "The secret of their murmuring and complaining is the restless insatiability of their desires."
2. "Great swelling words - men's persons - their mere outward appearance and rank."
3. "While they talk great swelling words, they are really mean and fawning towards those of wealth and rank."

## Albert Barnes:
1. "The sense is that of repining or complaining under the allotments of Providence, or finding fault with God’s plans, and purposes, and doings."
2. "Nothing is more common than for men to complain of their lot; to think that it is hard; to compare theirs with that of others, and to blame God for not having made their circumstances different."
3. "Giving unlimited indulgence to their appetites and passions."
4. "Showing great respect to certain persons, particularly the rich and the great."
5. "Because they hoped to derive some benefit to themselves."

## Marvin Vincent:
1. "Murmurers [γογγυσται] . Only here in New Testament. Doubtless, originally, with some adaptation of sound to sense, gongustai. It is used of the cooling of doves." 

2. "Complainers [μεμψιμοιροι] . From memfomai, to find fault with, and moira, a part or lot. Lit., blamers of their lot." 

3. "Having men's persons in admiration [θαυμαζοντες προσωπα] . The Rev., shewing respect of persons, is neater, but the A. V. more literal : admiring the countenances. Compare Genesis 19:21, Sept., 'I have accepted thee :' lit., have admired thy face."

## John Calvin:
1. "They who indulge their depraved lusts, are hard to please, and morose, so that they are never satisfied."
2. "He condemns their proud language, because they haughtily made a boast of themselves; but at the same time he shows that they were mean in their disposition."
3. "We may render the words 'Grumblers and fault-finders,' that is, as the word means, with their own lot: they grumbled or murmured against others, and were discontented with their own condition; and yet walked in such a way as made their lot worse and occasioned still more grumbling."

## Philip Schaff:
1. "They are characterized by a chronic discontent with everything and everybody, with their own lot especially the providence and ways of God." 
2. "They are walking ever after their own lusts, disregarding any restraints or moral boundaries." 
3. "Their reverence is reserved for the possessors of wealth and influence, those whom they hope to gain favor from."

## Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Murmurers (γογγυστα) in the LXX (Exodus 16:8; Numbers 11:1; Numbers 11:14-29)."
2. "Complainers (μεμψιμοιρο) from μεμφομα to complain and μοιρα lot or fate."
3. "Showing respect of persons (θαυμαζοντες προσωπα). Present active participle of θαυμαζω to admire, to wonder at. Nowhere else in N.T. with προσωπα, but a Hebraism (in Leviticus 19:15; Job 13:10) like λαμβανειν προσωπον (Luke 20:21) and βλεπειν προσωπον (Matthew 22:16) and προσοπωλεμπτεω (James 2:9)."

## Adam Clarke:
1. "These are murmurers — Grudging and grumbling at all men, and at all things; complainers, μεμψιμοιροι, complainers of their fate or destiny-finding fault with God and all his providential dispensations, making and governing worlds in their own way; persons whom neither God nor man can please."
2. "Walking after their own lusts — Taking their wild, disorderly, and impure passions for the rule of their conduct, and not the writings of the prophets and apostles."
3. "Having men's persons in admiration — Time-servers and flatterers; persons who pretend to be astonished at the greatness, goodness, sagacity, learning, wisdom; c., of rich and great men, hoping thereby to acquire money, influence, power, friends, and the like."


# BHT:
The verse described in these commentaries portrays individuals who are dissatisfied and in constant complaint, walking according to their own selfish desires. They hold in high regard those who possess wealth and power, aiming to gain personal benefits. Their discontent and lack of restraint lead them to be critical of their own circumstances and envious of others. They are characterized by a chronic dissatisfaction with God's plans and providence, grumbling and fault-finding in all aspects of life.
