# Jude 18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the last days, as prophesied, there will be mockers and scoffers who ridicule and reject the truth of God's Word. These individuals actively seek to undermine the faith of believers and lead them astray from the truth. However, believers should not be discouraged by their presence, but rather stand firm in their faith, rooted in the truth of God's Word. Our response to mockery provides an opportunity to demonstrate the love, grace, and truth of Christ, shining as a light in a dark world.
