## Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "The word is found nowhere else in the New Testament."
2. "How Alford can deny that [verse] is referred to (at least in part), I cannot imagine."
3. "Jude quotes the very words of Peter as the words which the apostles used to speak to his (Jude's) readers."

## Marvin Vincent:
1. "Mockers" - This term refers to those who ridicule or scoff at the teachings and prophecies of the Bible. It highlights the presence of individuals who reject the truth and choose to mock and belittle it.

2. "Ungodly lusts" - The phrase emphasizes the sinful desires and cravings that are contrary to God's will and character. It implies that these desires are rooted in a lack of reverence and respect for God, leading individuals to pursue immoral and unrighteous actions.

3. "Lusts of ungodlinesses" - This phrase further emphasizes the nature of these desires as being ungodly and contrary to the principles of righteousness. It suggests that these lusts are not just individual instances but are representative of a broader pattern of ungodliness and rebellion against God.

## John Calvin:
1. "By the last time he means that in which the renewed condition of the Church received a fixed form till the end of the world; and it began at the first coming of Christ."
2. "After the usual manner of Scripture, he calls them scoffers who, being inebriated with a profane and impious contempt of God, rush headlong into a brutal contempt of the Divine Being."
3. "So at this day the world is full of Epicurean despisers of God, who having cast off every fear, madly scoff at the whole doctrine of true religion, regarding it as fabulous."

## Philip Schaff:
1. "There shall be mockers; only here and in 2 Peter 3:3, where it is said that they show their quality in relation to the Second Coming of the Lord."
2. "Walking after the lusts of their ungodlinesses; each begetting the other; every lust rejecting the Divine that is opposed to it, and the rejection of what is Divine ending ever in aggravated immorality."
3. "The expression here used is no doubt intended to call up the characteristic quality already described in Jude 1:15."

## Archibald T Robertson:
1. "The use of the word 'that' (οτ) in this verse indicates a direct connection to what was previously mentioned. It serves as a reminder or reinforcement of the point being made." 

2. "The absence of mockery or scoffing (εν εμπαιγμονη) in this verse sets it apart from 2 Peter 3:3. It suggests a more serious tone and emphasizes the gravity of the situation being addressed." 

3. "By not mentioning 'ungodly people' (των ασεβειων), this verse focuses on the specific individuals who were once saved but have now turned away. It highlights the personal responsibility and accountability of those who have fallen away from the faith."

## Adam Clarke:
1. "Mockers in the last time" refers to those who ridicule and reject the truth in the final days. (Jude 1:18)
2. This verse echoes similar warnings in other biblical passages, such as 1 Timothy 4:1 and 2 Timothy 3:1, highlighting the prevalence of false teachings and scoffers in the end times.
