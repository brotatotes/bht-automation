# choicest prompt v1 X bht prompt v3; ['Henry Alford', 'Jamieson Fausset Brown', 'Albert Barnes', 'Marvin Vincent', 'John Calvin', 'Philip Schaff', 'Archibald T Robertson', 'Adam Clarke']

## Henry Alford:
1. "These are they that separate, that draw lines of distinction, by walking after their own desires, not in the path of the Church’s obedience, thus separating both themselves from you, and you from themselves."
2. "He who gives himself up to the lower appetites, is σαρκικός: he who by communion of his πνεῦμα with God’s Spirit is employed in the higher aims of his being, is πνευματικός."
3. "These men have not indeed ceased to have πνεῦμα, as a part of their own tripartite nature: but they have ceased to possess it in any worthy sense: it is degraded beneath and under the power of the ψυχή, the personal life, so as to have no real vitality of its own."

## Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Separate themselves from Church communion in its vital, spiritual reality."
2. "Arrogant setting up of themselves, as having greater sanctity and a wisdom and peculiar doctrine, distinct from others, is implied."
3. "In the animal, or natural man, the spirit is sunk into subserviency to the animal soul, which is earthly in its motives and aims."

## Albert Barnes:
1. "These be they who separate themselves - That is, from their brethren and from the work of benevolence and truth."
2. "Sensual - Under the influence of gross passions and appetites."
3. "Having not the spirit - The Holy Spirit, or the spirit of true religion."

## Marvin Vincent:
1. "Make separations; i.e., cause divisions in the church."
2. "Sensual because natural and unrenewed."
3. "In contrast with this is The spirit; the higher spiritual life."

## John Calvin:
1. "He means that they separated from the Church, because they would not bear the yoke of discipline, as they who indulge the flesh dislike spiritual life."
2. "The word sensual, or animal, stands opposed to spiritual, or to the renovation of grace; and hence it means the vicious or corrupt, such as men are when not regenerated."
3. "They were doing the same thing as those mentioned by Paul in Romans 16:17. They were producing discords in the Church, and not separations from it; and by continuing in it, they became 'spots and stains' to its members."

## Philip Schaff:
1. "Separation is caused in Christian communities by three things: by heretical doctrine, by an unloving, selfish, exacting spirit, and by proud words and an ungodly life; and all three are characteristic of these teachers." 
2. "Everything they are and everything they have tends to disintegration, and the sooner the Church is rid of them the better." 
3. "He who thinks only of his own interests, emotions, tastes, is the man whom this verse describes."

## Archibald T Robertson:
1. "They who make separations... rare word, in Aristotle for making logical distinctions." 
2. "Sensual... opposed to πνευματικος. Not used by Peter." 
3. "Having not the Spirit... Probably πνευμα here means the Holy Spirit, as is plain in verse Jude 1:20."

## Adam Clarke:
1. "Who separate themselves — From the true Church, which they leave from an affectation of superior wisdom."
2. "Sensual — ψυχικοι. Animal-living as brute beasts, guided simply by their own lusts and passions."
3. "Their Bible being the manifold devices and covetousness of their own hearts; for they have not the Spirit-they are not spiritually minded; and have no Holy Ghost, no inspiration from God."


# BHT:
These individuals, described by multiple commentators, are those who separate themselves from the Church's obedience and spiritual reality. They have an arrogant and self-righteous attitude, setting themselves apart with their own peculiar doctrines. Their actions and desires are driven by earthly passions, lacking the renewal of grace. They cause divisions within the Church, displaying a selfish and ungodly character that hinders the unity and growth of the body. They lack true spirituality and the guidance of the Holy Spirit, walking in their own understanding and leading astray those who follow them.
