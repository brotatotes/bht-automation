# Jude 19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
These teachers, characterized by their separations and divisions within the Church, draw lines of distinction and walk after their own desires, separating themselves from their brethren and the vital, spiritual reality of the Church. They possess a sensual, unregenerate nature, lacking the true spiritual life that comes from the Holy Spirit. Their actions result in disintegration and discord, going against the will and practice of Christ. By renouncing religious fellowship and causing divisions, they are driven by pride and worldly ambition, rejecting the true essence of unity in the body of Christ.

2. "He who gives himself up to the lower appetites, is σαρκικός: he who by communion of his πνεῦμα with God’s Spirit is employed in the higher aims of his being, is πνευματικός."
3. "These men have not indeed ceased to have πνεῦμα, as a part of their own tripartite nature: but they have ceased to possess it in any worthy sense: it is degraded beneath and under the power of the ψυχή, the personal life, so as to have no real vitality of its own."
