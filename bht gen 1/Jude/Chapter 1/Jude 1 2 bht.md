# Jude 2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the salutation expresses the foundational aspects of the Christian faith. It begins by highlighting the crucial role of mercy, which is synonymous with God's grace and encompasses the forgiveness of sins and acceptance by God. Peace, on the other hand, signifies a harmonious relationship with God, others, and oneself, bringing comfort in all circumstances. The concept of love is central, calling believers to display love towards God, fellow believers, and the world. This emphasis on love reminds readers that it should permeate their actions and attitudes in all aspects of life.

2. "The use of the word 'peculiar' in relation to love suggests that it is not a common or ordinary kind of love. It implies a unique and distinct quality that sets it apart from worldly love. This challenges believers to strive for a higher standard of love that reflects the character of God."

3. "By emphasizing love in the salutation, Jude encourages readers to approach the rest of the book with a mindset of love. This reminds believers that even in the midst of addressing false teachings and confronting wickedness, love should be the guiding principle in their actions and attitudes."

2. "The multiplication of mercy intends an enlarged view and fresh application of it, which they sometimes stand in need of, as under desertions, when they want the sense and manifestation of it to them; and under temptations and afflictions, when they need sympathy and compassion."
