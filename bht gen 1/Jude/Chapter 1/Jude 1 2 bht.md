# choicest prompt v1 X bht prompt v3; ['Henry Alford', 'Jamieson Fausset Brown', 'Albert Barnes', 'Marvin Vincent', 'John Calvin', 'Philip Schaff', 'Archibald T Robertson', 'Adam Clarke']

## Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Mercy stands first; the mercy of Christ." 
2. "Peace in the Holy Ghost." 
3. "Love of God."

## Albert Barnes:
1. "Mercy" - in the pardon of all their sins and acceptance with God.
2. "Peace" - with God, with their fellow-men, in their own consciences, and in the prospect of death.
3. "Love" - to God, to the brethren, to all the world. What blessings are there which these do not include?

## Marvin Vincent:
1. "Love is a central theme in the book of Jude, as it is mentioned in the salutation. This highlights the importance of love in the Christian faith and reminds believers of the need to show love to one another."

2. "The use of the word 'peculiar' in relation to love suggests that it is not a common or ordinary kind of love. It implies a unique and distinct quality that sets it apart from worldly love. This challenges believers to strive for a higher standard of love that reflects the character of God."

3. "By emphasizing love in the salutation, Jude encourages readers to approach the rest of the book with a mindset of love. This reminds believers that even in the midst of addressing false teachings and confronting wickedness, love should be the guiding principle in their actions and attitudes."

## John Calvin:
1. "Mercy means nearly the same as grace in the salutations of Paul."
2. "There is no other reason why God has embraced us in love, but that he pitied our miseries."
3. "God would kindle and confirm in them mutual love."

## Philip Schaff:
1. "‘Mercy’ is used in the salutation of the pastoral epistles only except here." 
2. "'Mercy' is God’s feeling towards them; 'peace' is their condition as the result of it."
3. "'Love' is either their feeling Godward and manward as the effect of God’s grace, or it is God’s love to them that are called, in the manifold expressions of it."

## Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Be multiplied" (πληθυνθειη) is a first aorist passive optative of πληθυνω, indicating a desire for abundance and increase.
2. The same verb is used in other passages like 1 Peter 1:2 and 2 Peter 1:2, emphasizing the idea of multiplication and growth.
3. This verse encourages the reader to seek an increase in blessings and abundance, highlighting the importance of spiritual growth and expansion.

## Adam Clarke:
1. "Even the best have no merit, and must receive every blessing and grace in the way of mercy." 
2. "Mercy unto you - For even the best have no merit."
3. "Peace - With God and your consciences, love both to God and man, be multiplied - be unboundedly increased."

The verse encourages believers to seek spiritual growth and expansion, always striving for a higher standard of love that reflects the character of God.
