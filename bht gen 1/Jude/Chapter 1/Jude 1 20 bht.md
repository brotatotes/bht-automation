# choicest prompt v1 X bht prompt v3; ['Henry Alford', 'Jamieson Fausset Brown', 'Albert Barnes', 'Marvin Vincent', 'John Calvin', 'Philip Schaff', 'Archibald T Robertson', 'Adam Clarke']

## Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Building up yourselves... on THE FAITH is equivalent to building on Christ, the object of faith."
2. "The Holy Spirit teaches what we are to pray for, and how. None can pray aright save by being in the Spirit, that is, in the element of His influence."
3. "Among the charisms bestowed at the beginning of the New Testament dispensation, was the gift of prayer, bestowed on someone who prayed in the name of the rest, and taught others to pray."

## Albert Barnes:
1. "They were to 'build up themselves;' that is, they were to act as moral and responsible agents in this, or were to put forth their own proper exertions to do it."
2. "Dependent, as we are, and as all persons with correct views will feel themselves to be, yet it is proper to endeavor to do the work of religion as if we had ample power of ourselves."
3. "The phrase 'most holy faith' here refers to the system of religion which was founded on faith; and the meaning is, that they should seek to establish themselves most firmly in the belief of the doctrines, and in the practice of the duties of that system of religion."

## John Calvin:
1. "He shews the manner in which they could overcome all the devices of Satan, that is, by having love connected with faith, and by standing on their guard as it were in their watch-tower, until the coming of Christ."
2. "He bids them first to build themselves on faith; by which he means, that the foundation of faith ought to be retained, but that the first instruction is not sufficient, except they who have been already grounded on true faith, went on continually towards perfection."
3. "The way of persevering is, when we are endued with the power of God. Hence whenever the question is respecting the constancy of faith, we must flee to prayer."

## Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Building up (εποικοδομουντες). Present active participle of εποικοδομεω, old compound with metaphor of a house (οικος), common in Paul (1 Corinthians 3:9-17; Colossians 2:7; Ephesians 2:20)."

2. "On your most holy faith (τη αγιωτατη υμων πιστε). For the spiritual temple see also 1 Peter 2:3-5. See πιστις (faith) in this sense (cf. Hebrews 11:1) in 2 Peter 1:5 with the list of graces added. A true superlative here αγιωτατη, not elative."

3. "Praying in the Holy Spirit (εν πνευματ αγιω προσευχομενο). This is the way to build themselves up on their faith."

## Adam Clarke:
1. "Building up yourselves — Having the most holy faith-the Gospel of our Lord Jesus, and the writings of his apostles, for your foundation; founding all your expectations on these, and seeking from the Christ who is their sum and substance; all the grace and glory ye need." 

2. "Praying in the Holy Ghost — Holding fast the Divine influence which ye have received, and under that influence making prayer and supplication to God." 

3. "The prayer that is not sent up through the influence of the Holy Ghost is never likely to reach heaven."


# BHT:
The scripture in question encourages believers to build themselves up on their faith, akin to constructing a house on a strong foundation, relying on the teachings of Christ. This involves embracing the Gospel and the writings of the apostles, seeking grace and salvation through Christ. Additionally, believers are urged to pray in the Holy Spirit, maintaining a close connection to the Divine influence they have received, as prayer not guided by the Holy Spirit may not reach its intended destination in heaven.
