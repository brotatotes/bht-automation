# Jude 20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, believers are encouraged to actively strengthen and grow their faith, which serves as the foundation for their spirituality. By building on Christ and His teachings, they are reminded to not only have knowledge of their faith, but also to continually seek growth and improvement in their understanding. This growth is achieved through prayer, specifically by praying in the Holy Spirit, who plays a vital role in building up and sustaining their faith. Through this process, believers are reminded of the interconnectedness of faith, love, hope, and the triune nature of God.
