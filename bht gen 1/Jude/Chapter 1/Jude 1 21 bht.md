# choicest prompt v1 X bht prompt v3; ['Henry Alford', 'Jamieson Fausset Brown', 'Albert Barnes', 'Marvin Vincent', 'John Calvin', 'Philip Schaff', 'Archibald T Robertson', 'Adam Clarke']

## Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Keep yourselves - not in your own strength, but 'in the love of God,' that is, God's love to you and all His believing children, the only guarantee for their being kept safe."
2. "Man's need of watching is implied; at the same time he cannot keep himself unless God in His love keeps him."
3. "Mercy is usually attributed to the Father: here to the Son; so entirely one are they."

## Albert Barnes:
1. "Keep yourselves in the love of God" - The phrase "the love of God" may mean either God's love to us, or our love to him. The latter appears to be the sense here, because it is not a subject which could be enjoined, that we should keep up "God's love to us." We may be commanded to love him, and to "keep" ourselves in that love.

2. "Looking for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ" - This refers to the anticipation of Jesus' return to receive his people. It is a reminder to keep our focus on the hope of his mercy and salvation. 

3. "That is a point over which we can have no control, except so far as it may be the result of our obedience" - Our love for God is not something we can directly control, but it can be nurtured and strengthened through our obedience to his commands. We have the ability to choose to love and remain in that love.

## John Calvin:
1. "He has made love as it were the guardian and the ruler of our life."
2. "The right course of our calling, when we make progress in love."
3. "He would not have us to hope for eternal life, except through the mercy of Christ."

## Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Keep yourselves" - emphasizes the urgency and importance of personal responsibility in maintaining one's faith and obedience.
2. "The warning in verse Jude 1:5" - highlights the consequences of not keeping one's faith and dominion, as seen in the example of the fallen angels.
3. "Both sides (human responsibility and divine sovereignty) presented side by side" - suggests that while humans have a responsibility to keep themselves, there is also a recognition of God's sovereignty and involvement in the process.

## Adam Clarke:
1. "Keep yourselves in the love of God — By building up yourselves on your most holy faith, and praying in the Holy Ghost; for without this we shall soon lose the love of God."
2. "Looking for the mercy of our Lord — For although they were to build themselves up, and to pray in the Holy Ghost, and keep themselves in the love of God, yet this building, praying, and keeping, cannot merit heaven."
3. "After all their diligence, earnestness, self-denial, watching, obedience, &c., they must look for the MERCY of the Lord Jesus Christ, to bring them to ETERNAL LIFE."


# BHT:
This verse emphasizes the need for individuals to actively maintain their faith and keep themselves in the love of God. They are called to build themselves up in faith, pray in the Holy Spirit, and remain diligent in their obedience. While these actions on their own cannot earn salvation, they are necessary to remain in God's love. Ultimately, believers must rely on the mercy of the Lord Jesus Christ to bring them to eternal life, acknowledging both human responsibility and divine grace.
