### Albert Barnes:
1. "Keep yourselves in the love of God" - The phrase "the love of God" may mean either God's love to us, or our love to him. The latter appears to be the sense here, because it is not a subject which could be enjoined, that we should keep up "God's love to us." We may be commanded to love him, and to "keep" ourselves in that love.

2. "Looking for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ" - This refers to the anticipation of Jesus' return to receive his people. It is a reminder to keep our focus on the hope of his mercy and salvation. 

3. "That is a point over which we can have no control, except so far as it may be the result of our obedience" - Our love for God is not something we can directly control, but it can be nurtured and strengthened through our obedience to his commands. We have the ability to choose to love and remain in that love.

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Keep yourselves" - emphasizes the urgency and importance of personal responsibility in maintaining one's faith and obedience.
2. "The warning in verse Jude 1:5" - highlights the consequences of not keeping one's faith and dominion, as seen in the example of the fallen angels.
3. "Both sides (human responsibility and divine sovereignty) presented side by side" - suggests that while humans have a responsibility to keep themselves, there is also a recognition of God's sovereignty and involvement in the process.
