# choicest prompt v1 X bht prompt v3; ['Henry Alford', 'Jamieson Fausset Brown', 'Albert Barnes', 'Marvin Vincent', 'John Calvin', 'Philip Schaff', 'Archibald T Robertson', 'Adam Clarke']

## Albert Barnes:
1. "The special feeling to be manifest toward a certain class of persons in seeking their salvation was tender affection and kindness."
2. "While we are to seek to save all, we are to adapt ourselves wisely to the character and circumstances of those whom we seek to save."
3. "To be able to make a distinction in the manner of saving souls is one of the highest qualifications for a good minister of the gospel."

## Marvin Vincent:
1. "On some have mercy who are in doubt."
2. "Some who are contentious rebuke."
3. "The Rev. rendering better suits what follows."

## John Calvin:
1. "He reminds them that such ought to be treated in different ways, every one according to his disposition: for to the meek and teachable we ought to use kindness; but others, who are hard and perverse, must be subdued by terror."
2. "The meaning then is, that if we wish to consult the well-being of such as go astray, we must consider the character and disposition of every one; so that they who are meek and tractable may in a kind manner be restored to the right way, as being objects of pity; but if any be perverse, he is to be corrected with more severity."
3. "When there is a danger of fire, we hesitate not to snatch away violently whom we desire to save; for it would not be enough to beckon with the finger, or kindly to stretch forth the hand."

## Archibald T Robertson:
1. "On some (κα ους μεν). Demonstrative plural of ος μεν--ος δε (ους δε, below), not the relative ους, but by contrast (μεν, δε)."
2. "Have mercy (ελεατε). Present active imperative of ελεαω (rare form in Romans 9:16 also for the usual ελεεω Matthew 9:27)."
3. "Who are in doubt (διακρινομενους). Present middle participle of διακρινω, in the accusative case agreeing with ους μεν, though K L P have the nominative."

Note: The commentary provided is not a complete or coherent passage, but rather a collection of individual statements.

## Adam Clarke:
1. "Ye are not to deal alike with all those who have been seduced by false teachers; ye are to make a difference between those who have been led away by weakness and imprudence, and those who, in the pride and arrogance of their hearts, and their unwillingness to submit to wholesome discipline, have separated themselves from the Church, and become its inveterate enemies."
2. "Instead of Και οὑς μεν ελεειτε διακρινομενοι, and of some have compassion, making a difference, many MSS., versions, and fathers have και οὑς μεν ελεγχετε διακρινομενους, and some rebuke, after having judged them; or, rebuke those that differ; or, some that are wavering convince; or whatever else the reader pleases."
3. "For this and the following verse are all confusion, both in the MSS. and versions; and it is extremely difficult to know what was the original text. Our own is as likely as any."

Additionally, the verse highlights the discernment required in saving souls and the potential use of terror to subdue those who are hardened. The verse also mentions the concept of making a difference and exercising mercy towards those who are in doubt or wavering.
