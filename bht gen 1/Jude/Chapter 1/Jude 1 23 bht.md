# Jude 23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse in question emphasizes the urgency and duty of believers to actively save and rescue others from the destructive power of sin. It encourages using various means, such as sharp admonitions, denouncing God's judgments, and inflicting church censures, in an attempt to bring about repentance. This task requires a firm disapproval of sinful behavior, a cautious approach to avoid being contaminated by sin, and a deep hatred for sin, just as God does.
