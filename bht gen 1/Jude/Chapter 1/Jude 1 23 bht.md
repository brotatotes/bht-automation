## Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Ministers and Christians are said to 'save' those whom they are made the instruments of saving; the Greek for 'save' is present, therefore meaning 'try to save.'" 
2. "Your compassion is to be accompanied 'with fear' of being at all defiled by them." 
3. "Sin is the only thing which God hates: so ought we."

## Albert Barnes:
1. "The arguments on which they relied were to be drawn from the dangers of the persons referred to, or from the dread of future wrath."
2. "Every method is to be employed, in its proper place, that we 'by all means may save some.'"
3. "While we endeavor to save the 'sinner,' we cannot too deeply loathe his 'sins;' and in approaching some classes of sinners there is need of as much care to avoid being defiled by them, as there would be to escape the plague if we had any transaction with one who had it."

## Marvin Vincent:
1. "Snatching them out of the fire." - The writer alludes to Zechariah 3:2, emphasizing the act of rescuing someone from imminent danger or destruction.

2. "With fear [εν φοβω]." - This phrase highlights the sense of caution and awareness of the contagious nature of sin while attempting to save others.

3. "Spotted [εσπιλωμενον]." - This term, used only here and in James 3:6, suggests the defilement or contamination caused by sin, underscoring the urgency of rescuing those who are affected.

These quotes shed light on the writer's intention to emphasize the urgency and seriousness of rescuing others from the destructive power of sin.

## John Calvin:
1. "He would have the faithful not only to beware of contact with vices, but that no contagion might reach them."
2. "He reminds them that everything that borders on vices and is near to them ought to be avoided."
3. "He does not allow evil to be cherished by indulgence, so he bids all preparations and all accessories to be cut off."

## Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Snatching them out of the fire" - This phrase alludes to the urgent and immediate action required to save someone from destruction. It emphasizes the importance of actively rescuing others from harm and danger.

2. "Do Christians?" - This rhetorical question challenges believers to reflect on their role in saving others. It prompts them to consider whether they are actively involved in rescuing those who are in spiritual danger and need help.

3. "On some have mercy with fear" - This phrase highlights the need for compassion and mercy towards those who are caught in sin. It also emphasizes the importance of approaching this task with a sense of reverence and caution, recognizing the potential impact of sin on our own lives.

## Adam Clarke:
1. "Some of them snatch from the fire: but when they repent, have mercy upon them in fear."-Syriac.
2. "And some of them rebuke for their sins; and on others have mercy when they are convicted; and others save from the fire and deliver them."-Erpen's Arabic.
