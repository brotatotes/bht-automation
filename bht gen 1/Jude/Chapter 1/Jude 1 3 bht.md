# choicest prompt v1 X bht prompt v3; ['Henry Alford', 'Jamieson Fausset Brown', 'Albert Barnes', 'Marvin Vincent', 'John Calvin', 'Philip Schaff', 'Archibald T Robertson', 'Adam Clarke']

## Henry Alford:
1. "giving all diligence...to write to you concerning the common salvation" - The author emphasizes the urgency and importance of addressing the topic of salvation and the need for diligence in doing so.

2. "I found it necessary to write to you...exhorting (you) to contend earnestly for the faith" - The author highlights the necessity of writing and encourages believers to actively and passionately defend their faith.

3. "the faith once for all delivered to the saints" - The author emphasizes the unchanging and complete nature of the faith that has been entrusted to believers, highlighting the importance of preserving and upholding it.

## Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "The people should, in accordance with his admonition, give all diligence to have all Christian graces, and to make their calling sure." 
2. "This community of faith, and of the object of faith, salvation, forms the ground of mutual exhortation by appeals to common hopes and fears." 
3. "Believers, like Nehemiah’s workmen, with one hand 'build themselves up in their most holy faith'; with the other they 'contend earnestly for the faith' against its foes."

## Albert Barnes:
1. "The mental process which led to writing the Epistle seems to have been this: To write unto you of the common salvation - The salvation common to Jews and Gentiles, and to all who bore the Christian name."
2. "There are great matters of religion held in common by all Christians, and it is important for religious teachers to address their fellow Christians on those common topics."
3. "The word here rendered 'earnestly contend' - ἐπαγωνίζεσθαι epagōnizesthai - is one of those words used by the sacred writers which have allusion to the Grecian games. This word does not elsewhere occur in the New Testament. It means 'to contend upon' - i.e., 'for or about' anything; and would be applicable to the earnest effort put forth in those games to obtain the prize."

## Marvin Vincent:
1. "Beloved. Occurring at the beginning of an epistle only here and 3 John 1:2."
2. "The common salvation. The best texts add hJmwn, of us. So Rev., 'our common salvation.'"
3. "Earnestly contend [επαγωνιζεσθαι] . Only here in New Testament. The faith. The sum of what Christians believe."

## John Calvin:
1. "He then intimates, that he was indeed glad and anxious to write to them, but yet necessity urged him to do so, even because they were assailed (according to what follows) by the ungodly, and stood in need of being prepared to fight with them."
2. "For necessity adds strong stimulants. Had they not been forewarned how necessary his exhortation was, they might have been slothful and negligent; but when he makes this preface, that he wrote on account of the necessity of their case, it was the same as though he had blown a trumpet to awake them from their torpor."
3. "He says that faith had been once delivered, that they might know that they had obtained it for this end, that they might never fail or fall away."

## Philip Schaff:
1. "It was his purpose to write on the great truths of the Gospel the common property of all who believe."
2. "The word to fight, or strive earnestly, means to stand over and defend to the utmost, even to agony; 'the faith,' not quite the doctrines of Scripture, still less their belief of them, but the Gospel, as believed by Christian men."
3. "Once for all delivered points to the completeness and unchangeableness of the Gospel, and to the fact that no new revelation was to be expected."

## Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Beloved. As in 3 John 1:2." 
2. "Of our common salvation. See this use of κοινος (common to all) in Titus 1:4 with πιστις, while in 2 Peter 1:1 we have ισοτιμον πιστιν, which see."
3. "To contend earnestly. Late and rare (in Plutarch, inscriptions) compound, here only in N.T. A little additional (επ) striving to the already strong αγωνιζεσθα (αγων contest). Cf. 1 Timothy 6:12 αγωνιζου τον καλον αγωνα."

## Adam Clarke:
1. "Beloved brethren, when I saw it necessary to write to you concerning the common salvation, my mind being deeply affected with the dangers to which the Church is exposed from the false teachers that are gone out into the world, I found it extremely necessary to write and exhort you to hold fast the truth which you had received, and strenuously to contend for that only faith which, by our Lord and his apostles, has been delivered to the Christians."
2. "Some think that St. Jude intimates that he had at first purposed to write to the Church at large, on the nature and design of the Gospel; but seeing the dangers to which the Churches were exposed, because of the false teachers, he changed his mind, and wrote pointedly against those false doctrines, exhorting them strenuously to contend for the faith."
3. "The common salvation — The Christian religion, and the salvation which it brings. This is called common because it equally belongs to Jews and Gentiles; it is the saving grace of God which has appeared to every man, and equally offers to every human being that redemption which is provided for the whole world."
