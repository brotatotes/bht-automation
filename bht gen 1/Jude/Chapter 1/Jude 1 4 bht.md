# Jude 4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we find a warning about certain individuals who have infiltrated the Christian community, described as ungodly men with scandalous lives. They pervert the true meaning of God's grace and turn it into an excuse for moral licentiousness. Their actions and teachings deny the true God and Lord Jesus, calling for believers to resist them with vigilance and hold firmly to the genuine message of grace. The condemnation of these false teachers was foretold long ago, emphasizing the need for discernment and adherence to the true doctrines of the faith.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "They came in by a side door; not that they crept in from without, being really no members of the Church; but only that they came in as members, and yet had in fact, as was now clear, sentiments and habits foreign to those of a Christian community, and ought never, therefore, to have entered it at all."
2. "Their character is further defined; they are ungodly men, with whom God’s holiness is no ground of reverence, nor His law their guide, who, having broken loose from His authority, show their ungodliness in all they do."
3. "Christ is here called their one absolute Lord and Owner, not in contrast with the other persons in the Godhead, but with foreign lords who once had dominion over them."
