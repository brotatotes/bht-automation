# choicest prompt v1 X bht prompt v3; ['Henry Alford', 'Jamieson Fausset Brown', 'Albert Barnes', 'Marvin Vincent', 'John Calvin', 'Philip Schaff', 'Archibald T Robertson', 'Adam Clarke']

## Henry Alford:
1. "Crept in, viz. into the Christian church, certain men who have been of old written down in prophecy." 
2. "The previous writing down of these men can only point to the O. T. prophecies."
3. "They made the state of grace and Christian liberty into a state of (moral) licence and wantonness."

## Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Scripture is the reflection of God’s book of life in which believers are 'written among the living.'"
2. "God’s eternal character as the Punisher of sin, as set forth in Scripture 'of old,' is the ground on which such apostate characters are ordained to condemnation."
3. "The disposition and the doom of both correspond."
4. "A phrase for the Gospel especially sweet to believers who appropriate God in Christ as 'our God,' and so rendering the more odious the vile perversity of those who turn the Gospel state of grace and liberty into a ground of licentiousness."
5. "By virtue of Christ’s perfect oneness with the Father, He, as well as the Father, is termed 'the ONLY' God and 'MASTER.'"

## Albert Barnes:
1. "They professed to teach the Christian religion, when in fact they denied some of its fundamental doctrines; they professed to be holy, when in fact they were living most scandalous lives."

2. "The punishment which befell the unbelieving Israelites, the rebel angels, and the inhabitants of Sodom, awaited those persons."

3. "Their doctrines and practice tended as really to the denial of the true God as they did to the denial of the Lord Jesus."

## Marvin Vincent:
1. "The verb means to get in by the side, to slip in by a side-door." 
2. "The meaning is in dispute... It seems better, on the whole, to take it here in the temporal sense, and to render written of beforehand, i.e., in prophecy."
3. "God is omitted in the best texts."

Note: The commentary provides explanations for the Greek words used in the verse and discusses the disputed meaning of a particular word. It also mentions the omission of a word in some texts.

## John Calvin:
1. "Satan now, he says, attacks and harasses you in a peculiar manner; it is therefore necessary to take up arms to resist him." 
2. "Satan sows his tares in the night, and while husbandmen are asleep, in order that he may corrupt the seed of God."
3. "But the grace of God has appeared for a far different purpose, even that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we may live soberly, righteously, and godly in this world."

## Philip Schaff:
1. "They came in by a side door; not that they crept in from without, being really no members of the Church; but only that they came in as members, and yet had in fact, as was now clear, sentiments and habits foreign to those of a Christian community, and ought never, therefore, to have entered it at all."
2. "Their character is further defined; they are ungodly men, with whom God’s holiness is no ground of reverence, nor His law their guide, who, having broken loose from His authority, show their ungodliness in all they do."
3. "Christ is here called their one absolute Lord and Owner, not in contrast with the other persons in the Godhead, but with foreign lords who once had dominion over them."

## Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Ungodly men" - Keynote of the Epistle (Mayor), in Jude 1:15 again as in 2 Peter 2:5; 2 Peter 3:7.
2. "Turning" - Present active participle of μετατιθημ, to change, for which verb see Galatians 1:6.
3. "Denying" - So 2 Peter 2:1. See also Matthew 10:33; 1 Timothy 5:8; Titus 1:16; 1 John 2:22.

## Adam Clarke:
1. "They had got into the Church under specious pretences; and, when in, began to sow their bad seed." 
2. "In the sacred writings all such persons, false doctrines, and impure practices, have been most openly proscribed and condemned." 
3. "Making the grace and mercy of God a covering for crimes intimating that men might sin safely who believe the Gospel, because in that Gospel grace abounds."


# BHT:
In this Bible verse, certain men have crept into the Christian church, written about beforehand in prophecy. They falsely presented themselves as holy and teachers of the Christian religion, while denying its fundamental doctrines. They turned the grace and liberty of Christ into a license for immorality. Such ungodly men, who sow bad seed and deny the true God, are condemned in Scripture and their impure practices have been openly proscribed. They pervert the Gospel, making it a cover for their sinful ways, disregarding the true purpose of God's grace.
