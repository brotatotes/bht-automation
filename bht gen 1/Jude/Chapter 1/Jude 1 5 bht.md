# choicest prompt v1 X bht prompt v3; ['Henry Alford', 'Jamieson Fausset Brown', 'Albert Barnes', 'Marvin Vincent', 'John Calvin', 'Philip Schaff', 'Archibald T Robertson', 'Adam Clarke']

## Henry Alford:
1. "I wish to remind you, knowing as ye do, once for all, all things, that Jesus, having saved the people out of the land of Egypt." 
2. "The Person designated by the two names being the same, they became sometimes convertibly used in popular exhortation." 
3. "By this τὸ δεύτερον the former aor. part. is marked as being not contemporary with but antecedent to the aor. verb following."

## Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "I wish to remind you, as knowing ALL (namely, that I am referring to; so the oldest manuscripts, versions, and Fathers) once for all."
2. "Christ is said to have accompanied the Israelites in the wilderness; so perfectly is Jesus one with the God of the Israelite theocracy."
3. "Saved - brought safely, and into a state of safety and salvation."

## Albert Barnes:
1. "To show you what must be the doom of such men, I will call certain facts to your recollection, with which you are familiar, respecting the Divine treatment of the wicked in times past."
2. "The thing which seems to have been in the mind of the apostle was an intention to call to their recollection, as bearing on the case before him, facts with which they had formerly been familiar, and about which there was no doubt."
3. "It might rather be inferred from the example of the Israelites that they would be [destroyed]."

(Note: The provided commentary is quite lengthy, so I have selected three quotes that I believe best capture the essence of the commentary.)

## Marvin Vincent:
1. "The participle is to be rendered as present." 
2. "Once for all, as ver. Jude 1:0:3." 
3. "Ye know all things once for all."

## John Calvin:
1. "I only recall, he says, to your mind what you have already learnt. As he ascribes knowledge to them, so he says that they stood in need of warnings, lest they should think that the labor he undertook towards them was superfluous."
2. "The use of God’s word is not only to teach what we could not have otherwise known, but also to rouse us to a serious meditation of those things which we already understand, and not to suffer us to grow torpid in a cold knowledge."
3. "The import of what he says is, that those whom God had honored with the greatest blessings, whom he had extolled to the same degree of honor as we enjoy at this day, he afterwards severely punished. Then in vain were all they proud of God’s grace, who did not live in a manner suitable to their calling."

## Archibald T Robertson:
1. "To put you in remembrance." (υπομνησα) - This phrase emphasizes the importance of recalling and remembering certain truths or teachings. It serves as a call to remember and reflect on what has been previously learned or experienced.

2. "Though ye know all things once for all." (ειδοτας απαξ παντα) - This highlights the understanding that the readers already possess knowledge of the subject matter. It implies that they have been previously taught and are familiar with the information being discussed.

3. "The Lord." (κυριος) - This term is understood to refer to the Lord Jesus Christ. It signifies His authority and lordship. The use of this term in connection with the reference to Christ in other biblical passages further reinforces the identification of the Lord as Jesus Christ.

## Adam Clarke:
1. "I will therefore put you in remembrance, though ye are THOROUGHLY instructed in this." - The author emphasizes the need to remind the readers, even though they are already well-informed about the topic at hand.

2. "Saved the people — Delivered them from the Egyptian bondage." - This quote highlights the act of God saving the Israelites from slavery in Egypt, illustrating His power and faithfulness.

3. "Afterward destroyed them — Because they neither believed his word, nor were obedient to his commands." - This quote explains the reason for the destruction of the people, emphasizing the importance of faith and obedience in maintaining a relationship with God.


# BHT:
This verse reminds the readers of a past event where God saved the people from the land of Egypt, but later destroyed them due to their lack of belief and obedience. The readers are instructed to remember this event, even though they are already well-informed about it. It serves as a cautionary reminder of the consequences that can result from a lack of faith and obedience.
