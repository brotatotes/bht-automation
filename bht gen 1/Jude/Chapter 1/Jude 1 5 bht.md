(Note: The provided commentary is quite lengthy, so I have selected three quotes that I believe best capture the essence of the commentary.)

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The participle is to be rendered as present." 
2. "Once for all, as ver. Jude 1:0:3." 
3. "Ye know all things once for all."

### John Calvin:
1. "I only recall, he says, to your mind what you have already learnt. As he ascribes knowledge to them, so he says that they stood in need of warnings, lest they should think that the labor he undertook towards them was superfluous."
2. "The use of God’s word is not only to teach what we could not have otherwise known, but also to rouse us to a serious meditation of those things which we already understand, and not to suffer us to grow torpid in a cold knowledge."
3. "The import of what he says is, that those whom God had honored with the greatest blessings, whom he had extolled to the same degree of honor as we enjoy at this day, he afterwards severely punished. Then in vain were all they proud of God’s grace, who did not live in a manner suitable to their calling."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "To put you in remembrance." (υπομνησα) - This phrase emphasizes the importance of recalling and remembering certain truths or teachings. It serves as a call to remember and reflect on what has been previously learned or experienced.

2. "Though ye know all things once for all." (ειδοτας απαξ παντα) - This highlights the understanding that the readers already possess knowledge of the subject matter. It implies that they have been previously taught and are familiar with the information being discussed.

3. "The Lord." (κυριος) - This term is understood to refer to the Lord Jesus Christ. It signifies His authority and lordship. The use of this term in connection with the reference to Christ in other biblical passages further reinforces the identification of the Lord as Jesus Christ.

### John Gill:
1. "It is one part of the work of the ministers of the word to put people in mind of what they have known; which is necessary, because of the inattentiveness of hearers, their forgetfulness, and loss of knowledge." 

2. "The instance follows, how that the Lord, having saved the people out of the land of Egypt; that is, the people of Israel, who were the chosen people of God, a special people, above all others, and had peculiar privileges."

3. "This shows the evil nature of unbelief; and that God will not suffer sin to go unobserved in any; no outward privileges and profession will screen any from divine vengeance."

### John Wesley:
1. "He afterwards destroyed - The far greater part of that very people whom he had once saved." 
2. "Let none therefore presume upon past mercies."
3. "As if he was now out of danger."
