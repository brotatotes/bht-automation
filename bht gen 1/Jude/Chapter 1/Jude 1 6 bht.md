# choicest prompt v1 X bht prompt v3; ['Henry Alford', 'Jamieson Fausset Brown', 'Albert Barnes', 'Marvin Vincent', 'John Calvin', 'Philip Schaff', 'Archibald T Robertson', 'Adam Clarke']

## Henry Alford:
1. "μὴ τηρήσαντας conveys not only the fact, but the reason for what follows."
2. "The fact alluded to is probably that which is obscurely indicated in Genesis 6:2."
3. "The ὑπό in both cases is to be accounted for by the darkness being considered as brooding over them, and they under it."

## Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Their own principality" implies that the angels aspired higher than the dignity assigned to them under the Son of God. (Quote 1)
2. The phrase "sons of God" in Genesis 6:2 refers to the Sethites, not angels. (Quote 2)
3. The sin of the apostate angels, their ambition and falling away from God, is spiritually analogous to the sin of the Sodomites. (Quote 3)

## Albert Barnes:
1. "The word rendered 'estate' (ἀρχὴν archēn) is, in the margin, 'principality.' The word properly means, 'beginning, commencement;' and then that which surpasses others, which is 'first,' etc., in point of rank and honor; or pre-eminence, priority, precedence, princedom."
2. "The word rendered 'habitation' (οἰκητήριον oikētērion) occurs nowhere else in the New Testament. It means here that heaven was their native abode or dwelling-place."
3. "The sense is, that that deep darkness always endures; there is no intermission; no light; it will exist forever."

## Marvin Vincent:
1. "The word originally signifies beginning, and so frequently in New Testament, mostly in the Gospels, Acts, Hebrews, Catholic Epistles, and Revelation."
2. "The Jews regarded the angels as having dominion over earthly creatures; and the angels are often spoken of in the New Testament as ajrcai, principalities; as Romans 8:38; Ephesians 1:21; so that this term would be appropriate to designate their dignity, which they forsook."
3. "Under carries the sense of the darkness brooking over the fallen spirits. On darkness, see on 2 Peter 2:4."

## John Calvin:
1. "He will not then forgive our perfidy, if we depart from the grace unto which he has called us."
2. "This punishment, inflicted on the inhabitants of heaven, and on such superior ministers of God, ought surely to be constantly before our eyes, so that we may at no time be led to despise God’s grace, and thus rush headlong into destruction."
3. "But we are not to imagine a certain place in which the devils are shut up, for the Apostle simply intended to teach us how miserable their condition is, since the time they apostatized and lost their dignity."

## Archibald T Robertson:
1. "The fallen angels, accusative case after τετηρηκεν (perfect active indicative of τηρεω, for which verb see 2 Peter 2:4; 2 Peter 2:7) at the end of the verse (two emphatic positions, beginning and end of the clause)." 

2. "Both Enoch and Philo (and Milton) discuss the fallen angels." 

3. "Αιδιος (from αε, always), old adjective, in N.T. only here and Romans 1:20 (of God's power and deity). It is synonymous with αιωνιος (Matthew 25:46)."

## Adam Clarke:
1. "The angels which kept not their first estate...this is spoken of those generally termed the fallen angels; but from what they fell, or from what cause or for what crime, we know not." 
2. "One thing is certain; the angels who fell must have been in a state of probation, capable of either standing or falling, as Adam was in paradise."
3. "He hath reserved in everlasting chains...under darkness...alluding probably to those dungeons or dark cells in prisons where the most flagitious culprits were confined."


# BHT:
In this thought-provoking verse, we learn about a group of angels who did not remain faithful in their initial position of honor and authority. The commentators shed light on various aspects of these fallen angels - their ambition and desire for a higher position, their sin being spiritually analogous to the sin of the Sodomites, and the dire consequences of their rebellion. These angels are depicted as dwelling in a deep darkness that will endure forever. With insights from different commentators, we gain a deeper understanding of the verse without specifically mentioning which Bible verse is being described.
