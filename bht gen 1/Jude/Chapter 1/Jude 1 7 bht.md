# choicest prompt v1 X bht prompt v3; ['Henry Alford', 'Jamieson Fausset Brown', 'Albert Barnes', 'Marvin Vincent', 'John Calvin', 'Philip Schaff', 'Archibald T Robertson', 'Adam Clarke']

## Henry Alford:
1. "Sodom and Gomorrha, and the cities about them, following fornication in like manner to these, and going away after other flesh, are set forth as an example." 
2. "The sin of Sodom was afterwards common in the most enlightened nations of antiquity."
3. "Undergoing the just punishment of eternal fire, which shall never be quenched."

## Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Sodom, etc. - giving themselves over to fornication - following fornication extraordinarily, that is, out of the order of nature."
2. "Going after strange flesh - departing from the course of nature, and going after that which is unnatural."
3. "The lasting marks of the fire that consumed the cities irreparably, is a type of the eternal fire to which the inhabitants have been consigned."

## Albert Barnes:
1. "The cities round about Sodom...committed iniquity in the same manner as the inhabitants of Sodom did, and were set forth in the same way as an example." 
2. "The reference seems to be to the unusual sin which, from the name Sodom, has been called 'sodomy.' The meaning of the phrase 'going after' is, that they were greatly addicted to this vice."
3. "The passage...cannot be used to prove that the particular dwellers in Sodom will be punished forever...but that there is a place of eternal punishment, of which that was a striking emblem."

## Marvin Vincent:
1. "Giving themselves over to fornication...giving themselves up utterly." 
2. "Turning away from purity, and going after strange flesh." 
3. "The corruption and punishment of the cities of the plain are laid out in plain sight...held up to view as a warning."

## John Calvin:
1. "God, excepting none of mankind, punishes without any difference all the ungodly."
2. "God at that time exhibited a remarkable example, in order to keep men in fear till the end of the world."
3. "It is not, therefore, without reason that Jude strikes all ages with terror, by exhibiting the same view."

## Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Even as Jude passes by the deluge, the cities of the plain were also included, Admah and Zeboiim. Zoar, the other city, was spared." 

2. "Like the fallen angels, they have given themselves over to fornication, a horrible licentiousness, even engaging in unnatural uses of the flesh." 

3. "They are set forth as an example, a sample of those who will suffer the punishment of eternal fire."

## Adam Clarke:
1. "Even as Sodom and Gomorrha...are set forth for an example." 
2. "Both of what God will do to such transgressors, and of the position laid down in Jude 1:4."
3. "Subjected to such a punishment as an endless fire can inflict."

These quotes highlight the example of Sodom and Gomorrah as a warning of God's punishment for sinners and the eternal nature of the fire that consumed them.


# BHT:
The cities of Sodom and Gomorrah, along with their neighboring cities, serve as a powerful cautionary tale against the sinful practices of fornication and unnatural desires. The inhabitants of these cities were given over entirely to immorality and were thus subjected to the just punishment of an endless fire. The account of their destruction stands as a vivid illustration of God's unwavering judgment on the ungodly, leaving us with a sobering reminder of the eternal consequences of such actions.
