## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "This necessity precludes the whole class of meanings represented by 'de somniis, in quibus corpus polluitur:' explained by Calv., 'est metaphorica loquutio, qua significat, ipsos esse tam hebetes, ut sine ulla verecundia ad omnem turpitudinem se prostituant.'"
2. "And those being got rid of, and a fortiori the interpretation given by Bretschneider, 'falsis oraculis decepti, vel falsa oracula edentes' (see reff.), we have but this left, that the word should represent that state of dreaming in the sleep of sin, out of which men are so often called on to awake to righteousness and the light of Christ."
3. "So De Wette: similarly Huther, but understanding κυριότητα of God, and δόξας of the angels."

1. "All sinners are spiritually asleep, and their carnal activity is as it were a dream."
