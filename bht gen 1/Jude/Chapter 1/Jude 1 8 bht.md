# choicest prompt v1 X bht prompt v3; ['Henry Alford', 'Jamieson Fausset Brown', 'Albert Barnes', 'Marvin Vincent', 'John Calvin', 'Philip Schaff', 'Archibald T Robertson', 'Adam Clarke']

## Henry Alford:
1. "This necessity precludes the whole class of meanings represented by 'de somniis, in quibus corpus polluitur:' explained by Calv., 'est metaphorica loquutio, qua significat, ipsos esse tam hebetes, ut sine ulla verecundia ad omnem turpitudinem se prostituant.'"
2. "And those being got rid of, and a fortiori the interpretation given by Bretschneider, 'falsis oraculis decepti, vel falsa oracula edentes' (see reff.), we have but this left, that the word should represent that state of dreaming in the sleep of sin, out of which men are so often called on to awake to righteousness and the light of Christ."
3. "So De Wette: similarly Huther, but understanding κυριότητα of God, and δόξας of the angels."

## Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "All sinners are spiritually asleep, and their carnal activity is as it were a dream."
2. "Their speaking evil of dignities is because they are dreaming, and know not what they are speaking evil of."
3. "The natural man's lusts are agitated by joy, distress, fear, and the other passions. But he is a stranger to self-command."

## Albert Barnes:
1. "Their character resembled that of the inhabitants of Sodom; the example which he adduces of the punishment which was brought on those sinners, leaves it to be clearly inferred that the persons of whom he was speaking would be punished in a similar manner."
2. "Their doctrines were the fruits of mere imagination, foolish vagaries and fancies."
3. "Pollute themselves; give indulgence to corrupt passions and appetites."

Note: The commentary provided is quite brief and does not offer much depth or insight into the verse. However, these quotes highlight the comparison to the inhabitants of Sodom, the nature of their doctrines, and their indulgence in corrupt passions.

## Marvin Vincent:
1. "Though they have these fearful examples before them, yet they persist in their sin."
2. "It is not easy to determine the exact meaning of these two terms."
3. "Some explain this passage and the one in Peter, of evil angels."

## John Calvin:
1. "He only shews that they were vessels of wrath appointed to destruction, and that they could not escape the hand of God, but that he would some time or another make them examples of his vengeance."
2. "He intimates that they were so dull and stupid as to give up themselves without any shame to every kind of baseness."
3. "They who abandon themselves to iniquity, do also wish to abolish all order."

Note: The commentary is about Jude 1:8.

## Philip Schaff:
1. "They live in the feelings of their own perverted sense, and they corrupt others as well as themselves." 
2. "Licentiousness is closely connected with contempt for all authority: no other vice, indeed, so easily demoralizes the entire nature."
3. "We are not to rail at even Satan, nor at earthly princes or dignities, though they be his instruments: he and they are to be left in God’s hands."

## Archibald T Robertson:
1. "In their dreamings (ενυπνιαζομενο). Present middle participle of ενυπνιαζω, to dream... here only in N.T." 
2. "Defile (μιαινουσιν). Present active indicative of μιναινω, old verb, to stain, with sin (Titus 1:15) as here." 
3. "Set at nought (αθετουσιν). Present active indicative of αθετεω, to annul."

## Adam Clarke:
1. "He means to say that these false teachers and their followers were as unbelieving and disobedient as the Israelites in the wilderness, as rebellious against the authority of God as the fallen angels, and as impure and unholy as the Sodomites; and that consequently they must expect similar punishment."
2. "In plain English, self-pollution, with all its train of curses and cursed effects on body, soul, and spirit."
3. "They set all government at nought-they will come under no restraints; they despise all law, and wish to live as they list."


# BHT:
This verse describes a group of people who are spiritually asleep, trapped in sin and indulging in corrupt passions. They persist in their disobedience, disregarding the examples of punishment and warnings from God. They are described as unbelieving, impure, and rebellious, comparable to the inhabitants of Sodom and the fallen angels. Their actions lead to the defilement of their body, soul, and spirit, and they show contempt for all forms of authority and law.
