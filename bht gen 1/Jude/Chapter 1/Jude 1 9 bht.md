# choicest prompt v1 X bht prompt v3; ['Henry Alford', 'Jamieson Fausset Brown', 'Albert Barnes', 'Marvin Vincent', 'John Calvin', 'Philip Schaff', 'Archibald T Robertson', 'Adam Clarke']

## Henry Alford:
1. "Michael the archangel...dared not bring against him a judgment of evil speaking, but said, The Lord rebuke thee." 
2. "The source of the tradition to which St. Jude here refers as familiar to his readers is not known with any certainty." 
3. "It is, however, remarkable that the same words, 'The Lord rebuke thee,' are spoken by the angel to the devil in Zechariah 3:1-3."

## Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Nowhere in Scripture is the plural used, 'archangels'; but only ONE, 'archangel.' The only other passage in the New Testament where it occurs, is Jude 1:9, where Christ is distinguished from the archangel, with whose voice He shall descend to raise the dead; they therefore err who confound Christ with Michael." 
2. "Satan, as having the power of death, opposed the raising of [Moses' body] again, on the ground of Moses' sin at Meribah, and his murder of the Egyptian. That Moses' body was raised, appears from his presence with Elijah and Jesus (who were in the body) at the Transfiguration: the sample and earnest of the coming resurrection kingdom, to be ushered in by Michael's standing up for God's people." 
3. "Michael, whose connection seems to be so close with Jehovah-Messiah on the one hand, and with Israel on the other, naturally uses the same language as his Lord. As Satan accuses alike the Church collectively and 'the brethren' individually, so Christ pleads for us as our Advocate. Israel's, and all believers' full justification, and the accuser's being rebuked finally, is yet future."

## Albert Barnes:
1. "The difficulty has arisen from these two circumstances: (2)The improbability of the story itself, which looks like a mere Jewish fable."
2. "The sum of the matter, then, it seems to me is, that Jude has, as Paul did on another occasion, adopted a tradition which was prevalent in his time; that there is nothing necessarily absurd or impossible in the fact affirmed by the tradition, and that no one can possibly demonstrate that it is not true."
3. "The language is the same as that recorded in Zechariah 3:2, as used by 'the angel' respecting Satan. But, as before observed, there is no reason to suppose that the apostle referred to that."

## Marvin Vincent:
1. "This reference to Michael was said by Origen to be founded on a Jewish work called 'The Assumption of Moses,' the first part of which was lately found in an old Latin translation at Milan."
2. "Angels are described in scripture as forming a society with different orders and dignities. This conception is developed in the books written during and after the exile, especially Daniel and Zechariah."
3. "Michael (Who is like God ?) is one of the seven archangels, and was regarded as the special protector of the Hebrew nation."

## John Calvin:
1. "Angels, far more excellent than men, dare not bring forward a railing judgment."
2. "It is beyond controversy that Moses was buried by the Lord, that is, that his grave was concealed according to the known purpose of God."
3. "We see that Satan almost in all ages has been endeavoring to make the bodies of God’s saints idols to foolish men."

## Philip Schaff:
1. "They do against dignities what even the archangel would not do against Satan."
2. "The most probable explanation is that there was a Jewish tradition to which Jude appeals."
3. "The solution that God revealed these facts to Jude is of course possible, but it is not likely."

## Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Michael is mentioned also in Daniel 10:13; Daniel 10:21; Daniel 12:1; Revelation 12:7." 
2. "Present middle participle of διακρινω, to separate, to strive with as in Acts 11:2."
3. "There is a similar reference to traditions in Acts 7:22; Galatians 3:19; Hebrews 2:2; 2 Timothy 3:8."

## Adam Clarke:
1. "Michael is this archangel, and head of all the angelic orders; the devil, great dragon, or Satan, is head of all the diabolic orders." 
2. "The contention mentioned by Jude is not about the sacrifice of Isaac, nor the soul of Moses, but about the BODY of Moses; but why or wherefore we know not." 
3. "It was a Jewish maxim, as may be seen in Synopsis Sohar, page 92, note 6: 'It is not lawful for man to prefer ignominious reproaches, even against wicked spirits.'"


# BHT:
In this intriguing passage, we find references to Michael the archangel and his interaction with Satan. The use of the phrase "The Lord rebuke thee" by Michael in both the New Testament and the Old Testament is worth noting. It is interesting to contemplate the distinction between Michael and Christ, as well as the connection between Michael and Israel. Jude possibly drew upon prevalent traditions of his time, including one regarding the body of Moses. This passage sheds light on the hierarchy and roles of angels and offers insights into spiritual battles and the power of divine rebuke.
