# Jude 9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This verse refers to a dispute between Michael the archangel and the devil, as mentioned in Zechariah 3:1-3. Michael's response, "The Lord rebuke thee," is significant because it shows that even the archangel did not bring a judgment against evil speaking. The language used by Michael is the same as that recorded in Zechariah, highlighting the close connection between the angel and Jehovah-Messiah. Additionally, commentators note the reference to traditions and the possible adoption of a prevalent tradition by Jude.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Michael the archangel...dared not bring against him a judgment of evil speaking, but said, The Lord rebuke thee." 
2. "The source of the tradition to which St. Jude here refers as familiar to his readers is not known with any certainty." 
3. "It is, however, remarkable that the same words, 'The Lord rebuke thee,' are spoken by the angel to the devil in Zechariah 3:1-3."

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Nowhere in Scripture is the plural used, 'archangels'; but only ONE, 'archangel.' The only other passage in the New Testament where it occurs, is Jude 1:9, where Christ is distinguished from the archangel, with whose voice He shall descend to raise the dead; they therefore err who confound Christ with Michael." 
2. "Satan, as having the power of death, opposed the raising of [Moses' body] again, on the ground of Moses' sin at Meribah, and his murder of the Egyptian. That Moses' body was raised, appears from his presence with Elijah and Jesus (who were in the body) at the Transfiguration: the sample and earnest of the coming resurrection kingdom, to be ushered in by Michael's standing up for God's people." 
3. "Michael, whose connection seems to be so close with Jehovah-Messiah on the one hand, and with Israel on the other, naturally uses the same language as his Lord. As Satan accuses alike the Church collectively and 'the brethren' individually, so Christ pleads for us as our Advocate. Israel's, and all believers' full justification, and the accuser's being rebuked finally, is yet future."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The difficulty has arisen from these two circumstances: (2)The improbability of the story itself, which looks like a mere Jewish fable."
2. "The sum of the matter, then, it seems to me is, that Jude has, as Paul did on another occasion, adopted a tradition which was prevalent in his time; that there is nothing necessarily absurd or impossible in the fact affirmed by the tradition, and that no one can possibly demonstrate that it is not true."
3. "The language is the same as that recorded in Zechariah 3:2, as used by 'the angel' respecting Satan. But, as before observed, there is no reason to suppose that the apostle referred to that."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "This reference to Michael was said by Origen to be founded on a Jewish work called 'The Assumption of Moses,' the first part of which was lately found in an old Latin translation at Milan."
2. "Angels are described in scripture as forming a society with different orders and dignities. This conception is developed in the books written during and after the exile, especially Daniel and Zechariah."
3. "Michael (Who is like God ?) is one of the seven archangels, and was regarded as the special protector of the Hebrew nation."

### John Calvin:
1. "Angels, far more excellent than men, dare not bring forward a railing judgment."
2. "It is beyond controversy that Moses was buried by the Lord, that is, that his grave was concealed according to the known purpose of God."
3. "We see that Satan almost in all ages has been endeavoring to make the bodies of God’s saints idols to foolish men."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "They do against dignities what even the archangel would not do against Satan."
2. "The most probable explanation is that there was a Jewish tradition to which Jude appeals."
3. "The solution that God revealed these facts to Jude is of course possible, but it is not likely."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Michael is mentioned also in Daniel 10:13; Daniel 10:21; Daniel 12:1; Revelation 12:7." 
2. "Present middle participle of διακρινω, to separate, to strive with as in Acts 11:2."
3. "There is a similar reference to traditions in Acts 7:22; Galatians 3:19; Hebrews 2:2; 2 Timothy 3:8."

### John Gill:
1. "By whom is meant, not a created angel, but an eternal one, the Lord Jesus Christ; as appears from his name Michael, which signifies, 'who is as God': and who is as God, or like unto him, but the Son of God, who is equal with God?"
2. "But this is to be understood figuratively; and reference is had to the history in Zechariah 3:1; as appears from the latter part of this verse: some think the priesthood of Christ is intended, which was the end, the sum and substance, of the law of Moses."
3. "Now the argument is from the greater to the lesser, that if Christ, the Prince of angels, did not choose to give a railing word to the devil, who is so much inferior to him, and when there was so much reason and occasion for it; then how great is the insolence of these men, that speak evil of civil and ecclesiastical rulers, without any just cause at all?"

### John Wesley:
1. "It suffices, that these things were not only true, but acknowledged as such by them to whom he wrote."
2. "Whether there be one archangel only, or more, it is not possible for us to determine."
3. "The devil would have discovered the place where [the body of Moses] was buried, which God for wise reasons had concealed."
