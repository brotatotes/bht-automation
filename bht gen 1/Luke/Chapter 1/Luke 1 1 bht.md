# Luke 1:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Bible verse being described is a narrative account of the birth, life, actions, doctrines, miracles, sufferings, death, resurrection, and ascension of Jesus Christ. The author of this Gospel, Luke, acknowledges that previous attempts to document these events were incomplete and fragmented. Luke takes on the task of providing a comprehensive and reliable narrative, drawing from various sources including direct conversations with the apostles and ministers of the Gospel. The purpose of his Gospel is to faithfully preserve and present these widely known and significant events among Christians.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "That such narratives should not have come down to us, is no matter of surprise: for (1) they would be absorbed by the more complete and sanctioned accounts of our present Evangelists; and (2) Church tradition has preserved very few fragments of authentic information of the apostolic age."
2. "The fact of that failure is indeed implied in Luke’s description of his own work but that, more because it possessed completeness (whereas they were fragmentary) than from any difference in kind."
3. "The use of the cognate noun πληροφορία supports this view: see 1 Thessalonians 1:5; Hebrews 6:11. There does not appear to be any reference to the filling of the sails of a ship, as Bp. Wordsw."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Set forth in order" means to draw up a narrative.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "His doctrines were original, bold, pure, and authoritative. His miracles had been extraordinary, clear, and awful. His life and death had been peculiar; and it is not improbable - indeed it is highly probable that such broken accounts and narratives of detached facts would be preserved."

2. "His were to be regular and full."

3. "Among Christians - among all the Christians then living."

These quotes highlight the uniqueness and significance of Jesus' teachings, miracles, life, and death, as well as emphasize the intention of the author to provide a comprehensive and reliable account of these events.

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The word carries the sense of a difficult undertaking...and implies that previous attempts have not been successful." 

2. "A declaration...something which leads the reader through the mass of facts: a narrative, with the accompanying idea of thoroughness."

3. "The word was particularly applied to a medical treatise...applied at least seventy three times to the writings of Hippocrates."

These quotes highlight the challenging nature of the task at hand, the comprehensive and thorough nature of the narrative, and the association of the word with medical treatises.

### John Calvin:
1. "Luke dedicates his Gospel to Theophilus, that he might undertake the faithful preservation of it."
2. "He modestly denies their title to full and unshaken confidence."
3. "By claiming for himself the authority of a faithful witness, he destroys the credit of others who give contrary statements."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Many such [sketches] were doubtless in existence then, but being more or less fragmentary would not be preserved."
2. "Luke felt their labors to be insufficient not from incorrectness, but from the fragmentary character of their narratives."
3. "The great facts of the life of Christ formed the substance of preaching in the Apostolic times."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Luke had secured fuller information and planned a book on a larger scale and did surpass them with the result that they all perished save Mark's Gospel and what Matthew and Luke possess of the Logia of Jesus." 

2. "Luke means to say that those before him had made attempts to rehearse in orderly fashion various matters about Christ. 'The expression points to a connected series of narratives in some order (ταξις), topical or chronological rather than to isolated narratives' (Bruce)."

3. "Luke may refer to the matters connected with Christ's life which have been brought to a close among us or accomplished. Bruce argues plausibly that he means fulness of knowledge 'concerning the things which have become widely known among us Christians.'"

### John Gill:
1. "They undertook to write and publish a very particular and exact narrative of the birth, life, actions, doctrines, miracles, sufferings, death, resurrection, and ascension of Jesus Christ."
2. "By these many, he cannot mean the authentic historians of evangelical facts, as Matthew and Mark; for they two cannot, with any propriety, be called many."
3. "He seems to design some honest and well-meaning Christians, who undertook to write, and did write an account of the above things, which were firmly believed by all; and which they took from the apostles, and first ministers of the Gospel, from their sermons and discourses, and from conversation with them."
