# Luke 1:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
At the appointed time of incense, the whole multitude gathered at the temple, joining in communal prayer and worship. The smoke of the incense symbolized the acceptableness of their prayers rising to God, much like the incense offered with the morning and evening sacrifices. This inclusive act of prayer occurred in the outer courts, allowing all worshipers, regardless of their ability to enter the inner courts, to participate and offer their daily sacrifices to God. It emphasized the significance of communal worship and the expiatory virtue found in the one sacrifice of a sweet-smelling savor.
