# Luke 1:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, the action takes place on the right side, which is regarded as the favorable side. Positioned on the north side, before the altar, Zacharias offers incense. This scene is set in a corrupted time, yet angels are present in the sacred place, symbolizing a divine connection. The temple, a place of divine manifestation, becomes the source of light breaking through the prevailing darkness. The verse also alludes to a resurrection appearance, offering an undeniable reality and urging us to distinguish between objective truth and myth.
