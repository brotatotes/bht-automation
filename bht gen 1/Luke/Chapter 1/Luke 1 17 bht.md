## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "By comparing this with Malachi 3:1; Isaiah 40:3, it is plainly 'Jehovah' in the flesh of Messiah before whom John was to go as a herald to announce His approach." 
2. "Both [John and Elijah] fell on degenerate times; both witnessed fearlessly for God; neither appeared much save in the direct exercise of their ministry; both were at the head of schools of disciples; the success of both was similar." 
3. "If 'the disobedient' be 'the children,' and to 'the fathers' belongs 'the wisdom of the just,' the meaning will be, 'he shall bring back the ancient spirit of the nation into their degenerate children.'"

### Philip Schaff:
1. "'Go before' implies the coming of the Messiah, but 'in his presence' refers to 'the Lord their God.'" 
2. "True reformation strengthens family ties. This is the principle, prophesied by the last Old Testament prophet, announced by an angel in the first ray of light ushering in the New Dispensation, fulfilled in John's ministry, in the whole history of Christianity."
3. "Whatever weakens family ties cannot be 'reform.'"
4. "To make ready for the Lord, i.e., for God. A preparation for the coming of the Messiah is undoubtedly meant, but the thought of God's appearing when the Messiah appeared underlies the prediction."
