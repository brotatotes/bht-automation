# Luke 1:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the encounter with the angel, Zacharias responded to the news of his soon-to-be-born son with doubt and a desire for a sign, contrasting with the faith of Abraham and Mary and highlighting his struggle to fully believe the angel's message. His hesitation stemmed from both his old age and the incredibility of the promise given to him. In contrast, Mary displayed unwavering faith, seeking only clarification on the fulfillment of the divine plan. The interactions emphasize the range of human responses to extraordinary revelations and the need for trust beyond what can be seen or comprehended.

It highlights Zacharias' struggle with doubt and disbelief in contrast to Abraham's strong faith.
