# Luke 1:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This verse describes how the teachings and events of Jesus were passed down from the Apostles to others, both orally and in written form. It emphasizes the importance of eyewitness accounts and firsthand knowledge in understanding the life and message of Jesus. Luke, the author of this Gospel, received and compiled this information from those who had seen and experienced these things themselves, ensuring the reliability of the accounts.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The Apostles, &c., delivered these matters orally to the Churches in their teaching and others drew up accounts from that catechetical instruction."
2. "He cannot therefore have seen (or, having seen, not recognized as such, which is highly improbable) the Gospel of Matthew."
3. "ὑπηρέτης had long lost trace of its original derivation, in its more common meaning; and it would be abhorrent from good taste to suppose St. Luke to have used it with so pedantic an allusion."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The phrase 'from the beginning' refers to the start of Jesus' public ministry, as indicated by the subsequent events described in the passage."

2. "This verse highlights the significance of Jesus' ministry and the impact it had on those who witnessed it."

3. "By emphasizing the beginning of Jesus' ministry, the author emphasizes the importance of understanding the full scope of Jesus' teachings and actions."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "As they delivered them - As they narrated them. As they gave an account of them."
2. "From the beginning - From the commencement of these things - that is, from the birth of John, or perhaps from the beginning of the ministry of Jesus."
3. "Eye-witnesses - Who had seen those things themselves, and who were therefore proper witnesses."
4. "Ministers of the word - The term 'word' here means the 'gospel.' Luke never uses it, as John does, to denote the second Person of the Trinity."
5. "These eye-witnesses and ministers refer, doubtless, to the seventy disciples, to the apostles, and perhaps to other preachers who had gone forth to proclaim the same things."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Even as. Referring to the composition of the narrative."
2. "Eye witnesses and ministers. Personal knowledge and practical experience were necessary elements of an apostle."
3. "Ministers [υπηρεται] . See on Matthew 5:25. In medical language denoting the attendants or assistants of the principal physician."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "They delivered them, or, ‘handed them down.’ The oral instruction of the Apostles is here referred to."
2. "From the beginning, i.e., from the baptism of John."
3. "Eye-witnesses. The Apostles, perhaps the Seventy also. This implies that Luke was not a disciple during the lifetime of our Lord."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Luke received this tradition along with those who are mentioned above (the many). That is he was not one of the 'eyewitnesses.' He was a secondary, not a primary, witness of the events." 
2. "Luke means to say that the handing down was dependable, not mere wives' fables. Those who drew up the narratives had as sources of knowledge those who handed down the data. Here we have both written and oral sources. Luke had access to both kinds." 
3. "The word foreyewitnesses (αυτοπτα) is an old Greek word and appears in the papyri also. It means seeing with one's own eyes. It occurs here only in the N.T."

### John Gill:
1. "The twelve apostles and seventy disciples handed down to others the accounts of the birth, life, and death of Christ."
2. "They were eyewitnesses of him, of the truth of his incarnation, and of his ministry and miracles."
3. "Luke was not one of the seventy disciples, as some have thought, nor did he take his account from the Apostle Paul."
