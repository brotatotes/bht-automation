# Luke 1:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the presence of God's power and glory, a man is left speechless and unable to communicate, symbolizing astonishment and awe. His inability to hear or understand signifies a lack of spiritual perception and receptiveness to God's message. The need for silence and reflection is emphasized, as frequent repetition of signs and gestures is observed, confirming the presence of divine intervention and a vision.
