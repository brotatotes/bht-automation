## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "χεχαριτωμένη, not ‘gratiâ plena,’ as the Vulg.; for, though χαριτόω is not found in classical writers, the analogy of all verbs in - όω must rule it to mean, the passing on of the action implied in the radical substantive to the object of the verb the ‘conferring of grace or favour, upon.’" 
2. "Thl. explains it as corresponding to εὗρες χάριν παρὰ τῷ θεῷ, Luke 1:30: τοῦτο γάρ ἐστιν τὸ κεχαριτῶσθαι, τὸ εὑρεῖν χάριν παρὰ τῷ θεῷ."
3. "ὁ κύρ. μετὰ σοῦ] i.e. ἐστίν: see ref."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "highly favoured—a word only once used elsewhere (Ephesians 1:6, "made accepted")"
2. "The mistake of the Vulgate's rendering, "full of grace," has been taken abundant advantage of by the Romish Church."
3. "As the mother of our Lord, she was the most 'blessed among women' in external distinction; but let them listen to the Lord's own words."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Hail - This word of salutation is equivalent to 'Peace be with thee,' or 'Joy be with thee;' a form of speech implying that she was signally favored, and expressing joy at meeting her."
2. "Highly favoured - By being the mother of the long-expected Messiah - the mother of the Redeemer of mankind."
3. "Blessed art thou among women - This passage is equivalent to saying 'thou art the most happy of women.'"

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Thou that art highly favored [κεχαριτωμενη] . Lit., as Rev. in margin, endued with grace."
2. "The rendering full of grace, Vulgate, Wyc., and Tynd., is therefore wrong."
3. "The imperfect tense, 'began to reason.'"

Note: The commentary is about Luke 1:28.

### John Calvin:
1. "A conviction of the Divine goodness is the entrance of faith, and the angel properly observes this order, that, after preparing the heart of the virgin by meditation on the grace of God, he may enlarge it to receive an incomprehensible mystery."
2. "To those on whom he has once bestowed his love God shows himself gracious and kind, follows and 'crowns them with loving-kindness.'"
3. "Blessing is here put down as the result and proof of the Divine kindness. The word Blessed does not, in my opinion, mean, Worthy of praise; but rather means, Happy."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "To refer it to any human being, makes sheer non-sense of the account."
2. "This was not a dream, but a visit in open day."
3. "She is here presented 'not as the mother of grace, but as the daughter of grace.'"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Highly favoured (κεχαριτωμενη). Perfect passive participle of χαριτοω and means endowed with grace (χαρις), enriched with grace as in Ephesians 1:6." 
2. "The Vulgate gratiae plena 'is right, if it means 'full of grace which thou hast received'; wrong, if it means 'full of grace which thou hast to bestow'." 
3. "The oldest MSS. do not have 'Blessed art thou among women' here, but in verse Luke 1:42."

### John Gill:

### John Wesley:
1. "Hail, thou highly favoured; the Lord is with thee; blessed art thou among women" - This salutation acknowledges Mary's special favor with God and her blessedness among women, similar to how Noah, Moses, and David were also highly favored by God.

2. "The Lord is with thee" - This phrase, used in the salutation, was also said to Gideon in Judges 6:12, emphasizing God's presence and support in Mary's life.

3. "This salutation gives no room for any pretence of paying adoration to the virgin" - The commentary highlights that the salutation does not imply worship or adoration of Mary, as it does not resemble a prayer or an act of worship towards her.
