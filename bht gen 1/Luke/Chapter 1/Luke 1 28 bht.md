1. "And the angel came in unto her,.... Into her house, and into the room where she was: and said, hail; all health, happiness, and prosperity attend thee." 

2. "thou art highly favoured; or graciously accepted, or hast obtained grace; not referring to electing, redeeming; justifying, pardoning, adopting, and sanctifying grace, which she had in common with other saints; but to that special and particular favour, in being chosen and singled out from all other women, to be the mother of the Messiah."

3. "the Lord is with thee; so the angel to Gideon, Judges 6:12 or 'be with thee', an usual form of salutation among the Jews."

### John Wesley:
1. "Hail, thou highly favoured; the Lord is with thee; blessed art thou among women" - This salutation acknowledges Mary's favor with God and her blessedness among women, placing her in the company of other biblical figures who found favor with God, such as Noah, Moses, and David.

2. "The Lord is with thee" - This phrase echoes the words spoken to Gideon in Judges 6:12, emphasizing God's presence and support in Mary's life.

3. "This salutation gives no room for any pretence of paying adoration to the virgin" - The commentator highlights that the salutation given to Mary does not imply worship or adoration, as it does not resemble a prayer or an act of worship directed towards her.
