## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Luke by this classes himself with these πολλοί, and shews that he intended no disparagement nor blame to them, and was going to construct his own history from similar sources."
2. "The παρηκ . ἄν . πᾶσιν ἀκρ . which follows, implies however a conscious superiority of his own qualification for the work."
3. "καθεξῆς, consecutively: see reff. By this word we must not understand Luke to lay claim to any especial chronological accuracy in writing; which indeed is not found in his Gospel."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "From the very first—that is, from the very earliest events; referring to those precious details of the birth and early life, not only of our Lord, but of His forerunner, which we owe to Luke alone." 
2. "In order—or 'consecutively'—in contrast, probably, with the disjointed productions to which he had referred. But this must not be pressed too far; for, on comparing it with the other Gospels, we see that in some particulars the strict chronological order is not observed in this Gospel."
3. "Most excellent—or 'most noble'—a title of rank applied by this same writer twice to Felix and once to Festus. It is likely, therefore, that 'Theophilus' was chief magistrate of some city in Greece or Asia Minor."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It seemed 'to be called for' that there should be a full, authentic, and accurate account of these matters."
2. "Luke did not profess to have seen these things, and this expression is designed to show how he acquired his information. It was by 'tracing up' every account until he became satisfied of its truth."
3. "The title 'most excellent' has by some been supposed to be given to express his 'character,' but it is rather to be considered as denoting rank or office."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The verb means to follow closely, and hence to trace accurately."
2. "Having traced the course."
3. "To trace down to the last and minutest detail."

### John Calvin:
1. "Having carefully examined all things... Luke intended to express his close and laborious investigation."
2. "The Greek verb παρακολουθεῖν is taken metaphorically from those who tread in the footsteps of others, that nothing may escape them."
3. "Luke's diligence was such that he perceived everything that had been done as well as if he had been a spectator."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "He does not claim, but certainly does not disclaim, inspiration."
2. "The inspired writers were moved by the Holy Spirit, not as passive machines, but as rational and responsible persons."
3. "Luke lays claim to chronological accuracy in his Gospel, though his narrative in this respect plainly falls behind that of Mark."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Luke here claims fulness of knowledge before he began to write his book. He had the traditions of the eyewitnesses and ministers of the word and the narratives previously drawn up." 
2. "Luke got himself ready to write before he began by full and accurate knowledge of the subject." 
3. "He has made careful investigation and his work deserves serious consideration."

### John Gill:
1. "Being moved to it by the Holy Ghost; for he did not undertake this work of himself, merely by the motion of his own will, but was influenced, and directed to it by the Spirit of God, as well as by him assisted in it."
2. "Luke had diligently sought after, and had attained unto a perfect knowledge of all the affairs of Christ; having studiously got into the company of, and intimately conversed with all, or as many as he could, who had seen Christ in the flesh."
3. "This clause is omitted in the Syriac, Arabic, and Persic versions, but is in all copies, and by all means to be retained: this being the case, these reasons prevailed upon him, as he says, to write unto thee, in order, most excellent Theophilus; which regards not so much the order of time, which he does not always strictly observe, as the particulars of things, related in order, and with great exactness."

### John Wesley:
1. "To write in order — St. Luke describes in order of time; first, The Acts of Christ; his conception, birth, childhood, baptism, miracles, preaching, passion, resurrection, ascension: then, The Acts of the Apostles." 
2. "But in many smaller circumstances he does not observe the order of time."
3. "After the preface St. Luke gives us the history of Christ, from his coming into the world to his ascension into heaven."
