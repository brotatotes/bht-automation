## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "From the very first—that is, from the very earliest events; referring to those precious details of the birth and early life, not only of our Lord, but of His forerunner, which we owe to Luke alone." 
2. "In order—or 'consecutively'—in contrast, probably, with the disjointed productions to which he had referred." 
3. "Most excellent—or 'most noble'—a title of rank applied by this same writer twice to Felix and once to Festus. It is likely, therefore, that 'Theophilus' was chief magistrate of some city in Greece or Asia Minor."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "He does not claim, but certainly does not disclaim, inspiration."
2. "The inspired writers were moved by the Holy Spirit, not as passive machines, but as rational and responsible persons."
3. "Luke lays claim to chronological accuracy in his Gospel, though his narrative in this respect plainly falls behind that of Mark."

### John Gill:
1. "Being moved to it by the Holy Ghost; for he did not undertake this work of himself, merely by the motion of his own will, but was influenced, and directed to it by the Spirit of God, as well as by him assisted in it."
2. "Luke had diligently sought after, and had attained unto a perfect knowledge of all the affairs of Christ; having studiously got into the company of, and intimately conversed with all, or as many as he could, who had seen Christ in the flesh."
3. "This being the case, these reasons prevailed upon him, as he says, to write unto thee, in order, most excellent Theophilus; which regards not so much the order of time, which he does not always strictly observe, as the particulars of things, related in order, and with great exactness."

### John Wesley:
1. "To write in order — St. Luke describes in order of time; first, The Acts of Christ; his conception, birth, childhood, baptism, miracles, preaching, passion, resurrection, ascension: then, The Acts of the Apostles."
2. "But in many smaller circumstances he does not observe the order of time."
3. "After the preface St. Luke gives us the history of Christ, from his coming into the world to his ascension into heaven."
