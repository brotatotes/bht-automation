# Luke 1:34 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
A faithful and pure-hearted woman, filled with wonder and admiration, speaks up about the miraculous conception. Striving to understand the unbroken law of human birth, she seeks to unravel the mystery of the divine plan. With strong faith and instincts of maidenly purity, she poses her question not out of doubt, but a genuine desire to comprehend the extraordinary means by which this event will come to pass. Inquisitive yet believing, she offers her words as a testament to her trust in the fulfillment of God's promises.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "How, &c.â€”not the unbelief of Zacharias, 'Whereby shall I know this?' but, taking the fact for granted, 'How is it to be, so contrary to the unbroken law of human birth?'"
2. "Instead of reproof, therefore, her question is answered in mysterious detail."
3. "Her question is not treated as a doubt, but as a difficulty to be solved."

### John Calvin:
1. "We ought not to give ourselves very much trouble, to acquit her of all blame. She ought immediately to have risen by faith to the boundless power of God, which is not at all lettered to natural means, but sways the whole world."
2. "Still, it must be admitted that she does not hesitate or inquire in such a manner as to lower the power of God to the level of her senses; but is only carried away by a sudden impulse of astonishment to put this question."
3. "The conjecture which some have drawn from these words, that she had formed a vow of perpetual virginity, is unfounded and altogether absurd. She would, in that case, have committed treachery by allowing herself to be united to a husband, and would have poured contempt on the holy covenant of marriage; which could not have been done without mockery of God."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "She simply expresses the natural objection of which she was conscious in her pure virgin heart."
2. "The instincts of maidenly purity combined with strong faith to show her the negative side of the mystery of the miraculous conception."
3. "It is altogether improper to understand this clause as implying a vow of perpetual virginity, or the purpose of such a vow, as many Romanist interpreters hold."

### John Gill:
1. "This she said not as doubting the truth of what was said; for she required no sign, as Zacharias did; nor is she charged with, and blamed for unbelief, as he was; yea, it is expressly said, Luke 1:45 that she believed."
2. "Her words express her admiration at it, and also her desire to be informed of the manner how it should be."
3. "She knew, by prophecy, that the Messiah was to be born of a virgin, and she perceived, by the angel's declaration, that she was that virgin, but could not imagine in what way this amazing thing should be effected."
