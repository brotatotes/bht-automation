# Luke 1:34 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse in question captures the dialogue between Mary, the mother of Jesus, and the angel Gabriel. Mary displays a sense of wonder and awe as she asks how the miraculous conception is possible, not out of doubt, but out of curiosity. Her question reflects both her belief in the angel's message and her desire to understand the supernatural nature of the event. Mary's pure heart and strong faith are evident as she seeks to comprehend the mystery while expressing her admiration and willingness to embrace God's plan.

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "How, &c.â€”not the unbelief of Zacharias, 'Whereby shall I know this?' but, taking the fact for granted, 'How is it to be, so contrary to the unbroken law of human birth?'"
2. "Instead of reproof, therefore, her question is answered in mysterious detail."
3. "Her question is not one of doubt, but of wonder and awe at the supernatural nature of the conception."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "She simply expresses the natural objection of which she was conscious in her pure virgin heart."
2. "The instincts of maidenly purity combined with strong faith to show her the negative side of the mystery of the miraculous conception."
3. "It is altogether improper to understand this clause as implying a vow of perpetual virginity, or the purpose of such a vow."

### John Gill:

2. "Her words express her admiration at it, and also her desire to be informed of the manner how it should be."
3. "She knew, by prophecy, that the Messiah was to be born of a virgin, and she perceived, by the angel's declaration, that she was that virgin, but could not imagine in what way this amazing thing should be effected."
