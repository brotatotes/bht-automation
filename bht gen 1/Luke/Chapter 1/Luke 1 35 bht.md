### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "The immediate energy of the Godhead conveyed by the Holy Ghost."
2. "A word suggesting how gentle, while yet efficacious, would be this Power."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The Holy Spirit is here represented as 'power,' not strictly 'the power' (as if He were not a Person, but merely the power of God)."
