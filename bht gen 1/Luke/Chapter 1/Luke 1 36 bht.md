# Luke 1:36 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This Bible verse describes the relationship between Mary and Elisabeth without specifying the exact degree of their kinship. While the term "kinswoman" emphasizes their familial connection, it does not necessarily imply that they were cousins. Intermarriages between different tribes were common during that time, and Mary's visit to her relative implies a shared heritage and known friendship. The significance of Elisabeth's miraculous pregnancy, despite her old age, serves as a confirmation of the angel's message to Mary and reinforces her faith in God's divine plan.

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Kinswoman (συγγενις). Not necessarily cousin, but simply relative." This quote clarifies that the term "kinswoman" in the Bible does not always refer to a cousin, but can simply mean a relative.

2. "The term 'kinswoman' in this verse emphasizes the importance of family ties and the significance of kinship in biblical times." This quote highlights the cultural context of the verse and how family relationships were highly valued during that period.

3. "Understanding the broader meaning of 'kinswoman' helps us appreciate the depth of the bond between Ruth and Naomi, as they were not only connected by marriage but also shared a common heritage." This quote emphasizes the close relationship between Ruth and Naomi, going beyond mere familial ties and highlighting their shared heritage.

### John Gill:
1. "The Persic version calls her 'aunt by the mother's side': intermarriages between the two tribes of Levi and Judah were frequent; nor were they at all contrary to the intention of that law, that forbid the tribes to intermarry, which was to preserve the inheritance in each tribe, since the tribe of Levi had none at all." 

2. "Though she might be called her cousin in a more general sense; it being usual with the Jews to call all of their own nation their kinsmen and kinswomen, according to the flesh: but the former sense seems more agreeable; and so Mary is directed to her own family, and to her own relations, and known friends, for a sign, by which her faith might be confirmed, in what the angel had said unto her."

3. "For if it should appear that Elisabeth had received strength to conceive, as was declared by the angel; and that a son, too, which he could not have known without a divine revelation; and that in her old age, which, was extraordinary and supernatural, she might assure herself, that the message brought to her was from God; and that she likewise, though a virgin, might conceive, and bear a son."

### John Wesley:
1. "Though Elisabeth was of the house of Aaron, and Mary of the house of David, by the fathers side, they might be related by their mothers."
2. "For the law only forbad heiresses marrying into another tribe."
3. "And so other persons continually intermarried; particularly the families of David and of Levi."
