1. "The phrase 'for joy' emphasizes that the joy is the motive or cause for the action being described. It suggests that joy is not just a byproduct of the action, but rather the driving force behind it."

2. "The use of the preposition 'in' in the phrase 'in joy' suggests that joy is not just an external emotion, but something that is experienced internally. It implies that true joy comes from within, and is not dependent on external circumstances."

3. "By emphasizing the importance of joy, this verse reminds us that joy is not just a fleeting emotion, but a deep and abiding state of being. It encourages us to cultivate joy in our lives, and to let it be the guiding force in all that we do."
