# Luke 1:46 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the hymn uttered by Mary expresses a deep inward repose and humility, in contrast to Hannah's song filled with indignation and personal triumph. Mary's hymn ascribes greatness to God, celebrating His grace, omnipotence, holiness, justice, and faithfulness. Filled with prophetic inspiration, Mary's song points to the Messianic period and exudes a sense of joy and faith even before the birth of Jesus. This description enriches our understanding of Mary's hymn and the profound significance it holds.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Is it unnatural to suppose that the spirit of the blessed Virgin had been drawn beforehand into mysterious sympathy with the ideas and the tone of this hymn?"
2. "In both songs, those holy women, filled with wonder to behold 'the proud, the mighty, the rich,' passed by, and, in their persons the lowliest chosen to usher in the greatest events."
3. "In both songs the strain dies away on CHRIST; in Hannah's under the name of 'Jehovah's King'â€”to whom, through all His line, from David onwards to Himself, He will 'give strength'; His 'Anointed,' whose horn He will exalt; in the Virgin's song, it is as the 'Help' promised to Israel by all the prophets."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Elizabeth's salutation was full of excitement, but Mary's hymn breathes a sentiment of deep inward repose" (Godet).
2. "Hannah's song differs from Mary's in its sense of indignation and personal triumph compared with Mary's humility and calmness."
3. "The soul is the principle of individuality, the seat of personal impressions, having a side in contact with the material element of humanity, as well as with the spiritual element."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The angel's visit was vouchsafed to Mary later than to Zacharias, yet her song of thanksgiving is uttered long before his: faith is already singing for joy, while unbelief is compelled to be silent."
2. "The hymns could not have been composed after the death of our Lord. They are Messianic rather than Christian; pointing to the period assigned them by Luke as the true date of their composition."
3. "The grace of God, His omnipotence, His holiness, His justice, and especially His faithfulness, are here celebrated."

### John Gill:
1. "By 'magnifying' him is meant, not making him great, for he cannot be made greater than he is; but ascribing greatness to him, even all the perfections of the Deity, and praising him on account of them."
2. "Mary did, not in lip and word only, but with her whole heart and soul, and with all the powers and faculties of it."
3. "She all along speaks in the prophetic style, of things, as if they were done, which were doing, or would shortly be done."

### John Wesley:
1. "Under a prophetic impulse"
2. "Several things, which perhaps she herself did not then fully understand"
3. "Enriches a reader's understanding of the verse"
