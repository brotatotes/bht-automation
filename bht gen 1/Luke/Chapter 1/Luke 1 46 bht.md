## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Is it unnatural to suppose that the spirit of the blessed Virgin had been drawn beforehand into mysterious sympathy with the ideas and the tone of this hymn?"
2. "In both songs, those holy women, filled with wonder to behold 'the proud, the mighty, the rich,' passed by, and, in their persons the lowliest chosen to usher in the greatest events."
3. "In both songs the strain dies away on CHRIST; in Hannah's under the name of 'Jehovah's King'—to whom, through all His line, from David onwards to Himself, He will 'give strength'; His 'Anointed,' whose horn He will exalt; in the Virgin's song, it is as the 'Help' promised to Israel by all the prophets."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "To 'magnify' means to 'make great,' and then to 'extol,' to 'praise,' to 'celebrate.'"
2. "It does not mean here strictly to 'make great,' but to increase 'in our estimation' - that is, to praise or extol."
3. "See Psalms 34:3; 2 Samuel 7:26."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Elizabeth's salutation was full of excitement, but Mary's hymn breathes a sentiment of deep inward repose" (Godet).
2. "Hannah's song differs from Mary's in its sense of indignation and personal triumph compared with Mary's humility and calmness."
3. "The soul is the principle of individuality, the seat of personal impressions, having a side in contact with the material element of humanity, as well as with the spiritual element."

### John Calvin:
1. "Mary says that she praises God from an inward feeling of the mind. And certainly they who pronounce his glory, not from the mind, but with the tongue alone, do nothing more than profane his holy name." 

2. "Sadness and anxiety lock up the soul, and restrain the tongue from celebrating the goodness of God. When the soul of Mary exults with joy, the heart breaks out in praising God." 

3. "Till God has been recognised as a Savior, the minds of men are not free to indulge in true and full joy, but will remain in doubt and anxiety. It is God’s fatherly kindness alone, and the salvation flowing from it, that fill the soul with joy."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The angel’s visit was vouchsafed to Mary later than to Zacharias, yet her song of thanksgiving is uttered long before his: faith is already singing for joy, while unbelief is compelled to be silent."
2. "This song of Mary, called the MAGNIFICAT, from the first word of the old Latin version, is the unpremeditated outpouring of deep emotion, and may be divided into regular stanzas and lines. It is the last Psalm of the Old Testament’ and the first of the New."
3. "The grace of God (Luke 1:48), His omnipotence (Luke 1:49-51), His holiness (Luke 1:49; Luke 1:51; Luke 1:54), His justice (Luke 1:52-53), and especially His faithfulness (Luke 1:54-55), are here celebrated."

2. "Mary did, not in lip and word only, but with her whole heart and soul, and with all the powers and faculties of it."
