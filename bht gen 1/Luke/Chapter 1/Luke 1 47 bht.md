# Luke 1:47 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, commentators remark on Mary's humble recognition and joy in God her Saviour. They emphasize her unawareness of her own extraordinary role, focusing on her devotion to Christ as the Son of God. Mary's exultation in spirit and hope of salvation through faith in Him brings her more joy than her role as His mother. This rejoicing is rooted in the understanding of God's compassion towards her and all humanity, reaching out to save and uplift those in lowly states.
