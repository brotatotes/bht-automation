# Luke 1:47 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we see Mary's humble acceptance of God's plan for her life and her recognition of Jesus as her Savior. The idea of Mary's immaculate conception, where she was conceived without sin, is dismissed by commentators who emphasize that her true greatness lies in her role as the mother of our Savior, not her own perfection. Mary rejoices in God her Savior, recognizing that salvation is a blessing for all believers who have hope in Him. She magnifies the Lord, recognizing that He regarded her low estate and came to save her and humanity from sin and misery.
