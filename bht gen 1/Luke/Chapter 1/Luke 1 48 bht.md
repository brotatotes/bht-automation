## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Is it unnatural to suppose that the spirit of the blessed Virgin had been drawn beforehand into mysterious sympathy with the ideas and the tone of this hymn?"
2. "In both songs, those holy women, filled with wonder to behold 'the proud, the mighty, the rich,' passed by, and, in their persons the lowliest chosen to usher in the greatest events."
3. "In both songs the strain dies away on CHRIST; in Hannah's under the name of 'Jehovah's King'—to whom, through all His line, from David onwards to Himself, He will 'give strength'; His 'Anointed,' whose horn He will exalt; in the Virgin's song, it is as the 'Help' promised to Israel by all the prophets."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "God is not a respecter of persons; that he is not influenced, in conferring favors, by wealth, honor, or office." 
2. "He seeks the humble and the contrite; he imparts his rich blessings to those who feel that they need them." 
3. "It is therefore right to consider her as highly favored or happy; but this certainly does not warrant us to worship her or to pray to her."

### Philip Schaff:
