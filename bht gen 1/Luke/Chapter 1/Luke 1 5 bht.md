# Luke 1:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, we encounter the story of Zacharias and Elisabeth. Zacharias, whose name means "the Lord remembers," is portrayed as a prophet chosen by God even before his birth. The mention of the course of Abia, the eighth division of the priests, sheds light on the meticulous organization of the temple service. This system not only ensured fairness in the distribution of duties but also provided equal opportunities for all the priests to serve. Furthermore, the significance of Elisabeth's name, meaning "God's oath," suggests a connection to divine promises and fulfillment.
