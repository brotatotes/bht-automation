# Luke 1:61 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the Jewish tribes and families are carefully preserved and kept distinct, as noted by commentator Albert Barnes. It was common practice to give names to children after their ancestors and relations, creating a sense of respect for honored parents and ancestors. John Gill emphasizes that in the context of the verse, Elizabeth's neighbors and relations could not find anyone from her kindred who shared the same name. This highlights the significance of naming practices and the uniqueness of the name being given in this particular situation.
