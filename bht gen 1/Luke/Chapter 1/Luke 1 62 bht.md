# Luke 1:62 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we see the story of a man who was not only unable to speak but also faced the additional challenge of being deaf. The use of non-verbal communication through signs highlights the depth of his affliction and the importance of finding alternative ways to connect. Despite the limitations imposed by his muteness, the man demonstrated his desire to communicate and his faith in Jesus' ability to heal. Through this story, we are reminded of both the power of Jesus to restore physical ailments and our own capacity for resourcefulness and determination in the face of adversity.
