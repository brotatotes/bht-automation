# Luke 1:62 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this passage, a man who is both deaf and dumb is brought to Jesus for healing. His physical disabilities are symbolic of the spiritual condition of humanity, highlighting our inability to hear and speak the truth of God's Word until Jesus opens our ears and loosens our tongues. The man's faith and trust in Jesus are expressed through the signs he makes, revealing his desire to be understood and to be healed. Through the use of signs, communication is made possible, allowing the man to participate in the conversation and receive the help he needs.
