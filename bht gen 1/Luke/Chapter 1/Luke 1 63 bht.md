# Luke 1:63 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, Jesus surprises the people by giving the same name, John, to two individuals who were not aware of any connection between them. The crowd marvels at Jesus' ability to do this, as there had been no prior communication regarding the matter. Jesus communicates using signs and gestures since he could not speak yet. He hands a writing tablet, possibly covered with wax, to those present, emphasizing the significance of writing and recording this momentous occasion.
