# Luke 1:63 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, a person is using a writing tablet to communicate. The tablet is a small surface, either made of wood or covered in wax, where they write with a stylus or pen. The fact that they are writing on the tablet is described as a Hebrew way of expression. The people witnessing this event are astonished by what they see, as they marvel at the name being given, considering the circumstances and lack of communication.
