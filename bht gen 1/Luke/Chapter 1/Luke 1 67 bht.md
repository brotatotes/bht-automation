# Luke 1:67 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, a pious Jewish priest named Zacharias is filled with the Holy Spirit and delivers a prophetic message, under the direct influence of the Holy Spirit. His words not only reflect his own pious beliefs but also become prophetic about the coming of the Messiah and the role his own son, John the Baptist, will play. Zacharias' prophecy highlights the fulfillment of God's promises, the incarnation of the Messiah, and the central role that Jesus plays in God's plan of redemption.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Philip Schaff:
1. "The BENEDICTUS presents, therefore, not only the faith of a pious Jewish priest, not only the result of the long months of silent reflection to which Zacharias had been subjected, but also these as guided, moved, and uttered under the immediate influence of the Holy Spirit."
2. "Without inspiration the pious priest would doubtless have adopted the same tone, the same Old Testament phraseology, but his words could not have been prophetic of the coming of the Messiah nor of the part to be taken by his own son."
3. "Taking it as an expression of religious feeling, we discover the hopes of the human educator of John the Baptist, and thus obtain a hint of the real views of John himself and of the character of his ministry."
