## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "There is not a word in this noble burst of divine song about his own child; like Elisabeth losing sight entirely of self, in the glory of a Greater than both."
2. "Lord God of Israel—the ancient covenant God of the peculiar people."
3. "In the Old Testament, God is said to 'visit' chiefly for judgment, in the New Testament for mercy."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The past tenses throughout are used because the eye of prophecy regards these certain future events as having already taken place."
2. "This sums up the benefits bestowed by the Messiah, regarding them from the priestly point of view."
3. "It is very unlikely that a priest would apply such a word to political deliverance alone."

### John Gill:
1. "To bless God, is not to invoke a blessing on him; for there is none greater than he to ask one of; nor does he stand in need of any, being the Creator, who is blessed for ever in himself, and is the fountain of blessedness to his creatures."
2. "The act of 'visiting' them, as previous to redemption, may include God's look of love upon them from everlasting; his choice of them in Christ unto salvation; the appointment and provision of a Saviour for them; the covenant of grace made with them in Christ, the foundation and security of their salvation."
3. "The 'redemption' of them, which was now said to be made, or done, because Christ was now sent to do it, and because it was as sure, as if it was done, intends the spiritual and eternal redemption of them by the price of his blood, from the slavery of sin, the bondage of the law, and curse of it, and the captivity of Satan, and a deliverance out of the hands of every enemy."
