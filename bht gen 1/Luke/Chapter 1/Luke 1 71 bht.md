# Luke 1:71 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the emphasis is on salvation from various enemies. These enemies include sin, which poses a threat to the soul and seeks its destruction, as well as Satan, the persistent adversary of humanity. The deliverance spoken of extends beyond physical foes to encompass liberation from the world's enmity and the bondage of the law. It also highlights the ultimate victory over death, the final enemy to be conquered. This salvation is not only a political or external one, but a profound transformation that safeguards against spiritual, emotional, and physical harm.
