# Luke 1:74 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Bible verse describes the purpose of redemption, emphasizing that we should serve and worship the Lord with holiness and righteousness. This service is seen as a privilege and an honor, not just a duty. It involves obeying, honoring, and dedicating ourselves to God, free from fear of death, enemies, or external foes. Through deliverance, we are granted the opportunity to joyfully and fearlessly love and serve God, yielding obedience as children to a loving Father who has saved us from spiritual enemies.
