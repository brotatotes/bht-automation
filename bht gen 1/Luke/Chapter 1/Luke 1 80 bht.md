# Luke 1:80 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this passage, we read about the development of John the Baptist. Various commentators highlight how John grew both in physical stature and spiritual strength, preparing him for his future mission. John lived in obscurity and was not known publicly, indicating that his preparation for his role as Messiah's forerunner took place in solitude and away from the influence of others. His time in the wilderness of Judea, like Moses in the desert, educated his spirit for his high vocation. Ultimately, John's growth and seclusion were essential for his later public usefulness in presenting himself before his nation.
