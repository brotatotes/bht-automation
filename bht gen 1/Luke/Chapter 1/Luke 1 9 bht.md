# Luke 1:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, a priest is chosen by lot to have the honor of burning incense in the temple. This task, assigned only once in a priest's lifetime, is a highly esteemed part of the priest's service. As the priest ascends the steps to the Holy Place, he spreads coals on the golden altar and arranges the incense. Inside the Holy Place, surrounded by silence, the priest waits for the moment to burn the incense, symbolizing the sweet savor of prayers ascending to God through the sacrifice of the Mediator.
