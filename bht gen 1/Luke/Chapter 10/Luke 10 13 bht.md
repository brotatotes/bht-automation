# Luke 10:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In these words, Jesus bids a solemn farewell to the cities that witnessed His miracles. The people of Chorazin and Bethsaida were condemned for their impenitence and unbelief, despite witnessing His powerful works. Had they repented, their sorrow and remorse would have been evident through sitting in sackcloth and ashes. This warning serves as a reminder of the urgency of the message and the accountability of those who reject the truth, for there are consequences for turning away from the grace and mercy of God.
