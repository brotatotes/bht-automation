# Luke 10:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Despite what was previously stated, there is a surprising and significant contrast to consider. The concept of accountability and the principle that greater knowledge and advantages bring a higher level of responsibility are revealed. Those who have received greater light and privileges, yet fail to live up to their responsibilities, will face a more severe punishment. The judgment for the inhabitants of Chorazin and Bethsaida, who had been exposed to the teachings and presence of Jesus, will be harsher than that of the Gentile cities.
