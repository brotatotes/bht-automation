# Luke 10:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, commentators discuss the exalted status and destiny of certain individuals, contrasting it with the concept of Hades as a place of the dead. The phrase 'which are exalted to heaven' suggests that not all will experience the same afterlife. It raises the question of whether exaltation is certain or possible. Hades is distinguished from Gehenna, emphasizing the Greek concept of the underworld instead of eternal punishment. The verse also alludes to the privileges and pride of a flourishing town, its excellent location and fountain, while warning that the boastful will be thrust down to hell.
