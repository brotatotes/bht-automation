1. "The truth is, that in this brief speech He sums up proleptically, as so often in the discourses in John, the whole great conflict with and defeat of the Power of evil, from the first even till accomplished by His own victory."
2. "The ἐθεώρ . τ . σ . refers to the original fall of Satan, when he lost his place as an angel of light, not keeping his first estate; which fall however had been proceeding ever since step by step, and shall do so, till all things be put under the feet of Jesus who was made lower than the angels."
3. "Not the suddenness only of the fall, but the brightness of the fallen Angel is thus set forth. The description is not figurative, but literal; i.e. as far as divine words can be said to be literal, being accommodated to our sensuous conceptions."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "I was beholding Satan as lightning falling from heaven" - The author emphasizes the significance of the imperfect tense in the original text, highlighting the continuous action of Jesus observing Satan's fall. This conveys the grandeur and suddenness of the event, likening it to the darting of lightning from heaven to earth.

2. "By that law of association which connects a part with the whole, those feeble triumphs of the Seventy seem to have compressed the ultimate result of His mission into a moment and quickened it into the rapidity of lightning!" - The commentary suggests that the small victories of the Seventy disciples in casting out demons brought the entire scope of Jesus' mission into focus, encapsulating it in a single moment of triumph.

This broadens the disciples' understanding of their mission and the magnitude of the spiritual warfare they are engaged in.

2. "Hence we infer, that our deliverance from the bondage of Satan is effected in no other way than through the Gospel; and that those only make actual proficiency in the Gospel, in whom Satan loses his power, so that sin is destroyed, and they begin to live to the righteousness of God."
3. "We ought also to attend to the comparison which he employs, that the thunder of the Gospel makes Satan fall like lightning; for it expresses the divine and astonishing power of the doctrine, which throws down, in a manner so sudden and violent, the prince of the world armed with such abundant forces."
