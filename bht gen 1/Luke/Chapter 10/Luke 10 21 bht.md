# Luke 10:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the joy and exultation of Jesus are unveiled, showing His profound delight in the spread of the Gospel and the application of its truths to ordinary people. This joy emanates from His deep appreciation for the sovereign and distinguishing grace of God towards the elect. Furthermore, this joy is rooted in the understanding that the Kingdom of God surpasses all earthly kingdoms, emphasizing the overarching power and authority of the Lord. Jesus' joy highlights the revelation of God's grace to the humble, while the wise and learned remain blind to its beauty.
