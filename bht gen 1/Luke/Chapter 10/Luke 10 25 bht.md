## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "No immediate sequence from Luk 10:24 is implied."
2. "There is no reason to suppose that the lawyer had any hostile intention towards Jesus, rather perhaps a self-righteous spirit."
3. "He doubtless expects to hear of some great deed; but our Lord refers him back to the Law of which he was a teacher."

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Tempted him - 'tested him'; in no hostile spirit, yet with no tender anxiety for light on that question of questions, but just to see what insight this great Galilean teacher had." 

2. "In no hostile spirit" - The person testing Jesus did not have ill intentions or a malicious agenda. 

3. "No tender anxiety for light on that question of questions" - The person was not genuinely seeking wisdom or understanding, but rather wanted to challenge Jesus and see how he would respond.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "A certain lawyer...stood up...tempted him": The lawyer's intention was not genuine, but rather to test Jesus and potentially trap him in contradiction. This highlights the lawyer's ulterior motive and sets the stage for Jesus' response.

2. "Inherit eternal life - Be saved": The lawyer's question about inheriting eternal life reflects the common concern among Jews at that time. This phrase emphasizes the importance of salvation and the eternal destiny of individuals.

3. "They had said that man must keep the commandments - the written and oral law": The reference to the commandments and the oral law highlights the legalistic mindset prevalent among the Jews. It sets the context for Jesus' later response, challenging the lawyer's understanding of the law and righteousness.

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Lawyer. See on ch. Luke 7:30."
2. "Tempted. See on temptation, Matthew 6:13."
