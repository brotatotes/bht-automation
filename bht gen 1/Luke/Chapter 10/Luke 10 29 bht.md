# Luke 10:29 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the individual seeks to justify himself and prove his compliance with the law. He questions Jesus about who qualifies as a neighbor, attempting to narrow its definition to exclude certain individuals. Jesus counters this narrow interpretation by responding with the parable of the Good Samaritan. Through this parable, Jesus challenges the man's self-righteousness and reveals the true meaning of being a neighbor. This interaction highlights the tension between legalism and true righteousness, emphasizing the importance of love and compassion for all people, regardless of their background.
