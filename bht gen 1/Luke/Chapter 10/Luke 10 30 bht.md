# Luke 10:30 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This verse tells a story of a man who fell victim to robbers while traveling from Jerusalem to Jericho, a notorious and dangerous road. He was left half-dead and abandoned by those who should have helped him. However, it was a compassionate Samaritan, typically despised by the Jews, who showed kindness and became the true neighbor, proving that acts of mercy transcend societal divisions. The parable speaks to the universal call to love and care for one another, regardless of race or background.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "taking him up, implies that the question was made an occasion of saying more than the mere answer."
2. "both because Jerusalem was higher, and because ‘to go up’ is the usual phrase for journeying towards a metropolis."
3. "The road passed through a wilderness which was notorious for the robberies committed there."
4. "They surrounded him."
5. "not merely of his clothing, but of all he had."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

2. "A certain man—a Jew." 
3. "From Jerusalem to Jericho—a distance of nineteen miles northeast, a deep and very fertile hollow—'the Temple of Judea' [TRENCH]."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He compelled him to acknowledge that a Samaritan - of a race most hated of all people by the Jews - had shown the kindness of a neighbor, while a 'priest' and a 'Levite' had denied it 'to their own countrymen.'"
2. "From Jerusalem to Jericho the country was rocky and mountainous, and in some parts scarcely inhabited. It afforded, therefore, among the rocks and fastnesses, a convenient place for highwaymen."
3. "Every circumstance in this parable, therefore, was full of significance to those who heard it. The Saviour delivered it near Bethany, on the border of the frightful desert... Thus it is that the instructions of our Lord derive often the form and much of their pertinence from the accidental connections of time and place."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "It means, strictly, to take up; and hence, of conversation, to take up another's discourse and reply."
2. "These were not petty stealers, but men of violence, as was shown by their treatment of the traveler."
3. "Not of his clothing only, but of all that he had."
4. "The word tugcanonta throws an element of chance into the case. Lit., happening to be half dead; or 'leaving him half dead, as it chanced;' his condition being a matter of unconcern to these robbers."

### John Calvin:
1. "The commandment would have run more clearly thus: Love every man as thyself. But as men are blinded by their pride, so that every man is satisfied with himself, scarcely deigns to admit others to an equal rank, and withholds from them the duties he owes them, the Lord purposely declares that all are neighbors that the very relationship may produce mutual love."
2. "To make any person our neighbor, therefore, it is enough that he be, a man; for it is not in our power to blot out our common nature."
3. "The allegory which is here contrived by the advocates of free will is too absurd to deserve refutation. According to them, under the figure of a wounded man is described the condition of Adam after the fall; from which they infer that the power of acting well was not wholly extinguished in him; because he is said to be only half-dead."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The main lesson of the parable is not love to enemies, but love to man as such, humanity, philanthropy."
2. "The incidents of the story are all probable, as is usual in our Lord's parables."
3. "This man is represented as being literally surrounded by such robbers, who both stripped him, i.e., of everything he had, and beat him, probably in consequence of his resistance."

2. "He shows himself to be their best neighbour, and truest friend."
3. "Man by sinning against God, departed from his happy and peaceful state, from a state of peace and tranquillity with God, with the holy angels, and even with the beasts of the field."

1. "The road from Jerusalem to Jericho (about eighteen miles from it) lay through desert and rocky places: so many robberies and murders were committed therein, that it was called the bloody way."
