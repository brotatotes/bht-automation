# Luke 10:31 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, a priest finds an injured man on the road but chooses to pass by on the other side. The commentators emphasize the priest's lack of compassion and his failure to fulfill the commandments of mercy and love. They highlight the priest's negligence, his adherence to rituals over moral duty, and his hardness of heart. The commentators also note that the priest's actions were not accidental but rather a result of his own choices. The verse serves as a reminder to prioritize compassion and mercy over empty religious observance.
