# Luke 10:32 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, we see the Levite, an inferior minister of the Law, failing to show compassion and fulfill his duty. He goes even farther than the priest in approaching the wounded man, yet still does nothing to help him. This highlights a tendency to prioritize personal safety and convenience over caring for others. The Levite's actions reveal a disregard for mercy and a lack of healing, as the law makes no allowances for human weakness and provides no justification or pardon. It becomes clear that the law itself cannot offer the redemption and atonement needed for sin.
