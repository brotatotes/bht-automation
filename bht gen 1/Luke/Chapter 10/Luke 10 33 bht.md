# Luke 10:33 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we witness a remarkable act of compassion and kindness, where an unexpected Samaritan becomes the epitome of love and mercy. Despite the deep animosity between Samaritans and Jews, this individual not only overcame prejudice but also went above and beyond to help someone in dire need. The Samaritan's genuine care and selflessness, which surpassed the actions of a priest and a Levite, highlight the transformative power of empathy. This narrative serves as a powerful reminder that true neighborliness transcends social divisions and is rooted in the innate desire to alleviate suffering.
