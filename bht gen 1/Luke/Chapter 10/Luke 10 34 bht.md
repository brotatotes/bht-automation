# Luke 10:34 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, a compassionate person goes above and beyond to help an injured man. They provide remedies commonly used in the East - oil and wine - to cleanse and soothe the wounds. Despite the inconvenience, they walk alongside the injured person, displaying selflessness in their care. The act of pouring oil and wine signifies the healing and restoration that God brings, blending His grace and mercy to bring deep healing and wholeness. It is a powerful balm that brings relief to the wounded soul.
