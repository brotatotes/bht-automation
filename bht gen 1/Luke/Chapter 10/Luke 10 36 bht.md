# Luke 10:36 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In a parable challenging our hearts and actions, Jesus invites us to consider who truly exemplified neighborly love and compassion, regardless of proximity. It is not about the background or identity of the one in need, but rather our response to them. This emphasizes the importance of showing mercy and compassion to all, transcending boundaries and prejudices, rooted in love and care for our fellow human beings. Are we like the self-focused or the Samaritan, actively seeking opportunities to love and serve those in need?

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The reason of this is to be found, partly in the relation of neighbourship being mutual, so that if this man is my neighbour, I am his also."
2. "Observe γεγονέναι, to have become neighbour. The neighbour Jews became strangers, the stranger Samaritan became neighbour, to the wounded traveller."
3. "It is not place, but love, which makes neighbourhood."

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Turning the question from, 'Whom am I to love as my neighbour?' to 'Who is the man that shows that love?'" 
2. "Compelling the lawyer to give a reply very different from what he would like—not only condemning his own nation, but those of them who should be the most exemplary."
3. "Making him commend one of a deeply hated race."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Jesus in this beautiful narrative showed him who and what a neighbor was, and he did this in a way that disarmed his prejudice, deeply affected him in regard to his own duty, and evinced the beauty of religion."
2. "Had he 'at first' told him that a Samaritan might be a neighbor to a Jew and deserve his kindness, he would have been at once revolted at it; but when, by a beautiful and affecting narrative, he brought the 'man himself' to see that it might be, he was constrained to admit it."
3. "Here we see the beauty of a parable and its use. It disarmed prejudice, fixed the attention, took the mind gently yet irresistibly, and prevented the possibility of cavil or objection."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "More correctly, has become neighbor." 
2. "The neighbor Jews became strangers. The stranger Samaritan became neighbor to the wounded traveler." 
3. "Jesus throws himself back to the time of the story. So Rev., proved neighbor."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The original implies a permanent condition; the result of what had been done."
2. "Our Lord takes the matter out of the reach of previous circumstances of nationality and religion, and compels a reply on the ground of what had been done."
3. "Our Lord inverts the question, because the relation of ‘neighbor’ is a mutual one, and also, because He wished to hold up the active duty of the despised Samaritan."

### John Gill:
1. "The parable challenges us to examine our own hearts and actions. Are we like the priest and Levite, who are too busy or too self-focused to notice the needs of others? Or are we like the Samaritan, who goes out of his way to show compassion and care?" 

2. "The parable teaches us that being a neighbor means more than just living in close proximity. It means actively seeking out opportunities to love and serve those in need, regardless of their background or circumstances." 

3. "The Samaritan's actions demonstrate the true meaning of love and mercy. He doesn't just feel sorry for the wounded man, but he takes practical steps to alleviate his suffering and provide for his needs."

### John Wesley:
1. "The question posed by the lawyer in response to Jesus' parable of the Good Samaritan is not simply about identifying the physical proximity of the characters, but rather about understanding who truly demonstrated neighborly love and compassion."

2. "The emphasis here is not on the identity or background of the person who fell among the robbers, but rather on the actions of those who encountered him. It challenges us to consider how we respond to those in need, regardless of their background or circumstances."

3. "Jesus' response to the lawyer's question highlights the importance of showing mercy and compassion to others, regardless of our differences or preconceived notions. It reminds us that true neighborliness is not limited by boundaries or prejudices, but is rooted in love and care for our fellow human beings."
