## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The rendering is as in E. V., go and do thou likewise. The καὶ σύ belongs, not to the πορεύου, but to the ποίει, which carries the main stress, the πορεύου being only secondary."
2. "All acts of charity and mercy done here below, are but fragments and derivatives of that one great act of mercy which the Saviour came on earth to perform."
3. "And thus we shall not give up the interpretation of the Fathers and other divines, who see in this poor traveller, going from the heavenly to the accursed city, the race of man, the Adam who fell."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "What new fountains of charity has not this opened up in the human spirit—rivers in the wilderness, streams in the desert!"
2. "What noble Christian institutions have not such words founded, all undreamed of till that wondrous One came to bless this heartless world of ours with His incomparable love—first in words, and then in deeds which have translated His words into flesh and blood."
3. "The priests and Levites had not strengthened the diseased, nor bound up the broken, while He bound up the brokenhearted and poured into all wounded spirits the balm of sweetest consolation."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He that showed mercy - His 'Jewish' prejudice would not permit him 'to name' the Samaritan, but there was no impropriety, even in his view, in saying that the man who showed so much mercy was really the neighbor to the afflicted, and not he who 'professed' to be his neighbor, but who would 'do nothing' for his welfare."
2. "Of this man we know nothing farther; but from this inimitably beautiful parable we may learn:... That religion requires us to do good to 'all' people, however 'accidentally' we may become acquainted with their calamities."
3. "We hence see the beauty of religion. Nothing else will induce people to surmount their prejudices, to overcome opposition, and to do good to those who are at enmity with them. True religion teaches us to regard every man as our neighbor; prompts us to do good to all, to forget all national or sectional distinctions, and to aid all those who are in circumstances of poverty and want."
