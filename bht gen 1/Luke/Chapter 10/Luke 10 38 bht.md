# Luke 10:38 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
During Jesus' last journey from Galilee to Jerusalem, he entered a certain village, where he was warmly received into the house of Martha. Martha, likely the elder sister, was the head of the household and acted as the hostess. With hospitality and diligence, she prepared for his entertainment, embracing her role in welcoming and accommodating the guest. In devoting herself to serving others, Martha exemplifies the virtue of selflessness and reminds us to humbly fulfill our own responsibilities without thinking more highly of ourselves than others.
