### Albert Barnes:
1. "Salutations among the Orientals did not consist, as among us, of a slight bow or an extension of the hand, but was performed by many embraces and inclinations, and even prostrations of the body on the ground." 
2. "There is such an amount of insincerity, flattery, and falsehood in the terms of salutation prescribed by etiquette, that our Lord, who is truth itself, desired his representatives to dispense with them as far as possible, perhaps tacitly to rebuke them." 
3. "These 'instructions' were also intended to reprove another propensity which an Oriental can scarcely resist, no matter how urgent his business. If he meets an acquaintance, he must stop and make an endless number of inquiries and answer as many."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Purse [βαλλαντιον]. Used by Luke only. For money."
2. "Shoes. Not that they were to go unshod, but that they were not to carry a change of sandals."
3. "Salute no man. Oriental salutations are tedious and complicated. The command is suited to a rapid and temporary mission."
