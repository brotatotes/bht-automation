# Luke 10:40 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this passage, we see Martha bustling about, distracted and encumbered with the cares and tasks of serving. Though her intentions were genuine and hospitable, her preoccupation prevented her from fully engaging with Jesus' teaching. While she expressed her frustration towards Jesus and her sister, it is clear that Jesus gently redirects her focus, emphasizing the importance of the relationship and presence with him over the busyness of tasks. This serves as a reminder that our connection with Jesus should always take precedence over earthly distractions and anxieties.
