## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Short work and little of it suffices for Me" - The commentary suggests that this phrase goes beyond the idea of economy and highlights the insignificance of elaborate preparation for this life compared to another.
2. "Choosing the better" - Mary's choice of sitting at Jesus' feet is considered better than Martha's busy serving because it is a higher way of serving and pleasing the Lord.
3. "Mary's choice would never be taken away" - Unlike Martha's service, which would end with her life, Mary's choice to prioritize the spiritual and eternal would endure. Both choices are valued, but Mary's represents the contemplative aspect of the Christian character while Martha's represents the active aspect.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "But one thing is needful - That is, religion, or piety. This is eminently and especially needful. Other things are of little importance. This should be secured first, and then all other things will be added." 
2. "It is of more importance to attend to the instructions of the Lord Jesus than to be engaged in the affairs of the world. The one will abide forever; the other will be but for a little time." 
3. "Piety is the chief thing needed. Other things will perish. We shall soon die. All that we can gain we must leave. But the 'soul' will live."

### John Calvin:
1. "But Christ had quite another design, which was, that whatever believers may undertake to do, and in whatever employments they may engage, there is one object to which every thing ought to be referred."
2. "Mary hath chosen the good part. There is no comparison here, as unskillful and mistaken interpreters dream. Christ only declares, that Mary is engaged in a holy and profitable employment, in which she ought not to be disturbed."
3. "For my own part, I have no objection to that opinion, but have followed the view which appeared to me to be more in accordance with Christ’s design."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The contrast with the preceding verse shows that this clause means: one thing is needful as the proper object of the anxiety and carefulness which we may manifest in receiving the Lord." 
2. "Mary’s choice proved what the ‘one thing’ was, and that anxiety about the ‘many’ others was unnecessary. ‘The good part’ chosen by her, in receiving the Saviour, was: undivided devotion to His word, the feeding on the bread of life by faith, which cometh by hearing."
3. "The possession of this ‘part’ is eternal. Both of these women loved the Saviour; Martha is not the type of a worldly woman, nor is the ‘one thing’ conversion. They represent two classes of Christians, which have always been found in the Church."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "The good portion (την αγαθην μεριδα). The best dish on the table, fellowship with Jesus."
2. "Salvation is not 'the good portion' for Martha had that also."
3. "Jesus pointedly takes Mary's side against Martha's fussiness."

### John Gill:
1. "But rather the hearing of the word, the Gospel of Christ, which Mary was engaged in; and which, ordinarily speaking, is necessary to the knowledge of Christ, and salvation by him, and to faith in him."
2. "Christ's meaning seems plainly to be, that Mary hearing the word from his mouth, and at his feet, was one necessary thing, in opposition to Martha's many unnecessary ones, about which she was cumbered."
3. "The heavenly inheritance also, eternal glory and happiness, is the saints' portion; it is called in Colossians 1:12 the part, or portion of the inheritance with the saints in light."

### John Wesley:
1. "Mary hath chosen the good part" - This phrase emphasizes the importance of making choices that align with our spiritual well-being. It prompts us to reflect on whether we are actively seeking to save our souls or if we are distracted by worldly concerns.

2. "To save her soul" - This highlights the ultimate goal of choosing the good part. It reminds us that our souls are precious and need to be nurtured and protected. It encourages us to prioritize our spiritual growth and salvation above all else.

3. "Reader, hast thou?" - This question challenges the reader to examine their own choices and actions. It prompts self-reflection and invites us to consider whether we have truly chosen the good part in our own lives. It serves as a call to action, urging us to actively pursue a relationship with God and prioritize our spiritual well-being.
