# Luke 11:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Some people fail to receive what they ask for because their prayers are misguided, either directed at the wrong person, offered in the wrong way, influenced by wrong motives, or seeking the wrong outcomes. However, when someone prays with the right focus, approach, and intentions, regardless of their background or station in life, their requests are granted. It is important to not only pray but also to actively engage in seeking other forms of divine guidance and diligently utilize the means available to us in order to attain the desired spiritual fulfillment.

### John Gill:
1. "Some indeed ask and receive not, because they ask amiss, James 4:3 who either apply to a wrong person, or ask in a wrong manner, or from wrong principles, or with wrong ends in view."
2. "When a man is right in the object of prayer, and in the matter and manner of prayer, and in the end he proposes to himself, let him be what he will, of whatsoever nation, or ever mean a person, he has the petitions which he asks."
3. "Whoever not only prays, but makes use of means, as attendance on other ordinances, and is diligent in the use of them, sooner or later finds his account herein, and what his soul seeks for."
