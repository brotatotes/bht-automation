# Luke 11:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse in question poses an interrogative question directed towards a specific group of people. The emphasis is on the importance of the role of fatherhood, highlighting the responsibility and authority it entails. There is an element of anacoluthon, causing some confusion in the textual translation. The use of the word "father" denotes a close and natural relationship, emphasizing the severity of a father neglecting his duty, which reflects an inhuman and brutish nature.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The pronoun 'τινα' is not indefinite, but interrogative, indicating that the question is being asked to a specific group of people."
2. "The correct translation of the verse should be 'of which of you that is a father', highlighting the specific role being addressed."
3. "The use of the word 'father' implies a sense of responsibility and authority, emphasizing the importance of the role being discussed."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "There is a decided anacoluthon here."
2. "The text of Westcott and Hort makes τον πατερα (the father) in apposition with τινα (of whom) and in the accusative the object of αιτησε (shall ask) which has also another accusative (both person and thing) 'a loaf.'"
3. "Μη shows that the answer No is expected, but the trouble is that the interrogative τινα in the first clause is in the accusative the object of αιτησε while here the same man (he) is the subject of επιδωσε."

### John Gill:
1. "The relation between a father and a son is natural, and it is very near."
2. "Should he do so, he would show that his heart was as hard, or harder than the stone he gives."
