# Luke 11:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the wicked Jews are compared to venomous and mischievous land scorpions, described as a kind of serpent. Commentators mention that scorpions are also compared to an herb with leaves resembling a scorpion, highlighting the similarity between the wicked and the nature of the scorpion. Additionally, it is noted that a scorpion, when forced to burst out of an eggshell, can instantly strike and kill. However, the commentators ponder the unlikely nature of a father intentionally harming their own child.
