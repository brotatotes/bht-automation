# Luke 11:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The inquiring Pharisees sought a sign from Jesus, not out of true faith, but as a means to test Him and find fault. Jesus, aware of their motives, responded by rebuking their lack of understanding and belief. He pointed to the story of Jonah as a sign of His impending death and resurrection, emphasizing that this ultimate sign would validate His divinity and power over death. Jesus warns against seeking signs without genuine faith, reminding us that true faith requires a humble heart that believes in Him for who He is, rather than relying on constant signs and wonders.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "No distinction can be drawn between σημ. and σημ. ἐξ οὐρ., for our Lord answers the demand in both places by the same reply, the sign of Jonas."
2. "The ordinary Jewish idea attached to σημ. would imply ἐξ οὐρ."
3. "Our Lord's reply was not a refusal, but a rebuke for their unbelief and perverseness."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Temptation is not sin; it is the opportunity to sin. It is the lure, the enticement, the invitation to evil. Temptation is the devil's attempt to draw us away from God and into sin." 

2. "When we pray 'lead us not into temptation,' we are acknowledging our weakness and asking God to protect us from the allure of sin. We are recognizing that we cannot overcome temptation on our own, but we need God's guidance and strength to resist it." 

3. "In Matthew 11:20, Jesus refers to the cities of Chorazin and Bethsaida, saying that if the miracles performed there had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago. This shows that even witnessing miracles and experiencing God's power firsthand does not guarantee repentance. It is a reminder that we should not take God's grace and mercy for granted, but rather respond to His call with a humble and repentant heart."

### John Calvin:
1. "Christ repeatedly attacked them on this subject, so that there was no end to the wickedness of those men who had once resolved to oppose the truth." 
2. "They do not express such submissiveness as to be prepared to yield to two or three miracles, and still less to be satisfied with a single miracle; but as I hinted a little before, they apologize for not believing the Gospel on this pretense, that Christ shows no sign of it from heaven."
3. "The meaning therefore is: 'Since thou professest to be a teacher and Master, if thou desirest that we should be thy disciples, let God declare from heaven that He is the Author of thy teaching, and let Him confirm thy calling by a miracle.'"

### Philip Schaff:
1. "A sign from heaven." - This phrase refers to the demand made by the Pharisees for Jesus to perform a miraculous sign as proof of his authority. It highlights their skepticism and lack of faith in Jesus.
2. "Matthew places this at a later point in the narrative." - This comment points out that Matthew includes a similar incident in his Gospel but in a different context. It highlights the different perspectives of the Gospel writers and their unique ways of presenting the events.
3. "Both the accusation and demand were made at the same interview." - This statement clarifies that the accusation and demand for a sign were made by the Pharisees during the same encounter with Jesus. It emphasizes the confrontational nature of their interaction.

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "These 'others' apparently realized the futility of the charge of being in league with Beelzebub."
2. "Hence they put up to Jesus the demand for 'a sign from heaven' just as had been done in Galilee."
3. "By 'sign' they meant a great spectacular display of heavenly power such as they expected the Messiah to give and such as the devil suggested to Jesus on the pinnacle of the temple."

### John Gill:
1. "The request for a sign from heaven reveals the lack of faith and understanding of those who were tempting Jesus. They were looking for miraculous displays of power, but failed to recognize the signs and wonders that Jesus had already performed in their midst."

2. "Jesus had already demonstrated his authority through his teachings and the miracles he had performed. The demand for a sign from heaven was a sign of their unbelief and unwillingness to accept the truth that was already before them."

3. "The request for a sign from heaven also highlights the human tendency to seek external validation and proof before accepting something as true. Jesus calls us to have faith and trust in him, even when we don't see miraculous signs or receive immediate answers to our prayers."

### John Wesley:
1. "The Pharisees demanded a sign from Jesus, but their request was not motivated by a genuine desire for faith. They were seeking to test Him and find fault. Jesus knew their hearts and responded with a rebuke, highlighting their lack of understanding and faith."

2. "Jesus refers to the story of Jonah as a sign of His own impending death and resurrection. Just as Jonah was in the belly of the great fish for three days and three nights, so would Jesus be in the heart of the earth for the same duration. This foreshadows the ultimate sign of Jesus' divinity and power over death."

3. "The Pharisees' demand for a sign reveals their spiritual blindness and hardness of heart. They had witnessed countless miracles performed by Jesus, yet they refused to believe. Jesus reminds them that the greatest sign of all is His own resurrection, which would validate His claims and prove His authority."

4. "Jesus challenges the Pharisees to examine their hearts and motives. He warns them that seeking signs without genuine faith is futile. True faith does not require constant signs and wonders, but rather a humble and receptive heart that is willing to believe and follow Jesus."

5. "In this encounter, Jesus teaches us the importance of genuine faith and the danger of seeking signs for the wrong reasons. He calls us to believe in Him, not because of the signs we see, but because of who He is and what He has done for us."
