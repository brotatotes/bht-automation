# Luke 11:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, Jesus is addressing the accusation that he casts out demons by the power of Beelzebub. The commentators suggest that Jesus is using a Greek condition to argue against this accusation. Jesus assumes, for the sake of argument, that he does cast out demons by Beelzebub. However, this conclusion is a reductio ad absurdum, as it highlights the inconsistency of the Pharisees' claim that their own sons also cast out demons. These commentators provide insights into the context and the logical reasoning employed by Jesus to refute the accusations against him.

1. "The Jews pretended to cast out devils, and to heal those that were possessed with them; which they did sometimes, by making use of the names of the patriarchs, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and sometimes of the name of Solomon."
2. "Josephus speaks of many in his time, who had this power of healing; and he himself saw one Eleazar, in the presence of Vespasian, his children, officers, and soldiers, cure many that were possessed of devils."
3. "Now if these sons of theirs cast out devils, which they would not say were done by the help of the devil, or in his name, why should they ascribe the ejection of devils by Christ, to a diabolical assistance?"
