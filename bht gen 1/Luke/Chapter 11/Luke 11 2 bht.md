# Luke 11:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the commentators emphasize the universality and importance of the instructions given by Jesus to his disciples. It is noted that the instructions concern all disciples, and that the form of prayer provided by Jesus can be used as a model for our own prayers. The verse is regarded as a directive for believers to imitate and apply the teachings in their own spiritual lives. Additionally, it is mentioned that the last petition in the Latin version is omitted in the original text.

1. "The clauses not found in the text could hardly by any possibility have been omitted by any, had they ever formed a part of it."
2. "Stierâ€™s argument, that our text has not been conformed to Matt., because the doxology has never been inserted here, seems to me to tend in quite another direction."
3. "The doxology was inserted there, because that was the form in general liturgical use, and not here, because this form was never used liturgically."
