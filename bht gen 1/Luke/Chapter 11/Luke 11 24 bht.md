# Luke 11:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, we encounter the haunting presence of evil spirits, likened to goblins shaped like goats. This alludes to the remnants of ancient Egyptian worship, where a goat figure symbolized the principle of fertility in nature. The verse is closely related to another passage that echoes its message, emphasizing the persistence of the devil's influence. It depicts a spiritual struggle, as the devil seeks rest but becomes unsettled, both among the Gentiles and the blinded Jews filled with rage against the Gospel.
