# Luke 11:25 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this intriguing passage, we encounter a vivid depiction of a spiritual state that is thoroughly devoid of goodness, no matter how much surface-level change has taken place. This verse also unveils a heart consumed by anger and hostility towards Christ and his message, creating a fertile ground for the forces of evil to take hold. The imagery employed here strongly suggests that this description applies to the Jewish nation during the period after Christ's crucifixion and leading up to the downfall of Jerusalem.
