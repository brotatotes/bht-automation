# Luke 11:26 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This verse describes the actions of individuals who are consumed by wickedness, as indicated by the reference to the devils taking spirits. These individuals have descended into a state of extreme depravity, comparable to the vileness of the foulest spirits. Their behavior is emblematic of the Jews before their destruction, and their subsequent state is even worse than before. The verse speaks to those who have deviated from true faith and highlights the consequences of their apostasy.
