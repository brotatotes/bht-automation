# Luke 11:29 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we see Jesus addressing a spiritually corrupt generation that seeks external signs as proof of His authority. While the people desire a sign, Jesus warns them that the only sign they will receive is His resurrection, symbolized by the sign of Jonah. He emphasizes that true faith involves seeking beyond what one already has, a pursuit of something greater and a surrender to God's will. This serves as a reminder that God's love and plan are sovereign, even in the face of a skeptical and sinful world.
