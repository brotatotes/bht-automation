### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The sign of Jonah is a powerful reminder that God's mercy and grace extend to all, even those who seem the most unlikely to receive it. Just as Jonah was a sign to the Ninevites, Jesus is a sign to all people, calling them to repentance and offering them the opportunity for salvation."

2. "The three days and three nights that Jonah spent in the belly of the fish foreshadowed Jesus' own death and resurrection. It is a reminder that even in the darkest and most hopeless situations, God has the power to bring about new life and redemption."
