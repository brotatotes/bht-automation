# Luke 11:32 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, commentators emphasize the powerful impact of the preaching of Jonah and Christ's preaching of repentance. The rejection of Christ's preaching is compared to the unbelief of the Jews in the face of His resurrection. The men of Nineveh, considered pagans, responded to Jonah's preaching and repented, while the Jews rejected Christ's preaching, remaining unbelieving despite being God's chosen people. The condemnation of the Jews will be intensified by the fact that the Ninevites, who were strangers to the covenants of promise, repented at Jonah's preaching.
