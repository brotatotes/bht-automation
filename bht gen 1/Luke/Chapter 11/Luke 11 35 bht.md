# Luke 11:35 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Take heed and be careful not to let the passions darken the enlightening faculty of your soul, for it is a pitiful situation if the very light within you turns into darkness. Cultivate and cherish the divine illumination that resides within you, as it is the inward light that guides and illuminates the path of your spiritual perception. Do not neglect the light of the Gospel and become blind and hardened in heart, for even the external revelation of divine knowledge may be lost if not cherished.
