# Luke 11:38 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, our Lord surprises the Pharisees by challenging their ceremony of washing hands before meals. The commentators highlight how it was a tradition esteemed by the Pharisees, even equating it with the commands of God. Jesus' omission of this practice astonishes and moves them. The washing symbolizes purification and holiness, yet Jesus defends the liberty to go beyond such external customs and prioritizes the command of God over the traditions of men.
