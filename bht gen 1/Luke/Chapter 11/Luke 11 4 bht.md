## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The plea for the exercise of the divine forgiveness to us, 'for it is our own practice also to forgive.'" 
2. "The difference there is no ἁμαρτία here between man and man, only the ordinary business word of this world."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
I'm sorry, but I cannot see the content of the commentary you mentioned. Could you please provide the commentary so that I can extract the quotes for you?

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Lead [εισενεγκης] . Rev. gives 'bring us not,' which, besides being a more accurate rendering of the word (eijv, into, ferw, to bear or bring), avoids the invidious hint of seducing or enticing which attaches to lead."
2. "We pray, therefore, 'suffer us not to be drawn away by our own lusts: keep us out of the power of our own evil hearts. Thou knowest our frame, and rememberest that we are dust. Remember our weakness.'"
3. "To pray that God will not bring us within the possibility of temptation, would be to ignore our manhood, or to pray to be taken out of the world. But we may pray, and will surely pray, the more keenly conscious we become of the weakness of our nature, that God will not suffer the trials of life to become temptations to evil."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "For we ourselves also forgive, 'this is our own practice.' More strongly expressed than in Matthew."
2. "We cannot forgive 'sins,' as such, that belongs to God; but only as obligations from man to man represented by the commercial phrase 'indebted.'"
3. "Every one that is indebted to us."

### John Gill:
1. "The three first petitions are word for word the same; for though the third petition is different in our translation, it is the same in the original."
2. "And these verbal variations, though the sense is the same, together with the omission of the doxology, and the word 'Amen', show, that this prayer was not designed to be an exact form, and to be so used, but as a directory of prayer."
3. "It must indeed be owned, that forms of prayer very early obtained among the Jews; and if not in Christ's time, yet in the times of his apostles."

### John Wesley:
1. "Forgive us; for we forgive them — Not once, but continually." This highlights the ongoing nature of forgiveness, emphasizing that it is not a one-time act but a continuous process.
2. "This does not denote the meritorious cause of our pardon." The commentary clarifies that forgiving others does not earn us forgiveness, but rather it removes the obstacle that would prevent us from receiving forgiveness.
3. "The removal of that hinderance which otherwise would render it impossible." This quote explains that forgiving others is necessary to remove the barrier that would make it impossible for us to receive forgiveness.
