In this verse, the commentators emphasize the connection between our inner thoughts and desires and our external actions.

Ultimately, the message is that God cares about our whole selves, and true righteousness involves both inward transformation and outward actions.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "How unwise and wicked is your conduct! The word denotes not only 'want of wisdom,' but also wickedness."
2. "Your conduct is not merely 'foolish,' but it is a cloak for sin - designed to countenance wickedness."
3. "Did not God, who made the 'body,' make also the 'soul?' You Pharisees take great pains to cleanse the 'body,' under a pretence of pleasing 'God.' Did 'he' not also make the 'mind?' and is it not of as much importance that 'that' should be pure, as that the body should?"

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Such a partial cleansing is no cleansing: all such religious acts are supposed to have reference to God, to holiness before Him."

3. "The folly of such a contradiction is shown."
