# Luke 11:44 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse describes the deceptive nature of the Pharisees, likening them to hidden graves or whited sepulchers. They appear righteous on the outside, but are corrupt and full of sin within. Their hypocrisy is compared to unseen graves, where people unknowingly walk over and become defiled. Despite their outward appearance, the Pharisees' true nature is revealed as they are exposed as deceitful and morally polluted.

### Henry Alford:
1. "The sepulchres are whited, that men may not pass over them unawares: and the comparison is to the outside fairness, and inside abomination." 
2. "The graves are not seen, and men thinking they are walking on clean ground are defiled by passing over them."
3. "The difference of expression may have been occasioned by the greater wealth and splendour and display of the Pharisees in the metropolis."

1. "The tombs, the unseen ones." - This phrase highlights the mysterious nature of the tombs, suggesting that they are hidden or unknown to people. 

2. "That walk over... as they walk; walk about on their daily business." - This emphasizes that people are unknowingly walking over these unseen tombs as they go about their daily lives. 

3. "Here they are not seen, and men walking on them are unconsciously defiled." - This statement reveals that the defilement caused by walking over the tombs is unintentional because the tombs are not visible.

### Philip Schaff:

1. "Christ compares the Pharisees, because of their hypocrisy, and secret iniquity, both to whited sepulchres, and to those that were not: to those that were, because, like them, they looked beautiful without, and righteous in the sight of men, and yet were inwardly full of all manner of pollution and sin."
2. "Under specious pretences to religion and holiness, [the Pharisees] were by their corrupt doctrines and practices unawares drawn into the commission of sin."
3. "Regard may not only be had to graves covered with grass, or not marked with lime, by which they might be known; but also to what the Jews call, 'the grave of the abyss', a grave that is not known no more than if it was in the bottomless pit."

### John Wesley:
1. "For ye are as graves which appear not, being overgrown with grass, so that men are not aware, till they stumble upon them."
