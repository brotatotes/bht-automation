# Luke 11:46 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse describes the woes pronounced against the religious leaders of Jesus' time, particularly the scribes and Pharisees, as well as the lawyers who burdened the people with heavy religious regulations and interpretations of the law. These leaders lacked compassion, integrity, and consistency, placing oppressive burdens on others without offering any assistance. Jesus exposes their hypocrisy and calls for true leadership that not only guides and teaches, but also supports and serves those under their care. It serves as a reminder for leaders to examine their own actions and strive for humility, compassion, and genuine service.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The scribes and Pharisees, who were the religious leaders of the time, were known for burdening the people with heavy and oppressive religious rules and regulations. Jesus criticizes them for placing these burdens on others without lifting a finger to help them."

2. "In this verse, Jesus is highlighting the hypocrisy of the religious leaders. They would preach about the importance of following the law, but they themselves would not practice what they preached. They were more concerned with appearing righteous in the eyes of others rather than truly living out their faith."

3. "Jesus is calling out the religious leaders for their lack of compassion and love towards the people. Instead of using their position of authority to serve and care for others, they were using it to elevate themselves and gain power.
