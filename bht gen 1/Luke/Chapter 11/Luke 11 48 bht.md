# Luke 11:48 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse being described is a rebuke to the religious leaders who claim to honor the prophets of the past while actively persecuting and rejecting the contemporary messengers of God. Their hypocrisy is exposed as they build tombs for the very prophets their ancestors killed, yet oppose and silence those sent in their own time. This contradiction bears witness to their deep hypocrisy and alignment with the spirit of their forefathers who rejected God's prophets.
