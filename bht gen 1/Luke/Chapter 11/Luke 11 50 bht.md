In this Bible verse, the accumulated sins of both the generation of Israel and the Amorites led to divine judgment, with the consequences falling swiftly and decisively. This judgment serves as a warning, highlighting the seriousness of shedding innocent blood and the certainty of divine retribution.

The punishment will be visible and terrifying, demonstrating the seriousness and gravity of this sin.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The iniquity of the Amorites was full" - The commentary highlights the parallel between the generation of Israel and the generation of the Amorites, emphasizing that both reached a point where their accumulated sins led to divine judgment.
2. "The whole collected vengeance of Heaven broke at once" - This quote emphasizes the sudden and overwhelming nature of the divine judgment that fell upon the generation of Israel. It suggests that the consequences of their sins were not delayed or gradual, but rather came upon them in a swift and decisive manner.
3. "The same awful principle was exemplified" - The commentary draws a connection between the judgment upon the generation of Israel and the events of the French Revolution. This quote suggests that the principle of divine judgment for accumulated iniquity is not limited to ancient times but can also be seen in more recent historical events.

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Divinely ordered sequence, first aorist passive subjunctive of εκζητεω, a late and rare verb outside of LXX and N.T., requiring as a debt the blood of the prophets." 

2. "Perfect passive participle of εκχεω and εκχυννω (an Aeolic form appearing in the margin of Westcott and Hort here, εκχυννομενον, present passive participle). If the present passive is accepted, it means the blood which is perpetually shed from time to time."

3. "From the foundation of the world (απο καταβολης κοσμου). See also Matthew 25:34; John 17:24; Ephesians 1:4, etc. It is a bold metaphor for the purpose of God."

### John Gill:
1. "The blood of all the prophets... shed from the foundation of the world." - This highlights the continuous persecution and shedding of blood of the righteous throughout history, starting from the earliest prophets like Abel. 

2. "Abel... not only a righteous man, but a prophet." - This emphasizes that Abel's sacrifice foreshadowed the sacrifice of Christ, making him not only a righteous man but also a prophet who spoke of Christ's future sacrifice.

3. "The blood of all the former ones may be required of this generation." - This suggests that the generation responsible for the shedding of the blood of the prophets will be held accountable for all the bloodshed from the beginning, indicating the severity of their actions.

### John Wesley:
1. "The blood of all shall be required of this generation" - This phrase indicates that the generation will face severe consequences for shedding innocent blood. It implies that there will be a divine judgment upon them.
2. "Shall be visibly and terribly punished upon it" - This suggests that the punishment will be evident and severe, serving as a warning to others. It implies that the consequences will be both visible and terrifying.
