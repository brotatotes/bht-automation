# Luke 11:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this vivid depiction, we witness a domestic scene where a person in bed is interrupted by a persistent visitor seeking bread. The frustration of the person in bed is palpable, as they resist getting up, citing the disturbance it would cause. The closed door symbolizes the late hour and the inconvenience of opening it. The presence of children and servants asleep further reinforces the impossibility of immediate help.
