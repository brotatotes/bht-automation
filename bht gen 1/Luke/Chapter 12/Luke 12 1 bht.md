# Luke 12:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the midst of a multitude gathered together, Jesus turns to his disciples and warns them to beware of the leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy. This caution is significant as Jesus had been speaking boldly and attracting even greater crowds to His ministry. The hypocrisy of the Pharisees is like leaven, gradually spreading and corrupting those who embrace it, much like the way leaven affects the entire lump of dough.
