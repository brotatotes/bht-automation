# Luke 12:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, a man approaches Jesus with a request to settle a dispute with his brother over their inheritance. The man's motives for seeking Jesus' help are twofold. First, he may have believed that Jesus, as the Messiah, had the power to rectify any injustice. Second, he may have been influenced by greed, hoping to secure a larger share of the inheritance. Despite the man's misunderstanding of Jesus' role and his questionable intentions, he demonstrates some level of faith by seeking Jesus' intervention.

### Henry Alford:
1. "The man was evidently not a disciple, nor preparing to be one."
2. "He thought this was just the care his circumstances wanted; being, as appears, oppressed by his brother in the matter of his patrimony."
3. "Possibly too he had an idea that the Messias, or the great Rabbi to whom he was listening, was come to set all things right."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Great Preacher of righteousness, help there is need of Thee in this rapacious world."
2. "Here am I the victim of injustice, and that from my own brother, who withholds from me my rightful share of the inheritance that has fallen to us."
3. "The man had not the least idea that his case was not of as urgent a nature, and as worthy the attention of our Lord, as anything else He could deal with."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "This man had probably had a dispute with his brother, supposing that his brother had refused to do him justice."
2. "From the parable which follows, it would appear that he had no 'just' claim on the inheritance, but was influenced by covetousness."
3. "An inheritance is the property which is left by a father to his children. Among the Jews, the older brother had two shares, or twice as much as any other child, Deuteronomy 21:17."

### John Calvin:
1. "There appear to have been chiefly two reasons why he declined the office of a judge. First, as the Jews imagined that the Messiah would have an earthly kingdom, he wished to guard against doing anything that might countenance this error."
2. "Let us learn from this to regulate our conduct by prudence, and to undertake nothing which may admit of an unfavorable construction."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "His request may have been suggested by our Lordâ€™s previous declarations about Providential care, or by his notion that the Messiah would set all things right. So that he manifested some confidence in the Lord by thus addressing Him."

2. "Such was the fame of Christ, and such credit he obtained by his ministry and miracles, that he concluded a word from him would go a great way with his brother."
3. "If he looked upon him, as the king Messiah the Jews expected, he might take this to be part of his work and office, to settle such civil affairs as these."
