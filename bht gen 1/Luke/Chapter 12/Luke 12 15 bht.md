# Luke 12:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Take heed and guard yourselves against covetousness, which is the root of all evil. Jesus' warning is not only for the two brothers, but for all. A man's life does not depend on the abundance of possessions, for true happiness is not found in excessive wealth, but in having enough to meet one's needs. Jesus reminds us that our spiritual and eternal life is not gained or secured through material possessions, as shown in the following parable.
