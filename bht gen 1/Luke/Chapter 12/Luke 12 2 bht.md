# Luke 12:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this passage, we learn that nothing can remain concealed forever, as all hidden things will eventually be brought to light. Through the Gospel, the truth of God's Word, which may seem hidden to some, is revealed by the work of the Holy Spirit. This Gospel cannot be understood by human wisdom alone, but requires the divine revelation of the Holy Spirit. These truths were spoken by Jesus on multiple occasions, emphasizing the importance and inevitability of all secrets being made known.

1. "Tis no use concealing anything, for all will one day come out."
2. "Give free and fearless utterance then to all the truth."
3. "Compare 1 Corinthians 4:3; 1 Corinthians 4:5."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Covered up [συγκεκαλυμμενον] . Only here in New Testament: implying close concealment." 

2. "The idea is that the truth of the gospel has been hidden or veiled from those who are perishing." 

3. "The gospel is not something that can be understood or accepted by human wisdom or intellect alone; it requires the work of the Holy Spirit to reveal it to us."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Covered up (συγκεκαλυμμενον εστιν). Periphrastic perfect passive indicative of συγκαλυπτω, an old verb, but here only in the N.T., to cover up on all sides and so completely." 

2. "Verses Luke 12:2-9 here are parallel with Matthew 10:26-33 spoken to the Twelve on their tour of Galilee, illustrating again how often Jesus repeated his sayings unless we prefer to say that he never did so and that the Gospels have hopelessly jumbled them as to time and place." 

3. "See the passage in Matthew for discussion of details."

### John Gill:
1. "No sin, be it ever so secret or privately done, as nothing is more covered than hypocrisy, but what shall be detected sooner or later."
2. "How careful soever men may be to hide their vices from others, they are known to God; who will bring everything into judgment, and make manifest the secrets of all hearts."
3. "These were general sentences, which were used by Christ at different times, upon different occasions, and applied to particular cases."
