## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "By supposing merely a divine decree to be meant, without personal communication, we lose the impressive part of the parable, where the man’s selfishness and folly is brought into immediate contact with the solemn truth of his approaching death, which certainly our Lord intends us to contemplate."
2. "ἄφρων, opposed to his worldly prudence; ταύτῃ τῇ ν., to the ἔτη πολλά; the ψυχή in the one case, at its ease, eating, drinking, and making merry, to the ψυχή in the other, demanded, rendered up, judged."
3. "αἰτοῦσιν, not strictly impersonal; there are those whose business it is, even the angels, the ministers of the divine purposes: see ch. Luk 6:38 and note. The merely impersonal sense may be defended: cf. Luke 12:48: but this saying seems so solemn, as to require something more."
4. "ἃ ἡτοίμασας, which thou madest ready; but not for thyself."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "This sudden cutting short of his career is designed to express not only the folly of building securely upon the future, but of throwing one's whole soul into what may at any moment be gone."
2. "'Thy soul shall be required of thee' is put in opposition to his own treatment of it, 'I will say to my soul, Soul,' &c."
3. "Compare Psalms 39:6, 'He heapeth up riches and knoweth not who shall gather them.'"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "If there is any supreme folly, it is this. As though riches could prolong life, or avert for a moment the approach of pain and death."
2. "In a single moment all his hopes were blasted, and his soul summoned to the bar of his long-forgotten God. So, many are surprised as suddenly and as unprepared."
3. "Thou shalt be required to die, to go to God, and to give up your account."
4. "Whose they may be is of little consequence to the man that lost his soul to gain them; but they are often left to heirs that dissipate them much sooner than the father procured them, and thus they secure 'their' ruin as well as his own."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Which do you take to be the more worthy of admiration, those who make images without sense or motion, or those who make intelligent and active creations?" - This quote highlights the contrast between senseless creations and intelligent beings, emphasizing the value of intelligence and purpose.

2. "The whole question of the tenure of his property is opened for the rich man. He had said my fruits and my goods. Now his proprietorship is ignored. They are not his. Whose shall they be?" - This quote emphasizes the sudden realization and loss of ownership that the rich man experiences, challenging his sense of entitlement and highlighting the transient nature of material possessions.

3. "In the second place, they shall be entirely stripped before they are judged, for they shall be judged when they are dead; and the judge, too, shall be naked; that is to say, dead." - This quote from Plato's dialogue illustrates the concept of being stripped of all external appearances and facing judgment with a naked soul, emphasizing the vulnerability and truth that lies beneath the surface.

### John Calvin:
1. "The word soul carries an allusion. Formerly, the rich man addressed his soul as the seat of all the affections: but now, he speaks of the life itself, or the vital spirit."
2. "The words, they will demand, though in the plural number, are used indefinitely, and mean nothing more than that the life of the rich man, which he imagined to be in his own power, was at the disposal of another."
3. "The design of Christ is simply to show that the life of men, which they imagine to be strongly protected by the fortress of their riches, is every moment taken away."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "God is represented as audibly uttering this judgment, to bring before the man the certainty of approaching death."
2. "Thy soul, which you would have ‘eat, drink, and be merry,’ is summoned where all this ceases, must be conscious of its higher nature, which, alas, now exposes it to judgment."
3. "The things which thou hast prepared, etc. ‘Prepared’ for thyself, they cannot be thine."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Thou foolish one (αφρων). Fool, for lack of sense (α privative and φρην, sense) as in Luke 11:40; 2 Corinthians 11:19."
2. "Is thy soul required of thee (την ψυχην σου αιτουσιν απο σου). Plural active present, not passive: 'They are demanding thy soul from thee.'"
3. "The impersonal plural (aitousin) is common enough (Luke 6:38; Luke 12:11; Luke 16:9; Luke 23:31). The rabbis used 'they' to avoid saying 'God'."

### John Gill:
1. "He determined within himself he should die that night; for the time of a man's death, as well as of his birth, is fixed by God." 
2. "Thou fool: as he appeared to be, throughout the whole of his conduct." 
3. "This night thy soul shall be required of thee... shows, that a man has no power over it to retain it, but must give it up when it is called for, even that very instant."

### John Wesley:
1. "Thou fool - To think of satisfying thy soul with earthly goods!"
2. "To depend on living many years! Yea, one day!"
3. "They - The messengers of death, commissioned by God, require thy soul of thee!"
