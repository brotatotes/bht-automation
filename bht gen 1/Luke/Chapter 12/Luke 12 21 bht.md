# Luke 12:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In utter confusion, and sudden destitution of all help and provision for eternity, lies the folly and sin of laying up treasure for oneself. Those who acquire riches for their own use, robbing their life toward God of its resources, are like beggars in the end. This path of covetousness is dangerous, but the true wisdom lies in seeking the kingdom of God, relying on His providence, and being ready to meet the Judge. In this pursuit, one realizes that being rich toward God encompasses spiritual wealth, trust in His provision, and active engagement in good works.
