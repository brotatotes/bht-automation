# Luke 12:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Food and clothing may be essential for survival, but they should not become the sole focus of our lives. As Philip Schaff points out, life is meant to be served by these earthly necessities, not the other way around. John Gill reinforces this idea, stating that life itself is of greater value than mere sustenance or outward appearance. The world, however, remains blind to this truth, often fixating on material things rather than recognizing the intrinsic worth of life. Ultimately, we are called to prioritize the significance of life, trusting in a loving God who will provide for our needs.
