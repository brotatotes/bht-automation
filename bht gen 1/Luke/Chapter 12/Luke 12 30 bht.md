# Luke 12:30 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, commentators explain that Jesus is discouraging excessive worry about basic needs, such as food and clothing. They emphasize that such anxiety is unbecoming of Christ's followers, as it reflects a lack of trust in God's providence and his covenant promises. By highlighting the Greek term for "all these things," they assert that Jesus is addressing the necessities of life and urging believers not to be overly anxious about them.

1. "This is an argument used to dissuade from an immediate and anxious concern for food and raiment, because it is Heathenish, and therefore very unbecoming the disciples and followers of Christ."
2. "It need not be wondered at in those that know not God, and do not acknowledge his providence, and are strangers to his covenant and promises."
3. "And therefore it is needless to be so anxious about them: the Persic version reads, 'all these things', and so some copies; that is, meat, drink, and clothing, all the necessaries of life."
