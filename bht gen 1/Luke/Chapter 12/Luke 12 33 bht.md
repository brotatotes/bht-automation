# Luke 12:33 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this passage, Jesus instructs His followers to sell their possessions and give to the poor. Commentators emphasize that this command is not meant to condemn wealth or promote asceticism, but rather to encourage a spirit of self-surrender and devotion to Christ. The idea is to use worldly resources to promote spiritual welfare, laying up treasures in heaven rather than in perishable bags. This directive to sell and give is seen as a law for the spirit, not a mechanical rule to be followed by all Christians.
