# Luke 12:34 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Our true treasure lies not in present circumstances, but in the eternal kingdom of God. Just as where our treasure is, there our heart will be also, our hearts should be focused on the eternal rather than the temporal. If our hearts are set upon earthly and carnal treasures, we lack the true riches. But if our treasure is heavenly, our hearts and lives will reflect a heavenly focus.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "The word 'will be' (εστα) in this verse emphasizes the future aspect of the reward, reminding us that our ultimate treasure is not found in the present circumstances, but in the eternal kingdom of God."
2. "Just as Matthew 6:21 teaches us that where our treasure is, there our heart will be also, this verse in Luke reminds us that our true treasure lies in the future, in the heavenly realm."
3. "In 1 Corinthians 7:32-34, Paul speaks of the advantage of being unmarried and undistracted in serving the Lord. This principle aligns with the idea presented in Luke 12:34, that our hearts should be focused on the eternal rather than the temporal."

### John Gill:
1. "The heart is always set upon the treasure, and as is a man's treasure, such is his heart, that is, set upon it."
