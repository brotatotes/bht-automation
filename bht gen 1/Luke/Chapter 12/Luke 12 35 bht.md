# Luke 12:35 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we are encouraged to be always prepared and ready, like servants waiting for their master's return from a wedding feast. Just as servants would gird their loins and keep their lamps burning, we are called to be spiritually and mentally prepared for action. This readiness includes remaining grounded in the teachings of the Gospel and being alert and watchful, actively engaged in serving God's kingdom. It emphasizes the need for believers to be prepared, active, and responsive to God's call at all times.
