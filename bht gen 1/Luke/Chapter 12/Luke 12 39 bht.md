# Luke 12:39 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Be on guard and be ready, for the unexpected return of the Lord is likened to a thief coming in the night. Just as a thief does not announce his arrival, so will be the coming of the Lord. We are reminded to always be prepared, like a homeowner who anticipates a thief and keeps watch over his belongings. The element of surprise and the need for constant vigilance are emphasized, urging us to remain alert until the Lord's return.
