# Luke 12:41 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This verse raises an important question: Who are the ones to wait, watch, and be honored at the Lord's coming? The suddenness of the question, its historical context, and its call to consider the entirety of the verse all contribute to its significance. Jesus' teachings are not limited to a select few, but are meant to reach all who are willing to listen and receive. Peter's desire for clarity reflects a common human tendency to seek exclusivity, but Jesus emphasizes that his message is for everyone, regardless of their background or role in society.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Who are they that are thus to wait and watch, and to be thus honoured at the Lord’s coming?" - This question highlights the central theme of the verse and invites further reflection on the identity of those who will be honored by the Lord's coming.

2. "This question, coming in so suddenly and unconnectedly and remaining apparently unanswered, is among the many proofs of the originality and historic reality of this discourse." - The suddenness and lack of immediate answer to the question indicate the authenticity and historical context of the discourse, adding weight to its significance.

3. "The whole [verse]... Who are they that are thus to wait and watch, and to be thus honoured at the Lord’s coming?" - The commentary emphasizes the importance of considering the entirety of the verse, rather than just the last two verses, in order to fully understand the question being posed.

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The question of who the message is for is a common one. Is it just for a select few, or is it meant for everyone? In this case, Jesus is speaking to his disciples, but the message is not exclusive to them. It is meant for all who are willing to listen and follow." 

2. "The disciples may have wondered if they were the only ones chosen to receive this message. But Jesus makes it clear that his teachings are not limited to a select few. They are meant to be shared with all, and it is up to each individual to decide whether they will accept and embrace the message." 

3. "The audience may have been filled with people from all walks of life, but Jesus' words were not meant to be exclusive. They were meant to reach the hearts of all who were willing to listen and receive. It is a reminder that the message of the Gospel is for everyone, regardless of their background or status."

### Philip Schaff:

### John Gill:
1. "Peter was in doubt whether the above discourse was peculiarly directed to them, the apostles, as containing special instructions to them in the discharge of the ministerial work."
2. "Or whether it was designed for all his disciples and followers, both in the present age, and in time to come, to the end of the world."
3. "Peter's question reflects a desire for clarity and understanding, showing his earnestness in wanting to grasp the deeper meaning of Jesus' teachings."

### John Wesley:
1. "The parable is addressed not only to the apostles and disciples, but to all people. It is a message that applies to everyone, regardless of their status or role in society."

2. "Jesus' teachings are not exclusive to a select few, but are meant to be understood and applied by all. This parable serves as a reminder that the message of the kingdom of God is for everyone, and no one is exempt from its call."

3. "The question of whether the parable concerns only the apostles and disciples or all people reveals a common human tendency to seek exclusivity and privilege. Jesus' response challenges this mindset and emphasizes the universal nature of his teachings."
