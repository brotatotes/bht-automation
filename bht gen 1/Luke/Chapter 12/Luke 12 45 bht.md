# Luke 12:45 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, a servant who was once faithful and wise becomes an "evil servant" according to Matthew, mistreating his fellow servants and indulging in his master's provisions. The delay in the return of the master is a prominent concern for this servant, causing him to question whether the master will come at all. It is worth noting that such apostates and persecutors of faithful followers are often characterized as not only being deceivers but also engaging in immoral behavior.

1. "Not the same servant before spoken of as a wise and faithful steward, that gives to all in the family the portion of meat in due season, and shall be found doing, and be made ruler over his master's goods but another, who also, as he, is made by his Lord ruler over his household, and is in a like post, and in the same office, but is an 'evil servant', as Matthew calls him, to distinguish him from the other."
2. "He had a notion of the coming of Christ, though he did not desire it; and because he tarried longer than was expected, supposed him to be slack concerning his promise, and began to think, and hope, and at length to believe, that he would not come at all."
3. "Generally speaking, as professors of religion, when they turn apostates, are the most violent persecutors of the saints; so such persecutors of Christ's faithful followers are commonly drunkards and debauchees."
