## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "The question of 'unto us or even to all?' reveals the tension between exclusivity and inclusivity in the message of Jesus. It challenges us to consider who is deserving of God's grace and who is excluded. Jesus' response reminds us that God's love is not limited by human boundaries and that the invitation to follow him is open to all, regardless of social status or religious background."

2. "The disciples' concern about who should receive the message reflects a common human tendency to categorize and exclude. Jesus' response challenges this mindset and calls us to embrace a more inclusive understanding of God's kingdom. He reminds us that the message of salvation is not meant to be hoarded or restricted, but to be shared with all people."

3. "Jesus' response to the disciples' question highlights the radical nature of his message. He came not to establish an exclusive club, but to bring salvation to all who would believe. His ministry was not limited to a select few, but extended to the entire world. This challenges us to examine our own attitudes and actions, and to ensure that we are not placing unnecessary barriers to God's grace."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He that knows what God commands and requires."
2. "Shall be severely and justly punished."
3. "They who have many privileges, who are often warned, who have the gospel, and do not repent and believe, shall be far more severely punished than others."

### John Calvin:
1. "In proportion as any man knowingly and willingly takes pleasure in despising the Lord, he deserves severer punishment."
2. "It is in vain for men to betake themselves to the plea of ignorance, in order to be freed from condemnation."
3. "The more abundant the instruction, therefore, which any man has received, so much the greater is the ground for punishment, if he be not obedient and submissive."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The verse states a general principle, which serves to explain the severity of the punishment spoken of in Luke 12:46."
2. "The ground of the punishment is not disobedience to an unknown will of the Lord, but the commission of acts worthy of punishment."
3. "Both classes will be punished in the same way; the difference being in degree, not in kind."

1. "The knowledge of which is necessary, in order to practice."
2. "There is no preparation, readiness, nor disposition, in a natural man, to the will of God."
3. "Persons may know much, and profess to know more, and in works deny all, and be to every good work, unfit, disobedient, and reprobate."

### John Wesley:
1. "The servant who knew his Lord's will shall be beaten with many stripes." This highlights the principle that those who have greater knowledge and understanding of God's will are held to a higher standard and will face more severe consequences for disobedience.

2. "His having much knowledge will increase, not lessen, his punishment." This emphasizes that knowledge without obedience is meaningless and can even lead to a harsher judgment. It serves as a reminder that true understanding of God's will should result in a life of faithful obedience.

3. "Knowledge without obedience is futile." This succinctly captures the essence of the verse, emphasizing that knowledge alone is not enough. It underscores the importance of aligning our actions with what we know to be true, rather than simply accumulating knowledge for its own sake.
