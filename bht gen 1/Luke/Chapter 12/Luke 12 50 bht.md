## Choicest Commentary Quotes:

Note: The commentary provided is quite lengthy, so I have selected three quotes that capture the essence of the commentary and provide insight into the symbolism and significance of baptism as it relates to the verse.

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "But . . . a baptism, c.—clearly, His own bloody baptism, first to take place."
2. "how . . . straitened—not, 'how do I long for its accomplishment,' as many understand it, thus making it but a repetition of :- but 'what a pressure of spirit is upon Me.'"
3. "till it be accomplished—till it be over. Before a promiscuous audience, such obscure language was fit on a theme like this; but oh, what surges of mysterious emotion in the view of what was now so near at hand does it reveal!"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "A baptism - See the notes at Matthew 20:22." 
2. "Am I straitened - How do I earnestly desire that it were passed!" 
3. "Since these sufferings 'must' be endured, how anxious am I that the time should come!"

### John Calvin:
1. "By these words our Lord asserts that there remains nothing but his last act, that by his death he may consecrate the renovation of the world."
2. "He compares death—as in other passages—to baptism, because the children of God, after having been immersed for a time by the death of the body, shortly afterwards rise again to life."
3. "He says that he is sorely pressed till that baptism has been accomplished, that he may encourage every one of us, by his example, both to bear the cross and to prefer death."

2. "These words express both the trouble and distress Christ was in, at the apprehension of his sufferings as man; which were like to the distress of persons, closely besieged by an enemy; or rather of a woman, whose time of travail draws nigh, when she dreads it, and yet longs to have it over."
3. "His eager desire...showed in various instances, and did show afterwards; as in his ready compliance with his Father's proposal in eternity; in his frequent appearances in human form before his incarnation; in sending one message after another, to give notice of his coming; in his willingness to be about his Father's business, as soon as possible; in rebuking Peter, when he would have dissuaded him from all thoughts of suffering."
