## BHT:
In this verse, the denial of Christ is depicted as a future action that will be denied by both Christ and the Father who is in heaven. This denial will have severe consequences for those who persist in denying Christ, resulting in eternal punishment with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels. The verb used to describe this denial emphasizes the seriousness and ultimate judgment of God, highlighting the everlasting torment that awaits deniers of Christ.
