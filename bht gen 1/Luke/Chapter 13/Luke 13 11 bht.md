### John Calvin:
1. "Luke says that the woman was held by a spirit of infirmity, so that her body was bent by the contraction of her nerves. As the nature of the disease is no farther described, it is probable that it was not one of an ordinary kind, or which was understood by physicians; and, therefore, he calls it a spirit of infirmity."

2. "We know that diseases of an unusual and extraordinary kind are, for the most part, inflicted on men through the agency of the devil; and this gave the more striking display of the divine power of Christ, which triumphed over Satan."

3. "Not that Satan rules over men according to his pleasure, but only so far as God grants to him permission to injure them. Besides, as the Lord, from whom alone all our blessings flow, makes his glory to shine with peculiar brightness in those blessings which are more remarkable, and of rare occurrence; so, on the other hand, it is his will that the power and tyranny of Satan should be chiefly regarded in extraordinary chastisements."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "A spirit of infirmity eighteen years. This suggests a form of demoniacal possession; and Luke 13:16 shows that Satanic influence was present in her case."
2. "Our Lord, however, did not heal demoniacs by laying on of hands, but by a word of command. Yet in this case He both speaks (Luke 13:12) and lays hands upon her (Luke 13:13)."
3. "The effect of her disease was that she was bowed together; her muscular power was so deficient, that she could in no wise lift herself up. She had some power, but it was insufficient to allow her to straighten herself up."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "A spirit of infirmity (πνευμα ασθενειας). A spirit that caused the weakness (ασθενειας, lack of strength) like a spirit of bondage (Romans 8:15), genitive case."
2. "She was bowed together (ην συνκυπτουσα). Periphrastic imperfect active of συνκυπτω, old verb, here only in the N.T., to bend together, medical word for curvature of the spine."
3. "And could in no wise lift herself up (κα μη δυναμενη ανακυψα εις το παντελες). Negative form of the previous statement. Ανακυψα, first aorist active infinitive of ανακυπτω (ανα, κυπτω, same verb above compounded with συ). Unable to bend herself up or back at all (εις το παντελες, wholly as in Hebrews 7:25 only other passage in the N.T. where it occurs)."

### John Wesley:
1. "She was bowed together, and utterly unable to lift up herself" - The commentary suggests that the woman's physical condition was a result of an evil spirit afflicting her. This challenges the notion that her condition was merely a natural or medical ailment.

2. "The evil spirit...afflicted her in this manner" - The commentary highlights the belief that the woman's physical ailment was not a random occurrence but a deliberate affliction caused by an evil spirit.

3. "Would not a modern physician have termed it a nervous case?" - This quote raises an interesting question about how the woman's condition might be diagnosed in modern times, suggesting that the understanding of her ailment might differ between ancient and contemporary perspectives.
