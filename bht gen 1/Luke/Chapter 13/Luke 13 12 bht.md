# Luke 13:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, Jesus exhibits both his power and compassion as he calls the woman to come near him without being asked, out of great compassion for her. He understands the nature and cause of her long-standing affliction and, with a touch and his words, he sets her free from her bonds and delivers her from her suffering. This healing serves as a powerful demonstration of Jesus' authority over diseases and his deep care for those who are suffering.

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Jesus addresses the woman as 'Woman,' which may seem harsh to our modern ears, but in this context, it is a term of respect and honor. By using this term, Jesus acknowledges her as a person of worth and dignity, not just a nameless individual in the crowd."
