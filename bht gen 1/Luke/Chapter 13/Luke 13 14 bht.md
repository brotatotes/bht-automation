# Luke 13:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The commentary on this Bible verse highlights the ruler's indirect approach and his envy towards Christ's miraculous work. The commentator points out that the ruler's indignation was not truly about the violation of the Sabbath, but rather about the honor and attention that this miracle would bring to Jesus. The ruler tries to justify his disapproval by focusing on the timing and location of the healing, using the Sabbath and religious worship as a pretext. However, the commentator argues that healing, especially when performed by Christ, cannot be considered a violation of the law referred to.

### John Gill:
1. "His indignation was at Christ, and the miracle he had wrought, being filled with envy at the honour it would bring unto him."
2. "He covered it under pretence of its being a violation of the sabbath, and that it ought not to have been done on such a day, and in such a place, which were appropriated not to servile works, but to religious worship."
3. "The observation and reproof were impertinent and needless, for the people did not come to be healed; for ought appears, the cure was unthought of and unexpected; nor was healing, especially as performed by Christ, by a word and a touch, a servile work, and therefore could not be any breach of the law referred to."
