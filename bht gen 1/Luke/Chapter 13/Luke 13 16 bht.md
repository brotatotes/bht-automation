# Luke 13:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the contrast is drawn between a woman, who is a descendant of Abraham and a chosen person of God, and a dumb animal. The emphasis is placed on the long duration of the woman's suffering, highlighting the significance of her healing. The commentators stress the importance of recognizing the worthiness of this woman and acknowledging her rightful place as an heir of the promise. Moreover, they highlight the presence of Satan and the need for her to be loosed from her affliction, just as an animal would be freed from its need for water.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The contrast is strongly drawn between a dumb animal and a daughter of Abraham, one of the chosen people."
2. "Between a few hours since the last watering and 'lo these eighteen years.'"
3. "The emphasis is on the long duration of the woman's suffering, highlighting the significance of her healing."

2. "Her dignity notwithstanding, as an heir of the promise!"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "She was therefore a Jewess; and the ruler of the synagogue, professing a special regard for the Jewish people, considering them as especially favored of God, should have rejoiced that she was loosed from this infirmity."
2. "By his 'binding' her is meant that he had inflicted this disease upon her. It was not properly a 'possession' of the devil, for that commonly produced derangement; but God had suffered him to afflict her in this manner."
3. "It is no more 'improbable' that God would suffer 'Satan' to inflict pain, than that he would suffer a wicked 'man' to do it; yet nothing is more common than for one 'man' to be the occasion of bringing on a disease in another which may terminate only with the life."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "True to its principle of contrast, this book gives Satan a prominent position." 
2. "Satan's presence in the book of Luke is highlighted by references in other passages such as Luke 4:13, Luke 10:18, and Luke 22:3, Luke 22:31." 
3. "The prominence of Satan in Luke's gospel is significant and should be considered in light of the book's overall theme and message."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "They were ‘hypocrites,’ because they perceived the necessity in the case of the beast, but heartlessly denied it in the case of the poor woman."
2. "The contrast is marked. In the one case a dumb animal, in the other a woman, who was moreover a daughter of Abraham, one of the covenant people of God, the God of the Sabbath."
3. "The animal is represented as bound by a master aware of its necessities, this woman was bound by Satan. Ordinary infirmity would scarcely be thus described; some kind of possession is asserted by our Lord."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Daughter of Abraham (θυγατερα Αβρααμ). Triple argument, human being and not an ox or ass, woman, daughter of Abraham (Jewess), besides being old and ill."
2. "Ought not (ουκ εδε). Imperfect active. Of necessity. Jesus simply had to heal her even if on the sabbath."
3. "Whom Satan bound (ην εδησεν ο Σατανας). Definite statement that her disease was due to Satan."

### John Gill:
1. "Not only a woman, or rational creature, and much preferable, as such, to an irrational one; but a descendant of Abraham, of whom the Jews gloried, and in descent from him prided themselves, and chose to call their women by this name, which gave them a character above others."
2. "Who, besides all this, was doubtless a good woman, a spiritual worshipper of the God of Israel; who, in a spiritual sense, was a daughter of Abraham, that walked in the steps of his faith, and was now a believer in Christ, and appeared to be a chosen vessel of salvation."
3. "The force of Christ's reasoning is this, that if it was lawful, on a sabbath day, to lead out a beast to watering, to quench its thirst, that so it may not suffer so much as one day for want of water, how much more reasonable must it be, that a rational creature, one of Abraham's posterity, and a religious person, who had been for eighteen years under a sore affliction, through the power of Satan over her, by divine permission, should be freed from so long and sore an affliction on the sabbath day?"

### John Wesley:
1. "Ought not any human creature, which is so far better than an ox or an ass?"
2. "Much more, this daughter of Abraham - probably in a spiritual as well as natural sense..."
3. "...to be loosed?"
