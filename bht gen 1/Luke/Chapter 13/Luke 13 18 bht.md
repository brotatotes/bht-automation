# Luke 13:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The parable, according to commentators, may depict the inward growth of the kingdom or the outward manifestation of it. It symbolizes the all-penetrating quality of the Gospel, which will mold and transform all aspects of society. The use of "therefore" suggests a logical progression in Jesus' teaching, while the ambiguity in the text necessitates further examination. The kingdom of God is not a physical place but a spiritual reality that starts small but has the potential to make a significant impact on the world. It represents growth and transformation, providing refuge and breaking human expectations.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "The parable of 'the Leaven' sets forth, perhaps, rather the inward growth of the kingdom, while 'the Mustard Seed' seems to point chiefly to the outward."
2. "Nor does it yield much satisfaction to understand the 'three measures of meal' of that threefold division of our nature into 'spirit, soul, and body,' or of the threefold partition of the world among the three sons of Noah, as some do."
3. "It yields more real satisfaction to see in this brief parable just the all-penetrating and assimilating quality of the Gospel, by virtue of which it will yet mould all institutions and tribes of men, and exhibit over the whole earth one 'Kingdom of our Lord and of His Christ'."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "He said therefore" - The use of "therefore" suggests that Jesus' statement is connected to something that has been previously mentioned or discussed. It indicates a logical progression in his teaching or response to a specific situation.

2. "It is not clear" - The commentator acknowledges the ambiguity in the text, highlighting the need for further examination and interpretation. This shows the complexity of understanding the context and the potential multiple layers of meaning in Jesus' words.

This highlights the need for careful analysis and consideration of the surrounding verses and passages.

### John Gill:
