2. "God's judgments are a great deep, and not to be fathomed by us, nor is it to be easily known, when anything befalls persons in a way of judgment; there is nothing comes by chance, but everything by the wise disposal of divine providence, to answer some end or another."
3. "Nor are persons that are punished, either immediately by the hand of God, or by the civil magistrate, to be insulted, but rather to be pitied; besides, love and hatred, the characters and states of men, are not to be known by these effects in providence."
