# Luke 13:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse being described discusses the idea of something being "covered up" and the profound implications that can come with it. It suggests that a small amount of sin or corruption can have a far-reaching impact, much like leaven spreading through dough. This hidden, subtle nature of sin reminds us of the importance of regularly examining our hearts and lives, identifying and removing any sinful attitudes or behaviors that may have crept in. By purging out the leaven, we create space for a life of authenticity and integrity, free from the contamination of sin.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Leaven is often used in the Bible as a symbol of sin or corruption. Just as a small amount of leaven can permeate and affect the entire batch of dough, so can a little bit of sin have a far-reaching impact on our lives and communities."

2. "The presence of leaven in the dough represents the hidden, subtle nature of sin. It is not always immediately noticeable, but its effects can be significant and detrimental if left unchecked."

3. "The command to 'cleanse out the old leaven' reminds us of the importance of regularly examining our hearts and lives, identifying and removing any sinful attitudes or behaviors that may have crept in."

4. "By purging out the leaven, we create space for the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth. This calls us to live lives of authenticity and integrity, free from the contamination of sin."

### John Gill:
1. "Fitly expresses the small beginnings of the Gospel ministry, and its increase, also the state and case of Gospel churches, and the nature of the grace of God."
2. "Unless false doctrine should rather be meant, which privately, secretly, and by little and little, got into the churches of Christ, the kingdom of God, and spread itself all over them."
3. "It may denote the small beginnings of the mystery of iniquity, which began to work in the apostle's time by the errors and heresies then propagated, and the manner in which the man of sin was privately introduced."

### John Wesley:
1. "The phrase 'covered up' suggests that the true nature or significance of something is hidden or concealed, perhaps intentionally. It implies that there is more to the situation than meets the eye, and that deeper understanding or revelation is needed to fully grasp its meaning."

2. "The idea of something being 'covered up' also implies a temporary state, indicating that the hidden truth will eventually be revealed or uncovered. It speaks to the idea that secrets or hidden truths cannot remain hidden forever, and that there will come a time when they are brought to light."

3. "The concept of being 'covered up' can also be understood metaphorically, suggesting that certain aspects of our lives or experiences may be veiled or obscured from our understanding. It reminds us to seek deeper insight and revelation, to not settle for surface-level understanding, but to dig deeper and uncover the hidden truths that may be waiting to be discovered."
