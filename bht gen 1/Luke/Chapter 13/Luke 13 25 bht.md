# Luke 13:25 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we are reminded of the urgency to seek entrance into heaven before it is too late. The commentators emphasize the image of a door that will eventually be shut, leading to the exclusion of those outside. They warn against being complacent, as simply seeking without striving will not guarantee admission. The verse urges us to take advantage of the opportunity while it is still available, for there will come a time when the door will be closed and it will be too late to enter.
