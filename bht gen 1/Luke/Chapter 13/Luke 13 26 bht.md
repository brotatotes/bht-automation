# Luke 13:26 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This verse describes the disappointment of those who think they have a close relationship with Christ based on their previous acquaintanceship with Him or their affiliation with Him, such as being born into a religious community. However, mere familiarity, attendance at teachings, or profession of faith without genuine belief and obedience will not be enough to secure salvation. The passage also warns against making empty claims and excuses, emphasizing the importance of true faith and fruitful action in response to the gospel.
