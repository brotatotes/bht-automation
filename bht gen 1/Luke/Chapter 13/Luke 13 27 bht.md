# Luke 13:27 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, Jesus warns against the superficiality of mere claim to know Him or perform works in His name. True discipleship involves a personal, intimate relationship with Him, characterized by obedience and a transformed life. It is a reminder to prioritize knowing Jesus above all else, as external displays of faith are not enough without a genuine heart connection to Him. As Wesley explains, Jesus desires true faith and a transformed heart, not religious performances or empty words.
