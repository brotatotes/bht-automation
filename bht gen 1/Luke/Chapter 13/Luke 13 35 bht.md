# Luke 13:35 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, Jesus delivers a profound message to the people, indicating the impending fate of Jerusalem. The commentators point out that the city and temple will be left desolate, causing great destruction and loss. They also highlight the separation and absence that the people will experience, as they will not see Jesus for a period of time. However, there is hope for salvation. The calamities the people will face will lead them to recognize their need for a Messiah, and they will be ready to welcome anyone who comes in the name of the Lord.
