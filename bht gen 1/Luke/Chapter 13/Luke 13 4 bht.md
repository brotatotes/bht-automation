## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The tower in Siloam refers to a specific incident in which a tower in the city wall near the pool of Siloam collapsed. This event is significant because it challenges the common belief that tragedy only befalls those who are particularly sinful or deserving of punishment."

2. "This verse serves as a reminder that life is unpredictable and that unexpected tragedies can happen to anyone, regardless of their moral standing. It emphasizes the importance of humility and the need to be prepared for the uncertainties of life."

3. "The tower's fall serves as a metaphor for the fragility of human existence and the impermanence of worldly structures. It reminds us to focus on the eternal rather than the temporal, and to prioritize our relationship with God above all else."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Jesus himself adds another similar case, to warn them - a case which had probably occurred not long before, and which it is likely they judged in the same manner."
2. "Josephus mentions the fountain of Siloam frequently as situated at the mouth of the Valley of Tyropoeon, or the Valley of Cheesemongers, where the fountain long indicated as that fountain is still found."
3. "It is probable that it was not far from the time when the Saviour made use of the illustration, for the manner in which he refers to it implies that it was fresh in the recollection of those to whom he spoke."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Sinners [οφειλεται] . Lit., debtors." - This quote highlights the connection between sin and debt, suggesting that sinners are indebted to God for their transgressions.
2. "Possibly with reference to the figure at the close of the last chapter." - This quote suggests that the mention of debtors may be related to the previous chapter, indicating a continuation of the theme or metaphor.
