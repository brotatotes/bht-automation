# Luke 13:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we are reminded of the consequence of ignoring warnings and the importance of repentance, as indicated by Archibald T. Robertson. It is improper to assume that those who experience heavy judgments are the worst of people, as highlighted by Albert Barnes. We see the destructive reality when multitudes perish in the ruin and debris, as pointed out by Philip Schaff. Furthermore, John Gill emphasizes that these individuals who perish in such a manner are not necessarily greater sinners but instead victims of divine providence.
