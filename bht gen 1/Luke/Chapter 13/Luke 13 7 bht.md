# Luke 13:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, the commentator quotes highlight various aspects of the passage. The three-year period mentioned represents a complete trial period before determining fruitfulness. The unfruitful vine not only hinders the growth of neighboring plants but also makes the ground idle and of no use. The parable is a call for repentance and serves as a warning for unproductive and burdensome individuals in the vineyard.

### Henry Alford:
1. "I have little doubt that an allusion is intended to the three years of our Lord’s ministry."
2. "In the individual application, many thousands did bear fruit this very year."
3. "Why, besides bearing no fruit, is it impoverishing the soil?"

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Three years—a long enough trial for a fig tree, and so denoting probably just a sufficient period of culture for spiritual fruit."
2. "Cut it down—indignant language."
3. "Cumbereth—not only doing no good, but wasting ground."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "For three successive years he had been disappointed. In his view it was long enough to show that the tree was barren and would yield no fruit, and that therefore it should be cut down." 
2. "By taking up the juices of the earth, this useless tree rendered the ground sterile, and prevented the growth of the neighboring vines. It was not merely 'useless,' but was doing mischief, which may be said of all sinners and all hypocritical professors of religion." 
3. "This parable is to be taken in connection with what goes before, and with our Saviour’s calling the Jewish nation to repentance. It was spoken to illustrate the dealings of God with them, and their own wickedness under all his kindness."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Cut it out" [εκ] from among the other trees and the vines.
2. "Not only is it unfruitful, but it draws away the juices which the vines would extract from the earth, intercepts the sun, and occupies room" (Bengel).
3. The verb cumbereth [καταργει] means to make of no effect. So Romans 3:3, Romans 3:31; Galatians 3:17. Cumbereth expresses the meaning in a very general and comprehensive way.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Three years are the time of a full trial, at the end of which the inference of incurable sterility may be drawn." (Godet) - This quote highlights the significance of the three-year period mentioned in the verse, emphasizing that it represents a complete trial period before determining the fruitfulness of the vine.

2. "Why is it allowed to impoverish the soil, and interfere with the other products of the vineyard. Barrenness curses others also." - This quote draws attention to the negative impact of the unfruitful vine on the overall productivity of the vineyard, emphasizing the importance of bearing fruit and not being a burden to others.

3. "Whatever be the special interpretation, this period indicates that fruit is not demanded too soon." - This quote emphasizes the idea that the expectation for fruitfulness should not be immediate, suggesting that there is a reasonable amount of time for growth and development before expecting results.

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "The Jewish nation is meant by this parable of the barren fig tree."
2. "In the withering of the barren fig tree later at Jerusalem we see parable changed to object lesson or fact."
3. "Makes the ground completely idle, of no use."

### John Gill:
1. "If by the owner of the vineyard is meant God the Father, then by the dresser of the vineyard Jesus Christ is intended; but as he seems rather designed by the owner, the vinedresser, or 'the gardeners', as the Persic version reads, in the plural number, may signify the ministers of the word, to whom Christ, who is Solomon's antitype, lets out his vineyard to dress and cultivate it, and to keep the fruit of it."
2. "These trees bear fruit once in three years; they bear fruit indeed every year, but their fruit does not come to maturity till after three years time; and this may be the reason why this number is fixed upon; for if such fig trees do not bring forth ripe fruit in three years time, there is little reason to expect any from them."
3. "So barren professors, as were the Jews, are not only useless and unprofitable themselves, being fruitless, but make churches barren, and stand in the way of others, who are stumbled by them; they are grieving to God, to Christ, and to the blessed Spirit, and are troublesome and burdensome to churches, ministers, and true believers."

### John Wesley:
1. "Christ was then in the third year of his ministry."
2. "A certain number being put for an uncertain."
3. "Not only bear no fruit itself, but take up the ground of another tree that would."
