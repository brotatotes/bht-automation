# Luke 14:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
During a journey, Jesus was invited to dine with the influential rulers of the Pharisees, who held great importance among them. The Sabbath was known for hosting feasts, although it had become an abuse during Jesus' time. The Pharisees watched Jesus closely, and their hospitality was hostile, as they had a concealed intent to find fault with Him. It may seem strange that Jesus dined on the Sabbath, but He sought to point out that acts of God and acts of charity do not violate the holy rest of the Sabbath.
