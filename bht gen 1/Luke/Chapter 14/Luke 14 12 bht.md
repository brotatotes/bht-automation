# Luke 14:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When Christ warns against inviting only friends, relatives, and wealthy neighbors to a feast, He encourages us to transcend ordinary fellowship and practice a higher duty of charity as explained by commentators. He exposes the superficiality of seeking the company of the wealthy and instead commends showing kindness to the poor. By extending our generosity to those in need, we demonstrate genuine charity and selflessness, rejecting the idea of expecting reward or repayment. This teaching challenges us to embrace the true spirit of hospitality and consider the needs of others above our own interests, ultimately invoking blessings upon ourselves.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Jesus certainly did not mean us to dispense with the duties of ordinary fellowship, but, remitting these to their proper place, inculcates what is better."
2. "A fear the world is not afflicted with."
3. "The meaning, however, is that no exercise of principle is involved in it, as selfishness itself will suffice to prompt to it."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He intended, doubtless, to reprove those who sought the society of the wealthy, and particularly rich relatives, and those who claimed to be intimate with the great and honorable, and who, to show their intimacy, were in the habit of 'seeking' their society, and making for them expensive entertainments."
2. "He meant, also, to commend charity shown to the poor. The passage means, therefore, call 'not only' your friends, but call also the poor, etc."
3. "Lest they feel themselves bound to treat you with the same kindness, and, in so doing, neither you nor they will show any kind spirit, or any disposition to do good beyond what is repaid."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Supper [δειπνον] is the principal meal at evening, and corresponding to the modern late dinner." 
2. "Call not thy friends, etc. A striking parallel occurs in Plato's 'Phaedrus,' 233."
3. "And, in general, when you make a feast, invite not your friend, but the beggar and the empty soul, for they will love you, and attend you, and come about your doors, and will be the best pleased, and the most grateful, and will invoke blessings on your head."

### John Calvin:
1. "Christ did not intend to dissuade us from every thing courteous, but merely to show, that acts of civility, which are customary among men, are no proof whatever of charity."
2. "To perform any act, in the hope of a reward, to rich men, from whom we expect a similar return, is not generosity, but a system of commercial exchange."
3. "Those who are kind to relatives and friends, but are niggardly towards the poor, are entitled to no commendation; because they do not exercise charity, but consult only their own gain or ambition."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The whole account is exceedingly apt and true to life."
2. "What is forbidden is the thought that this is hospitality, or in itself praiseworthy."
3. "All expenses for entertainments, for which we expect a return, are expenses for self and not for others."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "This is a parable for the host as one had just been given for the guests, though Luke does not term this a parable."
2. "It is the exclusive invitation of such guests that Jesus condemns."
3. "Recompense in the form of a return invitation."

### John Gill:
1. "When thou makest a dinner, or a supper; any entertainment for other persons, at what time of the day soever, whether sooner or later, at noon, or at night, on sabbath days, or others: call not thy friends, nor thy brethren, neither thy kinsmen, nor thy rich neighbours." 
2. "Not that our Lord's meaning is, that such should not be invited at all; which would be to destroy friendship and sociable conversation among persons in such a relation, and of such rank and fortune."
3. "His sense is, that not these only should be invited, to the neglect of poor friends, poor brethren, poor kinsmen, and poor neighbours; and who, comparatively speaking, should rather be invited than the former, as being what would be more serviceable to them, and of a greater advantage in the issue to the master of the feast himself."

### John Wesley:
1. "I do not bid thee call thy friends or thy neighbours. Our Lord leaves these offices of humanity and courtesy as they were, and teaches a higher duty."
2. "But is it not implied herein, that we should be sparing in entertaining those that need it not, in order to assist those that do need, with all that is saved from those needless entertainments?"
3. "This fear is as much unknown to the world, as even the fear of riches."
