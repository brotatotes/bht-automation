# Luke 14:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This passage describes a man expressing his anticipation of feasting in the future kingdom of God, unaware of its spiritual nature. His words reveal the common Jewish belief in a lavish, materialistic paradise with an abundance of food and drink.

This highlights the need for a deeper understanding of the spiritual blessings and eternal happiness found in the kingdom of God.

2. "This shows what was lacking in the seemingly pious exclamation of this man.

2. "To be 'blessed' in this context means to be in a position of favor with God. It is a state of being that is only possible through a relationship with Him. It is not something that can be achieved through our own efforts or accomplishments."

3. "The 'blessed' are those who recognize their need for God and depend on Him for everything. They are humble, recognizing their own spiritual poverty and their need for His grace and mercy. They are the ones who truly experience the fullness of God's blessings in their lives."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The company this ‘one’ was in and the parable which his remark called forth, oppose the view that he sympathized with our Lord."
