# Luke 14:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, people are depicted as making excuses when invited to an important event. Commentators note that these excuses vary but all serve the same purpose of putting off the invitation. Some excuses are motivated by the cares and pleasures of the world, while others claim a necessity or other pressing obligations. These excuses are seen as reflections of worldly priorities and a lack of spiritual commitment. The commentators emphasize that God does not approve of these excuses and calls for seeking His kingdom first, even when faced with worldly demands or distractions.
