# Luke 14:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, a man with dropsy, a condition characterized by the abnormal accumulation of fluid in the body, approaches Jesus. He was not a guest at the gathering, possibly placed there by the Pharisees to test Jesus or witness a miracle. Although he did not expressly ask for healing, his presence before Jesus revealed his faith in Jesus' power to cure him. This incident highlights Jesus' compassion and ability to restore physical health, even in seemingly incurable cases. It also underscores the uniqueness of this healing miracle in the New Testament.
