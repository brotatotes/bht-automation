# Luke 14:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this passage, we see the contrast between the broad streets and narrow lanes, symbolizing the invitation of the gospel to both the cities and villages and the despised and outcasts. The parable emphasizes the urgency of responding to the gospel's invitation, as time is running out. The invitation extends to all, including the poor and the spiritually destitute. Despite the anger and grief of the host over the rejection of some, the feast is ready, and prompt action is required to partake in its blessings.
