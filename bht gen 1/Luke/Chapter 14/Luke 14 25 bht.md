# Luke 14:25 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, Jesus is on a final journey to Jerusalem, surrounded by great multitudes of people who were likely heading to the Passover feast. However, Jesus deliberately tries to discourage the crowds from following Him mindlessly, as He wants true disciples who are willing to sacrifice everything for Him. He looks directly at them, speaking with a serious and solemn tone, making it clear that following Him requires giving up what is dear and being prepared to face hardships.
