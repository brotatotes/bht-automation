# Luke 14:26 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, Jesus extends an open invitation to all individuals, emphasizing the inclusivity of His offer of discipleship. He calls for a complete surrender of one's own desires, symbolized by taking up the cross, and a willingness to embrace suffering and self-denial. This invitation is a call to a life of discipleship, where one's love for Christ should surpass all other affections and attachments, even familial ties. It requires a radical prioritization of one's commitment to Christ, putting Him above all else, including earthly possessions and relationships.

1. "The demand is for supreme love to Christ: father, and mother, etc., are placed here as objects which may and often do interfere with this supreme love."
2. "In so far as they do this, they are to be hated, not actively and personally, but generally."
3. "All belonging solely to the sphere of the lower life, as opposed to the life of the Spirit, must be opposed in heart, i.e., actually hated."
