# Luke 14:31 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse being described speaks about the danger and folly of following Christ without considering the requirements of discipleship. It symbolizes a battle between two kings, representing the Christian and the world. The Christian must take counsel, deliberate, and ponder the decision, seeking not the advice of flesh and blood but of God and fellow believers. While the enemies of the Christian seem numerous and strong, it is essential to remember that God is with us, equipping us for the spiritual warfare we face.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "συμβαλεῖν πρὸς μάχην occurs Polyb. x. 37. 4" - This commentary references a specific instance in Polybius where the phrase "συμβαλεῖν πρὸς μάχην" is used, indicating that it is not a unique expression in the Bible.

2. "the instance from Xen. Cyrop. vii. 1. 20, cited by Meyer, does not apply" - The commentary dismisses a potential example from Xenophon's Cyropaedia, suggesting that it is not relevant to the interpretation of the verse.

3. "being συμβ . πρὸς τὸ μαχόμενον" - The commentary clarifies that the example from Xenophon's Cyropaedia is different because it uses the phrase "συμβ . πρὸς τὸ μαχόμενον" instead of "συμβαλεῖν πρὸς μάχην."
