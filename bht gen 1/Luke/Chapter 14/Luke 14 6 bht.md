# Luke 14:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the argument presented by our Lord was conclusive, leaving the opposing party thwarted and overcome. They couldn't find the strength or ability to answer back, as they were helpless and their mouths were shut up. They hated admitting that their priorities were misplaced, and the justice, equity, mercy, and humanity in the reasoning was a challenge to their own beliefs and practices.
