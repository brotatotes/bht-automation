# Luke 15:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we see the immense joy that is present in the celestial realm. The parable speaks of the Great Shepherd reclaiming His lost sheep and the joy that fills the heavens upon its recovery. This joy is not only shared by God Himself, but also by the angels, who are described as neighbors of God. The angels rejoice because a soul is rescued from the clutches of Satan, expanding the kingdom of Christ. This passage reminds us that the redemption of even a single lost soul has immeasurable significance and brings boundless joy to the heavenly realms.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "True to the idea of the parables. The Great Shepherd. The Great Owner Himself, is He whose the joy properly is over His own recovered property but so vast and exuberant is it, that as if He could not keep it to Himself, He 'calleth His friends and neighbors together'—His whole celestial family—saying, 'Rejoice WITH ME, for I have found My sheep-My-piece,' c."
2. "In this sublime sense it is 'joy,' before 'or in the presence of the angels' they only 'catch the flying joy,' sharing it with Him!"
3. "The recovery of even one such outcast is watched with interest and hailed with joy; nor are they left to come home of themselves or perish; for lo! even now the great Shepherd is going after His lost sheep, and the Owner is making diligent search for the lost property; and He is finding it, too, and bringing it back with joy, and all heaven is full of it."

### John Calvin:
1. "If angels mutually rejoice with each other in heaven, when they see that what had wandered is restored to the fold, we too, who have the same cause in common with them, ought to be partakers of the same joy."
2. "Though it would be more agreeable to the wishes of angels (as it is also more desirable) that men should always remain in perfect integrity, yet as in the deliverance of a sinner, who had been already devoted to destruction, and had been cut off as a rotten member from the body, the mercy of God shines more brightly."
3. "The word repentance is specially limited to the conversion of those who, having altogether turned aside from God, rise as it were from death to life."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Lest it should seem strange that so much importance is attached to the proper use of perishing and unrighteous wealth, remember the great principle: ‘He that is faithful,’ etc."
2. "That which is least, or ‘a very little.’ This refers to earthly possessions, and the faithfulness is the wise and prudent conduct suggested by the parable."
