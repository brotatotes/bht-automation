# Luke 15:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This verse depicts a profound biblical truth by using the image of a man in a parable. It reveals that God's reception and forgiveness of sinners aligns with His nature. The parable involves two sons, representing the relationship between standing and fallen believers. While the elder brother embodies the attitude of self-righteousness, the younger son represents the repentant and restored believer. Through this parable, Christ conveys the importance of recognizing God's grace and forgiveness for all who humbly seek Him.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The mystery of the admission of the Gentiles into God’s Church was not yet made known in any such manner as that they should be represented as of one family with the Jews."
2. "The upholders of this interpretation forget that when we speak of the Jew as elder, and the Gentile as younger, it is in respect not of birth, but of this very return to and reception into the Father’s house, which is not to be considered yet."
3. "The relations of elder and younger have a peculiar fitness for the characters to be filled by them, and are I believe chosen on that account."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Jesus, to illustrate still farther the sentiment which he had uttered, and to show that it was proper to rejoice over repenting sinners, proceeds to show it by a most beautiful and instructive parable."
2. "We shall see its beauty and propriety by remembering that the 'design' of it was simply to 'justify his conduct in receiving sinners,' and to show that to rejoice over their return was proper."
3. "This he shows by the feelings of a 'father' rejoicing over the 'return' of an ungrateful and dissipated son."

### John Calvin:
1. "In the first part is shown how readily God is disposed to pardon our sins."
2. "Christ describes all sinners who, wearied of their folly, apply to the grace of God."
3. "He compares God, who is not satisfied with pardoning those who pray to him, but even advances to meet them with the compassion of a father."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "In your use of it, i.e., 'faithful in that which is least.' Who will commit to your trust!" - This quote emphasizes the importance of being faithful and responsible with earthly possessions, as it reflects our trustworthiness in handling greater things.

2. "Such unfaithfulness proves us unfaithful in much (Luke 15:10), according to the judgment of God, who will not therefore entrust us with the true riches." - This quote highlights the connection between our faithfulness in earthly matters and God's trust in us to handle spiritual blessings and true riches.

3. "The word 'riches' is properly supplied in the translation, although the literal sense is 'the true,' that which is real, as opposed to the deceitful nature of earthly wealth." - This quote explains that the true riches referred to in the verse are not just material wealth, but rather the genuine and eternal blessings that come from a faithful relationship with God.

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The self-sacrificing care is that of the owner in each case." 
2. "Here (verses Luke 15:11-32) we have the most famous of all the parables of Jesus, the Prodigal Son, which is in Luke alone."
3. "In the moral sphere, there must be self-recovery to give ethical value to the rescue of the son who wandered away."

### John Gill:
1. "God indeed is not a man, nor is he to be represented by any human image; but inasmuch as man is the image of God, God is sometimes compared to man, and is called a man of war, an husbandman, c. which no ways contradict his being a spirit and true it is, that the second person only assumed human nature; and therefore, whenever a divine person is spoken of as man, Christ is commonly intended."

2. "The reception of sinners, and the forgiveness of them for Christ's sake, agree with [God the Father]."

3. "By the 'two sons' are meant, not angels and men, as that angels are the elder, and men the younger son; nor are the Jews and Gentiles here intended, which is the more received and general sense of the parable: rather standing and fallen professors may be designed: since the former are very apt to carry it toward the latter, in like manner as the elder brother is represented in this parable, as carrying himself towards the younger."
