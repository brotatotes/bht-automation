# Luke 15:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, the parable presents a compelling depiction of mankind's free will and the consequences that arise from our desire for independence from God. It illustrates the impatience and ambition of youth, reflecting the restless nature of human beings seeking to be their own masters. The younger son, symbolic of sinners, represents the imprudent nature of man in a state of nature, lacking knowledge of divine and spiritual things. Ultimately, this narrative reveals the boundless goodness and forbearance of God, as well as the inescapable and painful consequences that result from turning away from Him.
