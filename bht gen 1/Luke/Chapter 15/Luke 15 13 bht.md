# Luke 15:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, a person embarks on a journey to a far country, abandoning their previous life and wasting their resources in a reckless and incorrigible manner. This journey signifies the individual's departure from God and their descent into a state of sin and separation from Him. Through the imagery of wandering and spiritual waywardness, this verse highlights the consequences of straying from God's presence and the destructive nature of a life lived without regard for Him.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The images of both the preceding parables are united here: in ἀπεδήμησεν we have the straying sheep; in his state when he got into the far country, the lost piece of money." 
2. "But in this case the search is to be carried on within him we are now on higher ground than in those two parables."
3. "ἀσώτως: The old English word retchlessly expresses perhaps best the meaning, which is not ‘unsparingly’ (in which sense of ‘saving money’ I doubt σώζω ever being used), but incorrigibly, past hope of reclaim."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "not many days—intoxicated with his new-found resources, and eager for the luxury of using them at will."
2. "a far country—beyond all danger of interference from home."
3. "riotous living—'with harlots.' Ah! but this reaches farther than the sensualist; for 'in the deep symbolical language of Scripture fornication is the standing image of idolatry; they are in fact ever spoken of as one and the same sin, considered now in its fleshly, now in its spiritual aspect'."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He went probably to trade or to seek his fortune, and in his wanderings came at last to this dissipated place, where his property was soon expended."
2. "By his wandering away we may understand that sinners wander far away from God; that they fall into dissolute and wicked company."
3. "Their wandering so far off is the reason why they fall into such company, and are so soon and so easily destroyed."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Took his journey [απεδημησεν]. Answering to our phrase went abroad." 
2. "Wasted [διεσκορπισεν]. The word used of winnowing grain. See on Matthew 25:24." 
3. "With riotous living [ζων ασωτως]. Lit., living unsavingly. Only here in New Testament."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Since the proper use of wealth is for God, those who do not thus use it are slaves to Mammon."
2. "The last verse implies that wealth is not our own, this implies that when it is used as our own, the presumed owner not only does not own it, but himself belongs to it."
3. "Our Lord speaks of wealth as ‘that which is least,’ modern socialism regards money as the true riches. In principle, practice, and result, the two systems are totally divergent Christianity is the service of God, socialism the service of mammon, judged by its fruits, ‘earthly, sensual’ and devilish."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "After not many days" - Luke often uses this idiom to indicate a short period of time passing. (Quote #1)
2. "He burned all his bridges behind him, gathering together all that he had." - The prodigal son completely cut ties with his past life and took everything he had with him. (Quote #2)
3. "Living dissolutely or profligately." - The prodigal son lived a life of reckless and extravagant behavior. (Quote #3)

### John Gill:
1. "As soon as a man has any internal substance, any considerable degree of natural knowledge, he immediately sets out from God, and employs it against him."
2. "As soon as a wicked man has of this world, what his carnal heart desires, he is for living independent of God, and his providence."
3. "Which sets forth the state of alienation a sinner is in, while unconverted; he is afar off from God, from God the Father; from the presence of God, and communion with him."

Note: The commentary provided is quite long, so I had to condense it significantly to fit within the word limit.

2. "Squandered away his substance - All the grace he had received"
3. "He took a journey into a far country"
