# Luke 15:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the story described by the commentators, a person experiences a famine that represents a spiritual emptiness and the consequences of sin. This famine can be seen as a providential event, allowing the individual to realize their need for something greater. It is a turning point that can lead to despair or repentance. The famine is connected to the person's environment and their pursuit of worldly pleasures, ultimately leaving them in a state of want. Through this experience, the person comes to recognize the need for true fulfillment and the pursuit of a deeper relationship with God.
