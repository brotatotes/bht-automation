# Luke 15:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, a person sinks deeper and deeper, becoming a despised servant of an alien. The abrupt change of subject reveals the profound degradation and loathsome employments to which sin leads people. It is a story of someone who forcefully attaches himself to another, engaging in the lowest and most degrading forms of work. The main message is that sin, which starts as a desire for freedom, ultimately leads to slavery and dependence on the evil forces of the far country.
