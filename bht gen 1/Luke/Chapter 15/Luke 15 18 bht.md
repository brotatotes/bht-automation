# Luke 15:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, a lost son experiences a powerful transformation as he returns to his father in repentance. It is a resurrection from the dead, a change marked by simplicity and power, as the prodigal sinner humbly claims his identity as a beloved son, willing to take the lowest place. He deeply acknowledges his sins as offenses against God, and in his resolve, he reflects on his real condition and determines to return home, seeking forgiveness and reconciliation with his heavenly Father. This heartfelt confession and desire for restoration reveal the genuine nature of his repentance.

3. "Ah! and is it come to this? Once it was, 'Any place rather than home.' Now, 'Oh, that home! Could I but dare to hope that the door of it would not be closed against me, how gladly would I take any place and do any work, happy only to be there at all.' Well, that is conversion—nothing absolutely new, yet all new old familiar things seen in a new light and for the first time as realities of overwhelming magnitude and power."
