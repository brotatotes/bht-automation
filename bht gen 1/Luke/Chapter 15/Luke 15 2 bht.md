# Luke 15:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the enemies of our Lord testify to His willingness to receive sinners. They insinuate that Jesus must sympathize with sinners based on the company He keeps. Jesus, however, does not despise or overlook sinners but treats them with kindness and shows no sense of social superiority. He condescends and extends His grace to notorious sinners and receives them as they are, without requiring any worthiness on their part. Jesus' love seeks and receives sinners, making it a truth of unspeakable preciousness.

2. "Great condescension and grace did he show in receiving them who were 'sinners', not only by nature, but by practice; and not merely guilty of common infirmities, but were notorious sinners, covetous, extortioners, oppressors of the poor, and very debauched persons."
3. "No man should be discouraged from coming to Christ, on account of sin; all that do come to him, should come as sinners, for he receives them as such; nor does he receive any for any worthiness there is in them."
