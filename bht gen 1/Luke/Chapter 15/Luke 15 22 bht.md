# Luke 15:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this well-known parable, the father's extravagant love and mercy are vividly depicted through the imagery of clothing. The best robe given to the repentant son symbolizes the righteousness of Christ, restoring him to a position of honor and acceptance. The ring represents the everlasting love and seal of sonship from God, while the shoes signify freedom and dignity as they distinguish the son from a servant. This powerful story serves as a reminder that God eagerly forgives and restores those who humbly turn to Him.
