# Luke 15:25 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this parable, a son is depicted as working in his father's field, engaged in the family business. This highlights a sense of responsibility and commitment to the legacy of his father. The mention of innocent pleasures and festivities suggests that the Lord approves of the joys and unbendings of human life, reminding us that not all aspects of existence are tainted by sin. The use of music, harmonious collaboration, and dancing symbolizes unity and cooperation within the body of Christ, where each member has a unique role to play in creating a beautiful symphony of worship and praise.

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The word used here for music, συμφωνιας (symphōnias), refers specifically to a symphony or concerted music. This suggests that the music being played was not a solo performance, but rather a harmonious collaboration of different instruments or voices."

3. "Just as a symphony requires each instrument to play its part in order to create a harmonious sound, so too does the body of Christ require the active participation and cooperation of each member. We are called to use our individual gifts and talents to contribute to the overall purpose and mission of the church."

### John Calvin:

3. "The Gospel does not give an uncertain sound, nor contradict itself; it is not yea and nay... and as music, has a powerful and attractive virtue in it; so the Gospel is mighty and efficacious in the hand of the Spirit of God to quicken even dead sinners, to draw them to Christ, to allure, charm, and comfort them."

### John Wesley:
1. "The elder son represents the Pharisees and scribes, who were known for their self-righteousness and judgmental attitude towards sinners."
