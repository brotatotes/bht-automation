# Luke 15:28 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, we see the compassionate nature of God being compared to that of a loving father towards his children. The verse describes God's deep-seated and lasting indignation, not just a temporary anger, towards the self-righteous and those who reject His message of salvation. It serves as a reminder that God's love extends to all, urging us to bear with the faults of our brothers and not to envy the compassion shown towards them. We are cautioned against letting anger and pride hinder us from experiencing the grace and blessings that God wants to bestow upon us.
