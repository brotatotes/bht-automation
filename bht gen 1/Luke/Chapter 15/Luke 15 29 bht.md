# Luke 15:29 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the Pharisaic language of the elder son's complaint is highlighted, raising questions about the sincerity of the Jewish nation's words. The response of the father attests to the truth and love behind his actions. The comparison between the kid and the fatted calf illustrates the contrast in treatment, emphasizing the value and joy the father expresses at the prodigal son's return. Self-righteousness and lack of love are revealed as the failures of Pharisaism, while grace and mercy are extended even to those who have strayed and returned.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "ἰδ. τοσ. ἔτη δουλ. σοι, the very manner of speech of a Pharisee: as is the continuation οὐδέπ. ἐντ. σου παρ. Could the Jewish nation be introduced saying this, even in the falsest hypocrisy?" This quote highlights the Pharisaic language used in the verse and questions the sincerity of the Jewish nation's words.

2. "ἐμοὶ οὐδέποτε ἔδωκας answers to the younger son’s δός μοι in Luke 15:12; it is a separation of the individual son from his father, and, as there pointed out, the very root and ground of sin." This quote explains the significance of the phrase "ἐμοὶ οὐδέποτε ἔδωκας" in relation to the younger son's request for his share of the inheritance, emphasizing the separation and sinfulness it represents.

3. "ἔριφον, of less value than a calf." This quote highlights the comparison between the younger son and a calf, emphasizing the lesser worth of the younger son in the eyes of the father.

4. "τ. φίλ. μου who are these? this elder son also then has friends, who are not his father’s friends: see Matthew 22:16, τ. μαθητὰς αὐτῶν μετὰ τῶν Ἡρωδιανῶν." This quote raises the question of who the friends of the elder son are and suggests that they may not be aligned with the father's values, drawing a parallel with the Pharisees and their association with the Herodians in Matthew 22:16.

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "He is merely contrasting his constancy of love and service with the conduct of his brother."
2. "The father attests the truth of all he says."
3. "It was no entertainment for the gratification of the prodigal: it was a father's expression of the joy he felt at his recovery."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "This complaint was unreasonable, for his father had divided his property, and he 'might' have had his portion, and his father had uniformly treated him with kindness."
2. "But it serves to illustrate the conduct of the scribes and Pharisees, and the folly of their complaint."
3. "This was of less value than the calf; and he complains that while his father had never given 'him' a thing of so little value as 'a kid,' he had now given his other son the 'fatted calf.'"

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Kid [εριφον] . Some read the diminutive, ejrifion, 'a little kid.'"
2. "In any event a contrast is intended between the kid and the fatted calf."
3. "The choice of a kid instead of a lamb or a calf may have been made because the kid was a common sacrificial animal in Palestine."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The words of the elder son prove that his obedience in the past had not been hearty, and that he was now in opposition to his father's will."
2. "In contrast with 'the fatted calf.'"
3. "Self-righteousness is dissatisfied with the reward it receives. The essential failure of Pharisaism is its want of love to God despite its external obedience."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Progressive present tense of this old verb from δουλος (slave) which the elder son uses to picture his virtual slavery in staying at home and perhaps with longings to follow the younger son."
2. "Not even once (aorist) in contrast with so many years of service (linear present)."
3. "Some MSS. have εριφιον, diminutive, a little kid. So margin of Westcott and Hort."

### John Gill:
1. "He served his father, not in the Gospel, but in the law, moral and ceremonial; in the letter of it, and not in the newness of the Spirit; externally, and not internally; from fear, and not from love."
2. "He had never been under a work of the Spirit of God, who convinces of sin; and had never seen himself in a true light, in the glass of that law, he pretended to serve God in; that he was a stranger to the plague of his own heart, and was a self-deceiver."
3. "He had never received any favour in proportion to the services he had done; and so charges his father with ingratitude."

### John Wesley:
1. "How admirably therefore does this parable confirm that assertion!"
2. "Perhaps God does not usually give much joy to those who never felt the sorrows of repentance."
3. "God's grace and mercy are not limited to those who have always been faithful, but are extended even to those who have strayed and returned."
