## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The Father still asserts the restored sonship of his returned prodigal." 
2. "The difficulties which have been found in the latter part of the parable...are considerably lightened by the consideration that the contradiction of that assertion would have been beside the purpose of the parable." 
3. "The result of the Father's entreaty is left purposely uncertain...it is thus broken off, to be closed by each individual for himself."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The deeper sunk and the longer estranged any sinner is, the more exuberant is the joy which his recovery occasions."
2. "Such joy is not the portion of those whose whole lives have been spent in the service of their Father in heaven."
3. "Instead of grudging the want of this, they should deem it the highest testimony to their lifelong fidelity, that something better is reserved for them—the deep, abiding complacency of their Father in heaven."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The Lord would represent the forbearance of God toward the Pharisee as well as His pardoning love toward the prodigal; hence severe rebuke is excluded."
2. "The claim rested upon a correct principle: 'the doers of the law shall be justified' (Romans 2:13), but the character of the elder son is so portrayed as to indicate that he failed to stand on that principle."
3. "The parable was itself the Father’s entreaty to the elder son, and with each of those whom He represented the responsibility of answering was left."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "The father repeats to the elder son the language of his heart used in verse Luke 15:24 to his servants." 
2. "A real father could do no less." 
3. "Certainly he has produced a graphic pen picture here of God's love for the lost that justifies forever the coming of Christ to the world to seek and to save the lost."

### John Gill:
1. "It was meet that we should make merry... and this elder brother also, because of the relation he stood in to him." 
2. "If he had had the same spiritual affection the apostle had for his brethren and kinsmen, according to the flesh, he would have rejoiced at the conversion and return of sinners by repentance." 
3. "For this thy brother, though he would not own him as such, was dead, and is alive again, and was lost, and is found."

### John Wesley:
1. "Amazing intimation, that the best of men ought to account the worst sinners their brethren still; and should especially remember this relation, when they show any inclination to return."
2. "Our Lord in this whole parable shows, not only that the Jews had no cause to murmur at the reception of the Gentiles, but that if the Pharisees were indeed as good as they fancied themselves to be, still they had no reason to murmur at the kind treatment of any sincere penitent."
3. "Behold with wonder and pleasure the gracious reception they find from Divine, injured goodness! When such a prodigal comes to his father, he sees him afar off. He pities, meets, embraces him, and interrupts his acknowledgments with the tokens of his returning favour."
