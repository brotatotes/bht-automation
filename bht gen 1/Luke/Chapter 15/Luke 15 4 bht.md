# Luke 15:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, God's unwavering love and concern for each individual is beautifully depicted. Like an owner who leaves the majority to find the one lost sheep, God tirelessly pursues and labors for the restoration of every soul, going to great lengths to seek out those who have gone astray. This parable emphasizes the value and worth that God places on each person, encouraging us to imitate His compassion and actively reach out to those in need of redemption. To neglect the lost, as Wesley reminds us, would be both unchristian and inhuman.

"Christ vindicates his conduct in conversing with sinners, and neglecting the Scribes and Pharisees; for if it was right for an owner of an hundred sheep, when he had lost one of them, to leave all the rest, and go in search after that one till he had found it; then it was right in Christ to do what he did."
2.

3. "The 'one lost sheep' in this parable, though it may include all the elect of God, and be accommodated to a single elect sinner, yet chiefly respects the chosen of God among the Jews; which were very few, a remnant according to the election of grace: and which lay among the profane part of them, the publicans and sinners."
