### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Pieces of silver [δραχμας] . Used by Luke only." 
2. "A coin worth about eighteen cents, commonly with the image of an owl, a tortoise, or a head of Pallas." 
3. "A common weight in dispensing medicines and writing prescriptions."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The unjust steward, lit., ‘the steward of unrighteousness.’ This phrase stamps the conduct of the steward as immoral; and in this aspect as unworthy of imitation."
2. "Wiser (not absolutely, but) for their generation (i.e., in their dealings with one another, since the whole parable is drawn from that sphere) than the sons of the light (those who are really Christians)."
3. "The steward carefully considered his situation; but Christians very often fail to look at their duty in the light of their knowledge, and to act as common sense would dictate."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Ten pieces of silver (δραχμας δεκα). The only instance in the N.T. of this old word for a coin of 65.5 grains about the value of the common δηναριυς (about eighteen cents), a quarter of a Jewish shekel." 

2. "The root is from δρασσομα, to grasp with the hand (1 Corinthians 3:19), and so a handful of coin. Ten drachmas would be equal to nearly two dollars, but in purchasing power much more."

3. "Sweep (σαρο). A late colloquial verb σαροω for the earlier σαιρω, to clear by sweeping. Three times in the N.T. (Luke 11:25; Luke 15:8; Matthew 12:44). The house was probably without windows (only the door for light and hence the lamp lit) and probably also a dirt floor. Hence Bengel says: non sine pulvere."

### John Gill:
1. "The parable signifies the passiveness of a sinner in conversion, who can contribute no more to the first act of conversion than a lost piece of silver to its being found."
2. "The Gospel itself, like a candle, is lighted up in the evening of the world and may be removed from place to place. It gives light and is useful both to work and walk by."
3. "The preaching of the Gospel and the power that goes along with it is the means of the effectual calling of the elect, sweeping the house and causing a great stir and uproar in the sinner."
