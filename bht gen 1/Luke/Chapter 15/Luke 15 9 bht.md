# Luke 15:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Within the sacred walls of the Church, the Spirit finds its dwelling, accompanied by celestial beings who watch over its members. As the ministering spirits rejoice over each redeemed soul brought into the treasure-house of God, the gracious Spirit diligently seeks out the lost sinner, buried in the mire of this world. This search is akin to a diligent search for a lost valuable coin, demonstrating the great care that should be taken to find and appreciate the precious teachings of the Word.
