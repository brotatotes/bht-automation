# Luke 16:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Bible verse emphasizes the contrast between "unrighteous mammon," referring to worldly possessions acquired through dishonest means, and the "true riches" bestowed by God. Material wealth is temporary and fleeting, while spiritual treasures are eternal and lasting. It is vital to be faithful in handling earthly possessions, using them wisely and in alignment with God's values. By demonstrating integrity in the small matters of this world, we open ourselves to receiving the greater gifts of God's grace and eternal riches.
