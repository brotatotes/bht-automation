# Luke 16:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse being described highlights the concept of stewardship and the temporary nature of earthly possessions. It emphasizes the idea that material wealth is entrusted to us by God and should be used responsibly and in accordance with His will. If we are faithful stewards of what is given to us, we can expect to receive eternal rewards. However, if we act unfaithfully with worldly possessions, we should not expect to be entrusted with heavenly treasures. Ultimately, the verse reminds us that our true ownership lies in the eternal blessings of heaven.
