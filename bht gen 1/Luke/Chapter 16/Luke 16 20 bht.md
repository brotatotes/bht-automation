# Luke 16:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, a man named Lazarus, whose name signifies "God a help," is depicted as a beggar, helpless and in need. He is laid at a gateway, discarded and afflicted with open and untreated sores, depicting his extreme suffering. Despite the significant name, this Lazarus is distinct from the Lazarus of Bethany. The gate symbolizes the rejection of Christ by the Jews, as he had no entrance into their hearts and was ultimately led outside the gates of Jerusalem to suffer.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The significant name Lazarus should have prevented the expositors from imagining this to be a true history."
2. "Perhaps by this name our Lord may have intended to fill in the character of the poor man."
3. "The portal, which led out of the προαύλιον into the αὐλή."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Laid—having to be carried and put down." This quote highlights the severity of the man's condition, emphasizing that he was completely incapacitated and unable to move on his own.
2. "Full of sores—open, running." This quote vividly describes the physical state of the man, indicating that his sores were not only present but also actively discharging, which adds to the overall picture of his suffering.
3. "Not closed, nor bound up, nor mollified with ointment." This quote draws a parallel with Isaiah 1:6, emphasizing that the man's sores were left untreated and unhealed, further emphasizing the extent of his affliction.

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "It is a striking evidence of the deep impression which this parable has made on the mind of Christendom, that the term lazar should have passed into so many languages as it has, losing altogether its signification as a proper name" (Trench).
2. "Was laid [εβεβλητο]. Lit., was thrown: cast carelessly down by his bearers and left there."
3. "Gate [πυλωνα]. The gateway, often separated from the house or temple. In Matthew 26:71, it is rendered porch."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The significant name is mentioned in this case. It means ‘God a help,’ not, as some suppose, ‘helpless.’"
2. "The Lazarus of this parable has nothing save the name in common with Lazarus of Bethany."
3. "The rich man thus had an opportunity of making a better use of his wealth, for the ‘gate’ was the only entrance to the house itself."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "The name Lazarus is from Ελεαζαρος, 'God a help,' and was a common one." 
2. "Lazar in English means one afflicted with a pestilential disease."
3. "He had been flung there and was still there, 'as if contemptuous roughness is implied' (Plummer)."

### John Gill:
1. "The name Lazarus well agrees with him. The Syriac version calls him 'Loozar', as if it signified one that was helpless, that had no help, but wanted it, and so a fit name for a beggar; and well suits with Christ, who looked, and there was none to help."
2. "And though by assuming human nature, he did not cease to be God, or to lose the riches of his divine nature and perfections, yet his divine perfections, and the glory of them, were much hid and covered in his state of humiliation; and he was much the reverse of many of them in his human nature; in which he was exposed to much outward poverty and meanness."
3. "This denotes the rejection of Christ by the Jews; he came to them, and they received him not; he had no entrance into their hearts, and was admitted but into few of their houses; they put those that confessed him out of their synagogues; and caused him himself to depart out of some of their cities; they delivered him up unto the Gentiles that were without; and at last led him without the gate of Jerusalem, where he suffered."

### John Wesley:
1. "By his name it may be conjectured, he was of no mean family, though it was thus reduced."
2. "There was no reason for our Lord to conceal his name, which probably was then well known."
3. "It seems this circumstance is recorded to show that all his ulcers lay bare, and were not closed or bound up."
