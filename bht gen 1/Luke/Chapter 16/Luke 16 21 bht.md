# Luke 16:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This verse showcases the plight of Lazarus, who endures great suffering and neglect. The commentators emphasize the contrast between the indifference and cruelty of the rich man and the pitiable state of Lazarus. Despite his desperate circumstances, Lazarus remains resigned to God's will and lacks any desire for earthly wealth. The mention of dogs highlights the depth of his misery and his abandonment by society. Ultimately, the commentators point to the redemptive power of Christ, who offers salvation and solace to the downtrodden souls who embrace him and feed on his sacrifice.
