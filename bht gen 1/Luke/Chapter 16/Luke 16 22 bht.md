# Luke 16:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This verse depicts the contrast between the earthly suffering and heavenly bliss experienced by two individuals after death. The beggar, worn out and hungry, is carried by angels to Abraham's bosom, symbolizing the soul's entrance into paradise. The phrase "Abraham's bosom" represents a place of ultimate peace and joy for the righteous, a meeting point in paradise with the patriarch. In contrast, the rich man's death is unremarkable, and his extravagant funeral is criticized for its superficiality. The verse emphasizes the transformative power of death and the importance of humility and compassion in life.

"Christ died not merely as an example to them, or only to confirm his doctrines; but as a substitute, in the room and stead of his people; to atone for their sins, and satisfy divine justice; to procure the pardon of them in a way of justice; to take them away, and utterly abolish them; to bring in an everlasting righteousness; to obtain eternal redemption, and bring such nigh to God who were afar off, and that men might live through him now, and have eternal life by him hereafter."
3. "The ascension of Christ is expressed by a being 'carried up into heaven', and here he is entered, and has been received, and will be retained, until the time of the restitution of all things; here he is glorified in human nature, sits at the right hand of God, and appears in his presence, on the behalf of his people; and indeed, the ends of his going there, were to receive gifts for them, to be their advocate and intercessor, to take possession of heaven in their name, and prepare that for them, and them for that; and hither 'he was carried by angels'."
