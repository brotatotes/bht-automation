# Luke 16:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this passage, we are presented with a vivid depiction of the afterlife, particularly the contrasting experiences of the righteous and the wicked. The commentators refer to Hades as the temporary abode of all disembodied spirits. For the righteous, it is a place of bliss and joy, symbolized by Abraham's bosom or Paradise. However, the wicked suffer torment in Hades, experiencing pain and anguish that are beyond human comprehension. This parable highlights the eternal consequences of one's choices in life and serves as a powerful reminder of the need for righteousness and the promise of divine justice.

### John Calvin:
1. "Souls have neither fingers nor eyes, and are not liable to thirst, nor do they hold such conversations among themselves as are here described to have taken place between Abraham and the rich man; but our Lord has here drawn a picture, which represents the condition of the life to come according to the measure of our capacity."

3. "The wicked are described as fearfully tormented by the misery which they feel; as desiring some relief, but cut off from hope, and thus experiencing a double torment; and as having their anguish increased by being compelled to remember their crimes, and to compare the present blessedness of believers with their own miserable and lost condition."
