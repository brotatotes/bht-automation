# Luke 16:25 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we see a solemn and fatherly response, devoid of mocking or grief, from the afterlife. The nature of our present desires will shape our future bliss, as our whole life on earth is laid out before us like a map. The verse emphasizes the receipt in full and the exhaustion of all claims, revealing the consequences for one's choices and the deep divide between those who seek consolation in a life beyond the grave and those engulfed in their own pleasures.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:

2. "Analogy gives us every reason to suppose, that in the disembodied state the whole life on earth will lie before the soul in all its thoughts, words, and deeds, like a map of the past journey before a traveller."
3. "ἀπέλαβες not sufficiently expressed by ‘receivedst,’ E. V.: it is analogous to ἀπέχουσιν, Matthew 6:2; Matthew 6:5; Matthew 6:16, and expresses the receipt in full, the exhaustion of all claim on."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Son—stinging acknowledgment of the claimed relationship."
2. "As it is a great law of God's kingdom, that the nature of our present desires shall rule that of our future bliss."
3. "He whose 'evil things,' all crowded into the present life, drove him to seek, and find, consolation in a life beyond the grave, is by death released from all evil and ushered into unmixed and uninterrupted good."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It would not lessen his sorrows to remember that he was a 'son' of Abraham, and that he ought to have lived worthy of that relation to him."
2. "One of the chief torments of hell will be the 'remembrance' of what was enjoyed and of what was done in this world."
3. "How much 'better' was the portion of Lazarus, after all, than that of the rich man! It is probable that Lazarus had the most 'real' happiness in the land of the living, for riches without the love of God can never confer happiness like the favor of God, even in poverty."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Receivedst [απελαβες]. Received back [απο] as a reward or quittance." This quote highlights the idea that the son received something in return for his actions, suggesting that there is a consequence or recompense for one's choices.

2. "Gulf [χασμα]. From caskw, to yawn. Transcribed into the English chasm." This quote provides insight into the meaning of the word "gulf," emphasizing its connection to a deep, wide opening or divide.

3. "Is fixed [εστηρικται]. Compare ch. 22 32; and see on 1 Peter 5:10." This quote suggests that the fixed state mentioned in the verse can be compared to other biblical references, potentially providing further understanding of its significance.

### John Calvin:
1. "Son, remember." - The word "son" is used ironically to reprove the rich man for his false boasting. It serves as a painful reminder of his hypocrisy and false confidence.

3. "They who have patiently endured the burden of the cross... have a rest laid up for them in heaven." - Those who faithfully endure suffering and remain steadfast in their hope of a better life will find comfort and rest in heaven when their earthly struggles come to an end.

### Philip Schaff:

2. "Remember. Memory remains and is intensified in that state; it is here appealed to so as to prove to the man in torment the picture of his lot."
3. "But now, etc. The reason was not that Lazarus had been poor and the other man rich. It was the rich man’s estimate of his wealth, of which Abraham spoke."
