# Luke 16:27 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this passage, a lost spirit, having realized the truth, expresses sympathy towards his fellow brethren. Despite the anguish and misery experienced in the afterlife, there is no awakening of goodness or hope within the hearts of the lost. Instead, there is bitter reproach, as they reflect on their own choices and question why they were not adequately warned. The verse also highlights the significance of remembering and advocating for those in need, emphasizing a desire for redemption and change.

2. "Compare Dante, where Ciacco, the glutton, says to Dante: 'But when thou art again in the sweet world, I pray thee to the mind of others bring me.'" - This quote draws a parallel between the request made by Ciacco in Dante's Inferno and the plea made by the rich man in the Bible verse.

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The Roman Catholics probably justify prayer to saints from this petition from the Rich Man to Abraham, but both are in Hades (the other world)."
