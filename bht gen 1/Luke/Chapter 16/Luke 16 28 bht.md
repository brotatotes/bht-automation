# Luke 16:28 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, a man testifies as a thorough witness, potentially from beyond the grave. The rich man, laboring under a delusion, hopes that his brothers will believe this testimony as a man resurrected. However, their scorn and mockery only deepen his anguish, adding to his torment in the afterlife.

### John Gill:
1. "The Jewish nation were usually divided into 'three' parts, 'priests, Levites, and Israelites'; of these three the great sanhedrim usually consisted...now these were again divided into 'three' sects, 'Pharisees, Sadducees', and 'Essenes'." 
2. "Christ, when here on earth, did testify to that people of their sins, showed them the heinousness of them, inveighed against them, and reproved for them; and of their righteousness, and showed the hypocrisy, deficiency, and insufficiency of it to justify them."
3. "His concern for them did not arise from any regard to Christ, and the enlargement of his interest; nor from any love to his testimony, the Gospel; nor from any real notion or desire of converting grace for his brethren; nor from true love to them; but from a selfish principle, lest his own torments should be aggravated by their coming."

### John Wesley:
1. "He might justly fear lest their reproaches should add to his own torment."

3. "The fear of their scorn and mockery intensifies his anguish."
