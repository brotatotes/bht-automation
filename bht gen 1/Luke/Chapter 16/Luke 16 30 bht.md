# Luke 16:30 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the commentators emphasize the disbelief and stubbornness of the people, despite witnessing miracles and hearing God's message through prophets. They point out that even Lazarus rising from the dead didn't convince them, and the resurrection of Jesus didn't win over the unbelieving nation either. The commentators highlight the need for repentance as the key, rather than relying on signs, wealth, or influence. Ultimately, the verse portrays a hardened and rebellious people who refuse to listen and repent, even in the face of overwhelming evidence and divine grace.
