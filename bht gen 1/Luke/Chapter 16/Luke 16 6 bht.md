# Luke 16:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, a steward is depicted returning debtors their own bonds, allowing them to alter the figures rather than creating new ones. The transaction happens quickly and discreetly, implicating all the debtors together. The measurements mentioned in the verse, such as the bath and bond, have different interpretations and amounts according to various commentators. The use of the bath is associated with oil for lamps and other purposes, while the bond signifies a written contract indicating a bargain made.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The steward, not yet out of office, has all the vouchers by him, and returns each debtor his own bond, for him to alter the figure (not, to make another, which would imply the destruction of the old bond, not its return)." 
2. "σου is not emphatic, as Wordsworth, who has several times fallen into this mistake: see note, ch. Luke 14:26-27: but entirely unemphatic; almost expletive." 
3. "καθίσας is graphic. ταχέως implies the hurry with which the furtive business is transacted. The debtors seem to be all together, that all may be implicated and none may tell of the other."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The measure here mentioned is the 'bath' which contained, according to Dr. Arbuthnot’s tables, 7 12 gallons, or, according to the marginal note, about 9 gallons and 3 quarts."
2. "Oil of olives, or sweet oil. It was much used for lamps, as an article of food Exodus 29:2, and also for anointing, and, of course, as an article of commerce, 1 Kings 5:11."
3. "The bill or contract was in the hands of the steward, and he gave it back to him to write a new one."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The bath was a Hebrew measure, but the amount is uncertain, since, according to Edersheim, there were three kinds of measurement in use in Palestine."
2. "Assuming the first standard, the bath would be about fifty-six pints, and the debt, therefore, a large one."
3. "The bill is the bond which the buyer has given, and which is in the steward's keeping. He gives it back to the debtor for him to alter the figures."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Measures (βατους). Transliterated word for Hebrew bath, between eight and nine gallons." 
2. "Thy bond (σου τα γραμματα). Thy writings, thy contracts, thy note." 
3. "Quickly (ταχεως). It was a secret arrangement and speed was essential."

### John Gill:
1. "They were for the temple service; and the bath was the measure of oil, as the ephah was of wheat."
2. "According to Godwin, it held four gallons and a half; so that a hundred of them contained four hundred and fifty gallons."
3. "Take thy bill, or 'writing'; which showed the bargain made for so many measures; and which acknowledged the receipt of them, and promised payment."
