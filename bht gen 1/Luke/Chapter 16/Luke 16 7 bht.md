# Luke 16:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, several commentators emphasize the significance of the measures mentioned. Albert Barnes and Archibald T. Robertson explain that the Hebrew "kor" or "homer" was a unit of measurement equivalent to a specific volume. According to Barnes, it contained around 32 pecks or 8 bushels. Robertson adds that a cor was about ten bushels. Additionally, Marvin Vincent notes that the variations in the amount deducted in the parable do not have specific symbolic meanings. These details, along with John Gill's insights about the law and the actions of the steward, provide context and understanding to the passage.
