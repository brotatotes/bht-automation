# Luke 16:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, a cunning and dishonest steward is commended by his master for his shrewdness, but not for his unjust actions. The commendation highlights the ability to adapt means to ends and secure worldly provision. Jesus uses this example to emphasize that the world often displays more wisdom and prudence in worldly matters than the children of light do in spiritual matters. This serves as a reminder for believers to apply the same level of wisdom and foresight in pursuing heavenly and eternal life.
