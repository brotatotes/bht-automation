# Luke 16:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we see the admonition to use worldly wealth for righteous purposes, recognizing its deceptive nature. Through acts of charity and mercy, we can make friends and obtain favor with God. By wisely employing our riches and generously bestowing them on our neighbors, we not only provide a seasonable relief but also lay up treasure in heaven. Ultimately, our hope lies in being received into the everlasting habitations, where those we have blessed may serve as witnesses for us on the great day.
