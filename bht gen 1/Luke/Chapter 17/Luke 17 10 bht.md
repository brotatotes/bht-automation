# Luke 17:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the commentators emphasize that as servants of God, we cannot claim any merit or favor from Him. We are reminded of our humility, recognizing that our actions do not add to God's greatness. Our service to God should be driven by duty, not the expectation of reward. The commentators stress that our righteousness falls short, and any reward we receive is due to God's grace alone. Ultimately, we are urged to approach our service with humility, recognizing our own insufficiency and relying on God's unmerited favor.

### Henry Alford:
1. "This shews the sense of the parable, as applying to our own thoughts of ourselves, and the impossibility of any claim for our services to God."
2. "In Romans 6:23 we have the true ground on which we look for eternal life set before us; viz. as the gift of God whose servants we are, not the wages, as in the case of sin, whose we are not."
3. "The case supposed introduces an argument à fortiori: 'how much more, when ye have failed in so many respects.'"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "We have not, as his servants, profited or benefited God at all." This highlights the humility of the servants, recognizing that their actions do not add anything to God's greatness or glory.

2. "unprofitable—a word which, though usually denoting the opposite of profit, is here used simply in its negative sense." This clarifies that the term "unprofitable" is not used in the usual sense of lacking value, but rather to emphasize that the servants have not added anything to God's worth.

### John Calvin:
1. "Christ speaks here of an entire observance of the law, which is nowhere to be found; for the most perfect of all men is still at a great distance from that righteousness which the law demands."
2. "The present question is not, Are we justified by works? but, Is the observance of the law meritorious of any reward from God? This latter question is answered in the negative; for God holds us for his slaves, and therefore reckons all that can proceed from us to be his just right."
3. "Though it were true, that a reward is due to the observance of the law in respect of merit, it will not therefore follow that any man is justified by the merits of works; for we all fail: and not only is our obedience imperfect, but there is not a single part of it that corresponds exactly to the judgment of God."

2. "The true servants of Christ serve him in the first place, and seek first his righteousness, and his kingdom, and the honor of it, believing that all other things shall be added to them."
3. "Humility is necessary, that a man may not arrogate that to himself, which do not belong to him; or boast of his performances; or place any dependence on them; or have his expectations raised on account of them; since when he has done the most and best, he has done but what he should, and what he was obliged to, and in that is greatly deficient."
