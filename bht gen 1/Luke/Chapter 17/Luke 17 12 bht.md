# Luke 17:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In a village bordering Samaria and Galilee, there stood a group of lepers united in their misery and isolation, separated from the rest by the law's requirement to keep their distance. Confined to this village, they were unable to enter the larger cities. Being unclean, they intuitively recognized their need to turn aside as they stood afar off, a reflection of their deep reverence for Christ's authority and power. Their separation symbolized the brokenness and sinfulness of humanity, reminding us that Jesus came to bridge the gap, heal the outcasts, and offer redemption to all.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Their misery had broken down the national distinction, and united them in one company."
2. "On the nature of leprosy and its significance."
3. "See Leviticus 13:46; Numbers 5:2."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Stood afar off" - This phrase echoes the Old Testament law found in Leviticus 13:45-46, where those with leprosy were required to stand at a distance from others. It highlights the social and spiritual isolation experienced by the lepers, emphasizing their separation from the community and their need for healing and restoration.

2. "Stood afar off" - This distance also symbolizes the separation between humanity and God due to sin. Just as the lepers were kept at a distance, sin separates us from God. It serves as a reminder of our need for reconciliation and the healing power of Jesus to bridge that gap and restore our relationship with God.

3. "Stood afar off" - This phrase also reveals the humility and reverence of the lepers. Despite their desperate situation, they did not approach Jesus with entitlement or demands. Instead, they recognized their unworthiness and approached Him with respect and deference, acknowledging His authority and power to heal. Their posture of humility serves as a powerful example for us to approach God with reverence and humility in our own lives.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "They were not allowed to enter the village while they were afflicted with leprosy."
2. "They were unclean, and it was not lawful for them to come near to those who were in health."
3. "Seeing him, and knowing that they were unclean, they stopped or turned aside, so that they might not expose others to the contagion."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The mention of lepers in this verse reminds us of the healing miracles performed by Jesus, as recorded in Luke 5:12. It highlights Jesus' compassion and power to heal those who were considered outcasts and untouchable in society."

2. "The inclusion of lepers in this verse serves as a reminder that no one is beyond the reach of God's love and mercy. It shows that Jesus came to bring healing and restoration to all, regardless of their social status or physical condition."

3. "The presence of lepers in the biblical narrative often symbolizes the spiritual condition of humanity. It represents our brokenness, sinfulness, and need for divine intervention. Jesus' interaction with lepers emphasizes his role as the ultimate healer and savior, offering hope and redemption to all who come to him."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Misery had united them, although they were of different races."
2. "Who stood afar off. Because of their uncleanness."
3. "See on Matthew 8:2; and comp. the Levitical requirements: Leviticus 13:46; Numbers 5:2."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "They stood at a distance (Leviticus 13:45)." This quote highlights the parallel between the lepers in the Bible verse and the lepers mentioned in Leviticus, emphasizing the social and cultural significance of their distance.

2. "The first healing of a leper (Luke 5:12-16) like this is given by Luke only." This quote points out the uniqueness of Luke's account of the healing, suggesting that Luke may have had a specific reason for including this particular story in his Gospel.

3. "The compound read by B means 'rose up.'" This quote provides a linguistic insight, explaining the meaning of the compound used in the Greek text and shedding light on the physical action of the lepers in the verse.

### John Gill:
1. "Whether in Samaria or Galilee, is not certain; perhaps it bordered on both, since there were both Jews and Samaritans in it, as appears by what follows."
2. "Who either were confined to this place, this village, for they might not be in the larger cities, and walled towns."
3. "From Christ, by reason of their uncleanness, as they were obliged to by the law, in Leviticus 13:46."
