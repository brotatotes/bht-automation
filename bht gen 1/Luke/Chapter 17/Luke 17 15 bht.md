## BHT:
A man, who had been healed of a visible and tangible ailment, stood up and glorified God, acknowledging the divine power behind his restoration. The healing had a practical effect on his ability to move and function. Moved by gratitude, he returned to Jesus to offer thanks and praise for his cure, recognizing the rarity of gratitude and the transformative power of healing.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The ἰδὼν ὅτι ἰάθη (seeing that he was healed) suggests that the healing was a visible and tangible event, not just a subjective experience." 

2. "The ὑπέστη (he stood up) implies a physical action, indicating that the healing had a practical effect on the man's ability to move and function." 

3. "The μ. . φ. . μεγ. . δ. . τ. . θεόν (glorifying God) highlights the man's recognition of the divine power behind his healing, emphasizing the spiritual significance of the event."

### John Calvin:
1. "He must have obtained permission from the priests to return to the ordinary intercourse of life; and he had no right to neglect the command of Christ, and to defraud the temple of God of a sacrifice."
2. "Some will perhaps be better pleased with a different conjecture, that as soon as he saw that he was cleansed, and before he applied to the priests for a testimony, he was seized with a devout and holy zeal, and returned to the Author of the cure, so as to commence his sacrifice with thanksgiving."
3. "The words of Christ contain an expostulation with the whole nation; for it is by way of reproach that he draws a comparison between one stranger and many Jews, because it was customary with them to swallow up God’s favors without any feeling of piety."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The description is graphic, the healing took place immediately."
2. "There may be an allusion to the clearness of voice resulting from the cure of his leprosy, since that disease would make the voice husky."
3. "Glorifying God and love to Jesus Christ are closely joined."

### John Gill:
1. "When he felt perfect soundness in his body, and perceived that he was restored to his health, and saw with his eyes that the leprosy was gone from him, which must be visible enough: turned back; either immediately, before he went to the priests; or afterwards, came back to Jesus, when he had been with them." 

2. "Gratitude is a rare thing, it is found but in few; unthankfulness cleaves to most persons; it is the general character of men to be unthankful and unholy; multitudes, even all men, share in the providential goodness of God, yet few take notice of, and are thankful for it."

3. "No man will seek after a cure, till he sees, or is sensible of his sickness and his wound; and when he does, he will inquire after, and make use of the proper means of healing; and when he has got a cure, he is, or at least ought to be, thankful for it."
