# Luke 17:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, a miraculous healing takes place that involves a Samaritan and a group of Jews. The commentators highlight the significance of the Samaritan's ethnicity, emphasizing his despised status and how it colors the entire incident. The healed Samaritan's gratitude and willingness to approach Jesus with profound respect and reverence is also emphasized, contrasting with the behavior of the other Jews. This man's deep sense of gratitude prompts him to prostrate himself before Jesus, giving thanks and acknowledging his duty and obligations. The healing becomes not only a physical restoration but also a transformative moment for the grateful Samaritan.
