# Luke 17:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This verse describes a group of foreigners, specifically Samaritans, who are contrasted with Jews. The commentators highlight the fact that the Samaritans were considered outsiders, not only because of their Gentile background but also because of their mixed religion. The Samaritans were seen as strangers, aliens from the commonwealth of Israel, and were not typically shown favor by the Jews. The commentators emphasize the irony in this verse as the Samaritan, who was not expected to show gratitude, is the only one who returns to give thanks to God for his healing.
