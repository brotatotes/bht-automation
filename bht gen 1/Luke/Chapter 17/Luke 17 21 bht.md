### Albert Barnes:
1. "The reign of God is 'in the heart.' It does not come with pomp and splendor, like the reign of temporal kings, merely to control the external 'actions' and strike the senses of people with awe, but it reigns in the heart by the law of God; it sets up its dominion over the passions, and brings every thought into captivity to the obedience of Christ."

### John Gill:
1. "No such thing will fall under the observations of man, not but that this would be said, and was said by some persons, as it is suggested it should... but the sense of the words is, that no such thing ought to be said; and if it was said, it would not be true; nor should it be credited."
