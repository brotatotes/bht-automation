# Luke 17:27 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
During the time of Noah, people were consumed by worldly pleasures, with a focus on indulging their desires and disregarding any impending judgment. The lifestyle of the people was characterized by extravagance and sensuality. The descendants of Cain, known for their wickedness, intermarried with the righteous "sons of God." Ultimately, the catastrophic flood was not a coincidental event, but a manifestation of God's sovereign power and will.
