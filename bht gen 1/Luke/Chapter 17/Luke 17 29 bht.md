# Luke 17:29 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse being described talks about divine intervention and destruction. In this verse, the use of the phrase "ὁ θεὸς βρέχει" in Matthew 5:45 indicates that it does not necessarily imply the involvement of the sacred name. Luke 17:31 refers to the immediate example of Sodom, suggesting a connection to the destruction caused by fire and brimstone. Additionally, Matthew 24:16-18 places the verse in the context of the destruction of Jerusalem. This verse serves as a warning, drawing a parallel between the catastrophic fate of Sodom and the impending doom of Jerusalem.
