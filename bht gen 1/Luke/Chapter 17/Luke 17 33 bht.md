# Luke 17:33 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In these verses, Jesus challenges his followers to prioritize their commitment to him over their own self-preservation and safety. The commentators emphasize that seeking to save one's life by compromising one's beliefs or seeking personal comfort will ultimately lead to losing it. However, willingly sacrificing one's life for the sake of Christ and his gospel will result in the preservation and reward of everlasting life. They caution that true safety is found in being ready to surrender our lives for a higher purpose, rather than clinging to worldly security.
