# Luke 17:34 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In a moment of severance, the prepared and unprepared find themselves thrown together, their old associations forcibly abandoned. The night becomes a symbol of surprise and terror, vividly underscoring the imminent return of the Lord. It signifies a separation, not only between those who were once closely linked, but also between the faithful and the unfaithful. This momentous event, when Christ comes, will catch a heedless world off guard, paralleling the days of Noah and Lot.

1. "The word 'men' is not in the text, it is only, 'there shall be two in one bed'; and may as well be understood of a man and his wife, since it is not so usual for two men to lie in one bed; and this the rather more strongly expresses the distinguishing providence of God in saving one, and suffering the other to be taken and lost."
