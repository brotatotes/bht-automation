## BHT:
The verse being described portrays the different reactions people have to the preaching of the Gospel. Some embrace it as a source of life, while others reject it, leading to their spiritual death. The commentator notes that these instances are not simply about the impact of the Gospel, but also the varying circumstances in which people receive it. Whether asleep on a bed, feasting on a couch, grinding in a mill, or working in the field, these individuals may not be in the optimal position to truly listen and respond.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### John Gill:
1. "The circumstances attending these several instances show that they cannot be considered as expressive of the use and effect of the preaching of the Gospel, that being the savour of life unto life to some, and the savour of death unto death to others."
2. "Some being effectually called by it, and others being left to die in their sins."
3. "These men and women are said to be either in a bed asleep, or on a couch feasting, or grinding in a mill, or at work in the field, and so not in proper places and at leisure to hear the Gospel preached."
