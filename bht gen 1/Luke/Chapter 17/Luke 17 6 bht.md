# Luke 17:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
If believers possessed even a small amount of genuine faith, no task or challenge would be too difficult for them. The mention of the sycamine tree in this context seems to be a proverbial expression, symbolizing a seemingly insurmountable obstacle. This tree was known for its size, extensive roots, and tenacity, making it a fitting representation of difficulty and impossibility. Thus, this passage serves as a reminder of the remarkable power and potential of faith, even in the face of seemingly impossible circumstances.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The mulberry-tree; not very common in Palestine, but still found there."
2. "Notice the different tenses with ἄν: ἐλέγετε ἄν, ye would say: ὑπήκουσεν ἄν, it would (even while you were speaking) have obeyed."
3. "‘Cum ipsis radicibus, in mari mansura. Tale quiddam fit ipsis fidelibus.’ Bengel."

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "The sycamine tree was known for its deep roots, which made it difficult to uproot or transplant. This emphasizes the power of faith, which has the ability to uproot and overcome obstacles that seem impossible to overcome." 

2. "The sycamine tree was also associated with bitterness and unforgiveness. Jesus uses this imagery to teach the disciples about the importance of forgiveness and the need to uproot bitterness from their hearts in order to experience the fullness of God's grace." 

3. "The sycamine tree is a reminder that faith and forgiveness go hand in hand. Just as the disciples were called to have faith that could uproot a tree, they were also called to forgive others and uproot bitterness from their hearts. This challenges us to examine our own hearts and ask ourselves if there are any roots of bitterness that need to be uprooted through forgiveness."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "This sycamore is a remarkable tree. It not only bears several crops of figs during the year, but these figs grow on short stems along the trunk and large branches, and not at the end of twigs, as in other fruit-bearing trees." 
2. "It is easily propagated, merely by planting a stout branch in the ground, and watering it until it has struck its roots into the soil. This it does with great rapidity and to a vast depth."
3. "Now, look at this tree - its ample girth, its wide-spread arms branching off from the parent trunk only a few feet from the ground; then examine its enormous roots, as thick, as numerous, and as wide-spread into the deep soil below as the branches extend into the air above the very best type of invincible steadfastness."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Luke distinguishes between this and sukomorea, the fig-mulberry." 
2. "The names were sometimes confused, but a physician would readily make the distinction."
3. "Both were used medicinally."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The promise here given is even stronger than that in Matthew, for the tree is represented as being planted in the sea, where growth is ordinarily impossible."
2. "This promise is misunderstood, only when miracles of power are put above miracles of grace."
3. "You think the duties I enjoin too hard for your faith, but this shows that you have as yet no faith of the high order you ought to have, for the smallest measure of such a faith would enable you to do what seems altogether impossible in the natural world; and so much the more in spiritual things, since real faith is preeminently spiritual power."
