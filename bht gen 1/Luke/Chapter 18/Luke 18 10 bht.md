# Luke 18:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In a temple court, two men went up to pray. One, a Pharisee, stood proudly, boasting about his righteousness and looking down on others. The other, a publican, stood humbly, acknowledging his unworthiness before God. The temple, a place of prayer and worship, served as the backdrop for this contrasting display of attitudes and approaches to God. The approaching Passover added a sense of spiritual significance to the scene, as the characters grappled with their understanding of prayer and their own righteousness in the eyes of God.

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Stood (σταθεις). First aorist passive participle of ιστημ. Struck an attitude ostentatiously where he could be seen. Standing was the common Jewish posture in prayer (Matthew 6:5; Mark 11:25)." 
2. "Prayed thus (ταυτα προσηυχετο). Imperfect middle, was praying these things (given following). With himself (προς εαυτον). A soliloquy with his own soul, a complacent recital of his own virtues for his own self-satisfaction, not fellowship with God, though he addresses God."
3. "I thank thee (ευχαριστω σο). But his gratitude to God is for his own virtues, not for God's mercies to him. One of the rabbis offers a prayer like this of gratitude that he was in a class by himself because he was a Jew and not a Gentile, because he was a Pharisee and not of the am-haaretz or common people, because he was a man and not a woman."

### John Gill:
1. "The Jews had a mighty notion of praying in a place of religious worship, imagining that their prayers were more acceptable to God in such a place than in private."
2. "A man ought to join himself with the congregation, and not pray alone, whenever he can pray with that."
3. "The Pharisee...trusted in themselves as righteous and despised all others, especially publicans and sinners."
