# Luke 18:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, a Pharisee stands before God and arrogantly separates himself from others, rejoicing in his perceived moral and religious superiority. He boasts of his virtues, does works of supererogation, and fails to recognize his own sins and need for forgiveness. Standing ostentatiously, he thanks God in a self-centered and prideful manner, disregarding the undeserved goodness of God and relying on his own righteousness. This self-righteousness and contemptuous attitude towards others ultimately lead to his condemnation.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "To have been kept from gross iniquities was undoubtedly a just cause of thankfulness to God but instead of the devoutly humble, admiring frame which this should inspire, the Pharisee arrogantly severs himself from the rest of mankind, as quite above them."
2. "But these are only his moral excellencies. His religious merits complete his grounds for congratulation."
3. "Thus, besides doing all his duty, he did works of supererogation; while sins to confess and spiritual wants to be supplied he seems to have felt none."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He said over to himself what he had done, and what was the ground on which he expected the favour of God."
2. "Hypocrites are often the most orthodox in opinion of any class of people. They know the truth, and admit it."
3. "It is, however, not wrong to thank God that he has kept us from the gross sins which other people commit; but it should not be done in an ostentatious manner, nor should it be done forgetting still that we are great sinners and need pardon."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Stood [σατθεις] . Lit., having been placed. Took his stand. It implies taking up his position ostentatiously; striking an attitude. But no necessarily in a bad sense."
2. "Stood [σατθεις] . Lit., having been placed. Took his stand. It implies taking up his position ostentatiously; striking an attitude. But no necessarily in a bad sense."
3. "This publican. Lit., this (one), the publican. This publican here. 'He lets us see, even in the general enumeration, that he is thinking of the publican, so, afterward, he does not omit directly to mention him' (Goebel)."

### John Calvin:
1. "This thanksgiving, which is presented exclusively in his own name, does not at all imply that he boasted of his own virtue, as if he had obtained righteousness from himself, or merited anything by his own industry."
2. "Men are not truly and properly humbled, though they are convinced that they can do nothing, unless they likewise distrust the merits of works, and learn to place their salvation in the undeserved goodness of God, so as to rest upon it all their confidence."
3. "Let us therefore know that, though a man may ascribe to God the praise of works, yet if he imagines the righteousness of those works to be the cause of his salvation, or rests upon it, he is condemned for wicked arrogance."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The phrase doubtless alludes to the fact that his prayer was not really a communing with God, but a communing with himself."
2. "He did not thank God, but boasted. It is possible to thank God for what we do and become more than others, but such a thanksgiving springs out of the most profound humility."
3. "The Pharisee then subdivides the rest of men into classes: extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even as this publican. 'Even' is contemptuous; it does not imply that he considered the publican as less unworthy than the other classes."

### John Gill:
1. "He stood alone, apart from the publican, at a distance from him, as despising him; and lest he should be polluted by him."
2. "He prayed only with respect to himself; he was wholly intent upon himself; his own self, and the commendation of himself, were the subject of his prayer."
3. "He thanks God, in order to exalt himself, and places his righteousness in his own works, and treats all other men in a censorious and disdainful manner."
