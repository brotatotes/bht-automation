# Luke 18:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, the commentator notes the Pharisee's devotion to fasting twice a week, an additional practice beyond what the law required. Furthermore, the commentator mentions the Pharisee's commitment to giving tithes not only of what he possessed but also of his income. However, this self-righteous individual's approach was focused on external actions rather than acknowledging his own sinfulness. Ultimately, his plea revolved around the notion of doing no harm and maximizing his good works.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "This was a voluntary fast, on the Mondays and Thursdays; the only prescribed fast in the year being the great day of atonement." 
2. "Here again, the law perhaps only required tithe of the fruit of the field, and the produce of the cattle." 
3. "Not 'I possess,' which would be κέκτημαι but 'I acquire'; of all my increase."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The religion of the Pharisee, therefore, consisted in: 1. Abstaining from injustice to others; in pretending to live a harmless, innocent, and upright life; and, 2. A regular observance of all the external duties of religion." 
2. "His 'fault' consisted in relying on this kind of righteousness; in not feeling and acknowledging that he was a sinner; in not seeking a religion that should dwell in the 'heart' and regulate the feelings."
3. "Most of all was this abominable in the sight of God, who 'looks into the heart,' and who sees wickedness there when the external actions may be blameless."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The law required only one fast in the year, that on the great day of Atonement... The Pharisees fasted every Monday and Thursday during the weeks between the Passover and Pentecost, and again between the Feast of Tabernacles and that of the Dedication of the Temple." 

2. "The Israelite did not pay tithes of his possessions, but only of his gains - his annual increase."

3. "Besides, the verb, in the present tense, does not mean to possess, but to acquire; the meaning possess being confined to the perfect and pluperfect."

### John Calvin:
1. "We must not swell with confidence, as if we had satisfied God; and, next, we must not look down with disdainful contempt upon our brethren."
2. "The only hope of the godly, so long as they labor under the weakness of the flesh, is, after acknowledging what is good in them, to betake themselves to the mercy of God alone, and to rest their salvation on prayer for forgiveness."
3. "No man is pure from extortion, injustice, uncleanness, and other vices, unless he is governed by the Spirit of God."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "His acts, he affirms, surpass the requirements of God’s law."
2. "These were therefore private fasts."
3. "I give tithes of all that I get... I give God more than He claims in the law."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Twice in the week (δις του σαββατου). One fast a year was required by the law (Leviticus 16:29; Numbers 29:7). The Pharisees added others, twice a week between passover and pentecost, and between tabernacles and dedication of the temple."

2. "I get (κτωμα). Present middle indicative, not perfect middle κεκτημα (I possess). He gave a tithe of his income, not of his property."

3. "He gave a tithe of his income, not of his property."

These quotes highlight the additional fasting practices added by the Pharisees, the distinction between possession and income in giving a tithe, and the emphasis on tithing from one's income rather than property.

### John Gill:
1. "The sabbath was not a fasting, but a feasting day with the Jews."
2. "The whole seven days, or week, were by the Jews commonly called the sabbath."
3. "He thought himself a very righteous person, and more than a common man."

### John Wesley:
1. "I fast twice in the week — So did all the strict Pharisees: every Monday and Thursday." 
2. "I give tithes of all that I possess — Many of them gave one full tenth of their income in tithes, and another tenth in alms." 
3. "The sum of this plea is, I do no harm: I use all the means of grace: I do all the good I can."
