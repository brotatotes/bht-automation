# Luke 18:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, there is a stark contrast between the Pharisee and the Publican. While the Pharisee stands in a prideful position, the Publican distances himself and stands humbly. The Publican acknowledges that he is a sinner, not comparing himself to others but rather expressing intense self-abasement. He is filled with shame and expresses deep remorse for his sins, seeking mercy and forgiveness from God. The Publican's humility and genuine repentance demonstrate his understanding of his unworthiness and his reliance on God's grace and mercy.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "A contrast in spirit to the other's thanks that he was not as other men, is furnished by the poor Publican in his humility acknowledging this by an act." 
2. "Another contrast, for we must here suppose that the Pharisee prayed with all significance of gesture, with eyes and hands uplifted." 
3. "The τῷ rather implies, not comparison with others, but intense self-abasement: 'sinner that I am.'"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "standing afar off—as unworthy to draw near; but that was the way to get near"
2. "would not lift up—blushing and ashamed to do so"
3. "smote, c.—kept smiting for anguish and self-reproach"
4. "be merciful—'be propitiated,' a very unusual word in such a sense"
5. "a sinner—literally, 'the sinner'; that is, 'If ever there was one, I am he.'"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The publican stood on the other side of the same court if he was a Jew, or in the court of the Gentiles if he was a pagan, as far as possible from the temple, being conscious of his unworthiness to approach the sacred place where God had his holy habitation."
2. "Men who are conscious of guilt always fix their eyes on the ground."
3. "The publican was willing to do this in any place; in the presence of any persons; amid the multitudes of the temple, or alone. He felt most that 'God' was a witness of his actions, and he was willing, therefore, to confess his sins before him."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Standing [εστως]. In a timid attitude: merely standing, not posturing as the Pharisee."
2. "Lift up his eyes. As worshippers ordinarily."
3. "A sinner [τω αμαρτωλω]. With the definite article, 'the sinner.' 'He thinks about no other man' (Bengel)."

### John Calvin:
1. "Humility lies in not refusing to acknowledge our sins, but condemning ourselves, and thus anticipating the judgment of God."
2. "Such, too, is the cause of that shame which always accompanies repentance; for Christ insists chiefly on this point, that the publican sincerely acknowledged himself to be miserable and lost, and fled to the mercy of God."
3. "He who acknowledges that he is guilty and convicted, and then proceeds to implore pardon, disavows all confidence in works; and Christ’s object was to show that God will not be gracious to any but those who betake themselves with trembling to his mercy alone."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Standing. Simply standing, not putting himself into an attitude or position."
2. "Possibly, too, from the Pharisees thus indicating that he did not deem himself as other men, out morally below them."
3. "He thinks of himself as though he were the great and only sinner. As the Pharisee proudly gave thanks, the publican humbly petitions, and for the one thing he most needs."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "At a distance from the Pharisee, not from the sanctuary."
2. "Refused to lift... kept on smiting or beating."
3. "The main point in the contrast lies in this article. The Pharisee thought of others as sinners. The publican thinks of himself alone as the sinner, not of others at all."

### John Gill:
1. "And it might be, that this poor man might stand at a greater distance than was required, that he might not displease the Pharisee, who, he knew, would resent it, should he stand near him; or rather this was done, to testify the sense he had of his state and condition, and of his unworthiness; as that he was afar off from God, and unworthy to draw nigh unto him, and deserved to be kept at a distance from him for ever."
2. "This showed in the publican, that the guilt of his sins lay heavy on him; that he could not look up; that shame filled him with blushing; that sorrow caused his countenance to fall; and that fear of divine wrath, and displeasure, possessed him; and that he looked upon himself as unworthy of the smiles of heaven."
3. "The first thing a sensible sinner wants, is an application of pardoning grace and mercy; and forgiveness springs from mercy; and because the mercy of God is free and abundant, therefore pardon is so: but this is not to be expected from an absolute God, or God out of Christ. God is only propitious in Christ."

### John Wesley:
1. "The publican standing afar off - From the holy of holies"
2. "Would not so much as lift up his eyes to heaven"
3. "Touched with shame, which is more ingenuous than fear"
