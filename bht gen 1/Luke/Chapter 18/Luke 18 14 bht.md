## BHT:
In this verse, one person returns home with his prayer answered, having grasped the true object of prayer - the forgiveness of sins.

The passage emphasizes the importance of recognizing one's unworthiness, seeking forgiveness, and approaching God with humility in order to receive his justification and favor.
