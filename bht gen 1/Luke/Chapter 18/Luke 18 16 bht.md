1. "SUFFER THE LITTLE CHILDREN TO COME UNTO ME"—"AND FORBID THEM NOT," is the important addition of Matthew (Matthew 19:14) and Mark (Matthew 19:14- :). What words are these from the lips of Christ! The price of them is above rubies.
2. It is surely not to be conceived that all our Lord meant was to inform us, that seeing grown people must become childlike in order to be capable of the Kingdom of God, therefore they should not hinder infants from coming to Him, and therefore He took up and blessed the infants themselves.
3. But such application of the baptismal water can have no warrant here, save where the infants have been previously brought to Christ Himself for His benediction, and only as the sign and seal of that benediction.
