# Luke 18:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, Jesus uses the image of a child as a model for those seeking entrance into the kingdom of God. He emphasizes the importance of humility over pride and vanity. By not saying that the child is already in the kingdom without coming to Him, Jesus teaches his disciples the need to receive the kingdom of God, including the doctrines and ordinances of the Gospel, with the innocence and meekness of a child. Through his understanding of the child and his teachings, Jesus opens the door to a world of humility and spiritual growth.
