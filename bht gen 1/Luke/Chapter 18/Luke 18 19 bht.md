# Luke 18:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the commentators explore Jesus' response to a man who calls him "good." They emphasize the theological significance of Jesus' words and his intention to challenge the man's understanding of goodness. They suggest that Jesus aimed to raise the man's perception of Himself as superior to other "good masters" and to point out that true goodness can only be attributed to God. This response underscores the uniqueness and supremacy of God's goodness, reminding us that no one can possess inherent goodness apart from Him.
