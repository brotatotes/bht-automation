# Luke 18:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This verse depicts a judge who lacks reverence for God and disregards the rights of others. He is characterized as unprincipled, reckless, audacious, and lacking in fear and regard for both God and man. This judge's behavior serves as a warning of the consequences and shame that come with neglecting one's responsibilities and stewardship. The parable of the vineyard highlights the importance of bearing fruit for God's glory and fulfilling our purpose. As believers, we are called to fear God, regard the rights of others, and use the gifts entrusted to us wisely, knowing that we will be held accountable.

2. "The qualifications of one to be a judge, even of the bench of three, were these: wisdom, meekness (or modesty), and fear (i.e. of God), and hatred of mammon (or money), love of truth, and to have the love of men, and to be masters of a good name (or to be of good report)."
3. "But the judge in the text, came greatly short of these qualifications: his character follows, which feared not God, neither regarded man; and therefore, according to the canon, was disqualified from being a judge, since he was destitute of the fear of God; and seeing he regarded not men, he could neither have any love to men, nor any share in the affections of men, and such an one is very unfit to be a judge, for he cannot be thought to have any regard to his conscience, or his credit, and so not to justice and equity."
