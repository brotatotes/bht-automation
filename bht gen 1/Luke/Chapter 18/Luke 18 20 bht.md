### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Thou knowest, c.—Matthew (Matthew 19:17) is more complete here: 'but if thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments.'" 
2. "He saith unto him, Which—as if he had said, Point me out one of them which I have not kept?—'Jesus said, Thou shalt,' &c." 
3. "Our Lord purposely confines Himself to the second table, which He would consider easy to keep, enumerating them all."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Why callest thou me good? Jesus was not denying his own goodness or divinity, but rather challenging the young man's understanding of what it truly means to be good. He wanted the young man to recognize that true goodness comes from God alone, and that he himself was the embodiment of that goodness." 

2. "Do not commit adultery, etc. The different arrangement of the commandments by the synoptists highlights the importance of the commandments as a whole, rather than focusing solely on individual laws. It reminds us that obedience to God's commandments is not a matter of picking and choosing, but of embracing the entirety of God's moral law." 

3. "Compare the different arrangement of the commandments. This comparison invites us to reflect on the underlying principles behind the commandments and how they relate to one another. It encourages us to seek a holistic understanding of God's moral standards and to live our lives in accordance with His will, rather than simply adhering to a checklist of rules."
