# Luke 18:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, a ruler approaches Jesus, displaying a desire for assurance in achieving eternal life and a sincere commitment to following the commandments. However, he lacks a complete understanding of salvation, as he relies on his own efforts and achievements for righteousness. Even though the ruler's question reveals his recognition that something is missing, his sincerity and nearness to the kingdom of God draw Jesus' regard. This glimpse into the ruler's heart highlights the common human tendency to grapple with the true nature of salvation and the need for a Savior.
