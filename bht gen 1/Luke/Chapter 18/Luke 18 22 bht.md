# Luke 18:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, a conversation takes place with a ruler who lacked one fundamental thing. Jesus, looking upon him with love, revealed the deep need in his heart and challenged him to sell all his possessions to free himself from his love of the world. This was a specific trial designed to expose his attachment and direct him towards a life of selfless devotion to God's glory.
