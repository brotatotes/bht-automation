# Luke 18:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This passage describes a rich individual who is faced with the difficult choice of either parting with his material possessions to follow Christ or holding onto his wealth. The person feels deep sorrow, but it is clear that their attachment to their riches is a hindrance in fully committing to Christ. The lack of willingness to give up their wealth is seen as a deficiency in fulfilling the requirements of the law and a barrier to genuine obedience.
