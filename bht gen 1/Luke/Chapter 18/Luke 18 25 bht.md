# Luke 18:25 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, commentators emphasize the metaphorical nature of the expression used, comparing the difficulty of a rich person entering the kingdom of God to a camel passing through the eye of a needle. The expression is not meant to be taken literally but to convey the notion that it is extremely challenging for someone with material wealth to enter the realm of spiritual riches. This highlights the importance of humility and surrendering earthly possessions in order to fully embrace the treasures of God's kingdom.

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "To go through the eye of a needle [δια τρηματος βελονης εισελθειν] . Rev., more literally, to enter in through a needle's eye." 

2. "Both Matthew and Mark use another word for needle [ραφις] ; see on Mark 10:25. Luke alone has belonh, which, besides being an older term, is the peculiar word for the surgical needle." 

3. "The other word is condemned by the Greek grammatrians as barbarous."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Through a needle's eye (δια τρηματος βελονης). Both words are old. Τρημα means a perforation or hole or eye and in the N.T. only here and Matthew 19:24."
2. "Βελονη means originally the point of a spear and then a surgeon's needle. Here only in the N.T. Mark 10:25; Matthew 19:24 have ραφιδος for needle."
3. "This is probably a current proverb for the impossible. The Talmud twice speaks of an elephant passing through the eye of a needle as being impossible."

### John Gill:
1. "These words were spoken to the disciples again, and were a second address to them, after they had shown astonishment at the former." 

2. "The image of a camel passing through the eye of a needle is a vivid and powerful metaphor, illustrating the difficulty and impossibility of a rich person entering the kingdom of God on their own merits." 

3. "This verse highlights the importance of humility and surrendering our earthly possessions in order to fully embrace the spiritual riches of God's kingdom."
