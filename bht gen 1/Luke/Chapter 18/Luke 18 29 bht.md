# Luke 18:29 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, a surrender is acknowledged as complete and acceptable, even encompassing various forms of self-sacrifice. The surrender is not only for personal gain, but also for the sake of the Gospel. It entails leaving behind worldly possessions, relationships, and personal honor, all for the kingdom of God's sake. It is a call to embrace a life of devotion and sacrifice, not only for individual believers but for the greater purpose of advancing the Gospel and building the kingdom of God.
