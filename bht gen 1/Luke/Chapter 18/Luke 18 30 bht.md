# Luke 18:30 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this promise of the Bible, we are assured of a reconstruction of all human relationships and affections on a Christian basis and in a Christian state. Sacrificing our natural worldly desires on the altar of love for Christ enables us to receive manifold blessings in this life and ultimately, life everlasting in the world to come. It's a call to forsake all for Christ and experience comfort, peace, satisfaction, and pleasure that surpass any earthly possessions or relationships.

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Shall not receive" - The use of a strong double negative emphasizes the certainty that those who give up something for the sake of the kingdom of God will not receive it back in return.
2. "Manifold more" - This phrase highlights the abundance and multiplication of blessings that will be received by those who sacrifice for the kingdom of God.
3. "Late Greek word" - The mention of the word being a late Greek term indicates its rarity in the New Testament, making its usage in this verse significant and worthy of attention.

### John Gill:
1. "Not more houses, parents, brethren, c. but that which is abundantly preferable to them such comfort, peace, satisfaction, and pleasure, as are not to be found in such enjoyments."
