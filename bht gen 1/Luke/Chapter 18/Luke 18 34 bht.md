# Luke 18:34 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The disciples, in their lack of understanding, were blind to the true meaning of Jesus' words. Despite the plainness of his teachings, they failed to grasp the deeper significance. They struggled to reconcile Jesus' prophecies of suffering and death with their own expectations of a triumphant Messiah and an earthly kingdom. This lack of comprehension stemmed from both their own prejudices and their ignorance of the Old Testament prophecies. Only the resurrection seemed to hold any remote clarity for them.
