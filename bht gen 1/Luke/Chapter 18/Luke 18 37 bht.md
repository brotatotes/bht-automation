## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Passeth by" - The use of the present middle indicative form of "passeth by" suggests a continuous action, indicating that Jesus was in the process of passing by. This highlights the dynamic nature of the moment and emphasizes the urgency of the situation.

2. "No reason for differences of English tenses" - The commentary points out that the differences in English tenses (was passing by, passeth by) do not carry any significant meaning in the original Greek text. This reminds us to focus on the essence of the passage rather than getting caught up in linguistic nuances.

3. "Retained in indirect discourse" - The mention of indirect discourse highlights the fact that the passage is reporting someone's words or thoughts indirectly. This provides context for understanding the narrative style and helps us interpret the verse within its broader literary framework.

### John Gill:
1. "Jesus, the prophet of Nazareth, so much talked of, and said to be the Messiah, who was become so famous for his doctrines and miracles." 

2. "For healing diseases, and dispossessing devils, was just 'then' passing by." 

3. "This occasioned the noise and clamour."
