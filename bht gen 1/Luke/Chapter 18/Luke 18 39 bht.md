# Luke 18:39 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, there is a mention of a group that came before Jesus, possibly a large crowd. Each Gospel writer has their own unique way of describing events, emphasizing the significance of Jesus' actions and teachings. Importunity and rebuking are commended, leading to a greater level of persistence and determination. The woman cried out clamorously, demonstrating her strong desire for healing, and was brought to Jesus, an act described by a medical term. Jesus instructs someone to become silent, indicating the importance of holding one's peace, but the need for persistence remains.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The phrase 'οἱ προάγ' can be understood as 'the ones who went before' or 'those who preceded.' This implies that there was a group of people who came before Jesus, possibly referring to the crowd that had gathered earlier." 

2. "The mention of 'ὁ ὄχλος' in Matthew and 'πολλοί' in Mark suggests that there was a large crowd present. This emphasizes the significance of Jesus' actions and teachings, as they attracted a multitude of people." 

3. "The use of different terms in the different Gospel accounts highlights the diversity of the witnesses and their perspectives. It reminds us that each Gospel writer had their own unique way of recounting the events, adding depth and richness to our understanding of Jesus' ministry."

1. "That he should hold his peace (ινα σιγηση). Ingressive aorist subjunctive. That he should become silent."
