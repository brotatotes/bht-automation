# Luke 18:40 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, a blind man persists in his pursuit of an audience with Jesus, despite being discouraged by others. Eventually, he is told that Jesus has called for him, similar to a determined suitor finally receiving an invitation. Overjoyed, the blind man immediately goes to Jesus, eagerly casting away his garment. Jesus stands still, commanding the blind man to be brought to him, and as he draws near, Jesus asks him a significant question.

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "And they call the blind man, saying unto him, Be of good comfort, rise, He calleth thee"—just as one earnestly desiring an interview with some exalted person, but told by one official after another that it is vain to wait, as he will not succeed (they know it), yet persists in waiting for some answer to his suit, and at length the door opens, and a servant appears, saying, "You will be admitted—he has called you."

2. "And he, casting away his garment"—how lively is this touch, evidently of an eye-witness, expressive of his earnestness and joy—"came to Jesus."

3. Are there no other suitors to Jesus who sometimes fare thus?
