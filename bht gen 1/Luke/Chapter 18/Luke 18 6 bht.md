### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The unjust judge represents a stark contrast to the character of God. While the judge in the parable is indifferent and uncaring, God is just and compassionate. This highlights the persistence and faith of the widow, who continues to seek justice despite the judge's lack of concern."

2. "The widow's persistence in seeking justice is a powerful example for believers. It reminds us to persevere in our prayers and not lose heart, even when it seems like our requests are going unanswered. Just as the widow eventually receives justice, so too can we trust that God will hear and answer our prayers in His perfect timing."

3. "This parable also serves as a reminder that God's justice is not always immediate or apparent to us. Just as the widow had to wait for the judge to grant her request, we may have to wait for God's timing and His perfect plan to unfold. In the meantime, we are called to trust in His goodness and continue to seek Him in prayer."

### John Gill:
1. "Take encouragement from hence to be frequent and importunate in prayer with God."
