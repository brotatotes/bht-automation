### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Yet ere the Son of man comes to redress the wrongs of His Church, so low will the hope of relief sink, through the length of the delay, that one will be fain to ask, Will He find any faith of a coming avenger left on the earth?"
2. "That in these circumstances importunate, persevering prayer for deliverance is the Church's fitting exercise."

2. "This is the reason why the flesh imagines that the government of fortune is blind."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The avenging belongs to the coming of the Son of man, which is still future after eighteen centuries. However long delayed in man’s estimation, the day of the Lord will ‘quickly’ come, as God regards it." 
2. "The second coming of Christ is evidently meant." 
3. "The question then implies that the trials of the faith and patience of the church during the Lord’s delay will be so great as to make it doubtful whether such importunity for the Lord’s return will be the rule in the day of His appearing."

1. "The use of αρα before ευρησε seems to indicate a question expecting a negative answer as in Acts 8:30; Romans 14:19."
2. "But here αρα comes in the middle of the sentence instead of near the beginning, an unusual position for either inferential αρα or interrogative αρα."
3. "On the whole, the interrogative αρα is probably correct, meaning to question if the Son will find a persistence of faith like that of the widow."

1. "God's elect among the Jews were singled out, and gathered in from them, and were delivered from their persecutors, and saved from temporal ruin and destruction, whilst the Roman army made sad havoc of their enemies." 

2. "There will then be little of the doctrine of faith, and less of the grace of faith, and still less of the exercise of faith, particularly in prayer, and especially about the coming of Christ; it will be little thought of, and expected, or faith little exercised about it."
