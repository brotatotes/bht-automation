### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The small sum astonishes us. Compare, on the other hand, the talents (Matthew 25:0). But in Matthew, the Lord transfers to his servant his whole property; here he has only devoted a definite sum of money to the purpose of putting his servants to the proof therewith; and the smallness of the amount corresponds to what is so carefully emphasized in our parable, viz., the relation of faithfulness in the least to its great recompense (ver. 17); which relation is less regarded in the parable in Matthew" (" Commentary on Luke ").

2. "The word occupy has lost the sense which it conveyed to the makers of the A. V. - that of using or laying out what is possessed. An occupier formerly meant a trader."

3. "It is strange that the Rev. follows this reading without comment, while the Reviser's text takes no notice whatever of the reading of four of the leading manuscripts, which is adopted by both Tischendorf and Westcott and Hort; ejn w= ercomai, 'while I come,' a condensed form of expression for while I go and return."

### John Calvin:
1. "Christ does not lay on all an equal charge of trafficking, but commits to one a small, and to another a larger sum of money."
2. "Till the last day of the resurrection Christ, in some respects, goes to a distance from his people, but yet that it would be highly improper for them to sit down in idleness and do no good."
3. "Let us know that the Lord does not bestow on all indiscriminately the same measure of gifts, but distributes them variously as he thinks proper, so that some excel others."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The number is given here, but not in the other parable; comp. the ten virgins, Matthew 25:1."
2. "To each one; not to each 'according to his several ability' (Matthew 25:5)."
