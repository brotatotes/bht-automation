# Luke 19:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we encounter a man named Zacchaeus, whose name, meaning 'pure,' hints at a deeper meaning to his transformation. As the chief tax collector and administrator in his region, Zacchaeus held considerable authority and wealth, potentially acquired through questionable means. Despite the general characterizations and social bias against tax collectors, Zacchaeus' encounter with Jesus challenged societal norms and showed that even rich individuals can find redemption and entrance into the kingdom of God. The mention of his position and wealth emphasizes the transformative power of grace and the inclusivity of God's kingdom.
