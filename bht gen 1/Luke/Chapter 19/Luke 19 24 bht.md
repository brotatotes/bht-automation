# Luke 19:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, gifts that can be taken away are referred to as a "pound," symbolizing that they are not the unchangeable grace bestowed upon believers. Instead, these gifts can be transferred from one person to another, particularly to those who diligently use and develop their abilities. As a result of their hard work, these individuals experience growth in knowledge, radiate a brighter light, and become more valuable and effective compared to unproductive ministers.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### John Gill:
1. "Take from him the pound; which shows, that it was not special grace, for that is a good part that shall never be taken away, but gifts which may be taken away from men, or they from them."
2. "And give it to him that hath ten pounds; not that, strictly speaking, the gifts of some men are taken from them and bestowed on others; but the design of the expression is to show, that to diligent and laborious ministers, there is an increase of gifts."
3. "Their knowledge enlarges, and their light shines more and more to the perfect day, and they become more useful; and they appear brighter, and more illustrious, through the sloth of others, or when compared with indolent, negligent, and useless ministers."
