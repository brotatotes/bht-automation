## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The name, when thus put, must be accentuated ἐλαιών." 
2. "Luke uses this same expression elsewhere." 
3. "Josephus has διὰ τοῦ ἐλαιῶνος ὄρους."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Bethphage, meaning 'house of figs,' provides a symbolic backdrop for the events that unfold in this passage. Just as figs are known for their sweetness and abundance, Jesus' entry into Jerusalem is a sign of the abundant grace and blessings he brings to the world."

2. "The mention of Bethany, a village near Bethphage, adds depth to the narrative. Jesus had close relationships with Mary, Martha, and Lazarus in Bethany, and his presence in this area signifies the personal and intimate nature of his ministry."

3. "Mount Olivet, situated between Bethphage and Jerusalem, serves as a geographical marker that highlights the significance of Jesus' journey. As Jesus ascends the mount, he is symbolically moving closer to the fulfillment of his mission and the ultimate sacrifice he will make for humanity."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Bethphage, meaning 'house of unripe figs,' was a small village located on the eastern slope of the Mount of Olives. Its proximity to Jerusalem made it an ideal place for Jesus to send his disciples to find a donkey for his triumphal entry into the city."

2. "The choice of a donkey as a mode of transportation was significant. It fulfilled the prophecy of Zechariah 9:9, which foretold that the Messiah would come to Jerusalem 'gentle and riding on a donkey.' This humble and peaceful image of the Messiah contrasted with the expectation of a conquering king riding on a warhorse."

3. "The fact that Jesus sent his disciples to fetch the donkey indicates his authority and sovereignty. He knew that the donkey would be there, ready for his use, and he confidently instructed his disciples to bring it to him. This demonstrates Jesus' divine knowledge and control over all things, even the smallest details."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "On the afternoon of Friday, the 8th of Nisan." 
2. "He could reach the neighborhood of Bethany before sundown." 
3. "And when he had thus spoken, etc."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Unto Bethphage and Bethany (εις Βηθφαγη κα Βηθανια). Both indeclinable forms of the Hebrew or Aramaic names." 

2. "Of Olives (Ελαιων). As in Mark 11:1; Matthew 21:1, though some editors take it to be, not the genitive plural of ελαια (olive tree), but the name of the place Olivet." 

3. "In the Greek it is just a matter of accent (circumflex or acute) Olivet is correct in Acts 1:12."

### John Gill:

2. "By sending two disciples ahead, Jesus demonstrates his intentionality and preparation for the events that are about to unfold." 
3. "The proximity of Bethphage and Bethany to Jerusalem highlights the significance of Jesus' arrival and sets the stage for the triumphal entry into the city."

### John Wesley:
1. "The location of this event is significant, as it takes place at the foot of the mount of Olives. This mountain holds great significance in Jewish history and is associated with the coming of the Messiah. By choosing this specific location, Jesus is symbolically declaring himself as the long-awaited Messiah." 

2. "The mention of Bethphage and Bethany also adds depth to the narrative. These were both towns known for their close proximity to Jerusalem and their connection to Jesus. This highlights the anticipation and excitement surrounding Jesus' arrival in Jerusalem, as people from these towns would have been familiar with his teachings and miracles."

3. "The convergence of these two towns at the mount of Olives serves as a powerful visual representation of the unity and convergence of Jesus' ministry. It symbolizes the gathering of believers from different places and backgrounds, coming together to witness and participate in the fulfillment of God's plan."
