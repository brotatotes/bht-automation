## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "The phrase 'whereon, &c.' refers to the foundation of the house. The wise man builds his house on a solid foundation, which represents a life built on the principles and teachings of God's word."

2. "The 'rock' mentioned in this verse symbolizes the unchanging and firm nature of God. By building our lives on the rock of God's truth, we can withstand the storms and challenges of life."

3. "The 'sand' represents a life built on worldly values and temporary pleasures. Such a foundation is unstable and vulnerable to destruction when faced with trials and difficulties."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "And it came to pass." - This phrase indicates that there were events that took place before the events mentioned in the verse, specifically the events in Bethany on Saturday evening. It highlights the chronological sequence of events leading up to the verse.

2. "High to Bethphage and Bethany." - The mention of Bethphage and Bethany, the villages closest to Jerusalem, emphasizes the geographical context of the verse. It helps the reader understand the proximity of these locations to Jerusalem and sets the stage for what is about to happen.

3. "The village nearest Jerusalem is mentioned first." - This observation highlights the order in which the villages are mentioned, with Bethphage being mentioned before Bethany. This detail aligns with the account in the Gospel of Mark and provides additional insight into the specific locations being referred to in the verse.

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Whereon no man ever yet sat" - This phrase signifies the uniqueness and significance of the donkey that Jesus chose to ride into Jerusalem. It symbolizes Jesus' royal status and the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies.
2. "A royal progress into the city" - The disciples understood Jesus' entry into Jerusalem as a regal procession, highlighting his kingship and authority. It was a deliberate and intentional act that conveyed a powerful message to the people.
3. "A piece with the Virgin Birth of Jesus and the burial in a new tomb" - Just as the Virgin Birth and the burial in a new tomb were extraordinary events, Jesus' choice of an unridden donkey for his entry into Jerusalem was another extraordinary sign of his divine mission and purpose. It further emphasized his unique role as the Messiah.

### John Gill:
1. "What village this was, is not said by any of the evangelists; it seems to be either Bethany, or Nob; and rather the latter, since the village of Bethany was fifteen furlongs, or near two miles from Jerusalem."
2. "In Matthew 21:2 it is said, an ass, and a colt with her; which agrees with the prophecy in Zechariah 9:9 and which, no doubt, was matter of fact."
3. "For it seems that Christ stayed at the above place, until the disciples went and fetched it."
