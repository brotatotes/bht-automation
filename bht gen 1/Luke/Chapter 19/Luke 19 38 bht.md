## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:

1. "Peace in heaven, and glory in the highest." - Luke, by a poetic parallelism, paraphrases the ‘Hosanna’ mentioned by the other Evangelists. 

2. "If these should hold their peace, the stones, etc." - A proverbial expression, to show that this outburst could not and ought not to be restrained, and thus a most pointed rebuke of the objectors.
