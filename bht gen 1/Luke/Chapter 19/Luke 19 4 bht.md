# Luke 19:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible passage, we encounter a scene where Zacchaeus, filled with eagerness and enthusiasm, runs ahead of Jesus and climbs up a sycamore tree to catch a glimpse of Him passing by. This act demonstrates Zacchaeus' desire to overcome any barriers, including his own social status, in order to have a personal encounter with Jesus. It is a powerful example of how our deep longing for Jesus can override any sense of honor or shame.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The Egyptian fig, a tree like the mulberry in appearance, size, and foliage, but belonging generically to the fig-trees."
2. "It grows to a great size and height."
3. "Notice the changes of subject here, ἀνέβη (Ζακχ.)...ὅτι ἐκείνης ἤμελλεν (ὁ Ἰησ.) διέρ....κ. σπεύσας (Ζακχ.)."

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "The sycamore tree mentioned here is not the same as the sycamore tree we are familiar with today. It is actually the Egyptian fig tree, which has leaves that resemble those of the mulberry tree."

2. "The choice of the sycamore tree is significant because it represents the humble and lowly nature of Zacchaeus. Just as the sycamore tree grows in the desert and can withstand harsh conditions, Zacchaeus, as a tax collector, was despised and rejected by society."

3. "Climbing the sycamore tree was an act of desperation and determination for Zacchaeus. It shows his eagerness to see Jesus and his willingness to go to great lengths to overcome any obstacles that stood in his way."

4. "The sycamore tree also serves as a symbol of transformation in this story. Just as Zacchaeus climbed the tree to see Jesus, he later comes down from the tree a changed man. His encounter with Jesus leads to repentance and a commitment to make amends for his wrongdoings."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The mention of the sycamore tree in this verse is significant because it symbolizes the transformation and redemption that can occur in a person's life. Just as the sycamore tree was transformed from a lowly and despised tree into a place of encounter with Jesus, so too can our lives be transformed when we encounter Him."

2. "The sycamore tree also serves as a reminder that sometimes we need to go to great lengths, even climbing a tree, to get a glimpse of Jesus. It challenges us to step out of our comfort zones and make an effort to seek Him, knowing that the reward of encountering Him is worth the effort."

3. "In the story of Zacchaeus, the sycamore tree represents a physical barrier that Zacchaeus had to overcome in order to see Jesus. It reminds us that there may be obstacles in our lives that hinder our ability to see and experience Jesus fully. We must be willing to identify and overcome these barriers, whether they are physical, emotional, or spiritual, in order to have a deeper encounter with Him."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The fig-mulberry, resembling the fig in its fruit, and the mulberry in its leaves."
2. "Dr. Thomson says that it bears several crops yearly, which grow on short stems along the trunk and the large branches."
3. "It is a favorite and pleasant conceit with old commentators that Zacchaeus' sycamore that day bore precious fruit."

2. "A sycamore tree. The Egyptian fig tree, resembling in many respects the mulberry tree."
