# Luke 19:44 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this passage, commentators describe a vivid prophecy of the destruction of Jerusalem. The city, personified as a mother, will be brought to its knees, with its buildings beaten level and its children dashed to the ground. The destruction of Jerusalem is seen as a consequence of the rejection of Jesus as the Messiah. Despite the mercy and opportunity for salvation provided by His visitation, the people of Jerusalem failed to recognize and accept Him. The prophecy foretells the devastation that would befall the city, resulting in the temple's complete destruction and the city's eventual ruin.

1. "Mine eye affecteth mine heart" - This quote highlights the connection between the eyes and the heart, showing how emotions can be stirred by what is seen. It suggests that Jesus, in His humanity, experienced deep emotions that were visible through His tears.
2. "Under this sympathetic law of the relation of mind and body" - This quote suggests that there is a natural connection between the mind and the body, where emotions can manifest physically. It implies that Jesus, being fully human, was subject to this connection and experienced the full range of human emotions.
3. "He yielded Himself alike freely to both" - This quote emphasizes Jesus' willingness to fully experience both profound joy and deep sorrow. It suggests that He did not hold back or suppress His emotions, but allowed Himself to be fully present in each moment, whether it be in moments of joy or moments of sorrow.

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Shall dash to the ground (εδαφιουσιν). Attic future of εδαφιζω, to beat level, to raze to the ground, a rare verb from εδαφος, bottom, base, ground (Acts 22:7), here alone in the N.T."
