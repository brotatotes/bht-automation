# Luke 19:45 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the temple, Jesus, who is the Lord and proprietor, cast out the sellers and buyers, overthrew their tables, and exposed their corruption and exploitation. His actions were fueled by righteous indignation and a desire to restore the true purpose of the temple as a place of prayer and worship. This act served as a prophetic sign of judgment and restoration, challenging the religious leaders and reminding us to uphold holiness and reject all forms of corruption in our lives and in the church.
