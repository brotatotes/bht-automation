# Luke 19:8 Commentary Help Text

Zacchaeus, a tax collector who had embraced a sinful lifestyle, encounters Jesus and experiences a transformation of heart. Standing before Jesus in both reverence and repentance, Zacchaeus publicly confesses his past wrongdoings and makes a vow to make amends.

This response not only reveals a change of heart but also serves as an inspiration and a powerful example of what true repentance looks like.

3. "He gratefully addressed this to the 'Lord,' to whom he owed the wonderful change."
