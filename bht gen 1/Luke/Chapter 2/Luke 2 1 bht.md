# Luke 2:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
During the time of unprecedented peace in the world, a divine intervention occurred, orchestrated by an infinite and all-wise providence. The birth of the Messiah, the King of kings, took place amidst the earthly rule of the Roman emperor, Caesar Augustus. This enrollment, extending beyond Judea to the entire Roman empire, symbolized the universal impact of the Messiah's birth and his mission to redeem all people from the bondage of sin and death. It was not simply a historical event, but a momentous occasion shaped by both human and divine purposes.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Cæsar Augustus—the first of the Roman emperors." 
2. "All the world—so the vast Roman Empire was termed." 
3. "Taxed—enrolled, or register themselves."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Caesar Augustus - This was the Roman emperor. His first name was Octavianus. He was the nephew of Julius Caesar, and obtained the empire after his death. He took the name 'Augustus - i. e., august,' or honorable - as a compliment to his own greatness; and from him the month 'August,' which was before called 'Sextilis,' received its name."

2. "That the passage refers only to the land of Palestine, and not to the whole world, or to all the Roman empire, is clear from the following considerations: See Matthew 4:8, where Satan is said to have shown to Christ all the kingdoms of 'the world,' that is, of the land of Judea. See also Joshua 2:3; Luke 4:25 (Greek); Luke 21:26; Acts 11:28."

3. "Should be taxed - Our word 'tax' means to levy and raise money for the use of the government. This is not the meaning of the original word here. It means rather to 'enroll,' or take a 'list' of the citizens, with their employments, the amount of their property, etc., equivalent to what was meant by census."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Decree: Hence, strictly, a personal opinion; and, as the opinion of one who can impose his opinion authoritatively on others, a decree."
2. "The phrase [the inhabited (land)] was originally used by the Greeks to denote the land inhabited by themselves, in contrast with barbarian countries; afterward, when the Greeks became subject to the Romans, the entire Roman world; still later, for the whole inhabited world."
3. "Be taxed: The word means properly to register or enter in a list. Commentators are divided as to whether it refers to an enrollment for taxation, or for ascertaining the population."

### John Calvin:
1. "But as they have no other design than to obey the edict of Augustus, we readily acknowledge, that they were led like blind persons, by the hand of God, to the place where Christ must be born."
2. "God had marked out by his prophet — as we shall afterwards see — the place where he determined that his Son should be born."
3. "Nor is it of small consequence to the certainty of faith to know, that Mary was drawn suddenly, and contrary to her own intention, to Bethlehem, that 'out of it might come forth' the Redeemer, as he had been formerly promised."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "All the world, i.e., the Roman world. We should not, to avoid difficulty, limit it to Palestine."
2. "The word here used, it is claimed by some, has always a reference to tax-lists, as distinguished from a mere census with a view to recruiting the army."
3. "If we accept the enrolment as resembling a modern census, all difficulty vanishes, for Augustus ordered such an enrolment at least three times during his reign, and in statistics prepared by him, as we certainly know, there was a record of the population of countries ruled by dependent kings, such as Herod."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "No such decree was given by Greek or Roman historians and it was for long assumed by many scholars that Luke was in error."
2. "But papyri and inscriptions have confirmed Luke on every point in these crucial verses Luke 2:1-7."
3. "It means to write or copy off for the public records, to register."

### John Gill:
1. "The decree from Caesar Augustus was not just a historical event, but a divine intervention orchestrated by an infinite and all-wise providence."
