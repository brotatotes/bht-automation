# Luke 2:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
During the time of Caesar Augustus, a remarkable interposition of divine providence took place. The Roman Empire, known as "all the world," announced a census, which was a recorded enrollment for taxation purposes. This decree, not just a historical event, perfectly aligned with the prophecy of the Messiah's birth in Bethlehem. It serves to emphasize the stark contrast between the earthly ruler and the true King of kings, whose purpose is to redeem humanity from the bondage of sin, Satan, the law, and death.
