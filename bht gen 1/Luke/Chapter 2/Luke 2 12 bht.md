# Luke 2:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the angel describes a sign to the shepherds, guiding them to find a child who would be wrapped in swaddling clothes and lying in a manger. This sign serves as a tangible proof of God's fulfillment of His promises and signifies something greater. The choice of a humble and lowly birth for the Savior emphasizes his humanity and vulnerability, inviting us to identify with the weak and marginalized. By seeking and finding Christ in this unexpected and ordinary manner, we are called to embrace and believe in him, regardless of external appearances.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The spot was somehow known to them by the angel's description."
2. "The angel in giving the sign, generalizes the term they were to know the truth of his words."
3. "They were to find a child wrapped in swaddling clothes, lying in a manger."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The sign was to consist, it seems, solely in the overpowering contrast between the things just said of Him and the lowly condition in which they would find Him."
2. "Him whose goings forth have been from of old, from everlasting, 'ye shall find a Babe'; whom the heaven of heavens cannot contain, 'wrapt in swaddling bands'."
3. "Thus early were these amazing contrasts, which are His chosen style, held forth."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "This shall be a sign" - The sign is not just a mere indication of the child's presence, but a symbol of something greater. It is a divine marker, a tangible proof of God's fulfillment of His promises.

2. "You will find him wrapped in swaddling clothes" - The humble wrapping of the child in swaddling clothes emphasizes his humanity and vulnerability. It reminds us that God chose to enter the world in the most ordinary and lowly manner, identifying with the weak and marginalized.

3. "Lying in a manger" - The choice of a manger as the child's resting place is significant. It is a feeding trough for animals, a place associated with sustenance and nourishment. This highlights the paradoxical nature of Jesus' birth, as the Bread of Life being laid in a place meant for animals, foreshadowing his sacrificial role in providing spiritual nourishment for humanity.

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Sign [σημειον] . See on Matthew 11:20." 
2. "The babe [βρεφος] . See on 1 Peter 2:2. Rev., properly, 'a babe.' No article."

### John Calvin:
1. "That the mean and despicable condition in which Christ was might not deter the shepherds from believing in Christ, the angel tells them beforehand what they would see."
2. "Sending down to us from heaven the word of the Gospel, he enjoins us to embrace Christ crucified, and holds out to us signs in earthly and fading elements, which raise us to the glory of a blessed immortality."
3. "If the stable gave no offense whatever to the shepherds, so as to prevent them from going to Christ to obtain salvation, or from yielding to his authority, while he was yet a child; no sign, however mean in itself, ought to hide his glory from our view, or prevent us from offering to him lowly adoration."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The sign. No sign had been asked for... The dispensation of faith is beginning."
2. "A babe. Not 'the babe.' They were to look for a child born that day, wrapped and lying in a manger. There could be but one such."
3. "A manger, not 'the manger.' This implies that the place was not one well known to the shepherds."

### John Gill:
1. "This sign would distinguish the new born Saviour from all others."
2. "Had not the angel given them this direction, they would never have thought to have looked for, and found: him in such a place."
3. "By this means this objection was prevented, and this stumbling block was removed out of the way, and they were prepared to see him, embrace, and believe in him, in this mean condition."
