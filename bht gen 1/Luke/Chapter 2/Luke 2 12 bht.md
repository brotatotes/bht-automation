# Luke 2:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we find an extraordinary contrast between the greatness of the child described and the humble circumstances of His birth. Wrapped in swaddling clothes and lying in a manger, the child signifies the vulnerability and humanity of Jesus, while also foreshadowing His ministry of compassion and love. This unexpected sign points to His identification with the poor and marginalized. Through this unassuming beginning, a new era of faith emerges, distinguishing the Savior from all others, and inviting all who encounter Him to embrace and believe in Him.

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "The sign was to consist, it seems, solely in the overpowering contrast between the things just said of Him and the lowly condition in which they would find Him."
2. "Him whose goings forth have been from of old, from everlasting, 'ye shall find a Babe'; whom the heaven of heavens cannot contain, 'wrapt in swaddling bands'."
3. "Thus early were these amazing contrasts, which are His chosen style, held forth."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The sign of the child wrapped in swaddling clothes and lying in a manger is a humble and unexpected sign, pointing to the lowly circumstances of Jesus' birth."
2. "The use of swaddling clothes, typically used to tightly wrap infants for warmth and security, emphasizes the vulnerability and humanity of Jesus, who would later become the Savior of the world."
3. "The image of Jesus lying in a manger, a feeding trough for animals, highlights his identification with the poor and marginalized, foreshadowing his ministry of compassion and love for all."

### Philip Schaff:
