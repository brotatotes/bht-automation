# Luke 2:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
A heavenly army, consisting of angels who are the ministers of God, suddenly appeared. They dwelled in heaven and surrounded God's throne as His host. Their presence transferred the glorious praise of God from heaven to earth, symbolizing the divine significance of the event. This celestial choir rejoiced like the morning stars when the foundation of man's salvation was laid through the incarnation of the Son of God, a moment that paralleled the creation of the world itself.
