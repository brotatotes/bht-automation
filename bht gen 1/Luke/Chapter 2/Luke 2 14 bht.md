# Luke 2:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The birth of the Saviour is hailed by the angels, as they join in resounding praises to God in the highest heavens. This momentous event brings not only glory to God, but also peace and all kinds of happiness to dwell on earth. The overflowing of divine good will and favor is now extended to humanity, as sinful men become the objects of God's pleasure and are chosen to partake in fellowship with Him.
