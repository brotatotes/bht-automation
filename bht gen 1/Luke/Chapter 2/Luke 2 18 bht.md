# Luke 2:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the story is told of a miraculous birth that initially caused wonder and disbelief among those who heard it. The impact on the central figure, Mary, was lasting and profound. It is mentioned that the story was likely forgotten by most, only remembered by a few devoted souls until Jesus emerged as a teacher years later. The birth, happening in humble circumstances and disclosed first to shepherds instead of the influential, left people hesitant, astonished, and unsure how to respond.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Philip Schaff:
1. "With this natural, and probably transient, wonder of those who heard the story, the narrative contrasts the more abiding effect upon Mary."
2. "Before Jesus appeared as a teacher, thirty years afterwards, the story was probably forgotten by all but a few earnest souls."
3. "If His words and works did not prevent the mass of the Jews from rejecting Him, how little influence would this story have."

### John Gill:
1. "They did not imagine that he would be born of such mean parents, and appear in such mean circumstances, and in so contemptible a place."
2. "Shepherds, and not the princes of Israel, should have the first notice of it."
3. "They knew not what to say to it, neither to deny, nor believe it; hesitated about it, and yet astonished at the particulars of it."
