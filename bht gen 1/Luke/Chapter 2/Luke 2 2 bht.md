In this verse, we encounter the first enrollment or census of the Jewish nation, a significant historical event taking place during the governorship of Cyrenius in Syria. This enrollment, distinct from a later one, provides a contextual backdrop to the events described in the Bible. Luke's mention of P.

Additionally, it underscores the relationship between Syria and Judea, revealing the interconnectedness of different regions in biblical times.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The 'taxing' under Cyrenius was what led to the insurrection mentioned in Acts 5:37. That there was a taxing, however, of the whole Roman Empire under Augustus, is now admitted by all and candid critics."
2. "Even skeptics are ready to allow that there is not likely to be any real inaccuracy in the statement of our Evangelist."
3. "Many superior scholars would render the words thus, 'This registration was previous to Cyrenius being governor of Syria'—as the word 'first' is rendered in John 1:15; John 15:18."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The difficulty consists in the fact that 'Cyrenius,' or 'Quirinius,' was not governor of Syria until 12 or 15 years after the birth of Jesus."
2. "According to his view, the passage here means, 'This was the 'first' census of Cyrenius, governor of Syria.'"
3. "Thus, it is not improper to say that General Washington saved Braddock’s army, or was engaged in the old French war, though he was not actually made 'general' until many years afterward."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "This taxing was first made" - This phrase refers to the initial enrollment or registration that took place. It signifies that there was a subsequent enrollment that occurred later on, as mentioned in Acts 5:37. 

2. "With reference to a second enrollment" - The commentary highlights that there was a second enrollment that happened approximately eleven years later. This provides context and suggests that the first enrollment was distinct from the second one.

3. "And is referred to in Acts 5:37" - The mention of Acts 5:37 indicates that there is a connection between the first and second enrollments. This reference encourages readers to explore the biblical text further for a deeper understanding of the historical context.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The man referred to undoubtedly is P. Sulpicius Quirinius (not Quirinus); the office was that of president or governor of a Roman province."
2. "We hold that Quirinius was twice governor of Syria, the first time about the date usually assigned to the birth of Christ."
3. "A mistake on the part of so careful an investigator is out of the question. If Quirinius had not been governor of Syria at that time, there were many persons living who could and would have pointed out the mistake."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Luke alludes to a series of censuses instituted by Augustus, providing historical context for the first enrolment mentioned in the verse." 
2. "Ramsay's research shows that there was a periodical fourteen-year census in Egypt dating back to A.D. 20, supporting the idea that the first enrolment mentioned by Luke could have taken place around B.C. 8." 
3. "The mention of Quirinius as the governor of Syria has been criticized, but Ramsay's evidence from inscriptions confirms that Quirinius served in Syria twice, validating Luke's accuracy."

### John Gill:
1. "This was the first enrolment, or taxing, in the Jewish nation."
2. "It is given [the title of governor of Syria] to distinguish him from others of that name."
