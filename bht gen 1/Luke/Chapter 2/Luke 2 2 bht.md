# Luke 2:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we are given historical context through the mention of Cyrenius as governor of Syria, which sets the political stage for the events described. The mention of the "taxing" or registration under Cyrenius and the appointment of Publius Sulpicius Quirinius as governor of Syria signify a shift in power and authority. This highlights the significance of the events that followed and showcases the involvement of Roman authorities in the affairs of Judea, underscoring the interconnectedness between political and biblical events.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "The 'taxing' under Cyrenius appears not to have been governor of Syria for about ten years after the birth of Christ, and the 'taxing' under his administration was what led to the insurrection mentioned in Acts 5:37." 
2. "That there was a taxing of the whole Roman Empire under Augustus is now admitted by all and candid critics." 
3. "Many superior scholars would render the words thus, 'This registration was previous to Cyrenius being governor of Syria'—as the word 'first' is rendered in John 1:15; John 15:18."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The man referred to undoubtedly is P. Sulpicius Quirinius (not Quirinus); the office was that of president or governor of a Roman province."
2. "We hold that Quirinius was twice governor of Syria, the first time about the date usually assigned to the birth of Christ."
3. "The statement of Tertullian is at once outweighed by the thrice repeated assertion of Justin Martyr that our Lord was born under Quirinius, and his appeal to the register then made for confirmation."

### John Wesley:
1. "The mention of Cyrenius as governor of Syria provides historical context and helps us understand the political setting in which the events of the Bible took place."
2. "The appointment of Publius Sulpicius Quirinus as governor of Syria was significant because it marked a shift in power and authority in the region."
3. "By including this detail about the governorship of Syria, the Bible emphasizes the importance of the events that followed and highlights the involvement of Roman authorities in the affairs of Judea."
