## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Theirs was a song too, probably some canticle from the Psalter—meet vehicle for the swelling emotions of their simple hearts at what 'they had heard and seen.'" 
2. "In the act of circumcising Him, which was a symbolical and bloody removal of the body of sin, we have a tacit intimation that they 'had need'—as John said of His Baptism—rather to be circumcised by Him 'with the circumcision made without hands, in the putting off of the body [of the sins] of the flesh by the circumcision of Christ.'"
3. "Still the circumcision of Christ had a profound bearing on His own work—by few rightly apprehended. For since 'he that is circumcised is a debtor to do the whole law,' Jesus thus bore about with Him in His very flesh the seal of a voluntary obligation to do the whole law—by Him only possible in the flesh since the fall."
