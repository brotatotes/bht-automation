# Luke 2:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we see the fulfillment of the law as Mary and Joseph bring Jesus to the temple to present Him to the Lord. Mary's purification after giving birth is observed, as required by the law. Jesus, as the firstborn, is recognized as "holy to the Lord," set apart for His divine purpose. This act not only fulfills the law but also foreshadows Jesus' role as the ultimate sacrifice and the redemption of humanity. Through this act of obedience, the significance of purification and the grace of God washing away our pollutions are highlighted.
