# Luke 2:29 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Simeon, an aged saint, eagerly awaits his Master's command to depart, expressing a patient and reverential desire to be released from honorable service. With poetic beauty, he rejoices in being a servant of the Most High God, viewing death as a departure from this world. In his anticipation, Simeon longs for the fulfillment of the Messiah's coming, holding steadfast in his deep belief despite the anxieties of waiting. This Nunc Dimittis is filled with adoration, praise, and the profound intensity of rapture, akin to the Psalms.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Lord—'Master,' a word rarely used in the New Testament, and selected here with peculiar propriety, when the aged saint, feeling that his last object in wishing to live had now been attained, only awaited his Master's word of command to 'depart.'" 

2. "now lettest, c.—more clearly, 'now Thou art releasing Thy servant' a patient yet reverential mode of expressing a desire to depart." 

3. "a patient yet reverential mode of expressing a desire to depart."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Simeon uses the word for bond servant, it is evident that his death is conceived by him under the figure of enfranchisement from service."
2. "Godet's 'release of a sentinel from duty' is fanciful."
3. "In peace. Rev. properly puts this in its emphatic position at the end of the sentence."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The words of Simeon are poetic in their form, and even in a translation retain their peculiar beauty."
2. "The word 'servant' corresponds with Lord, i.e., 'master,' not Jehovah. Death is regarded as the dismissal from honorable service."

### John Gill:

2. "He expresses his death, by a departure out of the world, as in John 13:1 Philippians 1:21 agreeably to the way of speaking of it among the Jews."
3. "He also intimates, that whereas, though he had the strongest assurances of the Messiah's coming, and of his coming before his death, by the revelation of the Holy Ghost, and so most firmly believed it, without fluctuation, and hesitation of mind; yet as hope deferred makes the heart sick, he was anxious and restless in his desire, till it was accomplished."
