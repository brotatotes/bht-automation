## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The stone of stumbling and rock of offense" (Isaiah 8:14; Rom 9:33) refers to Jesus, who becomes a stumbling block for those who do not believe in Him.
2. The phrase "rising up in the sense of ch. Luk 1:52 by faith and holiness" suggests that those who humble themselves and have faith will be exalted.
3. The interpretation that the "stone of stumbling" and the "rising up" refer to the same people aligns with the next verse and the idea that humility leads to exaltation.

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "The two stages of temporary 'fall of many in Israel' through unbelief, during our Lord's earthly career, and the subsequent 'rising again' of the same persons after the effusion of the Spirit at Pentecost threw a new light to them on the whole subject."
2. "The determined enemies of the Lord Jesus."
3. "Such opposite views of Christ are taken from age to age."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The fall and rising again... For the fall, because he will be a stumbling block to many... For the rising, because many will be raised up through him to life and glory." 
2. "The expression does not voice a prophecy, but describes an inherent characteristic of the sign: a sign of which it is the character to experience contradiction from the world." 
3. "In the beginning, as a babe, Jesus experienced this at the hands of Herod; so all through his earthly ministry and on the cross; and so it will be to the end, until he shall have put all enemies under his feet."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "This indicates that Simeon knew (by revelation we infer) something of her peculiar relation to the child."
2. "The reference is to lying in an appointed place, probably with an allusion to the 'stone of stumbling.'"
3. "This refers to the future, but the present is used of what is characteristic. This prophecy was fulfilled during His earthly life; the culmination was the cross, which as the sign of salvation has not yet lost its offence."

### John Gill:
1. "Simeon blessed them,.... Pronounced them blessed persons, on account of their relation to Christ as man; and more especially, because of their interest in him, as the, Saviour and Redeemer of them; and wished them all happiness and prosperity inward and outward, temporal, spiritual, and eternal."
2. "behold, this child is set for the fall and rising again of many in Israel... The sense is, that this child, who is the stone of Israel, is set, or put, or lies, both as a stone of stumbling, and rock of offence, for many of the Jews to stumble at, and fail and perish and as a precious corner and foundation stone, for the erection and elevation of others of them, to the highest honour and dignity, that shall believe on him."
3. "Christ is now provided and appointed, for the raising them up out of their low estate, and he does do it; he is the resurrection and the life unto them; he raises from the death of sin, to a life of grace and holiness from him, to a life of faith on him, and communion with him here, and to eternal life hereafter."

### John Wesley:

2. "A sign which shall be spoken against" - Jesus, despite being a sign from God, will be rejected and opposed by many.
