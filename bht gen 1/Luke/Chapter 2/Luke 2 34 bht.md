## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The stone of stumbling and rock of offense, at which they should fall through unbelief." 
2. "Rising up in the sense of faith and holiness." 
3. "He that humbleth himself shall be exalted."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The two stages of temporary 'fall of many in Israel' through unbelief, during our Lord's earthly career, and the subsequent 'rising again' of the same persons after the effusion of the Spirit at Pentecost threw a new light to them on the whole subject."
2. "The determined enemies of the Lord Jesus."
3. "Such opposite views of Christ are taken from age to age."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The fall - The word 'fall' here denotes 'misery, suffering, disappointment,' or 'ruin.' There is a plain reference to the passage where it is said that he should be 'a stone of stumbling and a rock of offence.'"
2. "Many that were proud were brought low by his preaching. They fell from the vain and giddy height of their own self-righteousness, and were humbled before God, and then, through him, rose again to a better righteousness and to better hopes."
3. "And for a sign ... - The word 'sign' here denotes a conspicuous or distinguished object, and the Lord Jesus was such an object of contempt and rejection by all the people. He was despised, and his religion has been the common 'mark' or 'sign' for all the wicked, the profligate, and the profane, to curse, and ridicule, and oppose."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The fall and rising again...For the fall, because he will be a stumbling block to many...For the rising, because many will be raised up through him to life and glory." 
2. "The expression does not voice a prophecy, but describes an inherent characteristic of the sign: a sign of which it is the character to experience contradiction from the world." 
3. "In the beginning, as a babe, Jesus experienced this at the hands of Herod; so all through his earthly ministry and on the cross; and so it will be to the end, until he shall have put all enemies under his feet."

### John Calvin:
1. "Without all contradiction," says Paul, "the less is blessed of the greater." Besides, it has the appearance of absurdity, that any mortal man should offer prayers in behalf of the Son of God.
2. It was the design, at the same time, of the Spirit of God, to lay down a general instruction for all the godly. When they see the world opposing Christ with wicked obstinacy, they must be prepared to meet that opposition, and to contend against it undismayed.
3. The world would not display such harmony in opposing the Gospel, if there were not a natural enmity between the Son of God and those men. The ambition or fury of the enemies of the Gospel carries them in various directions, faction splits them into various sects, and a wide variety of superstitions distinguishes idolaters from each other.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Unto Mary his mother. This indicates that Simeon knew (by revelation we infer) something of her peculiar relation to the child."
2. "This further revelation may have been needed to prevent undue elation on the part of Mary."
3. "This refers to the future, but the present is used of what is characteristic. This prophecy was fulfilled during His earthly life; the culmination was the cross, which as the sign of salvation has not yet lost its offence."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "He will be a stumbling-block to some who love darkness rather than light."
2. "Jesus is the magnet of the ages. He draws some, he repels others."
3. "Nietzsche regarded Jesus Christ as the curse of the race because he spared the weak."

### John Gill:
1. "Simeon blessed them,.... Pronounced them blessed persons, on account of their relation to Christ as man; and more especially, because of their interest in him, as the Saviour and Redeemer of them; and wished them all happiness and prosperity inward and outward, temporal, spiritual, and eternal."
2. "behold, this child is set for the fall and rising again of many in Israel. The sense is, that this child, who is the stone of Israel, is set, or put, or lies, both as a stone of stumbling, and rock of offence, for many of the Jews to stumble at, and fail and perish and as a precious corner and foundation stone, for the erection and elevation of others of them, to the highest honour and dignity, that shall believe on him."
3. "Christ is now provided and appointed, for the raising them up out of their low estate, and he does do it; he is the resurrection and the life unto them; he raises from the death of sin, to a life of grace and holiness from him, to a life of faith on him, and communion with him here, and to eternal life hereafter."

### John Wesley:
1. "This child is set for the fall and rising again of many." - The verse highlights the dual nature of Jesus' impact on people. He will be a source of salvation for believers but also a stumbling block for unbelievers. 

2. "A sign which shall be spoken against." - Jesus, despite being a sign from God, will face rejection and opposition from people. This emphasizes the paradoxical nature of his mission and the resistance he will encounter. 

3. "That the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed." - The contradiction and rejection Jesus faces will serve as a revealing force, exposing the true thoughts and intentions of people's hearts. This suggests that Jesus' presence will provoke a response that exposes the inner disposition of individuals.
