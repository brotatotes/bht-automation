# Luke 2:35 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
"The prophecy foretells the struggles faced by many in Israel, including Mary herself, as they move from repentance to faith in Jesus. She, as His mother, would also experience the sharp pangs of sorrow for sin. The purpose of these struggles and sufferings is to reveal the thoughts and decisions of people's hearts, distinguishing those who receive Jesus from those who reject Him. The sword that pierces Mary's soul symbolizes the deep affliction and grief she would experience, particularly at the crucifixion of her Son, Jesus."
