She is said to be of the tribe of Asher, dwelling in the northern region of Canaan. Anna is recognized for her deep devotion, as evidenced by her great age and the significance of her name, which means "the face of God." Her life spans many significant periods, including her years as a married woman and as a widow, reaching an impressive ninety-one years old.
