# Luke 2:38 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, a woman named Anna is depicted standing by, ready to express her gratitude and praise. She speaks to those who were eagerly anticipating the redemption of Jerusalem. The words used to describe her actions imply that she had a receptive audience among the pious individuals waiting in the temple. Together with Simeon, Anna's words form a mutual agreement of praising God and acknowledging the fulfillment of long-awaited expectations for the Messiah. The accounts of Matthew and Luke inadvertently complement each other, contributing to a more complete understanding of this significant event.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The prep. as pointing to the retributive nature of the offering of praise."
2. "It was possibly at the hour of prayer."
3. "She spoke of Him to numbers, who would at such a time be flocking to the temple."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "She had been there already but now is found 'standing by,' as Simeon's testimony to the blessed Babe died away, ready to take it up 'in turn'." 
2. "In that Babe are wrapt up all your expectations."
3. "If this was at the hour of prayer, when numbers flocked to the temple, it would account for her having such an audience as the words imply."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The verb originally means to make a mutual agreement; and the idea of reciprocity is retained in the expression 'to return thanks' for something received."
2. "Not a public utterance, for which the words, those that waited, etc., would be inappropriate. It was to the pious ones who were with her in the temple, waiting for the Messiah."
3. "Render, as Rev., the redemption of Jerusalem. Nearly equivalent to the consolation of Israel, verse 25. Compare chapter Luke 1:68, and see Isaiah 40:2."

### John Calvin:
1. "The holy melody, which proceeded from the lips of Simeon and Anna, is praised by Luke, in order that believers may exhort each other to sing with one mouth the praises of God, and may give mutual replies."
2. "He again points out the small number of the godly. For the substance of faith lay in this expectation; and it is evident, that there were few who actually cherished it in their minds."
3. "When he says, that Anna spake of him to all who looked for redemption in Jerusalem."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "She gave praise to the Father for sending the Messiah."
2. "Evidently of the child."
3. "This probably took place on the spot."
4. "The correct reading favors this translation, which refers to the same Messianic expectation indicated by the E. V., but points to Jerusalem as the place where redemption would begin."
5. "Thus the accounts of Matthew and Luke undesignedly supplement each other."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The word often has the notion of coming suddenly or bursting in as of Martha in Luke 10:40. But here it probably means coming up and standing by and so hearing Simeon's wonderful words so that her words form a kind of footnote to his."
2. "Anna was evidently deeply moved and repeated her thanksgiving and kept speaking 'to all them that were looking for the redemption of Jerusalem.'"
3. "There was thus a nucleus of old saints in Jerusalem prepared for the coming of the Messiah when he at last appears as the Messiah in Jerusalem."

(Note: The provided commentary is quite lengthy, so I have selected three quotes that I believe provide valuable insights into the verse.)

### John Gill:
1. "She praised him, as he had done, that he had sent the promised, and long looked for Messiah and Saviour."
2. "She had lived to see his blessed face, and this happy day."
3. "She spake of him to all them that looked for redemption in Jerusalem."

Note: The commentary is not very clear and concise, so the quotes provided are the most relevant and informative parts.

### John Wesley:
1. "The sceptre flow appeared to he departing from Judah, though it was not actually gone: Daniel's weeks were plainly near their period."
2. "The revival of the spirit of prophecy, together with the memorable occurrences relating to the birth of John the Baptist, and of Jesus, could not but encourage and quicken the expectation of pious persons at this time."
3. "Let the example of these aged saints animate those, whose hoary heads, like theirs, are a crown of glory, being found in the way of righteousness."
