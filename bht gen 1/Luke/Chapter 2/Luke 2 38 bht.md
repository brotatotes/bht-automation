# Luke 2:38 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
At a moment of retributive offering of praise, possibly at the hour of prayer, an elderly woman spoke of the Messiah to a multitude of temple-goers. She thanked the Lord for sending the long-awaited Savior, and expressed gratitude for being directed to witness the blessed face of the newborn Child. The redeemed would see in Jerusalem the beginning of the redemption they were anticipating, and the revival of prophecy fueled the expectation of pious individuals. The example of these aged saints should inspire those who walk the path of righteousness to use their words to praise the Redeemer.
