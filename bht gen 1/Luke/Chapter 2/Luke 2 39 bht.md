# Luke 2:39 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, there is a connection between the humble origins of Jesus and the significance of being called a Nazarene. The independent accounts of Luke and Matthew, while not providing a clear chronological order, highlight the importance of the events in the larger narrative of Jesus' birth and early life. The journey from Jerusalem to Nazareth, being directly and immediately made by Joseph and Mary, emphasizes the fulfillment of prophecies and the humble nature of Jesus' earthly origins in the lesser-known town of Nazareth.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "This part of the gospel history is one where the Harmonists, by their arbitrary reconcilements of the two Evangelistic accounts, have given great advantage to the enemies of the faith."
2. "It is wholly impossible to suggest any satisfactory method of uniting them; every one who has attempted it has, in some part or other of his hypothesis, violated probability and common sense."
3. "The only inference from these two accounts, which is inevitable, is that they are wholly independent of one another."

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Nothing is more difficult than to fix the precise order in which the visit of the Magi, with the flight into and return from Egypt, are to be taken, in relation to the circumcision and presentation of Christ in the temple, here recorded."
2. "It is perhaps best to leave this in the obscurity in which we find it, as the result of two independent, though if we knew all, easily reconcilable narratives."
3. "The focus should not be on the exact chronological order, but rather on the significance of these events in the larger narrative of Christ's birth and early life."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Luke has omitted the flight into Egypt recorded by Matthew; but he has not denied it, nor are his words to be pressed as if he meant to affirm that they went immediately to Nazareth."
2. "A parallel case we have in the life of Paul. When he was converted it is said that he came to Jerusalem, as if he had gone there immediately after his conversion Acts 9:26; yet we learn in another place that this was after an interval of three years, Galatians 1:17-18."
3. "In the case before us there is no improbability in supposing that they returned to Bethlehem, then went to Egypt, and then to Galilee."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The significance of Jesus being called a Nazarene lies in the fact that Nazareth was a small, insignificant town in Galilee. This highlights the humble and lowly nature of Jesus' earthly origins."

2. "By being associated with Nazareth, Jesus identifies with the marginalized and despised in society. He came not to be served, but to serve, and his identification with the lowly reflects his mission to bring salvation to all."

3. "The term 'Nazarene' also carries a prophetic fulfillment, as it echoes the prophecies of the Old Testament that foretold the Messiah would be despised and rejected. Jesus' identification with Nazareth further emphasizes his fulfillment of these prophecies."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "They returned into Galilee, to their own city Nazareth." - This verse implies that Joseph and Mary went directly from Jerusalem to Nazareth, but the text does not explicitly state it. 

2. "It is difficult to suppose that Luke had seen Matthew's account, or vice versa." - The commentator suggests that Luke and Matthew likely did not have access to each other's accounts, indicating the independent nature of their writings.

3. "Of itself, this suggests that Joseph and Mary went directly and immediately from Jerusalem to Nazareth." - The verse alone implies a direct journey from Jerusalem to Nazareth for Joseph and Mary.

### John Gill:
1. "Relating to the purification of Mary, and the presentation and redemption of her firstborn, and the sacrifices and ceremonies belonging thereunto."
2. "They returned into Galilee: not that they came from thence to Jerusalem, but from Bethlehem, where Mary gave birth, and her time for purification was now just expired."
3. "Bethlehem was their native city, the place of their birth, at least of their family; and Nazareth was the city of their habitation."
