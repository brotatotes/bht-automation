# Luke 2:40 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The child, whose mental development matched his bodily, grew and waxed strong in spirit. His understanding, judgment, memory, and desires were all aligned with what is good. Filled with wisdom and knowledge, the grace of God rested upon him, signifying a unique favor that marked his increasing consciousness of God as his Father. As his body grew in strength and stature, so did his powers of mind, reflecting the genuine human development and increasing awareness of his own divine-human consciousness.
