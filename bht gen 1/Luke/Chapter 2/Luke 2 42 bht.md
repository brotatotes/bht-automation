# Luke 2:42 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
At the age of twelve, the boy Jesus was called "son of the law" and became responsible for observing religious ordinances. This marked a transition into adulthood and a recognition of his accountability within the Jewish community. It is likely that this was not Jesus' first trip to Jerusalem, as the passage implies a familiarity with the customs and practices of the feast. This incident serves as an example for parents to nurture and train their children in the ways of the Lord.
