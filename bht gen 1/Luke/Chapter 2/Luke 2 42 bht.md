# Luke 2:42 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
At the age of twelve, a Jewish boy would become a "son of the law," taking on personal responsibility for observing religious ordinances and obeying the law's requirements. It was customary for them to attend the Passover, and it is likely that this was not the first time Jesus had accompanied His parents for this occasion. The journey to Jerusalem held deep religious significance, as they followed established customs and rituals while reflecting on the beauty and joy of Mount Zion as the place of God's rest.
