# Luke 2:43 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, Mary and Joseph, alongside more devout individuals, fulfill the days of the feast while Jesus tarries behind in Jerusalem. Jesus displays an irresistible longing to remain in the sacred city and the house of God, desiring to hear discourses on Scripture and engage with religious leaders. This act cannot be taken as an example for children to act independently without consulting their parents. Here, we witness Jesus progressing through various stages of life, sanctifying them all except for old age, mirroring his role as the fruit of the womb, an infant, a little child, and a man.
