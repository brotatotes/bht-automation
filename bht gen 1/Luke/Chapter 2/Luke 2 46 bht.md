## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Some interpret the three days as their one day's journey out, one back, and one in Jerusalem, but they were more likely three days spent in search in Jerusalem."
2. "In one of the rooms attached to the temple, where the Rabbis taught their schools."
3. "No stress must be laid on 'ἐν μέσῳ'; it is only among. Nor must it be supposed from 'ἐπερωτ.' that our Lord was acting the part of a master."

3. "Asking them questions - Proposing questions to them respecting the law and the prophets. There is no reason to suppose that this was for the purpose of perplexing or confounding them.
