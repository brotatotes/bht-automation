# Luke 2:47 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
A child astonishes all who hear him with questions framed with correctness and propriety, acting more as a scholar than a teacher.

His understanding and judgment amaze both the learned doctors and their disciples, causing astonishment at the wisdom displayed by someone so young.
