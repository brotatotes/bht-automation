# Luke 2:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, a man and his newly married wife have returned home together, having consummated their marriage. Another passage in Matthew is referenced, suggesting that reading it alongside this verse will provide more insight. The wife may have been thinking of a prophecy associated with Bethlehem, and although she is from the lineage of David, it is unclear whether she herself is of the royal house. The verse also highlights their obedience to authority in participating in the tax enrollment.
