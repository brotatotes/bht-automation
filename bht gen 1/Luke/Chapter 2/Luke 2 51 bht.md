# Luke 2:51 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Bible verse depicts a scene where Jesus willingly submits to his earthly parents and works alongside his reputed father. This act of obedience is seen as a form of self-humiliation and dutiful respect. Jesus' mother, Mary, diligently retains and cherishes the memories of his remarkable actions, including his profound wisdom and astonishment of those around him. The verse conveys a sense of humility, obedience, and the profound impact Jesus has on those who witness his extraordinary presence.
