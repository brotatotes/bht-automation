# Luke 2:51 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, we see Jesus at a young age continuing to humbly subject Himself to His earthly parents, despite His divine nature. By working with His father and learning a trade, Jesus set an example for children and honored virtue in labor. His complete obedience and subjection in this role signify the self-humiliation He willingly embraced for our salvation. This depiction of Jesus waiting at Nazareth and His mother cherishing the remarkable events in her heart emphasizes the profound destiny that lay ahead for Him.

3. "The more cheerfully, on this account, ought every one to bear the yoke which the Lord has been pleased to lay upon him."
