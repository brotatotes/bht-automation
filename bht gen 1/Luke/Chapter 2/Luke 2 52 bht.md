# Luke 2:52 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we see the remarkable journey and development of Jesus from infancy to adulthood. His obedience, love, and grace were evident throughout His life as He grew in both physical stature and spiritual wisdom, without ever succumbing to sin. He experienced the fullness of humanity, emptying Himself of His glory, and lived a life perfectly aligned with the will of God. Jesus's increase in wisdom and favor with God serves as a model for all who seek to imitate His example, growing in holiness and finding favor not only with God but also with others.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The growing up through infancy, childhood, youth, manhood, from grace to grace, holiness to holiness, in subjection, self-denial, and love, without one polluting touch of sin, this it was which, consummated by the three years of active ministry, by the Passion, and by the Cross, constituted 'the obedience of one man,' by which many were made righteous."
2. "He had emptied Himself of His glory: His infancy and childhood were no mere pretence, but the Divine personality was in Him carried through these states of weakness and inexperience, and gathered round itself the ordinary accessions and experiences of the sons of men."
3. "All the time, the consciousness of his mission on earth was ripening; 'the things heard of the Father' were continually imparted to Him; the Spirit, which was not given by measure to Him, was abiding more and more upon Him; till the day when He was fully ripe for his official manifestation."

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "What seasons of tranquil meditation over the lively oracles, and holy fellowship with His Father."
2. "What inlettings, on the one hand, of light, and love, and power from on high."
3. "Outgoings of filial supplication, freedom, love, and joy on the other."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "In favour with God - That is, in proportion to his advance in wisdom." 
2. "This does not imply that he ever lacked the favor of God, but that God regarded him with favor in proportion as he showed an understanding and spirit like his own." 
3. "Happy are those children who imitate the example of Jesus - who are obedient to parents who increase in wisdom - who are sober, temperate, and industrious, and who thus increase in favor with God and people."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The word 'stature' in this verse refers to the age or maturity of a person. It signifies that John the Baptist was not just a young man, but someone who had reached a certain level of spiritual and moral development." 

2. "Luke's decision to retain the word 'stature' is significant because it emphasizes the importance of John's character and the depth of his calling. It highlights that John was not just any ordinary person, but someone who had grown and matured in his faith." 

3. "The parallel passages in Matthew and Mark also provide additional context to understand the significance of John the Baptist's ministry. They show that John was not just a preacher, but a prophet who came to prepare the way for the coming of Jesus Christ."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The favor with God found expression at His baptism, and that expression implies sinless perfection."
2. "The innocence of childhood, free in this case from all childish faults, developed into complete holiness of life, in the way of positive obedience."
3. "During this time of youthful obedience and subjection, was performed a large part of that work which the second Adam must do as fulfilling the law for others."

1. "He kept growing in stature and in wisdom." 
2. "His physical, intellectual, moral, spiritual development was perfect." 
3. "This is ideal manhood to have the favour of God and men."

### John Gill:
1. "As he grew in body, the faculties of his soul opened, and received gradually large measures of wisdom and knowledge, in things natural and spiritual."
2. "He increased in the wisdom and knowledge of his human soul, so he likewise increased in the stature of his body."
3. "He appeared by the grace that was in him, and the gifts bestowed on him, to be high in the love and favour of God; and had a large share in the esteem and affections of all good men."

### John Wesley:
1. "Jesus increased in wisdom - As to his human nature." 
2. "In proportion to that increase." 
3. "Though a man were pure, even as Christ was pure, still he would have room to increase in holiness."
