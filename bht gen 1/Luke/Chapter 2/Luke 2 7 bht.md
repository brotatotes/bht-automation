# Luke 2:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we see the fulfillment of the prophecy that the Messiah would be born in Bethlehem. Jesus, both fully human and fully divine, was laid in a manger or possibly a stall, highlighting the meanness of his birth and his identification with the lowly. Just as there was no room for Jesus in the inn, so too is there often no room for Christ in the hearts and lives of many today.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The combination of this consideration with the fact that brethren of our Lord are brought forward in this Gospel in close connexion with His mother, makes it as certain as any implied fact can be, that those brethren were the children of Mary herself."
2. "Ancient tradition states the birthplace of our Lord to have been a cave."
3. "Caves are used in most rocky countries as stables."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The law, in speaking of the first-born, regardeth not whether any were born after or no, but only that none were born before."
2. "The ancient tradition, that our Lord was born in a grotto or cave, is quite consistent with this, the country being rocky."
3. "But some 'guests went and came' not 'rudely,' but reverently. God sent visitors of His own to pay court to the new-born King."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Whether Mary had any other children or not has been a matter of controversy. The obvious meaning of the Bible is that she had; and if this be the case, the word 'firstborn' is here to be taken in its common signification."
2. "There was nothing special in the manner in which the infant Jesus was treated."
3. "It may be remarked that the fact that Joseph and Mary were in that place, and under a necessity of taking up their lodgings there, was in itself no proof of poverty; it was a simple matter of necessity there was 'no room' at the inn."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Wrapped in swaddling clothes [εσπαργανωσεν]. Only here and verse Luke 2:12. Naturally found often in medical writings. Swaddle is swathel, from the verb to swathe."
2. "In a manger [εν φατνη]. Used by Luke only, here and Luke 13:15. Quite possibly a rock cave. Dr. Thomson says: 'I have seen many such, consisting of one or more rooms, in front of and including a cavern where the cattle were kept' (Land and Book)."
3. "In the inn [εν τω καταλυματι]. Only here, chapter Luke 23:11; Mark 14:14, on which see note. The word refers to the ordinary khan, or caravanserai. Tynd., hostrey. 'A Syrian khan is a fort and a mart; a refuge from thieves; a shelter from the heat and dust; a place where a man and his beast may lodge; where a trader may sell his wares, and a pilgrim may slake his thirst...'"

### John Calvin:
1. "We see here not only the great poverty of Joseph, but the cruel tyranny which admitted of no excuse, but compelled Joseph to bring his wife along with him, at an inconvenient season, when she was near the time of her delivery."
2. "Joseph was not so devoid of feeling as to have no concern about his wife’s delivery. He would gladly have avoided this necessity: but, as that is impossible, he is forced to yield, and commends himself to God."
3. "Such was his condition at his birth, because he had taken upon him our flesh for this purpose, that he might, 'empty himself' on our account. When he was thrown into a stable, and placed in a manger, and a lodging refused him among men, it was that heaven might be opened to us, not as a temporary lodging, but as our eternal country and inheritance, and that angels might receive us into their abode."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Her first born son. This implies that Mary had other children... It is unlikely that an only child would be thus termed by one who wrote long afterwards with a full knowledge of the family." 
2. "Our Lord was born in a stable... His self-abasement is thus illustrated, the nature of His kingdom suggested, the lesson of humility enforced." 
3. "Not an inn, with a host, as in chap. Luke 10:34-35, but a place where travellers lodged, providing their own food. There is no hint of want of hospitality."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "There is not a particle of evidence for the notion that Mary refused to bear other children because she was the mother of the Messiah."
2. "Wrapped in swaddling clothes...Frequent in medical works."
3. "In a manger...connected with the inn we do not know. The cattle may have been out on the hills or the donkeys used in travelling may have been feeding in this stall or another near."

### John Gill:
1. "They have a tradition, that an Arabian should say to a Jew 'Lo! the king Messiah is born; he said to him, what is his name? Menachem: he asked him, what is his father's name? he replied to him, Hezekiah; he said unto him, from whence is he? he answered, from the palace of the king of Bethlehem.'" This tradition highlights the fulfillment of the prophecy that the Messiah would be born in Bethlehem.

2. "Christ, as to his human nature, was Mary's firstborn; and as to his divine nature, God's firstborn." This statement emphasizes the dual nature of Jesus as both fully human and fully divine.

3. "This shows the meanness of our Lord's birth, and into what a low estate he came; and that now, as afterwards, though Lord of all, yet had not where to lay his head in a proper place." The humble circumstances of Jesus' birth highlight his willingness to identify with the lowly and his sacrificial love for humanity.

### John Wesley:
1. "She laid him in the manger — Perhaps it might rather be translated in the stall. They were lodged in the ox stall, fitted up on occasion of the great concourse, for poor guests." 

2. "There was no room for them in the inn — Now also, there is seldom room for Christ in an inn." 

3. "Now also, there is seldom room for Christ in an inn."
