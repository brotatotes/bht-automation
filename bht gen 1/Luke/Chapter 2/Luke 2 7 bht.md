# Luke 2:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the birth of Jesus, the law only regards whether any were born before, not after. The ancient tradition that our Lord was born in a grotto or cave aligns with the rocky nature of the country. Guests came reverently to pay court to the new-born King, while the fact that changed the world was accomplished in a stable. Jesus, the King of kings, was laid in a manger and an ox stall, emphasizing his humble birth and meekness. This profound event highlights the rejection faced by Jesus, underlining the need to make room for Him in our lives.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "The law, in speaking of the first-born, regardeth not whether any were born after or no, but only that none were born before."
2. "The ancient tradition, that our Lord was born in a grotto or cave, is quite consistent with this, the country being rocky."
3. "But some 'guests went and came' not 'rudely,' but reverently. God sent visitors of His own to pay court to the new-born King."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Her first born son. This implies that Mary had other children... It is unlikely that an only child would be thus termed by one who wrote long afterwards with a full knowledge of the family." 
2. "Our Lord was born in a stable. This was purposed by God... His self-abasement is thus illustrated, the nature of His kingdom suggested, the lesson of humility enforced." 
3. "The fact that changed the world was accomplished in a stable; but the world’s emperor must send forth a universal decree that this humble birth might be in accordance with prophecy; for He who lay in the manger there was King of kings."

### John Gill:
1. "They have a tradition, that an Arabian should say to a Jew 'Lo! the king Messiah is born; he said to him, what is his name? Menachem: he asked him, what is his father's name? he replied to him, Hezekiah; he said unto him, from whence is he? he answered, from the palace of the king of Bethlehem.'"
2. "Jesus is called Mary's firstborn, because she had none before him; though she might not have any after him; for the first that opened the matrix, was called the firstborn, though none followed after, and was holy to the Lord, Exodus 13:2."
3. "This shows the meanness of our Lord's birth, and into what a low estate he came; and that now, as afterwards, though Lord of all, yet had not where to lay his head in a proper place; and expresses his amazing grace, in that he was rich, yet for our sakes became poor."

### John Wesley:
