# Luke 2:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
On a significant date in April, our Lord was born after the spring rains, when the pastures were lush with grass. The shepherds, spending the night in the fields, kept watch over their flocks, having chosen to remain out under the open sky. In the darkness of night, amidst the humble and diligent shepherds, Christ was revealed, demonstrating God's wisdom that surpasses human understanding. These shepherds, chosen by God, became the first witnesses of the Savior's birth, symbolizing how God often chooses the weak and lowly to bring forth His divine purposes.
