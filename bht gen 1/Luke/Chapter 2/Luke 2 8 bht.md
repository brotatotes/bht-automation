# Luke 2:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the stillness of the night, shepherds watched over their flocks under the open sky, blissfully unaware of the divine plans unfolding. These diligent keepers, who nurtured and protected their sheep day and night, were chosen to witness the arrival of the long-awaited Savior. In this humble scene, the Shepherd of Israel revealed His care for His flock, satisfying their yearning and igniting a pivotal moment in history. Little did they know, this event held profound significance for both the Jewish and Gentile world, as Christ's birth marked the dawn of redemption.

1. "From about passover time in April until autumn, the flocks pastured constantly in the open fields, the shepherds lodging there all that time."
2. "Were these shepherds chosen to have the first sight of the blessed Babe without any respect of their own state of mind? That, at least, is not God's way."
3. "Thus was Nathanael engaged, all alone but not unseen, under the fig tree, in unconscious preparation for his first interview with Jesus."
