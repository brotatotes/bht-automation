# Luke 20:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
On a momentous day in Jerusalem, Jesus faced a barrage of opposition from both the religious leaders and the people. It was not a sudden event, as this had been building up over the course of the previous days. With the temple teaching approaching its end, Jesus fearlessly continued to proclaim the truth, despite the hostile intentions of the Sadducees, Pharisees, and other members of the Sanhedrin. Surrounded by his adversaries, Jesus confronted their attacks head-on, unyielding in his faithfulness to his mission, undeterred by their fervent opposition.
