# Luke 20:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, Jesus tells a parable about the vineyard owner who will come and destroy the wicked husbandmen. This destruction signifies complete annihilation and is a severe judgment for those who reject God's authority. The religious leaders, upon hearing this, vehemently deny their involvement, not wanting to be implicated in such a crime. However, Jesus affirms that they will indeed carry out the prophesied rejection and killing of the heir. This parable serves as a warning of the consequences faced by those who oppose God's will.
