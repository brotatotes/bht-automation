### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The clearing of the temple was a powerful act of Jesus, demonstrating his authority and zeal for the purity of worship. It was a bold statement against the corruption and exploitation that had infiltrated the sacred space. This action revealed Jesus' deep concern for the true worship of God and his commitment to restoring the sanctity of the temple." 

2. "By driving out the money changers and those selling animals for sacrifice, Jesus was challenging the prevailing system of religious exploitation and manipulation. He was calling for a return to genuine worship, where the focus is on God and not on material gain. This act of cleansing the temple was a prophetic sign of the coming judgment and the need for repentance." 

3. "The clearing of the temple also serves as a reminder for us today to examine our own hearts and motives in our worship. Are we truly seeking to honor and glorify God, or are we more concerned with personal gain and comfort? Jesus' actions in the temple challenge us to pursue a genuine and sincere worship that is centered on God and his righteousness."
