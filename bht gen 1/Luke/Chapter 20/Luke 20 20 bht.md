# Luke 20:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this passage, we see a group of spies being sent to observe Jesus, posing as righteous and just individuals with the intention of finding fault in his words. These spies were carefully chosen to deceive Jesus and trap him with their cunning. They intended to use his words against him and deliver him to the Roman governor to face severe consequences. Jesus was aware of their ploy, but they watched him closely, waiting for the right opportunity to strike.
