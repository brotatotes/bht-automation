# Luke 20:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we see a perceptive individual who is acutely aware of the deceitful and cunning tactics employed by others. This person possesses an understanding of the true intentions and thoughts hidden within the hearts of those around them. It becomes evident that there is a ulterior motive behind the actions and questions posed to them, intending to trap or discredit them. The individual being tempted acknowledges the trap and subtly questions the intentions of the ones tempting them.
