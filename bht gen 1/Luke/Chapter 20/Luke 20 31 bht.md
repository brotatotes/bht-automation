# Luke 20:31 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this passage, we see the tragic cycle of marriage and death. The focus is on the absence of children, highlighting the futility of their actions and the inability to continue their lineage. The repetition of the phrase "took her" underscores the repetitive nature of their failed attempts at procreation. Ultimately, their deaths without leaving any children behind serve as a poignant reminder of the tragic outcome of their pursuit of marriage.

3. "And after."
