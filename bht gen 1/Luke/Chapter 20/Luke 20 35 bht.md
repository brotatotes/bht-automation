# Luke 20:35 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, it is clear that the worthiness to obtain the eternal kingdom is not achieved through personal works, but rather through the sacrificial work and righteousness of the Messiah.

This speaks to the idea that believers can experience the blessings and joys of the eternal kingdom, even before the physical resurrection takes place. Additionally, it mentions that in this kingdom, there will be no need for marriage, as explained in the upcoming reasons.
