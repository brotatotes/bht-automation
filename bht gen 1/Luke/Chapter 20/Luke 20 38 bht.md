# Luke 20:38 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This verse reveals that God's relationship with humanity extends beyond the confines of death. As John Wesley explains, God cannot be a God of the dead, for He is the God of the living. Those who belong to Him continue to live in His presence and enjoy His blessings. This truth applies to both the living and the departed saints, as all who have faith in Him share in the promise of eternal existence and happiness. Through this verse, we are reminded of God's everlasting nature and the hope we have in Him beyond the boundaries of life and death.

1. "For he is not a God of the dead, but of the living" - This verse reminds us that God is not limited by death. He is the God of the living, and even though our physical bodies may die, our souls continue to live with Him.

2. "He reckons of them, as if they were now alive" - God sees beyond the limitations of time and space. He considers the departed saints as if they were still alive, for He has the power to bring the dead to life and calls things into existence.

3. "The souls of all departed saints live with Him" - The souls of all those who have passed away in faith are in the presence of God. They continue to live with Him, experiencing the fullness of His love and glory.

These quotes highlight the eternal nature of God and His ability to transcend death, giving comfort and hope to believers.

### John Wesley:
1. "He is not a God of the dead, or, there is no God of the dead - That is, tho term God implies such a relation, as cannot possibly subsist between him and the dead; who in the Sadducees' sense are extinguished spirits; who could neither worship him, nor receive good from him." 

2. "So that all live to him — All who have him for their God, live to and enjoy him. This sentence is not an argument for what went before; but the proposition which was to be proved."

3. "And the consequence is apparently just. For as all the faithful are the children of Abraham, and the Divine promise of being a God to him and his seed is entailed upon them, it implies their continued existence and happiness in a future state as much as Abraham's."
