# Luke 20:39 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, Jesus triumphs over opposition from both the Sadducees and Pharisees, leaving them foiled and unable to challenge his authority. His profound understanding of Scripture baffles and silences the religious leaders. Even his enemies are forced to acknowledge the wisdom of his response, although their praise is laced with hostility. Through divine providence, Jesus' opponents unwittingly affirm the truth of his teaching. His words not only expose their errors but also reveal the beauty and clarity of his message.
