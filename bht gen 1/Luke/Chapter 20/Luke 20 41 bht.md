# Luke 20:41 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, Jesus questions the Pharisees' understanding of the Messiah, challenging their belief that the Messiah is simply a human descendant of David. By quoting Psalm 110:1, Jesus reveals that the Messiah is not only a human king, but the divine Son of God, with authority over all, including David himself. This challenges their traditional understanding and forces a deeper reflection on the true nature of the Messiah. It exposes their limited interpretation of the Scriptures and calls for a recognition of Jesus as the fulfillment of God's promises.
