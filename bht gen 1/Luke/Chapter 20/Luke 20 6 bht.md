# Luke 20:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the speaker anticipates a violent response, fearing that they will be stoned to death for their words. The people have already been persuaded and hold a strong belief, immune to the authority of the chief priests. Despite the potential backlash and opposition, the speaker remains steadfast, refusing to back down from their conviction, even against their own consciences.
