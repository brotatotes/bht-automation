# Luke 20:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the individuals mentioned displayed a deliberate ignorance of the truth. They preferred to sacrifice their principles for personal gain and chose to feign ignorance rather than acknowledge the truth. Their motive for this behavior seemed to be to avoid embarrassment or facing the consequences of their actions. Their actions can be seen as cowardly and hypocritical, as they prioritized their own interests over integrity and honesty.
