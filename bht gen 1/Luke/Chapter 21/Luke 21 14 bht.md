# Luke 21:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, we are instructed to be ready to give an answer for our faith, not through mere defense, but by sharing the transformative power of our beliefs. Our response should be characterized by gentleness and respect, reflecting the love and grace of Christ in our interactions. This preparation requires deep understanding and a willingness to engage in thoughtful dialogue, not anxiety-driven speech conning or sermon preparation. It is important to resolve in our minds to always be ready to provide an answer, overcoming any timidity or fear that may arise in such situations.
