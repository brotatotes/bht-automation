# Luke 21:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, a small act of giving is shown to be of great significance. The woman, described as the poor widow, offers two tiny coins, the smallest Jewish currency, known as two mites or a farthing. Though seemingly insignificant, her genuine faith and sacrificial spirit are recognized by Jesus, who commends her for giving more than all others combined. This story emphasizes the importance of humility, sincere devotion, and the true value of our offerings in the eyes of God.
