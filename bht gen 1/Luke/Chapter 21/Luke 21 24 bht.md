# Luke 21:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
During the destruction of Jerusalem, over a million Jews perished, and the city was desecrated and left in ruins. The oppressive and contemptuous conquest was so devastating that the land was sold, and no Jew was allowed near Jerusalem. However, these dark times have an end, as the full conversion of the Gentiles marks the completion of the times of their dominion over the city. This prophecy was rigorously fulfilled, emphasizing the significant historical and prophetic relevance of these events.
