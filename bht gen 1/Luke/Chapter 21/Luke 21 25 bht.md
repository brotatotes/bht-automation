# Luke 21:25 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the grandeur of the language points towards an event beyond time, yet it also refers to the destruction of Jerusalem and Christ's final coming. Distress and perplexity will grip the people, in a state of being lost, as they witness the roaring of the sea. The signs mentioned here are distinct from those in other scriptures, and there will be darkened and surprising eclipses. This verse serves as a reminder of the great day to come, paralleled with the destruction of Jerusalem.
