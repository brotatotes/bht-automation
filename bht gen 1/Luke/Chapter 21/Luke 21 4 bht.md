1. "The offerings of God" (or "unto the gifts") in this verse refers to the act of giving and presenting offerings to God. It signifies the act of worship and devotion, demonstrating our gratitude and reverence towards Him.

2. The word "penury" (or "lack") highlights the idea of scarcity or insufficiency. It suggests that the woman in this passage gave not out of her abundance, but out of her own need. Her offering was a true sacrifice, reflecting her faith and trust in God's provision.

3. This verse can be compared to similar passages in Matthew 24:1-14 and Mark 13:1-13.
