## BHT:
In the midst of the disciples' amazement at the splendor of the temple, with its grand stones, gilding, and lavish gifts, Jesus used this moment to impart a profound truth. He reminded them that God's plans and ways are far beyond their understanding, and that they can find peace and trust in surrendering to His wisdom. Jesus redirected their focus from the external beauty of the temple to the spiritual significance of their own lives, reminding them that their true richness and worth lie in their relationship with God.
