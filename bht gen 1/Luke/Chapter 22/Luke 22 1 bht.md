# Luke 22:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse in question describes a festival, specifically the feast of unleavened bread and passover. This festival is in commemoration of the Israelites' haste to leave Egypt, symbolized by the unleavened bread that they had to eat. The feast drew near as a conspiracy was formed against Jesus, and it is seen as a figurative representation of the sincerity and truth that should be observed in the Gospel feast. This is the only place in the New Testament where the expression "the feast of unleavened bread" is used.
