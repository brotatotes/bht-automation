In this significant moment, Jesus takes a cup, signifying the fulfillment of the Passover rite. His action marks the transition from the old to the new, as He institutes the Lord's Supper and abrogates the old traditions. The cup, customarily used in the Passover feast, is now used for the Eucharist, symbolizing the divine transfer from earth to heaven. Jesus, in His authority, shares the cup and gives thanks, foreshadowing the establishment of the perpetual ordinance.
