# Luke 22:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the use of the word "bread" emphasizes both its physicality as a staple food and its symbolic meaning of sustenance and provision. As we contemplate the sacrifice of Christ, his flesh becomes nourishment for us, symbolically representing sustenance for our souls. This verse also reminds us that Jesus, through his voluntary sacrifice, offers himself as a substitutionary offering, given in our place. Therefore, when we partake in the act of communion, we are to remember Christ's love and his body being offered up for us.
