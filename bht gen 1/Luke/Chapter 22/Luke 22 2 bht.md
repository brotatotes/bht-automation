# Luke 22:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse being described captures a crucial moment where the people, eagerly anticipating the approaching feast, are actively seeking to take hold of Jesus. This desire to "make way with" him may stem from their previous intent to end his ministry. However, while they consult and plan, fear holds them back from openly seizing him, as they are aware that the populace is quite supportive of Jesus and would likely respond with violence.
