# Luke 22:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, Jesus makes a profound statement about the presence of the betrayer, Judas, at the Last Supper. The commentators emphasize the irony and depth of Jesus' love in sharing a meal with the one who would betray him. They also highlight the timing of Jesus' words, clarifying that they were spoken before the institution of the Lord's Supper. The practicality of the statement is noted, as it signifies that the act of dipping and giving the bread to Judas could only have happened while the food was still on the table.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The verse reminds us that God's ways are not our ways, and His thoughts are not our thoughts. We may not always understand why God allows certain things to happen, but we can trust that His plans are always for our ultimate good and His glory." 

2. "This verse also serves as a reminder that God is in control of all things, even the seemingly chaotic and unjust events in our lives. He is sovereign and has a purpose for everything that occurs, whether we can see it or not." 

3. "It is a call to surrender our own understanding and trust in God's wisdom and sovereignty. We may not always have the answers or understand the reasons behind certain circumstances, but we can have faith that God is working all things together for our good."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "He does not say with you: thus separating the traitor from the rest of the disciples."

### John Gill:
1. "By the 'hand' is meant, not figuratively the counsel, contrivance, and conspiracy of Judas to betray him, but literally the hand of Judas, which was then dipping in the dish with Christ."
2. "It is an aggravation of his sin, that one that sat with him at his table, ate bread with him, and dipped his morsel in the same dish, should be the betrayer of him."
3. "The phrase, 'with me', is left out in the Syriac and Persic versions. From Luke's account it appears most clearly, that Judas was not only at the passover, but at the Lord's supper, since this was said when both were over."
