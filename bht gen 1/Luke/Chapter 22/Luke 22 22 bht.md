# Luke 22:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This verse speaks of a significant event in which the betrayal of Jesus by Judas is described. It implies that this betrayal was not a mere coincidence but rather part of God's predetermined plan. The word "determined" emphasizes the idea of setting boundaries or limits in relation to this act. While Judas is held responsible for his actions and is not excused from the consequences, the betrayal itself was predestined by God, serving as a pivotal moment in the death of Christ.
