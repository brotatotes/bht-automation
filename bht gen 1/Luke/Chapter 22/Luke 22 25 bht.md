# Luke 22:25 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the commentators highlight the contrast between positions of authority and acts of true benevolence. The verse challenges the desire for recognition and praise that often accompanies power, emphasizing that Jesus's kingdom is not of this world and should not be managed in the same manner. It exposes the deceptive nature of power, where those in authority may be called "benefactors" but often oppress others. True acts of kindness and service are characterized by selflessness and a desire to bless and benefit others, rather than seeking personal gain or control.
