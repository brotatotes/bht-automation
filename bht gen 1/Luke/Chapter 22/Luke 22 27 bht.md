## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "This verse highlights the humility and servant-heartedness of Jesus, who willingly took on the role of a servant to wash the disciples' feet. It serves as a powerful example for believers to follow, reminding us that true greatness is found in serving others selflessly." 

2. "By washing the disciples' feet, Jesus not only demonstrated his love for them but also taught them the importance of humility and servanthood in their own lives. This act of service was a tangible expression of his sacrificial love and a foreshadowing of his ultimate act of service on the cross."

3. "Through this act, Jesus also challenged the cultural norms of his time, where washing feet was considered a task for the lowest of servants. He showed that true leadership is not about power and authority, but about serving others with love and humility."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The disciples were not only disputing among themselves, but they were also struggling with their own doubts and fears. This reminds us that even those closest to Jesus can still have moments of uncertainty and confusion." 

2. "Jesus responds to their dispute by reminding them of the true nature of leadership. He teaches them that greatness is not found in power and authority, but in service and humility." 

3. "The disciples' argument over who is the greatest reveals their misunderstanding of Jesus' kingdom. They were still thinking in terms of worldly power and status, rather than embracing the upside-down values of the kingdom of God."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "But I am in the midst of you as he that serveth." - This clause gains in force by supposing that our Lord at this point washed His disciples’ feet. He, the ‘chief,’ was serving.
2. "We may also connect this with Luke 22:25: ‘the benefactors among the Gentiles are rulers and potentates; I, your benefactor, am among you as a servant.'" - Jesus contrasts himself with the rulers and potentates of the Gentiles who are considered benefactors, emphasizing that he is among his disciples as a servant.
3. "Luke 22:28-30 may belong here chronologically, or, as is far more likely, they followed the washing of the disciples’ feet, which may be appropriately placed at Luke 22:27." - The verses that follow may either be chronologically connected or they may have followed the washing of the disciples' feet, which would further emphasize the theme of Jesus serving his disciples.

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Jesus dares to cite his own conduct, though their leader, to prove his point and to put a stop to their jealous contention for the chief place at this very feast."
2. "A wrangling that kept up till Jesus had to arise and give them the object lesson of humility by washing their feet."
3. "Jesus' act of washing the disciples' feet serves as an object lesson of humility."

2. "Our Lord, by his own example throughout the whole of his conduct among them, as well as by such a single action, would dissuade from their ambitious views of superiority over each other."
