# Luke 22:32 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the midst of Peter's upcoming denial, Jesus prays for him, desiring that his faith remains intact even in the face of temptation. Through his persistent prayers, Jesus recognizes that while Peter's faith may falter to some degree, it is not completely extinguished. Jesus also foresees Peter's eventual repentance and appoints him to be a pillar of strength for his fellow disciples, encouraging them and helping restore their own faith. Despite the challenges and potential doubts, Jesus's prayers and guidance ensure that Peter's faith will ultimately endure.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "It must not be supposed that our Lord’s prayer was not heard, because Peter’s faith did fail, in his denial; ἐκλίπῃ implies a total extinction which Peter’s faith did not suffer."
2. "We may notice here, that our Lord speaks of the total failure of even an Apostle’s faith, as possible."
3. "There can, I think, be little doubt that this word is here used in the general N.T. sense, of returning as a penitent after sin, turning to God."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "But I have prayed—have been doing it already." - This quote highlights the continuous and persistent nature of the speaker's prayers, indicating a deep commitment to intercession.

2. "Fail not—that is, entirely; for partially it did fail." - This quote suggests that while the speaker's faith may have faltered to some extent, it did not completely fail. It speaks to the human struggle with doubt and the need for divine intervention.

3. "Strengthen, &c.—that is, make use of thy bitter experience for the fortifying of thy tempted brethren." - This quote emphasizes the importance of using personal trials and hardships as a source of strength and encouragement for others facing similar challenges.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The prayer of Jesus was that he might not altogether apostatize from the faith."
2. "There was no time in which Peter was not really a pious man."
3. "A man may be 'converted or turned' from any sin, or any evil course."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Prayed [εδεηθην] . See on prayers, ch. 5 33."
2. "Converted is simply the Latinized rendering of the word to turn round [χονςερτερε]."
3. "Strengthen [στηρισον] . See on ch. Luke 16:25, and 1 Peter 5:10. Rev., stablish, which is much better. Strengthen may denote only a temporary effect. The word implies fixedness."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "In the consciousness of greater power than that of Satan and greater faithfulness than that of Peter."
2. "Our Lord prays, not that Peter be not tried, but that his faith should not utterly fail."

### Archibald T. Robertson:

2. "The words 'do thou' single out Peter sharply, emphasizing his individual responsibility and the need for personal action." 

3. "The use of the word 'turned again' implies that Peter would fall, but also suggests that he would come back and play a role in strengthening his fellow disciples."

### John Gill:

2. "Though, through the power of sin, and the force of temptation, [faith] may fail as to some degree of the steadfastness of it, as to the acting and exercise of it, and as to the sense believers may have of it; yet never as to its principle, it being an irrevocable gift of God's grace."
3. "Christ is the advocate of his people; he prays that they might have faith, and then he prays, that it may not fail; and it shall not, notwithstanding all the opposition of hell, and earth, unto it."
