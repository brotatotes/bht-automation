# Luke 22:38 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, the disciples misunderstood Jesus' words about swords. They took it literally, thinking that physical self-defense was the intention. However, Jesus was referring to a deeper purpose. He dismissed the subject with a touch of irony and sorrow, highlighting their failure to grasp his spiritual meaning. The mention of the road infested with robbers adds context to the disciples' concern for protection. Ultimately, Jesus' words foreshadowed the upcoming events in the Garden of Gethsemane, where he would experience great agony before his arrest.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The road from Jericho to Jerusalem was much infested with robbers; and it was the custom for the priests, and even the quiet and ascetic Essenes, to carry weapons when travelling."
2. "Chrysostom gives a curious explanation of the two swords: 'εἰκὸς οὖν καὶ μαχαίρας εἶναι ἐκεῖ διὰ τὸ ἀρνίον.' This certainly agrees with the number of the disciples sent to get ready the Passover."
3. "Our Lord breaks off the matter with ἱκανόν ἐστιν, 'It is enough;' not 'they are sufficient;' but, 'It is well, we are sufficiently provided.'"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "two swords . . . enough" - This statement reveals the disciples' misunderstanding of Jesus' intentions. They interpreted His words literally, thinking that He was referring to the need for self-defense in the present moment. However, Jesus had a deeper meaning in mind.
2. "His answer showed He meant something else" - Jesus' response to the disciples' statement about having two swords indicated that He had a different purpose in mind. He was not concerned with physical defense but had a greater plan that would soon unfold.
3. "AGONY IN THE GARDEN" - This phrase hints at the upcoming events in the Garden of Gethsemane, where Jesus would experience intense anguish and pray fervently before His arrest. It serves as a reminder of the weight of the sacrifice He was about to make for humanity.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The Galileans, it is said, often went armed. The Essenes did so also. The reason was that the country was full of robbers and wild beasts, and it was necessary to carry, in their travels, some means of defense."
2. "It is difficult to understand this. Some suppose that it is spoken 'ironically;' as if he had said, 'You are bravely armed indeed, with two swords among twelve men, and to meet such a host!'"
3. "Others, that he meant to reprove them for understanding him 'literally,' as if he meant that they were then to procure swords for 'immediate' battle. As if he had said, 'This is absurd, or a perversion of my meaning. I did not intend this, but merely to foretell you of impending dangers after my death.'"

### John Calvin:
1. "It was truly shameful and stupid ignorance, that the disciples, after having been so often informed about bearing the cross, imagine that they must fight with swords of iron."
2. "It is evident, at least, that they were so stupid as not to think of a spiritual enemy."
3. "And it was necessary that the slaves of Antichrist should fall into such madness, of openly trampling under feet, by sacrilegious contempt, the sacred oracles of God."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The Galileans often travelled armed, and possibly two of the disciples had thus provided themselves because they expected danger that night."
2. "The reference is not to the sufficiency of the weapons, but a mild turning away from further explanation in view of their failure to understand."
3. "'Two swords' were of no avail in the spiritual conflict before Him; of this He had just spoken, but they failed to recognize His meaning."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "They took his words literally." 
2. "For all that take the sword shall perish with the sword." 
3. "It is with sad irony and sorrow that Jesus thus dismisses the subject."

### John Gill:
1. "They understood Christ's words literally; and two swords being among them, and which they might bring with them from Galilee, to defend themselves from thieves, and robbers."
2. "They mention them with a desire of knowing they were sufficient, or whether they must provide themselves with more."
3. "His meaning is, they were sufficient to answer his purpose, and be an emblem of what he designed by the sword."

### John Wesley:
1. "Here are two swords — Many of Galilee carried them when they travelled, to defend themselves against robbers and assassins, who much infested their roads."
2. "But did the apostles need to seek such defence?"
3. "And he said; It is enough - I did not mean literally, that every one of you must have a sword."
