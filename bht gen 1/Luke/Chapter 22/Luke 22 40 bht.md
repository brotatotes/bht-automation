## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "My soul is exceeding sorrowful even unto death"—"I feel as if nature would sink under this load, as if life were ebbing out, and death coming before its time"—"tarry ye here, and watch with Me"; not, "Witness for Me," but, "Bear Me company." It did Him good, it seems, to have them beside Him.
2. "Thy will be done!" - Jesus' ultimate surrender to the Father's will, even in the face of the revolting nature of His impending death.
3. "The bitterness of death is past." He has anticipated and rehearsed His final conflict, and won the victory—now on the theater of an invincible will, as then on the arena of the Cross. "I will suffer," is the grand result of Gethsemane: "It is finished" is the shout that bursts from the Cross.
