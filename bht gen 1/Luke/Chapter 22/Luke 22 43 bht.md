## BHT:
In this verse, we see the mention of an angel coming to strengthen someone in a time of spiritual battle. This angel's presence signifies divine intervention and support. The person being strengthened needed additional strength to endure a challenging situation or task, as their physical body was vulnerable and could have succumbed to weakness. The divine assistance provided sustenance and assurance, enabling the person to persevere until the appointed time or fulfill their intended purpose.
