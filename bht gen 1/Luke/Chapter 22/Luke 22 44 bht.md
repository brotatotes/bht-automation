# Luke 22:44 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the Garden of Gethsemane, Jesus experienced an intense struggle, feeling the weight of the wrath of God and being surrounded by a hostile spiritual realm. In this intense agony, his sweat poured out like drops of blood, demonstrating the depth of his distress. Strengthened by this agony, Jesus fervently prayed, ultimately surrendering to God's will and patiently awaiting the coming betrayal. This powerful moment exemplifies the depth of Jesus' humanity and his willingness to bear the weight of sin and God's judgment for our sake.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The intention of the Evangelist seems clearly to be, to convey the idea that the sweat was (not fell like, but was) like drops of blood; i.e. coloured with blood."
2. "To suppose that it only fell like drops of blood is to nullify the force of the sentence, and make the insertion of αἵματος not only superfluous but absurd."
3. "We must not forget, in asking on what testimony this rests, that the marks of such drops would be visible after the termination of the agony."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "There is in the aorist participle a suggestion of a growing intensity in the struggle, which is not conveyed by the simple being."
2. "Literally, though very awkwardly, it is, having become in an agony: having progressed from the first prayer into an intense struggle of prayer and sorrow."
3. "Agony occurs only here. It is used by medical writers, and the fact of a sweat accompanying an agony is also mentioned by them."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Our Lord was strengthened for this agony or conflict."
2. "The first result of the strengthening was that He prayed more earnestly."
3. "The final result was complete resignation and victorious waiting for the betrayer."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Satan pressed Jesus harder than ever before."
2. "Thick, clotted blood."
3. "Aristotle speaks of a bloody sweat as does Theophrastus."

### John Gill:
1. "This account of Christ's bloody sweat is only given by Luke, who being a physician, as is thought, more diligently recorded things which belonged to his profession to take cognizance of."
2. "This bloody sweat did not arise from a cachexy, or ill state of body, which has sometimes been the cause of it, as Aristotle observes, who says that the blood sometimes becomes sanious, and so serous, insomuch that some have been covered with a 'bloody sweat'."
3. "This agony, and bloody sweat of Christ, prove the truth of his human nature; the sweat shows that he had a true and real body, as other men; the anxiety of his mind, that he had a reasonable soul capable of grief and sorrow, as human souls are; and they also prove his being made sin and a curse for us, and his sustaining our sins, and the wrath of God."

### John Wesley:
1. "Feeling the weight of the wrath of God, and at the same time surrounded with a mighty host of devils, who exercised all their force and malice to persecute and distract his wounded spirit."
2. "Even with stronger cries and tears."
3. "His sweat - as it were great drops of blood - which, by the vehement distress of his soul, were forced out of the pores."
