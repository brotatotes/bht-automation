### Henry Alford:
1. "Suffer, permit me, thus far: i.e. to touch the ear of the wounded person." 

2. "If this interpretation be correct, it furnishes an additional token of the truthfulness of our narrative."

3. "The previous laying hold of Jesus has not been mentioned here, but in Matthew and Mark."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Suffer ye thus far. This is variously interpreted. I think the text requires that the words should be addressed to the disciples, and taken as the answer to the question, shall we smite, etc."
2. "The meaning then is, permit them to go so far as to seize me. The expression thus corresponds with Matthew 26:52."

1. "Suffer ye thus far. Probably addressed to the disciples: Let them go on and fulfil this their design of taking me. It is a mild reproof of the hasty use of the sword." 

2. "Let me go, until I have healed this man, or Let me go as far as this man. This is grammatically probable, but opposed by the phrase ‘answered.’"
