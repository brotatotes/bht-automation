# Luke 22:54 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the midst of Jesus' trials, the identity of the high priest remains uncertain. Luke omits the trial or includes its essence in the account of the morning assembly of the Sanhedrin, while John clarifies that it was Annas. The house where these events take place is undoubtedly Caiaphas', serving as the backdrop for not only Jesus' trial but also Peter's denial. Jesus' silence in the face of false accusations demonstrates his submission to God's will and willingness to endure unjust suffering, showcasing the contrast between corrupt human justice systems and God's perfect justice.
