# Luke 22:55 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the middle of the hall, a large and bright fire blazed all around, kindled by the servants and officers of the high priest on a cold night. Peter, restless and wanting to go unnoticed, sat among them. The fire not only provided warmth but also allowed Peter to blend in, preventing him from being suspected as he had been loitering around. This event took place during the passover and the beginning of harvest.
