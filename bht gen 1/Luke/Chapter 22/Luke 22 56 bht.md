# Luke 22:56 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In a vivid and realistic scene, Peter warms himself by the fire, while facing the light that both illuminates and exposes him. As he gazes steadily, Peter is scrutinized by a woman who despisingly refers to him as a contemptible disciple of Jesus. The fire becomes a symbol of the testing and refining of Peter's faith, as he is confronted about his association with Jesus in the midst of the flickering flames and inquisitive looks.
