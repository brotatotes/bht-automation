# Luke 22:65 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the Gospel of John, the author provides a glimpse into the vastness of Jesus' works and teachings, acknowledging that there are many other things yet to be explored. This emphasizes the incompleteness of the Gospel narrative, inviting readers to delve deeper into the richness of Jesus' ministry. It also highlights the misconceptions and blasphemy faced by Jesus, with some denying his deity, ridiculing his offices as prophet, priest, and king, and asserting him to be a mere man. However, the charge of blasphemy is ultimately placed on those who opposed Jesus, for he truly was the Son of God.
