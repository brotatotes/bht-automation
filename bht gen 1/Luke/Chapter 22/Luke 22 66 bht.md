# Luke 22:66 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, we witness a meeting of the Sanhedrin, the council of respected leaders within the Jewish community, convening in the early morning. The presence of the elders signifies a collective decision-making process, giving weight to their discussion. The timing of this meeting is significant, as both Roman law and Jewish tradition forbid conducting investigations or rendering final judgments during the night. Jesus' silence in the face of false accusations showcased his humility and fulfillment of prophecy, serving as a challenge for us to respond with grace and trust in God's sovereignty when faced with unjust treatment.
