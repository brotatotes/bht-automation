# Luke 22:68 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, our Lord's response is a protest against the question asked of Him, firmly challenging the intentions and bias behind it. He understands the predetermined guilt they assign to Him and their reluctance to engage in an honest discussion or accept His claims, even if He were to prove His innocence. It becomes clear that the questioners have no genuine interest in the truth but instead are determined to keep Him in bondage and take His life, rendering any further conversation futile.
