# Luke 22:69 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
From now on, there is a shift in perspective towards the Son of man, who is the Messiah. He answers their demand by asserting his identity as the Son of man and makes claims of equality with God. This power and authority come from God himself, as Luke specifically adds. The actions described in this verse indicate a shift in time and a manifestation of God's power through the destruction of their nation, city, and temple.
