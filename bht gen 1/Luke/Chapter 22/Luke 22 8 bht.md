## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Mark 14:13 has only 'two' while Matthew 26:17 makes the disciples take the initiative." This highlights the difference in the accounts of Peter and John's involvement in preparing for the Passover meal, emphasizing the specific number of disciples mentioned in each Gospel.

2. "The word passover in this context is used either of the meal, the feast day, the whole period (including the unleavened bread)." This insight expands our understanding of the term "Passover," indicating that it can refer to different aspects of the celebration, including the meal itself, the feast day, or the entire period of observance.

3. "'Eat the passover' can refer to the meal as here or to the whole period of celebration (John 18:28)." This quote further emphasizes the flexibility of the term "Passover," explaining that it can be understood as both the specific meal being eaten and the broader period of celebration encompassing various rituals and observances.

### John Gill:
1. "Jesus sent them, as the Syriac, Persic, and Ethiopic versions express it; these were two favourite disciples of Christ." 
2. "Go and prepare us the passover, that we may eat it together; so servants used to be sent, to go and prepare the passover for their masters." 
3. "This shows the authority and power of Christ, that he could send his disciples to any place, and they should find everything ready for them."
