# Luke 23:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, an episode unfolds where Herod and his soldiers display contempt and mockery towards Jesus. Herod sets Jesus at nought, treating him as insignificant and foolish for not answering his questions. This arrogance is further emphasized when Herod dresses Jesus in a splendid robe, symbolizing his dismissive attitude towards Jesus' claim as King of the Jews. Herod's actions reflect his ignorance and failure to recognize the true power and authority of Jesus.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "ἐσθῆτα λαμπρ. ] Variously interpreted: either purple, as befitting a king, and why should this not be the very χλαμὺς κοκκίνη afterwards used by Pilate’s soldiers (Matthew 27:28; ἱμάτιον πορφυροῦν, Joh 19:2)?"
2. "or white, as λαμπρ. is rendered by some (but see note), Acts 10:30."
3. "ἐσθῆτα λαμπρ. ] Variously interpreted: either purple, as befitting a king, and why should this not be the very χλαμὺς κοκκίνη afterwards used by Pilate’s soldiers (Matthew 27:28; ἱμάτιον πορφυροῦν, Joh 19:2)? or white, as λαμπρ. is rendered by some (but see note), Acts 10:30."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "stung with disappointment at His refusal to amuse him with miracles or answer any of his questions."
2. "If this mean (as sometimes) of shining white, this being the royal color among the Jews, it may have been in derision of His claim to be 'King of the Jews.'"
3. "Thus he implicated himself with Pilate in all the guilt of His condemnation, and with him accordingly he is classed."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Herod with his men of war - With his soldiers, or his body-guard. It is probable that in traveling he had 'a guard' to attend him constantly."
2. "Set him at nought - Treated him with contempt and ridicule."
3. "A gorgeous robe - A white or shining robe, for this is the meaning of the original. The Roman princes wore 'purple' robes, and 'Pilate,' therefore, put such a robe on Jesus."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Gorgeous [λαμπραν] . Lit., bright or brilliant."
2. "Mark has purple (porfuran), and Matthew scarlet [κοκκινην]."
3. "The general term for raiment."

### John Calvin:
1. "It was impossible but that a haughty man, who valued himself on his luxuries and royal dignity and wealth, should despise Christ, who had at that time nothing but what was contemptible in his appearance."
2. "The pride of Herod, which shut the door on the grace of God, admits of no excuse."
3. "The honor which is due to God is seldom rendered to him in the courts of kings."

Note: The provided commentary is quite long, but I have extracted the three most relevant quotes that provide insights into the verse.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The motive was resentment at the silence of Jesus, though actual contempt was doubtless felt."
2. "Set him at nought, treated Him contemptuously, and mocked him, with words and actions alike."
3. "This garment was put on in mockery, and hence brilliant. It may have been the same scarlet cloak which is spoken of in Matthew 27:28, and thus indicated contempt of His claims to royalty, or a white robe, such as candidates for office wore."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Set him at nought (εξουθενησας). First aorist active participle from εξουθενεω, to count as nothing, to treat with utter contempt, as zero."
2. "Arraying him in gorgeous apparel (περιβαλων εσθητα λαμπραν). Second aorist active participle of περιβαλλω, to fling around one. Λαμπραν is brilliant, shining as in James 2:2, so different from the modest dress of the Master."
3. "This was part of the shame."

### John Gill:
1. "Treated him as a silly, and contemptible creature, that could not do anything that was reported of him."
2. "Made sport and pastime with him, and arrayed him in a gorgeous robe."
3. "Uncondemned, not knowing what to make of him, or the charge against him, and he might be unwilling to have any hand in his death."

These quotes highlight the mockery and contempt that Herod and his soldiers showed towards Jesus, as well as their confusion and uncertainty about what to do with him.

### John Wesley:
1. "Herod set him at nought — Probably judging him to be a fool, because he answered nothing."
2. "In a splendid robe — In royal apparel; intimating that he feared nothing from this king."
3. "Herod's mocking and dressing Jesus in a royal robe reveal his ignorance and arrogance, as he fails to recognize the true power and authority of Jesus."
