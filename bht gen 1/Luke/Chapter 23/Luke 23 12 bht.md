In this verse, we see the unexpected reconciliation between Pilate and Herod, both of whom were previously indifferent or hostile towards Jesus.

The reconciliation also highlights the disdain the world has for the children of God and religion itself. The account showcases the grammatical aspect of continuous action in the past, emphasizing the prior state of enmity that existed between Pilate and Herod.
