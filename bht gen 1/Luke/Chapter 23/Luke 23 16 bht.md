# Luke 23:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, we see Pilate's unjust decision-making and moral compromise. Despite finding Jesus innocent, Pilate proposes to chastise him as a concession to the demanding crowd. This act of chastisement, often associated with purifying and amendment, is an illegal concession, causing Pilate to compromise his integrity and further emboldening the crowd. The delicate power dynamics highlight the struggle between maintaining order and giving in to external pressure. In the end, Pilate is caught between his desire to release Jesus and his fear of displeasing the crowd.

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The word is not synonymous with punish, since it always implies an infliction which contemplates the subject's amendment; and hence answers to chastise or chasten." 
2. "Chasten is from the Latin castus, 'pure,' 'chaste;' and to chasten is, properly, to purify."
3. "Instead of punishing him with death, he will chastise him, in order to teach him better."

### John Calvin:
1. "Pilate, therefore, acts unjustly when, after pronouncing Christ to be free from all blame, he resolves to punish him, as if he had been guilty of an ordinary offense; for he not only declares that he has found in him no crime worthy of death, but asserts his innocence in the most unqualified manner."
2. "Earthly men, who are not confirmed by the Spirit of God in a constant wish to do what is right, even though they are desirous to maintain integrity, are accustomed, in this manner, to yield so far as to commit small injuries, when they are compelled."
3. "The Popish clergy persecute his holy servants with the same cruelty with which the Jewish priests cried out, demanding that Christ should be put to death. Many of the judges, indeed, willingly offer themselves as executioners to follow out their rage; but when they shrink from shedding blood, so as to save innocent men from dying, they scourge Christ himself, who is the only righteousness of God."

### Philip Schaff:

### John Gill:
1. "Give him some correction, as by scourging, or beating with rods: this he proposed, not because he thought him deserving of it, but in complaisance to the Jews." 
2. "This would carry a show of guilt and punishment, and he hoped this might be thought sufficient, and so he should please them, and save Jesus from dying, which he much desired."
3. "Release him; from his bonds, and let him go."
