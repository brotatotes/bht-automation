# Luke 23:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this passage, the question posed by Pilate presents a striking contrast between two choices: Barabbas, a notorious criminal, and Jesus, the Messiah. The crowd's decision to choose Barabbas over Jesus reveals the fallen nature of humanity and their rejection of the true Messiah. Pilate's attempt to wash his hands of the decision emphasizes our personal responsibility to make a choice regarding Jesus. Ultimately, this exchange symbolizes the sacrifice Jesus would make on the cross, offering us freedom from sin and challenging us to consider the weight of our own choices.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Albert Barnes:
1. "Pilate's question, 'Whom do you want me to release for you: Barabbas, or Jesus who is called the Messiah?' reveals the stark contrast between the two choices. Barabbas, a notorious criminal, represents the sinful nature of humanity, while Jesus, the Messiah, represents the hope of salvation and redemption."

2. "The crowd's choice of Barabbas over Jesus reflects the fallen nature of humanity and their rejection of the true Messiah. It highlights the irony that the very people Jesus came to save were the ones who chose to release a criminal instead."

3. "Pilate's attempt to wash his hands of the decision, symbolizing his innocence in the matter, only serves to emphasize the responsibility of each individual to make a personal choice regarding Jesus. We cannot escape the decision to either accept or reject Him."

4. "The exchange of Barabbas for Jesus on the cross foreshadows the ultimate sacrifice that Jesus would make for humanity. Just as Barabbas was set free, we are set free from the bondage of sin through the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ."

5. "This passage serves as a reminder of the power of choice and the consequences that follow. It challenges us to examine our own hearts and consider whether we are choosing the temporary pleasures of this world over the eternal salvation found in Jesus."

### John Gill:
