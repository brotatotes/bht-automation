## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The words themselves which they use are not so false, as the spirit, and impression which they convey."
2. "The κωλύοντα φ. Κ. διδ. was, however, false entirely."
3. "It is just one of those instances where those who are determined to effect their purpose by falsehood, do so, in spite of the fact having been precisely the contrary to that which they assert."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "This fellow - The word 'fellow' is not in the original. It conveys a notion of 'contempt,' which no doubt they 'felt,' but which is not expressed in the 'Greek,' and which it is not proper should be expressed in the translation."
2. "Perverting the nation - That is, exciting them to sedition and tumults. This was a mere wanton accusation, but it was plausible before a Roman magistrate."
3. "Forbidding ... - About their charges they were very cautious and cunning. They did not say that he 'taught' that people should not give tribute - that would have been too gross a charge, and would have been easily refuted; but it was an 'inference' which they drew."

### Marvin Vincent:

2. "The phrase 'we found' implies a collective decision reached after careful examination and deliberation." This quote emphasizes the collaborative nature of the council's decision-making process.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The first approach to Pilate is narrated by John only, but Luke gives this charge with most precision."
2. "They thus represent themselves as genuine friends of the people."
3. "This involved what was true. But from this single element of truth they deduced certain political results, which had never occurred."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "They had indulged their hatred in doing it, but they no longer have the power of life and death." 
2. "Probably they mean that they had caught Jesus in the act of doing these things (in flagrante delicto) rather than discovery by formal trial."
3. "Jesus did claim to be the Christ and the king of the kingdom of God. But the Sanhedrin wanted Pilate to think that he set himself up as a rival to Caesar."

### John Gill:
1. "He was so far from perverting the nation with false doctrine and worship, that he taught the true doctrine, and right way of worship, and refuted the false glosses of the Pharisees, and opposed the vain traditions of the elders, by which both were corrupted."
2. "So far was he from any seditious principles and practices, or doing any injury to Tiberius Caesar, the then reigning emperor, that he taught the people to give Caesar the things that were Caesar's, and he himself paid the tribute money."
3. "When the people would have took him by force, and have made him a king, he avoided it by getting out of the way."

These quotes highlight the innocence of Jesus, showing that he did not pervert the nation or engage in seditious activities. He taught the true doctrine and worship, and even upheld the authority of Caesar.
