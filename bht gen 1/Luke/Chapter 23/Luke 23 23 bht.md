# Luke 23:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, a powerful force gains the upper hand and prevails. The urgency and pressing nature of this force is likened to a tempest, overwhelming and laying itself down to work. The people's insistence on crucifixion, their importunity, pressing force, and overwhelming numbers make it impossible for Pilate to resist their demands. The tempest-like nature of their pleas sways Pilate, resulting in the outcome they desired.
