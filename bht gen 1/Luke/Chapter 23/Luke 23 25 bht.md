# Luke 23:25 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the description is inserted to provide a contrast between Barabbas, a detestable and unworthy criminal not even named, and Jesus, the innocent one. Luke intentionally omits the details of the scourging and mocking of Jesus, highlighting the injustice of the judge surrendering to the mob's clamor. The break between verses shows the harshness of the moment, with Barabbas being released while Jesus, who was delivered to their will to be mocked, scourged, and crucified, faces an unjust fate.
