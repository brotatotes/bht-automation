# Luke 23:27 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
At the scene of the crucifixion, a diverse crowd had gathered, consisting of both men and women. The women, some of whom were loyal followers of Jesus, stood at a distance, weeping in genuine sympathy for the innocent Man enduring such a cruel death. Among them were those who had personally experienced Jesus' healing power, thankful for His earlier acts of compassion. Their presence exemplifies the unwavering devotion and steadfast support of women in Jesus' ministry, as they witnessed the wickedness and inhumanity of the men responsible for His crucifixion.
