# Luke 23:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When Pilate questioned Jesus if he was the King of the Jews, the significance of the inquiry reached beyond a mere political title. It was a profound interrogation about Jesus' identity and authority. In response, Jesus subtly acknowledged his kingship, stating "Thou sayest it" without explicitly confirming or denying. Pilate's attempt to release Jesus, juxtaposed with the condemnation of the true Passover Lamb, highlights the sacrificial nature of Jesus' death and the redemption it offers. The consistency in the accounts of Pilate's question across the Gospels emphasizes its importance.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The answer is widely different from the distinct affirmation in the other three, affirming that He was 'a King' which was the form of their charge."
2. "I believe therefore that the Three give merely the general import of the Lord's answer, which John relates in full."
3. "It is hardly possible, if Jesus had affirmed the fact so strongly and barely as the Three relate it, that Pilate should have made the avowal in Luk 23:4 which John completely explains."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The question Pilate asked Jesus, 'Are you the king of the Jews?' was not a simple inquiry about Jesus' political aspirations. It was a profound question about his identity and authority. Pilate wanted to know if Jesus was claiming to be the Messiah, the long-awaited king of Israel."

2. "Jesus' response to Pilate's question, 'You have said so,' was not a direct affirmation or denial. It was a subtle acknowledgment of his kingship, but also a recognition that his kingdom was not of this world. Jesus was not seeking an earthly throne, but a spiritual reign over the hearts and lives of people."

3. "Pilate's attempt to release Jesus, based on the custom of releasing a prisoner during the Passover, highlights the irony of the situation. The true Passover Lamb, who came to take away the sins of the world, was being condemned to death while a guilty prisoner was set free. This juxtaposition emphasizes the sacrificial nature of Jesus' death and the redemption it offers to all who believe."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Pilate’s question implies some knowledge of the Messianic expectations of the Jews."
2. "Thou sayest it = Yes. So Matthew and Mark."
3. "Pilate’s language in Luke 23:4 implies some further conversation."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Thou sayest" - A direct affirmation, similar to Luke 22:70, indicating Pilate's acknowledgment of the Jews' statement. 

2. "The Gospels all give Pilate's question about Jesus asking of the Jews in precisely the same words" - Highlighting the consistency in the accounts of Pilate's question across the Gospels (Mark 15:2; Matthew 27:11; Luke 23:3; John 18:33). 

3. "The Gospels all give Pilate's question about Jesus asking of the Jews in precisely the same words" - Emphasizing the significance of Pilate's question and its repetition in multiple Gospel accounts.

### John Gill:
1. "Observing that it was said, he had given himself out to be a king; for as for what regarded religion, he took no notice of it; he put this question to him, art thou the King of the Jews?" 
2. "Thou sayest it; that is, thou sayest well; it is as thou sayest, I am the King of the Jews." 
3. "Though he did not leave this without an explanation; without informing him what sort of a king he was, and what kind of a kingdom he had."
