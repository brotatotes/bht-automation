# Luke 23:32 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, we read about Jesus being led with two other malefactors. The sympathy expressed in this verse seems to be directed towards Jesus alone, rather than the malefactors. Luke's account stands out as the only Gospel writer who mentions this detail, distinguishing his narration. The uniqueness of Luke's choice of words is also evident in his description of the malefactors as "evil doers," rather than calling them "robbers" like the other Gospel writers. Ultimately, this verse highlights the ignominy and reproach faced by Jesus, being led with the malefactors to the death of the cross.
