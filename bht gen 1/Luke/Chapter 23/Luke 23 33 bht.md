# Luke 23:33 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
On the hill of Calvary, also known as Golgotha, Jesus was crucified, a place that holds deep significance in Christian theology. It is a symbol of the ultimate sacrifice made by Jesus, where he conquered death and brought salvation to humanity. Despite the mockery and rejection Jesus faced on Calvary, he remained steadfast in his unwavering love and grace. The name Calvary possibly arose from the slight elevation resembling a skull, where the crosses were placed. This hill, traditionally considered the burial site of Adam, was a usual place for execution.
