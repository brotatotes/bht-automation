# Luke 23:35 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The scene depicted in this Bible verse shows a crowd of people, including the chief priests, scribes, elders, and soldiers, deriding and mocking Jesus. The onlookers, who had previously chanted for Jesus to be crucified, now stand in contempt as they scoff at his claims. Their insults and mockery reflect a disbelief in Jesus' role as the Messiah and King. Despite the insults and scorn, Jesus is unwavering, for he has come to save others and fulfill the prophecy of being the chosen one of God.
