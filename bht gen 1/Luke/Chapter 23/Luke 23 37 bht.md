# Luke 23:37 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the Bible verse, there is a scoff directed at Jesus, questioning his identity as the King of the Jews. The mocking challenge to save himself highlights the ignorance and blindness of those who didn't recognize him as the true King. However, the irony lies in the fact that Jesus' purpose was not to save himself but to save others through his sacrificial death. This interrogation reveals doubt, limited understanding, and the ultimate demonstration of love and victory through Jesus' selflessness on the cross.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Philip Schaff:
1. "This scoff was learned from the rulers no doubt (Matthew 27:42), but it included a sneer at the Jews as well." 
2. "The mocking challenge to Jesus to save himself reveals the ignorance and blindness of those who did not recognize him as the true King of the Jews." 
3. "The irony in their words is that Jesus, as the true King, was not there to save himself but to save others through his sacrificial death."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "The soldiers pick out 'the king of the Jews' as the point of their sneer, the point on which Jesus was condemned."
2. "Jesus could not save himself if he was to save others."
3. "Both soldiers and rulers fail to understand that Jesus could not save himself if he was to save others."

### John Gill:
1. "The question posed to Jesus, 'if thou be the King of the Jews,' reveals the doubt and skepticism of those who witnessed his crucifixion. It challenges the very essence of his identity and purpose."
2. "The demand to 'save thyself' reflects the limited understanding of those who failed to grasp the redemptive plan of God. They saw only the physical suffering, unaware of the profound spiritual significance of Jesus' sacrifice."
