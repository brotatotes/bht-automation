## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The phrase 'over Him' emphasizes the physical placement of the inscription on the cross, indicating that it was prominently displayed for all to see."

2. "The use of the term 'projecting upright beam' highlights the unique shape of the cross, with its vertical beam extending above the horizontal beam, further emphasizing the visibility of the inscription."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Superstition is a belief or practice that is irrational, unfounded, or based on fear rather than reason. In the context of Mark 14:26, the commentary highlights how the disciples' fear and superstition led them to misunderstand Jesus' words and actions."

2. "The commentary explains that the disciples' superstition caused them to interpret Jesus' statement about the scattering of the sheep as a sign of impending danger or disaster, rather than understanding it as a metaphorical reference to their own abandonment of Jesus."

3. "By emphasizing the disciples' superstition, the commentary sheds light on the human tendency to rely on irrational beliefs and fears, rather than trusting in God's plan and promises. It serves as a reminder to examine our own hearts and motivations, and to seek a deeper understanding of God's truth."
