# Luke 23:39 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, we see Jesus being reviled and mocked by a criminal who demands Him to save himself and others. The reviling reflects the extent and power of sin, as the criminal persistently engages in abusive and slanderous language. Despite the jeers, this verse serves as a reminder to believers of the unspeakable glory of the dying Redeemer, who endured such reproach to grant us the honor of being acknowledged as brethren among angels. It also highlights the wickedness and obstinacy of those who would continue to blaspheme, even in the midst of their own torments.
