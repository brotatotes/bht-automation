## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Pilate must have known well that a man who had really done that, whereof Jesus was accused, would be no such object of hatred to the Sanhedrim."
2. "This knowledge was doubtless accompanied with a previous acquaintance with some of the sayings and doings of Jesus, from which Pilate had probably formed his own opinion that He was no such King as His foes would represent Him."
3. "Pilate wishes to dismiss Him, finding no fault in Him."

### Albert Barnes:

2. "Pilate, from a dread of exciting a tumult, did not venture absolutely to acquit him, he willingly availed himself of the opportunity which presented itself, of submitting him to the jurisdiction of Herod."
