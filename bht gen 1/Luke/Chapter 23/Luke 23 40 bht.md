# Luke 23:40 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, we witness a remarkable demonstration of God's grace and the power of divine intervention. A repentant criminal, in the final moments of his life, rebukes his companion and recognizes the innocence and divinity of Jesus. Despite their shared fate, this penitent soul exhibits profound repentance, faith, and other graces. It serves as a reminder that God's mercy is not limited by time, but it also cautions against delaying repentance until the last hour.
