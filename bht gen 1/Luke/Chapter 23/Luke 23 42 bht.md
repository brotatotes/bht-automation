# Luke 23:42 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, a man expresses his faith in Jesus as the Messiah and acknowledges him as the King of kings and Lord of lords. Despite being in a moment of great suffering and shame, the man's belief in the kingdom of Christ is unwavering. His request to be remembered in the kingdom demonstrates his trust in Jesus' power to bring blessings, whether in the present or in the future judgment. This extraordinary act of faith is a stark contrast to even the disciples' understanding at that time.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "There is nothing so astounding in this man’s faith dogmatically considered, as De Wette thinks; he merely joins the common belief of the Jews of a Messianic Kingdom, in which the ancient Fathers were to rise, &c., with the conviction, that Jesus is the Messiah."
2. "What is really astounding, is the power and strength of that faith, which, amidst shame and pain and mockery, could thus lift itself to the apprehension of the Crucified as this King."
3. "It is remarkable how, in three following sayings, the Lord appears as Prophet, Priest, and King: as Prophet, to the daughters of Jerusalem; as Priest, interceding for forgiveness; as King, acknowledged by the penitent thief, and answering his prayer."

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "The 'kingdom' referred to was one beyond the grave for it is inconceivable that he should have expected Him to come down from the cross to erect any temporal kingdom."
2. "He does not presume to ask a place in that kingdom, though that is what he means, but with a humility quite affecting, just says, 'Lord, remember me when,' &c."
3. "Now contrast with this bright act of faith the darkness even of the apostles' minds, who could hardly be got to believe that their Master would die at all, who now were almost despairing of Him, and who when dead had almost buried their hopes in His grave."

### John Calvin:
1. "A robber, who not only had not been educated in the school of Christ, but, by giving himself up to execrable murders, had endeavored to extinguish all sense of what was right, suddenly rises higher than all the apostles and the other disciples whom the Lord himself had taken so much pains to instruct."
2. "But that a person, ignorant and uneducated, and whose mind was altogether corrupted, should all at once, on receiving his earliest instructions, perceive salvation and heavenly glory in the accursed cross, was truly astonishing."
3. "Now if a robber, by his faith, elevated Christ—while hanging on the cross, and, as it were, overwhelmed with cursing—to a heavenly throne, woe to our sloth, if we do not behold him with reverence while sitting at the right hand of God; if we do not fix our hope of life on his resurrection; if our aim is not towards heaven where he has entered."
