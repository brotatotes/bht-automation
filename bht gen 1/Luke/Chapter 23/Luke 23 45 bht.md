# Luke 23:45 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
At the moment of Jesus' death, darkness fell upon the land and the sun's light completely failed, emphasizing the unique and supernatural nature of the event. The tearing of the temple veil symbolized the removal of barriers between God and humanity, signifying the end of the Old Covenant and the beginning of the New Covenant, where believers would have direct access and communion with God through Jesus' sacrifice. This significant event, foretold in prophecy, not only granted forgiveness of sins but also restored the broken relationship between God and humanity, showcasing the inclusivity and all-encompassing love of God's salvation.
