## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "παρασκευή ‘the day before the sabbath,’ which now ἐπέφωσκεν, drew on; a natural word, used of the conventional (Jewish) day beginning at sunset."
2. "There is no reference to the lighting of candles in the evening or on the sabbath."
3. "Lightfoot (in loc.) has shewn that such use of the word was common among the Jews, who called the evening (the beginning) of a day אוֹר, ‘light.’"

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The day of Preparation, or the day before the Sabbath, was a significant day in Jewish culture. It was a day of getting ready, both physically and spiritually, for the Sabbath rest. This detail emphasizes the timing and urgency of the events that unfolded leading up to Jesus' crucifixion." 

2. "The mention of the Sabbath drawing near highlights the strict observance of the Sabbath in Jewish tradition. It adds a sense of anticipation and impending rest, contrasting with the chaos and turmoil surrounding Jesus' death. This juxtaposition emphasizes the significance of Jesus' sacrifice and the rest that comes through him." 

3. "The use of the word 'Preparation' also carries a deeper meaning. It not only refers to the preparation for the Sabbath but also foreshadows the preparation for the resurrection. Just as the day of Preparation was necessary for the Sabbath, Jesus' death and burial were necessary for the ultimate victory of his resurrection."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "The day of the Preparation (ημερα παρασκευης). The technical Jewish phrase for the day before the sabbath." 

2. "However, it was sundown, not sunrise when the Jewish sabbath (twenty-four-hour day) began." 

3. "Luke is not speaking of the twelve-hour day which began with sunrise, but the twenty-four-hour day which began with sunset."

### John Gill:
1. "Both for the sabbath, and for the 'Chagigah', or grand festival, which they kept on the fifteenth day of the month, in a very pompous manner; so that the day following was an high day." 

2. "For so they say, 'the lighting of the lamp on the sabbath is not in a man's power, (or at his liberty,) if he pleases he may light, and if not, he may not light. But it is what he is obliged to, and every man and woman are bound to have in their houses a lamp lighted up on the sabbath.'"

3. "Besides, it was usual to call the evening of any day by the name of 'light': thus it is said, 'on the light (i.e. the night) of the fourteenth (of the month "Nisan"), they search for leaven, &c.'"

These quotes provide insights into the preparations and customs surrounding the Sabbath and the festival, as well as the significance of lighting lamps during this time.
