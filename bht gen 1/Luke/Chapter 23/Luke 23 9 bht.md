# Luke 23:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, Jesus encounters someone who is inquisitive and seeks answers, particularly about the powerful miracles associated with Him. However, Jesus does not respond, choosing silence as a powerful response and demonstrating His wisdom in not engaging in pointless arguments. By refusing to answer, Jesus teaches us the importance of discernment, the value of humility, and the trust we can have in the truth of His words. The verse also emphasizes the inclusivity and accessibility of the Bible's message, which is relevant to a wide range of individuals and not limited to a select few.
