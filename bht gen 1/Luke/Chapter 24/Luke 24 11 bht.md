# Luke 24:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this passage, various accounts and perspectives of the events are presented, emphasizing the diversity of testimonies. The plural usage implies multiple witnesses. Some described these accounts as idle tales, wild talk, or nonsense, doubting their veracity. The disciples, lacking understanding of the fulfillment of Scripture, approached these stories as mere fables and delusions, unaware of the reality of Christ's resurrection.
