# Luke 24:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Their eyes were held back from fully recognizing Jesus. This lack of recognition did not solely involve supernatural intervention, but had plausible explanations that did not require divine intervention. The disciples' inability to recognize Jesus demonstrated the weakness of their senses and the need for divine revelation. Jesus concealed himself in order to reveal himself more fully, allowing for a deeper understanding of his purpose. Our own perspective and disbelief can also hinder our ability to recognize Christ in our lives.

1. "For though Christ remained like himself, he was not recognized, because the eyes of beholders were held; and this takes away all suspicion of a phantom or false imagination."
2. "But hence we learn how great is the weakness of all our senses, since neither eyes nor ears discharge their office, unless so far as power is incessantly communicated to them from heaven."
3. "The proper discrimination between truth and falsehood, therefore, does not arise from the sagacity of our own mind, but comes to us from the Spirit of wisdom."

### Philip Schaff:
