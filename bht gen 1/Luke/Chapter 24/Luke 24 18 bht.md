In this verse, there is surprise and disbelief expressed towards someone who is seemingly unaware of a significant event that had recently occurred in Jerusalem. The emphasis is on the fact that this person must be a foreigner or a stranger to not have heard about it, as it had made great noise and conversation throughout the city. Their lack of knowledge is seen as unusual given the widespread awareness of these events among both residents and visitors.
