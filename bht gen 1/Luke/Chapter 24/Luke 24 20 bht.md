## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Therefore the two disciples were Jews, not Hellenists, as some have supposed."
2. "That 'they say our, not as excluding, but as including the stranger,' as alleged in some former Editions, is not a safe view from the evidently exclusive use of ἡμεῖς in the next verse."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The religious leaders were so blinded by their own self-righteousness and pride that they could not recognize Jesus as the Messiah, even when He stood before them. Their hearts were hardened, and they were more concerned with preserving their own power and authority than seeking the truth."

2. "The false witnesses brought against Jesus were a desperate attempt to find any reason to condemn Him. Yet, their testimonies were inconsistent and contradictory, revealing the weakness of their case. This highlights the injustice and manipulation of the religious leaders in their pursuit to eliminate Jesus."

3. "The high priest's question to Jesus, 'Tell us if you are the Christ, the Son of God,' was a pivotal moment. Jesus' response, 'You have said so,' affirmed His identity as the long-awaited Messiah. This declaration sealed His fate in the eyes of the religious leaders, who saw it as blasphemy and grounds for condemnation."

4. "The religious leaders' mocking and physical abuse of Jesus during His trial demonstrated their utter disregard for His dignity and humanity. Their actions revealed the depths of their hatred and the extent to which they were willing to go to silence Him."
