# Luke 24:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
On this significant day, the disciples, who had placed their trust and hope in Jesus as the promised Redeemer of Israel, found themselves grappling with dashed expectations. Their anticipation of both spiritual and political deliverance had grown faint with each passing moment. Yet, amidst their conflicting emotions of hope and fear, they were now faced with the realization that this was the very day Jesus had foretold of His resurrection. As the disciples tried to reconcile these seemingly disparate pieces, they stood at the precipice of witnessing the fulfillment of a momentous promise, the resurrection of Christ.
