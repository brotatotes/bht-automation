# Luke 24:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The accounts brought by the women astonished and surprised us, leaving us at a loss for words. We find it difficult to believe or disprove what they claim, as it seems almost too incredible to be true. These women, who went early to the tomb to anoint Jesus' body, had no expectation of his resurrection. Their experience at dawn carried a weight of amazement and transformed their understanding of what had occurred.
