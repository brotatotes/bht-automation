# Luke 24:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the narrator describes the interaction between Cleopas, his companion, and the women who had seen the empty tomb. The women report that they had seen Jesus alive and also encountered angels, but Cleopas and his companion found their accounts to be uncertain and indirect. The disciples were hopeful but also skeptical about this news, not knowing how to fully believe or discredit it. Despite the testimony and clear evidence, doubt and perplexity clouded their understanding.
