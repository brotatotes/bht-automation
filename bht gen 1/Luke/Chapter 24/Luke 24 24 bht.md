# Luke 24:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this passage, we encounter a group of disciples who, despite hearing reports from women about the empty tomb and the resurrection of Jesus, go to check it out for themselves. The inclusion of Peter and John in this group highlights their role as witnesses to the resurrection. The disciples, feeling a mixture of hope and sadness, find the tomb just as the women had said, further confirming the truth of the reports. However, despite this evidence, they are left in suspense, unable to fully comprehend and explain what has occurred.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "It is natural, even in accordance with Luke 24:12, that the antithesis to τινές before, and the loose way of speaking to a stranger, who (they believed) was not acquainted with any among them, might cause them here to use τινές, without any reference to Peter being accompanied."
2. "But what wonder, if the reports of such a day of anxiety and confusion were themselves disjointed and confused?"
3. "The loose way of speaking to a stranger, who (they believed) was not acquainted with any among them, might cause them here to use τινές, without any reference to Peter being accompanied."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The inclusion of Peter and John in this group of disciples emphasizes their role as witnesses to the resurrection of Jesus. They were not just bystanders, but active participants in the events that unfolded after Jesus' death." 

2. "John's presence in this group is significant because he was the disciple whom Jesus loved, and his testimony carries weight and credibility. His firsthand account of the empty tomb and the linen cloths provides valuable evidence for the resurrection." 

3. "The fact that Peter and John went to the tomb together shows their unity and shared commitment to seeking the truth. They were not content with hearsay or secondhand information; they wanted to see and experience the reality of Jesus' resurrection for themselves."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Knowing from other sources that John accompanied Peter (John 20:2-10), we have a right to use this verse in explaining Luke 24:12."
2. "The hope that was rekindled was turned to sadness (Luke 24:17), because despite the angelic message, the Lord had not yet appeared."
3. "Possibly then some rumor of it had reached their ears. But even were this the case, they had treated the report as ‘idle talk’ (Luke 24:11)."

### John Gill:
1. "The disciples went to the sepulchre... and found it even so as the women had said." 
2. "The women, as before observed, might report, that though they found not the body in the grave, yet they saw him alive by the way, but so did not the disciples." 
3. "They could not tell how to account for this, and this made them be in suspense about the fact."
