# Luke 24:25 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This verse highlights the lack of understanding and spiritual insight of the disciples. They are reproached for their sluggishness in believing and their failure to grasp the deeper meaning of Christ's resurrection. Their dullness and lack of perception are emphasized as they were slow to comprehend the prophecies and the teachings of Jesus. Their lack of understanding is seen as a weakness and a hindrance to their faith.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The word 'fool'... denotes 'weakness or dulness.' He reproached them for not seeing what he had himself so clearly predicted, and what had been foretold by the prophets."
2. "The word used in the original does not imply as much 'reproach' as the word 'fool' does among us. It was not an expression of 'contempt;' it was an expression denoting merely that they were 'thoughtless,' and that they did not properly 'attend to' the evidence that he must die and rise again."
3. "Slow of heart to believe - Not quick to perceive. Dull of learning. They had suffered their previous opinions and prejudices to prevent their seeing the evidence that he must die and rise from the dead."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Jesus would never have called those sorrowful disciples fools in that sense."
2. "The word is compounded of aj, not, and noew, which implies, besides seeing, perception of the mind as consequent upon sight."
3. "While this rebuke relates to the understanding, the following one, slow of heart, goes deeper, and contemplates the region of feeling and moral susceptibility."

1. "For it ought to be observed, that; what is here said was not confined to these two persons, but, as a reproof of a common fault, was intended to be conveyed by their lips to the rest of their companions."
2. "This hesitation, therefore, he justly attributes to folly, and assigns as the reason of it their carelessness in not having been more ready to believe."
3. "Nor does he only reprove them because, while they had the best Teacher, they were dull and slow to learn, but because they had not attended to the instructions of the Prophets; as if he had said, that their insensibility admitted of no excuse, because it was owing to themselves alone."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Something in Him led them to speak so freely of their perplexity; with a word He might now have turned their sorrow into joy, but He would give them thorough instruction."
2. "He answers, not in a tone of pity, but of rebuke, as one competent to teach them. O foolish men, without understanding, unreceptive intellectually, and slow of heart, sluggish in the entire disposition."
3. "To believe all, etc. They could not have been disciples without believing a part of prophecy, but they would have understood His death and confidently expected His resurrection, if they had believed ‘all.’ Our Lord intimates that the slowness to believe was the ground of the want of understanding."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Foolish men (ανοητο) - without sense (νους), not understanding."

3. "They could only understand part of the prophecies, not all."
