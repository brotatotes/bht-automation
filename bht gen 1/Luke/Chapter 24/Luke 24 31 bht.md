# Luke 24:31 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
After the disciples' eyes were opened and the supernatural cloud was removed, they recognized Jesus and their doubts disappeared. Jesus, in his risen body, swiftly vanished, not through metamorphosis or earthly means, but in a way that highlighted his divine nature and ability to transcend physical limitations. This miraculous disappearance emphasized that Jesus' body was not hidden, but actually removed from their presence, leading them to seek him in the spiritual realm rather than in the confines of the world.
