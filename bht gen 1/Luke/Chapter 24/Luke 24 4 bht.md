# Luke 24:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
At the tomb, two angelic beings in the form of men appeared to the women. Dressed in bright and shining garments, their celestial splendor reflected the glory and majesty of these heavenly messengers. This unexpected and supernatural encounter stirred confusion and astonishment among the women, who had already seen the angels shortly before. These angelic visitors were the first witnesses to the resurrection of Christ, their presence an assurance of the miraculous reality before them.
