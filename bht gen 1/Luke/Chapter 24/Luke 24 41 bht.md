The verse describes a scene where a group of people experience extreme joy upon witnessing a miraculous event. Their joy is described as being unexpected and incomprehensible, causing them to struggle to fully believe what they are seeing. The intensity of their emotions hinders their ability to rationalize and accept the reality before them. At the same time, the verse highlights the physical proof provided to dispel doubts and emphasize the authenticity of the event.
