# Luke 24:47 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Gospel message of repentance, forgiveness, and salvation in Christ extends to all nations, beginning in Jerusalem, the heart of God's kingdom.

This message of mercy, even for the chief of sinners, is proclaimed with the authenticity of being first preached on the very spot where the events took place. It is a reminder of the boundless grace and forgiveness available to all who repent and believe.
