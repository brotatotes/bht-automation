In this Bible verse, the commentators highlight the astonishment expressed by the women at the presence of the living Christ in a place associated with death. The question posed by the angel challenges the idea of seeking the living among the dead, emphasizing Christ's role as the source of life and resurrection. The commentators point out the fear that clouded the women's understanding and kept them from remembering Jesus' prediction of his resurrection. They emphasize that Christ, as the Living One, is to be found among the living and not among the dead or lifeless.
