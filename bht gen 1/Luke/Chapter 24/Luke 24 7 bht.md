# Luke 24:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse being described captures a significant moment after Jesus' betrayal, where He is handed over by Judas to a group of men and officers armed with swords and staves. It is noteworthy that this scene involves sinful men, and yet Jesus willingly puts Himself in their midst. This encounter is seen as necessary, as it aligns with God's decrees and the covenant commitments made by Christ. The gravity of this event is also underscored by angels referencing a specific sentence of Jesus, leading one to wonder why it wasn't fresh in the disciples' memory.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "How remarkable it is to hear angels quoting a whole sentence of Christ's to the disciples." 
2. "Mentioning where it was uttered and wondering why it was not fresh in their memory." 
3. "Doubtless it was in theirs."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The announcements in these passages were made to the Twelve, but Mark 8:0 shows that a wider circle heard them." This quote highlights that the message of Jesus' suffering and resurrection was not limited to just the Twelve disciples, but was also shared with a wider audience.
2. "The angel knew of this." This quote suggests that the angel was aware of the broader dissemination of the message and was referencing it in his statement.
3. "The term 'Son of Man' is here quoted; it is not otherwise applied to Christ after the resurrection." This quote emphasizes that the use of the term "Son of Man" in this context is significant, as it is not commonly used to refer to Jesus after his resurrection.

### John Gill:
1. "He was delivered into the hands of the band of men and officers by Judas, who came against him with swords and staves, as against a thief."
2. "To be among sinners, in the company of such sinful men, must needs be very disagreeable to the holy and harmless Lamb of God."
3. "The words declare, that all these things must be; that there was a necessity of them; partly on account of the decrees of God, by which it was determined they should be; and partly on account of the covenant engagements of Christ, in which he agreed unto them."
