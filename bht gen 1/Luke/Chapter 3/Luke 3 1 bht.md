# Luke 3:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the historical and political context in which Jesus' ministry began is emphasized. The mention of Pontius Pilate, Herod Antipas, Philip, Lysanias, and the high priesthood of Annas and Caiaphas provides a comprehensive view of the rulers and authorities during that time. This highlights the political tensions and power dynamics that Jesus confronted when He began His ministry. Additionally, John the Baptist's appearance marks a significant moment as he reintroduces the prophetic role after centuries of silence. This sets the stage for the "acceptable year of the Lord," a period of divine favor and grace.
