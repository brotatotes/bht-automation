# Luke 3:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In a momentous event after centuries of prophetic silence, John the Baptist began his ministry and baptizing, marking the beginning of the greatest epoch in the history of the Church. With precise attention to detail, Luke mentions the Roman Emperor, the Procurator of Judea, Tetrarchs of Galilee, Iturea, and Trachonitis, and the high-priests of the time. This marks the start of the acceptable year of the Lord, where the clash between political power and religious authority ultimately leads to the crucifixion of Jesus.
