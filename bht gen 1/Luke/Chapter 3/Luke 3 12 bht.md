## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The word 'telonai' refers to tax collectors, who were despised by the Jews because they were seen as collaborators with the Roman oppressors. Jesus' command to love even these outcasts challenges societal norms and calls for a radical transformation of the heart." 

2. "By using the example of tax collectors, Jesus teaches us that love should not be limited to those who are easy to love or who share our beliefs. It is a call to extend love and compassion to all, regardless of their social status or reputation."

3. "Jesus' words remind us that true love goes beyond superficial acts of kindness. It requires us to see the humanity in others, to embrace them with empathy, and to seek their well-being. It is a love that breaks down barriers and fosters unity among all people."

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "The mention of publicans and sinners in this verse highlights Jesus' willingness to associate with those who were considered outcasts and marginalized by society. It shows his compassion and desire to reach out to those who were in need of spiritual healing and redemption."

2. "The Pharisees' criticism of Jesus for eating with sinners reveals their self-righteousness and lack of understanding of God's grace. It serves as a reminder that no one is beyond the reach of God's love and forgiveness, and that we should not judge others based on their past or their current circumstances."

3. "Jesus' response to the Pharisees, 'They that be whole need not a physician, but they that are sick,' emphasizes the purpose of his ministry - to bring healing and salvation to those who recognize their need for it. It challenges us to examine our own hearts and acknowledge our need for spiritual healing and transformation."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "If a Jew could scarcely persuade himself that it was right to pay taxes, how much more heinous a crime must it have been in his eyes to become the questionably honest instrument for collecting them." 
2. "If a publican was hated, how still more intense must have been the disgust entertained against a publican who was also a Jew."
3. "The word 'publican,' as a popular term of reproach, was used even by our Lord."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Publicans. Tax-gatherers." - This highlights the specific group of people referred to in the verse, emphasizing their role as tax collectors.
2. "Their presence is a proof of the power of Johnâ€™s preaching." - This suggests that the fact that tax collectors were present indicates the effectiveness of John's preaching, as it attracted even those considered outcasts or sinners.
3. "See Matthew 5:46." - This reference directs readers to another verse in Matthew, potentially providing additional context or insights related to the role of tax collectors in biblical times.

### John Gill:
1. "Being convinced under John's ministry of the evils of their past life, and desirous of being admitted to baptism, to which they understood repentance, and fruits meet for the same, were pre-requisite."
2. "What shall we do to escape divine vengeance? or what are the particular duties we are to perform?"
3. "The ordinance of baptism requires, as previous to it, a true and hearty repentance."
