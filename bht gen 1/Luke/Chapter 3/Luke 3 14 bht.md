### Albert Barnes:
1. "Do violence ... - Do not take the property of any by unlawful force, or do not use unjust force against the person or property of any individual."
2. "Neither accuse any falsely - It is probable that when they wished the property of others and could not obtain it by violence, or when there was no pretext for violence, they often attempted the same thing in another way, and falsely accused the persons of crime."
3. "By this they were to show that their repentance was genuine; that it had a practical influence; that it produced a real reformation of life; and it is clear that 'no other' repentance would be genuine."

3. "The word had some original connection with figs, and that it came to mean to slander or accuse falsely. From it comes our word sycophant."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Soldiers. Some soldiers. The original refers to those in actual service at the time. They may have had police duty to perform." 
2. "Do violence to no one. The verb first means ‘to shake violently,’ then to oppress, vex, lay under contribution, etc."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Soldiers also (κα στρατευομενο). Men on service, militantes rather than milites (Plummer). So Paul in 2 Timothy 2:4. An old word like στρατιωτης, soldier."
2. "Do violence to no man (μηδενα διασεισητε). Here only in the N.T., but in the LXX and common in ancient Greek. It means to shake (seismic disturbance, earthquake) thoroughly (δια) and so thoroughly to terrify, to extort money or property by intimidating."
3. "Be content with your wages (αρκεισθε τοις οψωνιοις υμων). Discontent with wages was a complaint of mercenary soldiers. This word for wages was originally anything cooked (οψον, cooked food), and bought (from ωνεομα, to buy). Hence, 'rations,' 'pay,' wages."

### John Gill:
1. "John replied, do violence to no man; or 'shake' him, or put him, into bodily fear, by threatening, hectoring, and bullying him, and drawing the sword upon him, which is usual, upon the least offence, for such persons to do."

3. "Be content with your wages; allowed by the government, and do not seek to increase them by any unlawful methods, as by mutiny and sedition, by rebelling against your officers, or by ill usage of the people."
