# Luke 3:15 Commentary Help Text

All men in their hearts were captivated by the thoughts of John, whom some regarded as the long-awaited Christ. They were engrossed in deep contemplation and engaged in serious debates about his identity. John's powerful preaching, his miraculous birth, and the restoration of religion under his influence left them questioning if he truly was the Messiah. The fulfillment of prophecies, the testimonies of Zacharias, Simeon, Anna, and the wise men all contributed to their keen anticipation of the manifestation of the promised Messiah.
