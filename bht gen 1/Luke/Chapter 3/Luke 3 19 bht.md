# Luke 3:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Thoroughgoing was the fidelity of the Baptist to his royal hearer, Herod Antipater, a son of Herod the first and a very wicked man. Strong must have been the workings of conscience in that slave of passion who slew John, the high priest, with many of the wise men of Israel because John reproved him not only for his sin but for all the evils he had done. This Bible verse, inserted here to complete the sketch of John's ministry, reveals the unwavering commitment of John the Baptist and the depravity of Herod's actions.
