# Luke 3:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the tumultuous time of the Bible, when the power and influence of the high priesthood were divided and disputed, we see the emergence of Annas, a figure who held great authority despite his deposition. With his connections and clever tactics, he maneuvered to retain power, acting as a substitute or deputy high priest. This intricate web of political and religious dynamics is weaved throughout the verse, presenting a complex portrayal of leadership and the divine calling affirmed by John the Baptist, who received his mission and baptism from heaven.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Annas, as ex-high-priest, and possibly retaining in the view of the Jews the legitimate high-priesthood, was counted still as having the office: he certainly exercised the power." 
2. "He had influence enough to procure the actual high-priesthood for five of his sons, after his own deposition." 
3. "A substitute, or deputy to the high-priest, appears to have been usual, and Annas would thus be able to evade the Roman appointment and keep the authority."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The former, though deposed, retained much of his influence, and, probably, as sagan or deputy, exercised much of the power of the high priesthood along with Caiaphas."
2. "Both Zadok and Abiathar acted as high priests in David's time, and it seems to have become the fixed practice to have two."
3. "Such formulas, of course, are never used when speaking of Jesus, because the divine nature manifested itself in Him not at certain isolated moments of His life. He was the one everlasting manifestation of the Godhead—THE WORD."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "An impostor does not mention names, and times, and places particularly. If he did, it would be easy to ascertain that he was an impostor."
2. "The sacred writers describe objects and people as if they were perfectly familiar with them. They never appear to be 'guarding' themselves."
3. "If they were 'honest,' then the Christian religion is true."

This quote provides specific examples of the different titles used for John the Baptist in the Gospel of John, Matthew, and Mark, further illustrating the unique perspectives and nuances in the portrayal of John the Baptist in each Gospel.

### John Calvin:
1. "Luke’s narrative indicates such a state of trouble and confusion, that, though there was not more than one person who was actually high priest, the sacred office was torn in pieces by ambition and tyranny."
2. "Hence infer, that there are no regular teachers, but those on whom God has conferred the office; and that it is not enough to have the word of God, if there be not likewise a special calling."
3. "The whole passage is remarkable, and proves that the appointment to the sacred office of high priest was entirely at the disposal of the Roman Governor."

2. "It seems most likely therefore, that he [Annas] was the 'Sagan' of the priests, of which office mention is frequently made, in the Jewish writings... This officer was not a deputy high priest, or one that was substituted to officiate occasionally, in the room of the high priest, but a ruler and governor over other priests."
3. "He [John the Baptist] had lived a solitary life, and had not learnt his doctrine from men, but had his mission, ministry, and baptism, from heaven."
