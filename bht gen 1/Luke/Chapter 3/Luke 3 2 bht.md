# Luke 3:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we see the presence of Annas and Caiaphas, who were both influential high priests. Annas, although deposed, still held significant authority, and was recognized as the legitimate high priest by the Jews. Caiaphas, on the other hand, was the high priest de facto, especially when dealing with Roman authority. The word of God came to John, a figure distinct from Jesus, as indicated by the use of different titles given by the Synoptists. This verse reflects the Old Testament formula for prophetic inspiration, where the word of God is delivered to individuals such as John.
