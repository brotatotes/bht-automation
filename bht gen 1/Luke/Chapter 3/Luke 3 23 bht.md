# Luke 3:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus, at the age of about thirty, began his ministry which was marked by great achievements accomplished within a limited time. Like a servant diligently fulfilling his work, Jesus accomplished his mission before his earthly life ended prematurely. Despite a shortened time on earth, the rewards awaiting him in eternity are abundant.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "If no other proof were in existence of the total independence of the present Gospels of Matthew and Luke, their genealogies would furnish what I conceive to be an undeniable one."
2. "The attempts of many, and recently of Wieseler, to make it appear that the genealogy is that of Mary, reading νἱὸς (ὡς ἐνομ. τοῦ Ἰωσὴφ) τοῦ Ἡλί, ‘the son (as supposed of Joseph, but in reality) of Heli, &c.’ are, as Meyer (Comm. in loc.) has shewn, quite unsuccessful."
3. "With all these elements of confusion, it is quite as presumptuous to pronounce the genealogies discrepant, as it is over-curious and uncritical to attempt to reconcile them."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "At this age the priests entered on their office."
2. "Those who take the latter opinion, that we have here the line of Mary, as in Matthew that of Joseph—here His real, there His reputed line—explain the statement about Joseph, that he was 'the son of Hell,' to mean that he was his son-in-law, as the husband of his daughter Mary."
3. "On comparing the two genealogies, it will be found that Matthew, writing more immediately for Jews, deemed it enough to show that the Saviour was sprung from Abraham and David; whereas Luke, writing more immediately for Gentiles, traces the descent back to Adam, the parent stock of the whole human family, thus showing Him to be the promised 'Seed of the woman.'"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Jesus began to be ... - This was the age at which the priests entered on their office." 

2. "He was not subjected to the Levitical law in regard to the priesthood, and it does not appear that prophets and teachers did not commence their work before that age."

3. "As was supposed - As was commonly thought, or perhaps being legally reckoned as his son."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The phrase 'began to be about thirty years of age' highlights the significance of Jesus' age when he began his ministry. It suggests that Jesus, in his thirties, was at the appropriate age to assume the role of a teacher and leader." 

2. "The phrase 'when he began (to teach) was about thirty years of age' emphasizes the commencement of Jesus' teaching ministry. It implies that Jesus' ministry was not only about performing miracles but also about imparting wisdom and knowledge to his followers." 

3. "Luke's account of Jesus' temptation in the wilderness parallels the narratives in Matthew and Mark. This event serves as a testing ground for Jesus, highlighting his unwavering commitment to God's will and his ability to resist temptation."

### John Calvin:
1. "Baptism was an appendage to the Gospel: and therefore it began at the same time with the preaching of the Gospel."
2. "On account of this mildness of Christ, by which he kindly and gently called, and every day invites, sinners to the hope of salvation, the Holy Spirit descended upon him in the appearance of a dove."
3. "Though he is in himself invisible, yet he is spoken of as beheld, when he exhibits any visible sign of his presence."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The beginning of the ministry could not have been later than U. C. 782 (see Luke 3:1), and probably was two years earlier."
2. "It is remarkable that, in the Talmud, Mary the mother of Jesus is called the daughter of Heli. From whence have Jewish scholars derived this information? If from the text of Luke, this proves that they understood it as we do; if they received it from tradition, it confirms the truth of the genealogical document Luke made use of."
3. "The name of Mary would be unnecessary after Luke’s account of the Nativity. Besides, our Lord was ‘the son of David,’ and that could be true, according to the gospel history, only through His mother."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Jesus Himself (αυτος Ιησους). Emphatic intensive pronoun calling attention to the personality of Jesus at this juncture."
2. "Luke does not commit himself definitely to precisely thirty years as the age of Christ. The Levites entered upon full service at that age, but that proves nothing about Jesus."
3. "If we understand Luke to be giving the real genealogy of Jesus through Mary, the matter is simple enough. The two genealogies differ from Joseph to David except in the cases of Zorobabel and Salathiel."

### John Gill:
1. "Jesus, when he was baptized and began his public ministry, was about thirty years of age: an age at which the priests, under the law, who were typical of Christ, entered on their work." 
2. "Joseph might very rightly be called, as he was supposed to be, the father of Jesus, by a rule which obtains with the Jews that he 'that brings up, and not he that begets, is called the father,' or parent." 
3. "Mary was the daughter of Eli: and so the Jews speak of one Mary, the daughter of Eli, by whom they seem to design the mother of our Lord."

### John Wesley:
1. "Our great Master attained not, as it seems, to the conclusion of his thirty-fourth year. Yet what glorious achievements did he accomplish within those narrow limits of time!"
2. "Happy that servant, who, with any proportionable zeal, despatches the great business of life; and so much the more happy, if his sun go down at noon."
3. "For the space that is taken from the labours of time, shall be added to the rewards of eternity."
