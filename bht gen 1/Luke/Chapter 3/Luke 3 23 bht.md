# Luke 3:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Within a span of years, our great Master began His ministry at a similar age as when priests entered their office. He accomplished remarkable achievements within this limited time. The genealogy of Joseph implies the lineage of Mary, supporting the understanding that Jesus was the son-in-law of Heli, which aligns with Jewish tradition and confirms the accuracy of Luke's genealogical account. Though Jesus's ministry began at a relatively young age, He fulfilled His purpose with great zeal and impact.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "At this age the priests entered on their office." 
2. "Those who take the latter opinion, that we have here the line of Mary, as in Matthew that of Joseph—here His real, there His reputed line—explain the statement about Joseph, that he was 'the son of Hell,' to mean that he was his son-in-law, as the husband of his daughter Mary."
3. "On comparing the two genealogies, it will be found that Matthew, writing more immediately for Jews, deemed it enough to show that the Saviour was sprung from Abraham and David; whereas Luke, writing more immediately for Gentiles, traces the descent back to Adam, the parent stock of the whole human family, thus showing Him to be the promised 'Seed of the woman.'"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Jesus began to be ... - This was the age at which the priests entered on their office." 
2. "It is not evident that Jesus had any reference to that in delaying his work to his thirtieth year." 
3. "He was not subjected to the Levitical law in regard to the priesthood, and it does not appear that prophets and teachers did not commence their work before that age."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The beginning of the ministry could not have been later than U. C. 782 (see Luke 3:1), and probably was two years earlier."
2. "It is remarkable that, in the Talmud, Mary the mother of Jesus is called the daughter of Heli. From whence have Jewish scholars derived this information? If from the text of Luke, this proves that they understood it as we do; if they received it from tradition, it confirms the truth of the genealogical document Luke made use of."
3. "The name of Mary would be unnecessary after Luke’s account of the Nativity. Besides, our Lord was ‘the son of David,’ and that could be true, according to the gospel history, only through His mother."

### John Wesley:
1. "Our great Master attained not, as it seems, to the conclusion of his thirty-fourth year. Yet what glorious achievements did he accomplish within those narrow limits of time!"
2. "Happy that servant, who, with any proportionable zeal, despatches the great business of life; and so much the more happy, if his sun go down at noon."
3. "In the genealogy of Joseph (recited by St. Matthew) that of Mary is implied, the Jews being accustomed to marry into their own families."
