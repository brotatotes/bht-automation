# Luke 3:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, we see the complexities within the genealogies and names that establish the lineage of Jesus. The confusion around the identity of Salathiel and Matthat is evident, as they are referred to as both fathers and sons. However, these complexities serve an important purpose in fulfilling God's promise of a Savior from the line of David. Despite debates among commentators, the presence of these names in various ancient exemplars and versions adds to the rich tapestry of Jewish history and the fulfillment of prophecy.
