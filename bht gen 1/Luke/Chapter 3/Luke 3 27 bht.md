In this passage, two commentators provide insights into the genealogy of Jesus. According to Philip Schaff, the genealogies possibly coincide, highlighting the historical connections between them. On the other hand, John Gill emphasizes that the list of names goes beyond mere lineage, reflecting the faithfulness and sovereignty of God throughout history. Each name represents a story of God's providence and redemption, demonstrating that God's plan of salvation is not limited to a specific family but encompasses all people.
