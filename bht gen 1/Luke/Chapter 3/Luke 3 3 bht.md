# Luke 3:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we encounter John the Baptist in the wilderness, specifically in the area bordering the Jordan River. The baptism he performed was not mere ritual, but rather a powerful symbol of repentance and forgiveness. It represented the cleansing and renewal of the soul, a public declaration of commitment to leave behind an old life and embrace a new life in Christ. Through this baptism, John called upon people to turn away from their sinful ways and prepare their hearts for the coming of Jesus.
