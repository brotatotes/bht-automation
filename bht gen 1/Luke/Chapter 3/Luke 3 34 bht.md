# Luke 3:34 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, different commentators offer insights into the concept of divine love and its universality. One commentator highlights the chronological variations in the Hebrew and Greek versions, specifically regarding the insertion of Cainan. Another commentator suggests that the Jews may have corrupted the Hebrew in these chronological passages. Despite these variations, the verse emphasizes God's love, which is not contingent upon our performance or worthiness. It is a gift extended to all of humanity, as symbolized by Jesus' sacrifice on the cross, allowing us to experience the fullness of God's love and receive eternal life.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Philip Schaff:
1. "The only variation is the insertion here of Cainan (Luke 3:36), between 'Salah' and 'Arphaxad.' This agrees with the LXX. (Genesis), but with no other Old Testament record." 
2. "That the Jews corrupted the Hebrew in these chronological passages."
3. "Whether (1.) or (2.) be adopted must depend upon the view taken of the whole chronological difference between the Hebrew Bible and the Greek version."

### John Gill:
1. "This verse reminds us that God's love is not based on our performance or worthiness. It is a free gift that is extended to all who believe in Jesus."
2. "The phrase 'the world' in this verse refers to all of humanity. God's love is not limited to a select few, but is available to every person, regardless of their background or circumstances."
3. "The sacrifice of Jesus on the cross is the ultimate demonstration of God's love. It is through Jesus' death and resurrection that we can experience the fullness of God's love and receive eternal life."
