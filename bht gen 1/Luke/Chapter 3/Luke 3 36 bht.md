# Luke 3:36 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this passage, there is a discrepancy surrounding the mention of a certain individual named Cainan. While he is not found in the Hebrew text, the LXX version includes his name, causing a debate among scholars. One possibility is that the current Hebrew text has been corrupted in these chronological passages. Another possibility is that the LXX version is incorrect or has been altered. This discrepancy is further supported by the absence of Cainan's name in other versions and in Josephus' writings, leading some to question its authenticity altogether.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "This name does not exist in our present Hebrew text, but in the LXX, Genesis 10:24; Genesis 11:12-13, and furnishes a curious instance of one of two things either (1) the corruption of our present Hebrew text in these chronological passages; or (2) the incorrectness of the LXX."
2. "Lightfoot holds the latter alternative: but I own I think the former more probable."
3. "Certainly it appears not to have existed in the earliest copies of that version."

### John Gill:
1. "This Cainan is not mentioned by Moses in Genesis 11:12 nor has he ever appeared in any Hebrew copy of the Old Testament, nor in the Samaritan version, nor in the Targum; nor is he mentioned by Josephus, nor in 1 Chronicles 1:24 where the genealogy is repeated."
2. "It indeed stands in the present copies of the Septuagint, but was not originally there; and therefore could not be taken by Luke from thence, but seems to be owing to some early negligent transcriber of Luke's Gospel, and since put into the Septuagint to give it authority."
3. "For certain it is, there never was such a Cainan, the son of Arphaxad, for Salah was his son; and with him the next words should be connected."
