## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Marvin Vincent:
1. "He said, the imperfect, and came forth, the present participle; both denoting action in progress, or customary action; so that the sense is, he kept saying, or he used to say to those who were coming out, to the crowds of people which kept pouring out successively."
2. "John's figurative language is altogether the language of the desert. Notice the succession of images: Brood of vipers; fruits (of repentance) the axe at the root of the tree; the slave boy loosing or bearing the sandals; the baptism of fire; the winnowing fan, the threshing floor, the garner, and the burning of the chaff."
3. "Warned. From upo, under, and deiknumi, to shew. Hence, literally, to shew secretly. The word implies a private or confidential hint or reminder."

### John Calvin:
1. "Though the persons whom John reproved were few in number, his design was to strike terror on all; as Paul enjoins us to regard it as the advantage of public rebukes, 'that others also may fear.'" 
2. "It is probable, therefore, that John publicly attacked the Pharisees, for the benefit of the whole church of God, that they might no longer dazzle the eyes of simple men by empty show, or hold the body of the people under oppression by wicked tyranny."
3. "If John, the organ of the Holy Spirit, employed such severity of language in his opening address to those who voluntarily came to be baptized, and to make a public profession of the gospel; how ought we now to act towards the avowed enemies of Christ, who not only reject obstinately all that belongs to sound doctrine, but whose efforts to extinguish the name of Christ are violently maintained by fire and sword?"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The present participle also notes the repetition of the crowds as does ελεγεν (imperfect), he used to say."
2. "John's metaphors are from the wilderness (vipers, fruits, axe, slave boy loosing sandals, fire, fan, thrashing-floor, garner, chaff, stones)."
3. "The verb is like our 'suggest' by proof to eye, ear, or brain (Luke 6:47; Luke 12:5; Acts 9:16; Acts 20:35; Matthew 3:7)."

### John Gill:
1. "John's words to the Pharisees and Sadducees reveal his boldness and uncompromising nature, as he addresses them as a 'generation of vipers.'" 

2. "By calling them a 'generation of vipers,' John highlights their deceitful and venomous nature, exposing their hypocrisy and lack of genuine repentance." 

3. "John questions their motives, asking who has warned them to flee from the impending wrath. This challenges their sincerity and forces them to examine their true intentions in seeking baptism."
