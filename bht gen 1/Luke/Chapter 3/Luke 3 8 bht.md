# Luke 3:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we are called to bear fruits that truly reflect our repentance, showing that it is genuine and not just words. It reminds us that our ancestral lineage or external privileges do not guarantee our relationship with God, as He can raise up children from unexpected sources. We are urged not to rely on our membership in the visible Church or any external advantages, but to undergo a sincere change of heart, as God requires, without delay.
