# Luke 4:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the Spirit is not only the driving force behind Jesus' actions, but it also serves as the guiding presence throughout His time in the wilderness. Filled with the Holy Spirit, Jesus engages in a spiritual battle armed with the Word of God. The wilderness, a desolate and dangerous place, becomes the backdrop for Jesus' solitude, where His reliance on the Spirit and fasting for spiritual purposes prepares Him for His ultimate ministry.
