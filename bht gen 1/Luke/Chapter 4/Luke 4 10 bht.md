## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The addition of ἐν πάσαις ταῖς ὁδοῖς σου in the LXX emphasizes the comprehensive nature of God's guidance, indicating that it extends to all aspects of life and all paths we may take."

### John Gill:
1. "Satan, in citing this text, has left out the middle clause, 'to keep thee in all thy ways,' which he knew was against him, and has only taken that which made for him." 

2. "Supposing the clause omitted was added, he asks of what advantage it would be? since the two verses being connected together as they are, the sense with respect to God's providence and preservation, is clear enough and complete." 

3. "It appears that Satan failed not, neither in the manner of citing it, nor in the application of it to Christ; but by wresting it to a wicked purpose, to countenance an action unwarrantable and criminal, being a tempting God."
