# Luke 4:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, we see Jesus returning to His hometown, where He had been brought up and known by the residents. As was His custom, He went to the synagogue on the Sabbath day. The synagogue allowed not only rabbis but also respected teachers, like Jesus, to address the congregation. Standing up to read, He demonstrated His authority and respect for the Word of God. This visit occurred early in His ministry, before His wider reputation was established.
