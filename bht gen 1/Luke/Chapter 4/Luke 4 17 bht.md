# Luke 4:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this passage, as the commentators suggest, the finding of the book was not a coincidence or accident. Instead, it was a fortuitous discovery guided by divine intervention. The unrolling of the scroll was deliberate, and the reader's eyes fell upon the destined passage through God's providential guidance. This narrative highlights God's hand at work, for no human calculations or timing can explain this remarkable and intentional encounter with His Word.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The roll containing that book (probably, that alone) was given to the Lord."
2. "But it does not appear that He read any part of the lesson for the day; but when He had unrolled the scroll, found (the fortuitous, i.e. providential, finding is the most likely interpretation, not the searching for and finding) the passage which follows."
3. "No inference can be drawn as to the time of the year from this narrative; partly on account of the uncertainty above mentioned, and partly because it is not quite clear whether the roll contained only Isaiah, or other books also."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The reading of the Law had already taken place, and that from the Prophets was to begin." 
2. "When He unrolled the book, His eye fell, accidentally some would say, providentially we say, upon this passage."
3. "All calculations as to the time of year, based on the reading of this part of Isaiah, are therefore excluded."

### John Wesley:
1. "He found" - This phrase suggests that the discovery was not a result of chance or luck, but rather a divine intervention or guidance.
2. "Opening upon it" - This implies that the finding was not accidental, but rather a deliberate revelation from God.
3. "By the particular providence of God" - This phrase emphasizes the belief that God's specific and intentional intervention led to the discovery.
