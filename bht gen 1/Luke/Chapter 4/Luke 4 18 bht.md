# Luke 4:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, the commentator points out that Jesus deliberately chooses a specific passage to announce the essence of His mission, highlighting His divine character and special endowments. It is suggested that this selection was appropriate for Jesus' ministry at that early stage. Additionally, the commentator emphasizes the anointing of Jesus with the Spirit and the interwoven doctrine of the Trinity in unexpected scriptures. The verse seems to draw a parallel between the spiritual state of humanity and the miserable captivity of those who are blind and burdened with chains.
