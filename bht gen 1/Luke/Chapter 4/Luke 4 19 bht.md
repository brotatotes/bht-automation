# Luke 4:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Bible verse being described is a reference to the acceptable year of the Lord, a period of time in which God shows His grace and favor. This concept is reminiscent of the year of jubilee in the Old Testament, which represents a time of restoration, freedom, and liberation. During this acceptable year, Christ proclaims Himself as the healer of all maladies, announcing the blessings and proclaiming liberty to all. It is a time when God's goodwill and pleasure are revealed through the redemption of His people.
