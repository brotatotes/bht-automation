# Luke 4:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, commentators discuss the expectations and reproach faced by Jesus in his hometown of Nazareth. He is urged to heal there, "as presently interpreted," but faced skepticism as his miracles were performed elsewhere. The commentators note the significance of his choice to reside in Capernaum, causing offense in Nazareth. Their rejection stems from both local pride and disbelief, prompting Jesus to highlight their lack of faith. The verse conveys the challenge Jesus faced in gaining acceptance from his own people and the need for them to prioritize their trust in him.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Exert thy powers of healing in thine own country, as presently interpreted; the Physician being represented as an inhabitant of Nazareth."
2. "The reproach was repeated under the Cross, with a strictly individual application."
3. "Whether we read ἐν or εἰς, the preposition is equally local in its signification, in Capernaum, not 'in the case of Capernaum,' or 'to Capernaum.'"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Charity begins at home."
2. "Strange rumors have reached our ears of Thy doings at Capernaum but if such power resides in Thee to cure the ills of humanity, why has none of it yet come nearer home, and why is all this alleged power reserved for strangers?"
3. "His choice of Capernaum as a place of residence since entering on public life was, it seems, already well known at Nazareth; and when He did come thither, to give no displays of His power when distant places were ringing with His fame, wounded their pride."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Suppose that a man should attempt to heal another when he was himself diseased in the same manner; it would be natural to ask him first to cure himself, and thus to render it manifest that he was worthy of confidence."
2. "You profess to be the Messiah. You have performed miracles at Capernaum. You profess to be able to deliver us from our maladies, our sins, our afflictions. Show that you have the power, that you are worthy of our confidence, by working miracles here."
3. "It does not refer, therefore, to any purification of his own, or imply any reflection on him for setting up to teach them. It was only a demand that he would show the proper evidence 'by miracles' why they should trust in him."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Surely [παντως] . Lit., by all means. Rev., doubtless."

### John Calvin:
1. "From the words of Christ it may be easily inferred, that he was treated with contempt by the inhabitants of Nazareth."
2. "He afterwards imputes to them the blame of his declining to work miracles among them, and charges them with malice, in bestowing no honor on a prophet of God."
3. "The objection, which he anticipates, is this: 'There is no reason to wonder, if his countrymen hold him in little estimation, since he does not dignify his own country, as he does other places, by working miracles; and, consequently, it is but a just revenge, if his own countrymen, whom he treats with less respect than all others, are found to reject him.'"

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The tone throughout is that of reproof."
2. "Luke, the physician, presents Christ as the Physician; our Lord implies that this is His office."
