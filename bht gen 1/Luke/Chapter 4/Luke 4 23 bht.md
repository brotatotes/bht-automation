# Luke 4:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, commentators mention the theme of starting with charity at home before extending it to others, questioning why Jesus performed miracles elsewhere and not in His hometown, and the concept of Jesus being a physician and the need for self-healing. There is a tone of reproof and questioning the disbelief of the people. In this context, the commentators address the importance of overcoming prejudices and recognizing the power and capabilities of Jesus, urging the people to seek healing and love closer to home.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Charity begins at home."
2. "Strange rumors have reached our ears of Thy doings at Capernaum but if such power resides in Thee to cure the ills of humanity, why has none of it yet come nearer home, and why is all this alleged power reserved for strangers?"
3. "His choice of Capernaum as a place of residence since entering on public life was, it seems, already well known at Nazareth; and when He did come thither, to give no displays of His power when distant places were ringing with His fame, wounded their pride."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Doubtless ye will say. This reply is based upon something deeper than the question of Luke 4:22. The tone throughout is that of reproof."
2. "Physician. Luke, the physician, presents Christ as the Physician; our Lord implies that this is His office."
3. "Heal thyself. Help thine own countrymen, who are naturally nearest to thee. Others paraphrase it: If thou wilt be a helper of others (physician), help thyself from the want of respect and esteem among us, by working miracles here as thou hast done in Capernaum. The former seems the more natural explanation."

### John Wesley:
1. "Your approbation now outweighs your prejudices."
2. "You will soon ask, why my love does not begin at home?"
3. "It is because of your unbelief."
