# Luke 4:26 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we see a remarkable display of God's sovereignty and provision. The mention of Sarepta, or Zarephath, between Tyre and Sidon, emphasizes that God's favor is not bound by geography or nationality. Just as He cared for a gentile widow during a time of famine, God extends His grace to all, sometimes choosing those least expected. This speaks to the divine pattern of God's working, reminding us not to be surprised when He acts in unexpected ways.

1. "Save . . . saving" - This phrase emphasizes the exclusivity of the salvation offered by God. It implies that there is no other way to be saved except through Him. (Quote 1)
2. "Sarepta—'Zarephath'" - This reference to the Old Testament story of Elijah and the widow of Zarephath highlights the fact that God's grace extends beyond the boundaries of Israel. He shows mercy and provides for those who are outside of His chosen people. (Quote 2)
3. "A heathen village between Tyre and Sidon" - This detail reveals that God's plan of salvation is not limited to a specific geographical location or a particular group of people. He reaches out to all nations and desires to bring them into His fold. (Quote 3)

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Zarephath, now called 'Surafend,' was a large inland village between Tyre and Sidon. The ancient city was likely on the coast and belonged to the territory of Sidon, hence, in the land of Sidon." 

2. "The mention of Zarephath in Luke 4:26 reminds us of the story in 1 Kings 17:9, where the prophet Elijah was sent to a widow in Zarephath during a time of famine. This connection highlights the theme of God's provision and care for His people, even in the midst of difficult circumstances." 

3. "The fact that Jesus references Zarephath in his teaching suggests that he is drawing on the example of God's faithfulness in the past to encourage his listeners to trust in God's provision and care for them in the present."

### John Gill:
1. "God bestows his favours on persons in a sovereign way, and sometimes upon the most unlikely."
2. "In a time of famine, he overlooked the poor widows in Israel, his peculiar people, and sent his prophet to a Gentile woman in one of the cities of Sidon."
3. "They should cease to wonder if he wrought his miracles in other places, and not in his own country; since this was agreeable to the divine procedure in other cases."
