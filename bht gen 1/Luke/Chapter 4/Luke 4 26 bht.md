# Luke 4:26 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Between the cities of Tyre and Sidon lies the village of Zarephath, known today as Surafend. This coastal town, once a significant location, was home to a widow who was a woman of non-Jewish descent. In a time of famine, God chose this unlikely recipient for His favor, surpassing the needs of the widows in Israel. This pattern of divine sovereignty, seen in the life of the prophet Elijah, reminds us that God's blessings are not limited by geographical boundaries or societal expectations.
