# Luke 4:27 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In these verses, we see parallelism between the miracles of the Syro-Phoenician woman and the ruler's son at Capernaum, and those of Elijah, Elisha, and the healing of the leper by Jesus. These stories emphasize the power of faith, the willingness of Jesus to respond to those who believe, and His ability to heal the outcasts. They highlight the social stigma and isolation faced by lepers, as well as the pitiable condition they lived in. Ultimately, these accounts demonstrate God's power to bring healing, restoration, and spiritual transformation to those in desperate need.

### John Gill:
1. "The leprosy was a disease very common among the Jews; hence those laws concerning it in Leviticus 13:1."
2. "It seems by this account, that it was very prevalent in the time of Eliseus the prophet."
3. "None of them was cleansed from their leprosy, by any direction of the prophet, saving Naaman, the Syrian."

### John Wesley:
1. "The healing of Naaman's leprosy is a powerful reminder that God's ways are not our ways. Naaman, a powerful and respected commander, expected a grand gesture from Elisha, but instead, he was instructed to simply wash in the Jordan River seven times. This highlights the importance of humility and obedience in our relationship with God."

2. "Naaman's initial reluctance to follow Elisha's instructions reflects our own tendency to question God's methods. However, when Naaman finally humbled himself and obeyed, he experienced a miraculous healing. This teaches us the importance of surrendering our own expectations and trusting in God's wisdom and guidance."

3. "The significance of Naaman's healing lies not only in the physical restoration but also in the spiritual transformation that took place. Through this encounter, Naaman came to recognize the power and sovereignty of the God of Israel. It serves as a reminder that God's miracles are not just about physical healing, but also about bringing people closer to Him and revealing His glory."
