# Luke 4:29 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the midst of a tumultuous synagogue service, the people rose up in great wrath and forcefully expelled Jesus, as if he were a criminal deserving of death. They led Him outside the city, intending to inflict the severest punishment upon Him. This violent reaction of the crowd mirrored the chaotic nature of their actions, disregarding proper protocol and displaying their strong rejection of Jesus. Such was the response Jesus received for daring to challenge the beliefs and traditions of the religious authorities.
