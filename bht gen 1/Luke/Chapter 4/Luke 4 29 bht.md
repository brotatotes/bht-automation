# Luke 4:29 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we see intense hostility towards Jesus as the people in the synagogue react with great wrath and anger, rushing out of the service to forcefully expel Him. Their intentions were severe, aiming to throw Him down headlong and break Him to pieces, reminiscent of the brutal actions of the Edomites towards the Jews. This violent reaction lacked any regard for the sacredness of the place, the worship, or the sanctity of the Sabbath.
