# Luke 4:31 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse described in these commentaries captures a significant moment in Jesus' ministry as he intentionally leaves Nazareth and settles in Capernaum. Capernaum, a bustling fishing village by the Sea of Galilee, becomes the new headquarters for Jesus' ministry. This decision signifies Jesus' commitment to reaching out to people from diverse backgrounds and his authority over the spiritual realm. It also represents a shift from the old covenant to the new covenant, as Jesus brings fresh revelation and a new way of experiencing God's presence. In Capernaum, Jesus teaches, heals, and demonstrates his compassion for those in need.
