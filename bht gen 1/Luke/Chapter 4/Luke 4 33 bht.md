# Luke 4:33 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this passage, a man is described as being possessed by an unclean devil. This highlights the impurity and evil nature of the spirit, emphasizing the spiritual battle between good and evil. The demon's presence not only harms the man physically, but also influences his mind and imposes upon the people. The mention of the Sabbath day adds to the significance of this encounter, as the demon is defying the holiness associated with it. The man's loud cry in the presence of Jesus demonstrates his power and authority over the forces of darkness.

1. "The frequency with which this character of impurity is applied to evil spirits is worthy of notice."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "A spirit of an unclean devil" - Luke's use of the term "unclean devil" emphasizes the impurity and evil nature of the spirit possessing the man. It highlights the spiritual battle between good and evil that is at play in this passage.

2. "Where the rendering should be demon" - The commentary suggests that the term "demon" is a more accurate translation than "devil" in this context. This distinction helps to clarify the nature of the spirit as a malevolent supernatural being rather than the ultimate embodiment of evil.

3. "This is the only case in which Luke adds... the epithet unclean" - Luke's specific choice to describe the demon as "unclean" further underscores its impurity and defilement. It suggests that the presence of this spirit is not only harmful but also spiritually contaminating.

2. "And this was on the sabbath day; whereas the Jews say that 'Satan and the evil demon flee on the sabbath day to the mountains of darkness, and do not appear all the sabbath day, because that day is holy, and they are unclean.'"
