### Marvin Vincent:
1. "A spirit of an unclean devil" - Luke's choice of words, specifically adding the epithet "unclean" to the term "devil," emphasizes the impurity and malevolence of the spirit. 

2. "Where the rendering should be demon" - The commentary suggests that the term "demon" is a more accurate translation for the Greek word used here, highlighting the spiritual nature of the entity possessing the person. 

3. "This is the only case in which Luke adds...the epithet unclean" - Luke's deliberate inclusion of the word "unclean" implies that not all demons are necessarily unclean, suggesting a distinction between different types of evil spirits.

### John Calvin:
1. "This mode of expression, which Luke employs, conveys the idea, that the man was driven by the impulse of the devil."
2. "By the permission of God, Satan had seized the faculties of his soul in such a manner, as to drive him not only to speak, but to perform other movements, at his pleasure."
3. "The title, Holy One of God, was probably taken from a manner of speaking, which was, at that time, in ordinary and general use."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Luke's Gospel uses δαιμονιον twenty-two times and ακαθαρτον as an epithet, once of δαιμονιον as here and once of πνευμα."
2. "In Mark the man is in (εν) the power of the unclean spirit, while here the man 'has' a spirit of an unclean demon."
3. "With a loud voice (φωνη μεγαλη). Not in Mark. Really a scream caused by the sudden contact of the demon with Jesus."

### John Gill:
1. "The man in the synagogue was not only physically afflicted but also spiritually oppressed, as he had a spirit of an unclean devil. This emphasizes the power of evil and the need for divine intervention."
