In this verse, Jesus demonstrates His authority and power over the spiritual realm by rebuking an unclean spirit that had convulsed a man.

The event serves as a reminder of the ongoing battle between good and evil, where Jesus emerges victorious, delivering people from the bondage of evil forces with His ability to fling and hurl them away.
