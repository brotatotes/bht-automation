2. "This healing also highlights the importance of service and hospitality. After being healed, Peter's mother-in-law immediately begins to serve Jesus and his disciples. It is a reminder that when we experience the healing power of Jesus in our lives, we are called to use our restored health and strength to serve others."

3. "The fact that Jesus touched Peter's mother-in-law to heal her is significant. In Jewish culture, touching someone who was sick or unclean would make a person ceremonially unclean. But Jesus, as the Son of God, is not bound by these cultural norms. His touch brings healing and restoration, breaking through societal barriers and showing his divine authority."
