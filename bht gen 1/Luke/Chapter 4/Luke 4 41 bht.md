# Luke 4:41 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this biblical verse, the act of speaking is emphasized, as well as the intention behind it - to convey knowledge or understanding. The demoniac's inarticulate cries and the articulate utterances of those who acknowledged Jesus as the Son of God and the true Messiah are highlighted. Jesus, consistently refusing testimony from demons, rebuked them and did not allow them to speak, showing his authority and the fact that he did not rely on their recognition of him.
