# Luke 4:41 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the emphasis is on the disciples' ability to speak rather than merely claim knowledge, as stated by Henry Alford. The knowledge they possess is not only theoretical but also practical and experiential. However, they are not willing to speak of it, as John Gill suggests, because Jesus rebukes them and does not desire their testimony. As Jamieson Fausset Brown points out, Jesus always refused the testimony of devils as it would associate Him with His enemies. Despite being sought out and entreated to stay, Jesus declines, recognizing the urgency of His work.
