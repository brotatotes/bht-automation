# Luke 4:44 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, Jesus is depicted as actively engaging with the Jewish community by preaching in the synagogues of Galilee. This deliberate choice demonstrates his intention to bring his message directly to the people, rather than expecting them to seek him out. By utilizing the established religious institutions, Jesus shows respect for tradition and uses it as a platform to challenge and teach. The synagogues of Galilee serve as more than just places of worship; they are central gathering spots where Jesus connects with people on a personal level, building relationships and fostering familiarity.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The reading τῆς Ἰουδαίας must, on any intelligible critical principles, be adopted; and Tregelles can hardly be acquitted of inconsistency with his own usual practice, in rejecting it."
2. "The three Evangelists relate no ministry in Judæa, with this single exception. And our narrative is thus brought into the most startling discrepancy with that of St. Mark, in which unquestionably the same portion of the sacred history is related."
3. "Still, these are considerations which must not weigh in the least degree with the critic. It is his province simply to track out what is the sacred text, not what, in his own feeble and partial judgment, it ought to have been."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "One must fill in details, though Mark 1:39 and Matthew 8:23-25 tell of the mass of work done on this campaign."
2. "Periphrastic imperfect active, describing his first tour of Galilee in accord with the purpose just stated."
3. "Was preaching (ην κηρυσσων)."

Note: The commentary provided is quite brief, so the quotes are also brief.

### John Gill:
1. "Preaching in the synagogues of Galilee allowed Jesus to reach a wide audience, as these synagogues were central gathering places for the Jewish community. It shows his intention to bring his message to the people where they were, rather than waiting for them to come to him." 

2. "By preaching in the synagogues, Jesus demonstrated his respect for the established religious institutions of his time. He engaged with the existing structures and traditions, using them as a platform to share his teachings and challenge the prevailing religious beliefs." 

3. "The synagogues of Galilee served as a hub for spiritual and communal life, making them an ideal setting for Jesus to connect with people on a personal level. His presence in these synagogues allowed him to establish relationships, build trust, and create a sense of familiarity among the local communities."
