# Luke 4:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, the temptation of Jesus is described. The order in Matthew is adhered to, with this temptation placed last. The verse portrays a moment of time in which Jesus is shown all the kingdoms of the world, possibly through a supernatural extension of vision. This panoramic view is not a physical representation, but rather a mental feat of imagination. The verse also highlights the inversion of the order of being taken to the mountain and then to Jerusalem, as it is considered more natural.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The order in Matthew, in which this temptation is placed last, is to be adhered to in our expositions of the Temptation."
2. "No definite notes of succession are given in our text, but they are by Matthew."
3. "The inversion has been made as suiting better the requirements of probability: it seeming more natural that our Lord should be first taken to the mountain and then to Jerusalem, than the converse."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "In a moment of time [εν στιγμη χρονου]. Peculiar to Luke. Stigmh is literally a mark made by a pointed instrument, a dot: hence a point of time." 

2. "Stigmh is literally a mark made by a pointed instrument, a dot: hence a point of time." 

3. "Tynd., in the twinkling of an eye."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "No definite mark of time, hence we think this temptation was the third (as in Matthew)."
2. "The words: 'into' a high mountain, are to be omitted."
3. "A supernatural extension of vision is possibly implied."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The inhabited world. In Matthew 4:8 it is του κοσμου." 
2. "This panorama of all the kingdoms of the world and the glory of them in a moment of time was mental, a great feat of the imagination." 
3. "This second temptation in Luke is the third in Matthew's order. Luke's order is geographical (wilderness, mountain, Jerusalem). Matthew's is climacteric (hunger, nervous dread, ambition)."

### John Gill:
1. "The devil showed unto him all the kingdoms of the world...which he represented to Christ, not in a map, since the glory of them could not be described in that way." 

2. "This was a mere phantasm, a deception of the sight, with which he endeavored to impose on Christ, but could not." 

3. "Nor did Christ...need any representation of the kingdoms of the world from him."
