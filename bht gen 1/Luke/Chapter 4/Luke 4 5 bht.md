# Luke 4:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, Jesus is faced with a series of temptations. According to Henry Alford, the order of the temptations as presented in Matthew should be followed in our interpretation. Philip Schaff suggests that this particular temptation was likely the third one. John Gill adds that when Satan showed Jesus all the kingdoms of the world, it was not with a physical representation but rather a deceptive illusion. These insights help us see that the temptations Jesus faced were not only real but also involved both physical and supernatural elements.

### John Gill:

2. "For this a mountain was no more a proper place, than any other; nor was it any real object he presented to his bodily sight, or any real prospect he gave him of the kingdoms of the world."

3. "But this was a mere phantasm, a deception of the sight, with which he endeavored to impose on Christ, but could not; nor did Christ, who is the maker of the world, and the governor among the nations, need any representation of the kingdoms of the world from him."
