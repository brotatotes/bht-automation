# Luke 4:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, there is a clear distinction between a good angel and a fallen angel, as pointed out by John Gill. A good angel would never allow themselves to be worshipped by humans, instead they guide people towards the worship of God alone. However, the fallen angel, like Satan, sought to be worshipped and craved divine reverence. Gill expresses his strong disapproval of this audacious and arrogant desire for worship, highlighting the severe impudence and insolence displayed by such actions.
