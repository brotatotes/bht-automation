# Luke 5:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus called his disciples to follow Him and become fishers of men, signifying a radical change in their purpose. This call is not just to be followers of Jesus, but to actively participate in His mission by sharing the good news and seeking the lost. The imagery of fishing reminds believers that it requires effort, skill, and perseverance to cast the net of the gospel into the world. Being fishers of men is an ongoing commitment, involving a passion for seeing people come to know Jesus and a willingness to go outside of our comfort zones.

2. "The plain lying between Capernaum and Tiberias is said to be a little longer than thirty, and not quite twenty furlongs in breadth. It is described as being, in his time, universally fertile."

1. "Jesus called them to follow Him, not just to be His disciples, but to become fishers of men. This implies a radical change in their identity and purpose.
