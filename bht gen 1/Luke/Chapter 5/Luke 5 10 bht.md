# Luke 5:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the disciples are filled with awe and fear as they witness a miraculous catch of fish. Jesus calms their fears and assures them that they will now embark on a new chapter of their journey with Him. They are called to be fishers of men, spreading the gospel and bringing people out of the depths of sin and into the path of salvation. The overwhelming abundance of the fish they catch is a foreshadowing of the countless souls they will help bring to Jesus.
