### John Gill:
1. "Between this disease and sin, there is a very great likeness... all mankind, by reason of sin, are by the Lord pronounced filthy; and by their evil actions, not only defile themselves, but others."
2. "Sin has spread itself over all mankind, and over all the powers and faculties of the soul, and members of the body; there is no place free of it."
3. "Christ only, by his blood and stripes, heals the disease of sin, and cleanses from it."

### John Wesley:
1. "The leper's request is a powerful expression of faith and humility. He recognizes Jesus' authority and power to heal, and he acknowledges his own unworthiness by saying, 'If you are willing.' This demonstrates a deep understanding of Jesus' character and the nature of his ministry."

2. "Jesus' response to the leper is filled with compassion and love. He not only touches the man, which was considered taboo for someone with leprosy, but he also declares his willingness to heal him. This act of physical touch and verbal affirmation reveals Jesus' desire to restore not only the leper's physical health but also his social and emotional well-being."

3. "The significance of Jesus' command to the leper to go and show himself to the priest cannot be overlooked. This was a necessary step for the leper to be declared clean and reintegrated into society. By instructing him to go to the priest, Jesus is not only affirming the importance of following the religious laws but also demonstrating his authority over the religious system."

4. "The healing of the leper serves as a powerful example of Jesus' ministry of restoration. Not only does he heal the physical ailment, but he also restores the leper's dignity, social standing, and relationship with God. This miracle points to Jesus as the ultimate source of healing and restoration for all who come to him in faith."
