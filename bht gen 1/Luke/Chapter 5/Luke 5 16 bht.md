# Luke 5:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this passage, Jesus retreats to a deserted place, seeking rest from his tireless ministry of preaching and healing. Alone in solitude, he prays privately to God, fulfilling his own humanity and seeking divine guidance. His withdrawal serves as a deliberate example, not out of weakness, but as an invitation for all to prioritize their personal communion with God, away from the distractions and demands of the world.
