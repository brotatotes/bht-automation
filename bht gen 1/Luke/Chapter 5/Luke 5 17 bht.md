# Luke 5:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this passage, we see Jesus in Capernaum, where a great crowd has gathered to listen to his teaching and witness his miraculous healings. The religious leaders, the Pharisees and teachers of the law, are present, observing his actions and looking for opportunities to criticize him. However, it is the multitude, both those who came to hear his teachings and the sick who sought healing, who experience the power of the Lord. Jesus, being filled with divine authority and compassion, not only offers physical healing but also extends his power to heal the sickness of their souls.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The power of God (working in the Lord Jesus) was in the direction of His healing: i.e. wrought so that He exercised the powers of healing." 
2. "Luke uses κύριος frequently for Jesus, but always with the article...whence we conclude that the meaning is, the power of God (working in the Lord Jesus) was in the direction of His healing."
3. "So uncertain are merely subjective considerations either way: and so necessary is it to adhere in such cases, where any uncertainty exists, simply and faithfully to antiquity, as our best existing guide."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The Pharisees and doctors sitting by" - This indicates the increasing influence and attention that Jesus was gaining, causing the religious leaders to take notice and feel the need to make a judgment about Him.

2. "The power of the Lord present" - This highlights the divine authority and presence of Jesus, suggesting that His ability to heal was not merely a human skill but a manifestation of God's power.

3. "To heal them—the sick people" - This emphasizes Jesus' compassion and willingness to heal those who were suffering, showing His concern for the physical and emotional well-being of others.

1. "The pronoun has a slightly emphatic force: he as distinguished from the Pharisees and teachers of the law."
2. "The element of teaching is emphasized, probably in intentional contrast with Christ's teaching."

Note: The commentary provided is quite fragmented and lacks coherence. It would be helpful to have a more complete and cohesive commentary to extract meaningful quotes.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Pharisees and teachers of the law. Peculiar to Luke; but the other Evangelists speak of the ‘scribes’ as objecting."
2. "From all parts, not necessarily from each and every village."
3. "And the power of the Lord was with him to heal."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Luke sometimes has αυτος in the nominative as unemphatic 'he' as here, not 'he himself.'" 
2. "These 'teachers of the law' are called elsewhere in the Gospels 'scribes' (γραμματεις) as in Matthew and Mark."
3. "One must bear in mind that John 4:1-4 shows that Jesus had already left Jerusalem and Judea because of the jealousy of the Pharisees."

### John Gill:
1. "When he was at Capernaum, as appears from Mark 2:1As he was teaching: in the house where such numbers were gathered together, to hear the word of God preached by him, that there was not room for them, neither within the house, nor about the door." 

2. "Having heard much of his doctrine and miracles, they came from all parts to watch and observe him, and to take all opportunities and advantages against him, that they might expose him to the people."

3. "The power of the Lord was present to heal them; not the Pharisees and doctors of the law, who did not come to be healed by him, either in body or mind; but the multitude, some of whom came to hear his doctrine, and others to be healed of their infirmities."

### John Wesley:
1. "Sitting by - As being more honourable than the bulk of the congregation, who stood." 
2. "And the power of the Lord was present to heal them - To heal the sickness of their souls, as well as all bodily diseases."
