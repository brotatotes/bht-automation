# Luke 5:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
On the shores of the lake, the fishermen, having completed their toil, were washing their nets that had accumulated dirt and filth from a fruitless night of fishing. Their small boats, drawn up on the beach, stood empty, awaiting their return. Their spirits were dampened, as previous attempts had proved futile. Little did they know that their despair would soon be transformed into astonishment, as they were about to witness a miraculous event that would forever alter their lives.

1. "The fishermen were gone out of them; that is, either the above persons, or their servants." This quote highlights the absence of the fishermen from their boats, setting the stage for the miraculous event to come.
