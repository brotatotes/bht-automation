# Luke 5:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
By the lake, fishermen stood by their boats, washing their nets after a night of toil. The ships they used were likely small fishing-boats without decks, easily drawn up on the beach. Though they had gathered much soil and filthiness, their efforts had been in vain. This scene underscores the need for patience, persistence, and obedience in our work, highlighting that sometimes the desired outcome may not be immediate, but will come in due time.
