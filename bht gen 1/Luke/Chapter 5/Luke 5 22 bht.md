# Luke 5:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, Jesus astounds the scribes with his claim to have the authority to forgive sins, which was perceived as a divine prerogative. This challenges their understanding of God's power and their own role in mediating forgiveness. Jesus, fully aware of their thoughts, confronts them to expose the wickedness concealed within their hearts, thereby revealing his divine authority as the Son of God. This highlights Jesus' omniscience, his ability to discern the motives of the heart, and his desire to confront and expose hidden evil.
