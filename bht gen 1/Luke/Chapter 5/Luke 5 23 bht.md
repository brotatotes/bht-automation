The purpose of the question posed in this verse is seen as a way for the speaker to prove their divinity and refute accusations of blasphemy.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### John Gill:
1. "Neither of them could be said by a mere man, with effect, so as that sins would be really remitted on so saying; or that a man sick of a palsy, by such a word speaking, would be able to stand upon his feet and walk."
2. "Both of them were equally easy to him, that is truly God; and he that could say the one effectually, could also say the other."
3. "Our Lord meant, by putting this question, and acting upon it, to prove himself to be God, and to remove the imputation of blasphemy from him."
