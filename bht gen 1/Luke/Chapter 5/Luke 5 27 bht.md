# Luke 5:27 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, Jesus is depicted as intentionally observing and attentively looking upon a situation, going beyond a casual glance. He not only saw a tax collector named Levi, but also recognized his potential and worth as a person. Jesus called Levi to follow him, inviting him to leave behind his old way of life and embrace a new identity as a disciple. This act of grace, singling out Levi and extending fellowship to tax collectors and sinners, challenged societal expectations and emphasized the transformative power of Jesus' invitation.
