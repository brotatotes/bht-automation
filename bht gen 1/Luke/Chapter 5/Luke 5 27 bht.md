# Luke 5:27 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, Jesus is depicted as approaching the sea side where He beheld Levi, or Matthew, a tax collector. The call to Matthew symbolizes the immense grace and mercy of God, as Jesus extends His invitation to someone who was viewed as a social outcast. By choosing Matthew, Jesus exemplifies inclusivity and His desire to offer salvation to all. Matthew's immediate response, leaving everything behind to follow Jesus, underscores the transformative power of encountering Christ and the willingness to surrender one's old way of life for the sake of the Kingdom.
