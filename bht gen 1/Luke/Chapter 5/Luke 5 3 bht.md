# Luke 5:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, Christ takes advantage of being on a boat to teach the crowd gathered by the shore. He asks Simon, later known as Peter, for the favor of putting the boat out a little way from the shore. Simon and the other disciples obey, executing Christ's command, and they put the boat at a convenient distance for the crowd to hear the teachings. This method of teaching from a boat allows the message to reach the people without the boat disappearing from sight or hearing.

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The ship was the Lord's pulpit, and the sea the congregation; the ship was the school, and the disciples the scholars; the ship was the church, and the disciples the members. It was a strange sight, to see Christ teaching in a ship, and the disciples learning in a ship; but it was a sight that became him, and became them." 

2. "The ship was a type of the church, and the sea of this world; and Christ's teaching his disciples in the ship, and their learning of him in the ship, was a type of the ministry of the word in the church, and the people's receiving instruction from it in the church."

3. "The ship was tossed with waves, and the disciples were tossed with fears; but Christ was in the ship, and that made it safe, and the disciples were in the ship, and that made them safe. Christ was in the ship, and therefore the storm was not so terrible as it would have been if he had not been there; and the disciples were in the ship, and therefore the storm was not so terrible as it would have been if they had not been there."

### Albert Barnes:

3. "No spectacle could be more sublime than that of the Son of God - the Redeemer of the world - thus speaking from the bosom of a placid lake - the emblem of the peaceful influence of his own doctrines - to the poor, the ignorant, and the attentive multitudes assembled on the shore."
