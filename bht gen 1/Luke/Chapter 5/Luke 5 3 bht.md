# Luke 5:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
From the quotes of various commentators, we gather that the Bible verse depicts Jesus using a boat as a platform to teach his followers. The ship symbolizes safety and security, signifying that Jesus' teachings guide and protect amidst life's storms. By teaching from the boat, Jesus demonstrates his authority over chaos and can calm the storm's turmoil, bringing peace to troubled souls. This act emphasizes the significance of being rooted in the Word of God, finding stability, support, and truth to navigate life's challenges.
