# Luke 5:30 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, religious leaders express their disapproval of Jesus and his disciples for associating with publicans and sinners. The criticism stems from the Pharisees' judgment of those considered outcasts in society. The objections are directed towards both Jesus and his disciples, particularly Matthew, a former tax collector. The motive behind the religious leaders' protest is to bring accusations against Jesus and tarnish his reputation among the people.

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "The incongruities mentioned in Luke 5:36-38 were intended to illustrate the difference between the genius of the old and new economies, and the danger of mixing up the one with the other."
2. "By a mongrel mixture of the ascetic ritualism of the old with the spiritual freedom of the new economy, both are disfigured and destroyed."
3. "The 'new wine' seems plainly to be the evangelical freedom which Christ was introducing; and the old, the opposite spirit of Judaism: men long accustomed to the latter could not be expected 'straightway'—all at once—to take a liking for the former."

### Philip Schaff:
