## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The incongruities mentioned in Luke 5:36-38 were intended to illustrate the difference between the genius of the old and new economies, and the danger of mixing up the one with the other."
2. "By a mongrel mixture of the ascetic ritualism of the old with the spiritual freedom of the new economy, both are disfigured and destroyed."
3. "The 'new wine' seems plainly to be the evangelical freedom which Christ was introducing; and the old, the opposite spirit of Judaism: men long accustomed to the latter could not be expected 'straightway'—all at once—to take a liking for the former."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Matthew and Mark represent the objection as raised against the conduct of our Lord." 
2. "The disciples also ate with the publicans and sinners." 
3. "The result would be a protest from the Pharisees against both the Master and His disciples."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The Pharisees and their scribes... Some of the scribes were Sadducees. It is only the Pharisees who find fault here." 
2. "Murmured... Picturesque onomatopoetic word that sounds like its meaning. A late word used of the cooing of doves. It is like the buzzing of bees." 
3. "The publicans and sinners... Here Luke is quoting the criticism of the critics. Note one article making one group of all of them."

### John Gill:
1. "The Scribes and Pharisees murmured against his disciples, saying... why do ye eat and drink with publicans and sinners?" - This quote highlights the criticism and judgment of the religious leaders towards Jesus and his disciples for associating with those considered outcasts and sinners.

2. "They either murmured at the publicans and sinners sitting down at meat... or rather against Christ for sitting down with them." - This quote reveals the two possible reasons for the murmuring: either the religious leaders were upset about the company Jesus kept or they were directly criticizing Jesus for his actions.
