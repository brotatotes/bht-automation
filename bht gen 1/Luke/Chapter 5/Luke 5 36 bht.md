# Luke 5:36 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this passage, various commentators shed light on the significance of Jesus' parables. They emphasize the inherent incongruity between the old and the new, warning against the attempt to combine them. Trying to engraft the new upon the old not only hampers the new's completeness but also compromises the old's consistency. The damage inflicted by such an endeavor is likened to tearing a piece from a new garment and making the old one appear patched. This cautionary tale serves as a reminder to remain open to new teachings, undergo true transformation, and avoid legalism and religious hypocrisy.

### John Gill:
1. "To join these together, in order to patch up a garment of righteousness, to appear in before God, was equally as weak and ridiculous, as to put a piece of new and undressed cloth into a garment that was old, and wore threadbare."
2. "By this Christ intimates, that the Jews, by being directed to the observance of the traditions of the elders, were drawn off from a regard to the commandments of God; so that instead of having a better righteousness, they had one much the worse, a ragged, and a rent one."
3. "The statutes of men, and the ordinances of God, or the traditions of the elders, and the commands of God, are no more like one another, than the piece of a new and an old garment, and as unlike is obedience to the one, and to the other."

### John Wesley:
1. "The parable of the new wine in old wineskins teaches us the importance of being open to new teachings and experiences. Just as old wineskins cannot contain the fermentation process of new wine, our rigid beliefs and traditions can hinder our spiritual growth and understanding."
2. "Jesus' use of the parable of the patched garment reminds us that true transformation comes from within. We cannot simply patch up our old ways and expect to experience lasting change. We must allow God to renew our hearts and minds, embracing His transformative power."
3. "The parable of the new wine in old wineskins also serves as a cautionary tale against legalism and religious hypocrisy. Jesus challenges us to examine our motives and ensure that our actions are driven by genuine love and devotion to God, rather than a desire to conform to societal expectations or gain approval from others."
