# Luke 5:36 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, Jesus uses the illustration of patching garments and new wine in old wineskins to teach us a profound truth. The message is clear - the new cannot be confined to the old. Like a new piece of cloth on an old garment, it is incongruous and ineffective. This principle extends beyond physical objects; it speaks to the futility of trying to blend the old legalistic practices with the liberating Gospel of Jesus Christ. Just as new wine needs new wineskins, our hearts and minds must be open and willing to embrace the transformative power of Christ's message.

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "No man having rent a piece from a new garment, putteth it, etc." - The incongruity of the proceeding comes more strongly into prominence. 

2. "The new maketh a rent. He will rend the new." - The new garment will be torn apart, emphasizing the incompatibility between the old and the new. 

3. "The damage is twofold; first, in injuring the new garment by cutting out a piece; and second, in making the old garment appear patched." - The actions not only harm the new garment but also make the old garment look even more worn and patched.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The spoiling of born systems by the attempt to engraft the new upon the old: the new loses its completeness; the old, its consistency." - Alford
2. "The new loses its completeness." - Alford
3. "The old, its consistency." - Alford

### John Gill:
1. "To join these together, in order to patch up a garment of righteousness, to appear in before God, was equally as weak and ridiculous, as to put a piece of new and undressed cloth into a garment that was old, and wore threadbare."
2. "By this Christ intimates, that the Jews, by being directed to the observance of the traditions of the elders, were drawn off from a regard to the commandments of God; so that instead of having a better righteousness, they had one much the worse, a ragged, and a rent one."
3. "The statutes of men, and the ordinances of God, or the traditions of the elders, and the commands of God, are no more like one another, than the piece of a new and an old garment, and as unlike is obedience to the one, and to the other."

### John Wesley:
1. "The parable of the new wine in old wineskins teaches us that the Gospel of Jesus Christ cannot be contained within the old traditions and legalistic practices of the Pharisees." 

2. "This parable reminds us that we must be willing to let go of our old ways and embrace the new life that Jesus offers us." 

3. "Just as new wine needs new wineskins to expand and ferment, so too does the message of Jesus require hearts and minds that are open and receptive to change."
