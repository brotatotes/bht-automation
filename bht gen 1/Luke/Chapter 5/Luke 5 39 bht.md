## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### John Calvin:
1. "This statement is given by Luke alone, and is undoubtedly connected with the preceding discourse."
2. "I take it simply as a warning to the Pharisees not to attach undue importance to a received custom."
3. "Hence it follows, that Christ's manner of acting towards his disciples is not less worthy of approbation, because it has less show and splendor."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "There is no comparison between the relative excellence of new and old wine, but simply a statement of the wish (‘desireth’) of one accustomed to drinking old wine." 

2. "This is precisely the attitude of a false conservatism." 

3. "Even if men oppose the new and the true, because they are content with the old, and will not take the trouble to examine what is new, much less to recognize any excellence in it, let us not grow weary."

### John Gill:
1. "This is a proverbial expression, and which Luke only records; which may be applied to natural men, who having drunk the old wine of their carnal lusts and pleasures, do not desire the new wine of the Gospel, and of the grace of God, and of spiritual things, but prefer their old sins and lusts unto them."
2. "Carnal lusts may be signified by old wine, both for the antiquity of them, being as old as men themselves, and therefore called the old man, and for the gratefulness of them to them; and who may be said to drink of them, as they do drink iniquity like water; which is expressive of their great desire and thirst after it, and delight in it."
3. "The disciples having more largely drank of [the old wine], under the ministry of Christ, could not easily desire the new wine of the fastings and prayers of the Pharisees, and John's disciples; for the old wine of the Gospel was much better in their esteem, more grateful to the taste, more refreshing to their spirits, and more salutary and healthful, being the wholesome words of our Lord Jesus Christ."
