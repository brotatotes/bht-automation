## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Master—betokening not surely a first acquaintance, but a relationship already formed." 
2. "all night—the usual time of fishing then, and even now Peter, as a fisherman, knew how hopeless it was to 'let down his net' again, save as a mere act of faith."
3. "at His word of command, which carried in it, as it ever does, assurance of success."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The word here used means a 'prefect,' or one placed 'over' others, and hence, it comes to mean 'teacher' or 'guide.'" 
2. "Though it seemed so improbable that they would take anything after having in vain toiled all night, yet he was willing to trust the word of Jesus and make the trial." 
3. "This was a remarkable instance of 'faith.' Peter, as it appears, knew little then of Jesus. He was not then a chosen apostle."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Master [επιστατα]. Used by Luke only, and always with reference to Jesus." 
2. "Toiled [κοπιασαντες]. From korov, suffering, weariness; and therefore indicating exhausting toil." 
3. "The net [δικτυον]. A general term for a net, whether for fish or fowl."

These quotes provide insights into the unique usage of the term "Master" by Luke, the meaning of "toiled" as indicating exhausting toil, and the general term for a net.

### John Calvin:
1. "Our sentiments concerning Christ do not render him sufficient honor, unless we embrace his doctrine by the obedience of faith, and know what he requires from us."
2. "The deference which he pays to Christ is manifested by this, that, when worn out by fruitless toil, he commences anew what he had already attempted in vain."
3. "A particular instance of faith, rendered to a single command of Christ, would not have made Peter a Christian, or given him a place among the sons of God, if he had not been led on, from this first act of submission, to a full obedience."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Master. Not ‘teacher,’ but a title of respect, not involving a close personal relation."
2. "But, not ‘nevertheless.’"
3. "The significance of this verse for ‘fishers of men’ is obvious."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "This word recognizes Christ's authority." 
2. "Peter's protest calls attention also to the whole night of fruitless toil." 
3. "Acquiescence to show his obedience to Christ as 'Master,' but with no confidence whatsoever in the wisdom of this particular command."

### John Gill:
1. "he knew him to be the Messiah, the king of Israel, and a teacher sent from God"
2. "they had been fishing that 'night', which was the best time for catching fish; and they had been at it all the night, and had 'laboured' hard; and were even 'fatigued', and quite wearied out; and what was most discouraging of all, their labour was in vain"
3. "thus the faithful preachers of the Gospel, sometimes labour and toil in the ministry of the word a great while, with little or no success; and are discouraged from going on, and would be tempted to leave off, were it not for the commission and word of command they have received from Christ"
