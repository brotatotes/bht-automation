# Luke 5:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, a weary fisherman acknowledges Jesus as the Messiah, embracing his doctrine and acknowledging the authority of his command. Despite a night of fruitless toil, the fisherman demonstrates faith by obeying Jesus's word, which carries with it the assurance of success. This act of submission becomes a turning point, leading to a full obedience and a recognition of the greater purpose at hand. It serves as a reminder that even in discouraging moments, faith and obedience to Christ's command are necessary for the fulfillment of his divine plan.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Master—betokening not surely a first acquaintance, but a relationship already formed." 
2. "All night—the usual time of fishing then, and even now Peter, as a fisherman, knew how hopeless it was to 'let down his net' again, save as a mere act of faith." 
3. "At His word of command, which carried in it, as it ever does, assurance of success."

### John Calvin:
1. "Our sentiments concerning Christ do not render him sufficient honor, unless we embrace his doctrine by the obedience of faith, and know what he requires from us."
2. "The deference which he pays to Christ is manifested by this, that, when worn out by fruitless toil, he commences anew what he had already attempted in vain."
3. "A particular instance of faith, rendered to a single command of Christ, would not have made Peter a Christian, or given him a place among the sons of God, if he had not been led on, from this first act of submission, to a full obedience."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Master. Not 'teacher,' but a title of respect, not involving a close personal relation."
2. "We toiled. Not 'have toiled,' for that implies that they had just stopped. Peter gives an account of the last night's labor."
3. "At thy word. On account of thy word. This involved faith, yet the proverbial superstition of fishermen may have entered here."

### John Gill:
1. "he knew him to be the Messiah, the king of Israel, and a teacher sent from God"
2. "they had been fishing that 'night', which was the best time for catching fish; and they had been at it all the night, and had 'laboured' hard; and were even 'fatigued', and quite wearied out; and what was most discouraging of all, their labour was in vain"
3. "faith in Christ, and obedience to him: thus the faithful preachers of the Gospel, sometimes labour and toil in the ministry of the word a great while, with little or no success; and are discouraged from going on, and would be tempted to leave off, were it not for the commission and word of command they have received from Christ"
