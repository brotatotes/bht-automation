# Luke 5:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, the disciples experience a miraculous catch of fish, with the net on the verge of breaking due to the immense quantity and weight of the fish. The overwhelming abundance of the catch serves as a symbol of Christ's divinity, inviting the disciples to become His followers. The breaking net not only emphasizes the extraordinary size of the catch but also highlights the limitations of human strength and the need for divine intervention. It reminds us that, with faith in God's power, even our most challenging endeavors can be accomplished.
