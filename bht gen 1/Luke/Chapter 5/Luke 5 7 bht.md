# Luke 5:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, the fishermen are seen beckoning with their hands due to the distance between them and their partners. Overwhelmed by astonishment and fear, they were unable to speak. There are different interpretations, but it is suggested that the fishermen made signs and beckoned because of the distance, not just amazement. The catch of fish was so abundant that both ships were filled to the point of sinking. Despite the uncertainty of fishing, this miraculous catch brought the boats to their limits.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "They beckoned, on account of the distance." This quote suggests that the reason for beckoning was due to the distance between the individuals. It implies that they were unable to communicate verbally and had to resort to using gestures instead.

2. "μὴ δυνάμενοι λαλῆσαι ἀπὸ τῆς ἐκπλήξεως καὶ τοῦ φόβου." This quote, translated as "unable to speak from astonishment and fear," provides insight into the emotional state of the individuals. It highlights their overwhelming surprise and fear, which could have hindered their ability to speak.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Their partners - James and John. See Luke 5:10."
2. "It was with some one of this sort, I suppose, that Simon had toiled all night without catching anything, but which, when let down at the command of Jesus, inclosed so great a multitude that the net broke, and they filled two ships with the fish until they began to sink."
3. "Indeed, every kind of fishing is uncertain. A dozen times the angler jerks out a naked hook; the hand-net closes down on nothing; the drag-net brings in only weeds; the bag comes up empty. And then again, every throw is successful - every net is full; and frequently without any other apparent reason than that of throwing it on the right side of the ship instead of the left, as it happened to the disciples here at Tiberias."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "They made signs because of the distance of the other boat; hardly, as has been suggested, because they were too much amazed to speak."
2. "Help [συλλαβεσθαι]. Lit., take hold with. Compare Philippians 4:3."
