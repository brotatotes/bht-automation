# Luke 5:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the presence of Jesus, a man falls down at His knees, recognizing His authority and power. Overwhelmed by emotion and a deep sense of unworthiness, he expresses a desire for Jesus to depart from him. This plea arises from a recognition of his own sinfulness and a belief that he is not fit to be in the presence of such holiness. However, Jesus responds by drawing him closer, encouraging him to cling more closely and allowing for a transformative encounter.
