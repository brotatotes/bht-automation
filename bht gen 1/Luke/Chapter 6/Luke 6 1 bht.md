# Luke 6:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, there is a mention of a day called the "second-first Sabbath," which commentators have debated over its exact meaning. One interpretation suggests that it refers to a festival-day within the Passover season. Others propose that it signifies a Sabbath following a feast day or a specific day within the Jewish calendar. Some commentators believe it could be related to the feast of first-fruits. The event described involves disciples plucking the ears of wheat, rubbing them with their hands, and consuming the grains, an action permissible by Jewish traditions as long as it was done before the Sabbath.

3. "ψώχ. τ. χ. is a detail peculiar to Luke: rubbing them and blowing away the chaff."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The 'second day' of the Passover was a great festival, on which the wave-sheaf was offered... The 'first' Sabbath after that 'second day' was called the 'second first,' or the first from the second day of the feast." 
2. "They rubbed it in their hands to separate the grain from the chaff. This was common and allowable... The Pharisees did not object to the thing itself, only to the time when it was done."
3. "The incident of plucking the ears of wheat, rubbing out the kernels in their hands, and eating them... is one which the traveler sees often at present who is in Palestine at the time of the gathering of the harvest."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The exact meaning of [δευτεροπρωτω] cannot be determined."
2. "The word [ετιλλον] is used mostly of pulling out hair or feathers."
3. "The verb [ψωχοντες] means to rub small."

### John Calvin:
1. "It is beyond all question that this Sabbath belonged to some one of the festival-days which the Law enjoined to be observed once every year." 
2. "I am more inclined to favor those who understand by it the second festivity in the year; and this agrees exceedingly well with the name given to it, the second-first Sabbath, because, among the great Sabbaths which were annually observed, it was the second in the order of time."
3. "Now the first was the Passover, and it is therefore probable that this was the feast of first-fruits."

### Philip Schaff:
1) "The common reading ‘second-first,’ has good support; but is omitted in the oldest and best manuscripts."
2) "Explanations of the common reading: (1) That it meant a feast day immediately following the Sabbath... (2) a Sabbath preceded by a feast day... (3) the first day of unleavened bread... (4) the first Sabbath of the second month... (5) the first Sabbath of the second year in the circle of seven years."
3) "Rubbing them with their hands. Peculiar to Luke. The form indicates that they rubbed and ate, as they went."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "A possible explanation is that a scribe wrote 'first' on the margin because of the sabbath miracle in Luke 6:6-11. Then another scribe recalled Luke 4:31 where a sabbath is mentioned and wrote 'second' also on the margin."
2. "Whether wheat or barley, we do not know, not our 'corn' (maize)."
3. "This was one of the chief offences. 'According to Rabbinical notions, it was reaping, threshing, winnowing, and preparing food all at once' (Plummer)."

### John Gill:
1. "Others have been of opinion, that as the Jews had two beginnings of their year, the one on civil accounts in Tisri, the other on ecclesiastical accounts in Nisan; so the first sabbath in Tisri was called the first first sabbath, and that in Nisan, which was this, the second first sabbath."
2. "So the Jews reckoned the seven weeks from thence to Pentecost by sabbaths; the first after the second day they called the second first, or the first after the second day; the second they called the second second; and the third was named the second third; and so on, the second fourth, the second fifth, the second sixth, and second seventh, which brought on Pentecost, when the harvest was ended."
3. "And as plucking of the ears of corn was forbidden on a sabbath day, so was rubbing them; though if they were rubbed before, the chaff might be blown off from them in the hand, and eat on the sabbath day."
