# Luke 6:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This Bible verse refers to a specific Sabbath that commentators seem to have different opinions on. One commentator describes it as an "obscure expression" and believes it may refer to the first sabbath after the second day of unleavened bread. Another commentator suggests that it could be a Sabbath that belonged to one of the festival days prescribed by the Law. Another theory associates it with the feast of first-fruits or the feast of tabernacles. Lastly, an explanation for the action in the verse mentions that rubbing and eating the corn was allowed if it was done before the Sabbath.
