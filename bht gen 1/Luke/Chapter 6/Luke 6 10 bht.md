# Luke 6:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we see the power and authority of God at work. The withered arm represents human weakness and limitations, but God's hand can restore and strengthen what is broken and withered in our lives. We are reminded to trust in His power and rely on Him for restoration, even in the midst of our own limitations. Just as the man's withered hand was restored, God's power is greater than any weakness we may have, bringing healing and wholeness to every aspect of our lives.
