# Luke 6:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In a remarkable display of divine power, Jesus emits a spiritual force that brings healing and restoration. This power flows from God, and when people reach out to Jesus in faith, as a crowd eagerly pressed to touch him, they experience the life-transforming virtue that emanates from him. It is not just physical healing but also emotional and spiritual restoration that Jesus offers, as individuals find themselves healed and saved from their afflictions. This verse highlights the continuous, abundant, and unique nature of Jesus' healing power.
