## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:

2. "To suppose that Luke’s report of this discourse refers only to this world’s poverty, &c. and the blessings to anticipated outward prosperity in the Messiah’s Kingdom is surely quite a misapprehension."
3. "Comparing these expressions with other passages in Luke himself, we must have concluded, even without Matthew’s report, that they bore a spiritual sense."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The benediction is pronounced upon the 'poor in spirit' and those who 'hunger and thirst after righteousness.'"
2. "In this form of the discourse, then, our Lord seems to have had in view 'the poor of this world, rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom which God hath promised to them that love Him.'"

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The kingdom of God is, essentially, the absolute dominion of God in the universe, both in a physical and a spiritual sense."
