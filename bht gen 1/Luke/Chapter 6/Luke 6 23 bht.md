# Luke 6:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In a future time, when people are hated, discarded, and reproached, they are called to rejoice. This rejoicing is not a mere gladness, but an overwhelming and exuberant leap for joy. It is as if the greatest honor and happiness imaginable has been bestowed upon them. Their reward for enduring such persecution is great in heaven and parallels the treatment that the forefathers of these individuals gave to the prophets.
