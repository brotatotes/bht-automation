### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "The woe pronounced here is not against all who are spoken well of by all, but against those who are spoken well of by all falsely, and who are flattered by all, because they flatter all, and prophesy smooth things to all, and never reprove or condemn any, but always speak well of all, and so are the darlings of the people." 

2. "The false prophets of old were popular because they told the people what they wanted to hear, rather than speaking the truth. This woe is a warning against seeking the approval and praise of others at the expense of speaking the truth."

3. "The true prophets of God were often despised and rejected because they spoke the uncomfortable truth. This woe reminds us that it is better to be faithful to God and speak His truth, even if it means being unpopular or facing opposition from those who only want to hear pleasant words."
