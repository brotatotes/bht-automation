# Luke 6:29 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In Matthew 5:39, believers are challenged to respond to violence or harm with love and forgiveness, contradicting our natural inclination for revenge. This teaching promotes non-violence and peace, resisting the cycle of violence and breaking the chain of hatred. By embodying Christ's teachings, we are called to respond to aggression with love, grace, and forgiveness rather than aggression itself. The verse reminds us not to seek private revenge but to bear injuries and affronts with patience, offering the other cheek and forgoing our cloak if necessary.
