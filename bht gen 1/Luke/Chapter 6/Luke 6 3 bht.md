# Luke 6:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, Jesus rebukes the ignorance of his listeners by reminding them of two instances from the Scriptures. He draws attention to how David, in a time of need, entered the tabernacle and ate the showbread reserved for the priests, demonstrating the priority of meeting human needs over adherence to legalistic rules. He also mentions the priests who carried out their duties on the Sabbath without being condemned for breaking the law. Jesus uses these examples to challenge the rigidity and shallow understanding of the Scriptures held by his audience.
