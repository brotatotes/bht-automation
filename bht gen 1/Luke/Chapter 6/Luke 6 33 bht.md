# Luke 6:33 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the commentators highlight the limitations of simply showing kindness to those who are kind to us. They argue that true righteousness cannot be measured by such actions alone, as they lack true virtue and do not merit praise or recognition. Instead, they suggest that one should not consider themselves righteous or superior based on these actions, but rather adopt a more humble and inclusive mindset. Jesus' teachings challenge narrow sentiments and offer a broader understanding of goodness and compassion.
