### Henry Alford:
1. "The similitude is taken from a very full measure of some dry thing such as corn."
2. "If we are to find a nom., it should be the Angels, who are in this matter the ministers of the divine purposes."
3. "This saying is found with a totally different import Mark 4:24; one of the many instances how the Lord turned about, so to speak, the Light of Truth contained in His declarations, so as to shine upon different departments of life and thought."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Pressed down, as dry articles; shaken together, as soft goods; running over, as liquids." - Bengel's interpretation of the terms "pressed down," "shaken together," and "running over" is fanciful and incorrect. The allusion in each case is to a dry measure, and Bengel's interpretation would destroy the climax in the three participles.

2. "The gathered fold of the wide upper garment, bound together with the girdle, and thus forming a pouch." - The term "bosom" refers to the gathered fold of the wide upper garment, which is bound together with a girdle, forming a pouch. In Eastern markets, vendors can be seen pouring the contents of a measure into the bosom of a purchaser.

3. "In Acts 27:39, the word is used of a bay in a beach, forming a bend in the land like the hollow of a robe." - The word "bosom" is also used in Acts 27:39 to describe a bay in a beach, forming a bend in the land resembling the hollow of a robe. This usage is similar to the Latin term "sinus," which can refer to both the hanging, baggy bosom of a robe and a bay.

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Pressed down (πεπιεσμενον). Perfect passive participle from πιεζω, old verb, but here alone in the N.T., though the Doric form πιαζω, to seize, occurs several times (John 7:30; John 7:32; John 7:44)." 
2. "Shaken together (σεσαλευμενον). Perfect passive participle again from common verb σαλευω."
3. "Shall be measured to you again (αντιμετρηθησετα). Future passive indicative of the verb here only in the N.T. save late MSS. in Matthew 7:2. Even here some MSS. have μετρηθησετα."

### John Gill:
1. "Give liberally of your worldly substance to indigent persons, as you have an opportunity, according to your ability, and as cases require: and it shall be returned again to great advantage." 
2. "Good measure, pressed down, and shaken together, and running over, shall men give into your bosom." 
3. "He signifies that a large compensation should be made to such, who give liberally and generously to needy persons; that as they abounded in their acts of beneficence, so an overflowing plenty of good things should be returned to them."

### John Wesley:
1. "Into your bosom — Alluding to the mantles the Jews wore, into which a large quantity of corn might be received."
2. "With the same measure that ye mete with, it shall be measured to you again — Amazing goodness! So we are permitted even to carve for ourselves!"
3. "Give then to man, what thou designest to receive of God."
