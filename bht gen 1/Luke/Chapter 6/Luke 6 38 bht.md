## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Pressed down, as dry articles; shaken together, as soft goods; running over, as liquids." - Bengel's interpretation of the terms "pressed down," "shaken together," and "running over" is fanciful and incorrect. The allusion in each case is to a dry measure, and Bengel's interpretation would destroy the climax in the three participles.

2. "The gathered fold of the wide upper garment, bound together with the girdle, and thus forming a pouch." - The term "bosom" refers to the gathered fold of the wide upper garment, which is bound together with a girdle and forms a pouch. In Eastern markets, vendors can be seen pouring the contents of a measure into the bosom of a purchaser.

3. "In Acts 27:39, the word is used of a bay in a beach, forming a bend in the land like the hollow of a robe." - In Acts 27:39, the word "bosom" is used to describe a bay in a beach, forming a bend in the land that resembles the hollow of a robe. This usage is similar to the Latin term "sinus," which can mean both the hanging, baggy bosom of a robe and a bay.
