# Luke 6:39 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we find Jesus addressing the issue of judgment and guiding his disciples to avoid assuming the role of a condemning leader. The verse highlights the importance of humility and self-examination, as Jesus emphasizes the need to remove the beam in one's eye before attempting to judge others. The commentators also highlight the transformative power of Jesus' ministry, as he brings healing, hope, and inclusion to those who were previously marginalized. This parabolic saying serves as a reminder of Christ's teaching style, incorporating both crisp proverbs and longer narrative comparisons, to impart his characteristic ideas to his disciples.
