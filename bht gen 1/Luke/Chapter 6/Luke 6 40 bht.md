## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "The disciple aims to come up to his master, and he thinks himself complete when he does so."
2. "If you then be blind leaders of the blind, the perfection of one's training under you will only land him the more certainly in one common ruin with yourselves."
3. "The disciple's goal is to reach the same level as his master, considering himself complete when he achieves this. However, if the leaders are blind and misguided, their followers will be led to their own destruction."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The disciple is not above his master, or teacher, etc. See on Matthew 10:24. The connection here is very different. There the principle is assigned as a reason for the disciples' expecting persecution; here it admonishes to be like the Master in humility and charitableness."

2. "When he is perfected, or 'fully instructed,' knowing and consequently endeavoring to do his duty."

3. "Only if a disciple surpassed his master could he hope to be preserved from the ditch into which he sees his blind leader fall. Since, however, the disciple does not commonly surpass the master, he has also the same danger to fear. As a rule every one is constituted like his master."

### John Gill:
1. "If the master is ignorant, the scholar will be so too; and thus it is with teachers, and their people under their care."
2. "Whoever is ambitious of being a thorough scholar, and is diligent and industrious, by all ways and means, to obtain such a character, shall be even as good an one as his master, under whom he learns, and better he cannot well expect to be."
3. "Christ, in this last clause, seems to design his own disciples, who, when perfect in knowledge, which is not to be expected in this state, unless in a comparative sense, will be like himself."
