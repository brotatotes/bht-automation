# Luke 6:41 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we find a powerful analogy of a mote and a beam, highlighting the irony of someone focusing on the small faults of others while ignoring their own glaring flaws. It serves as a reminder of the importance of self-reflection, humility, and empathy. We are urged to examine our own faults before passing judgment, recognizing that our perception of others can be clouded by our own biases. Through understanding and compassion, we can respond with kindness and support, rather than harsh judgment.

1. "Beholdest [βλεπεις] - The Greek word βλεπεις implies more than just seeing with the physical eyes. It suggests a deeper level of observation and understanding, a careful and thoughtful examination of the situation at hand."

2. "considerset [κατανοεις] - This word carries the idea of discernment and understanding. It goes beyond simply perceiving something and delves into the realm of comprehending and grasping the true nature and significance of what is being observed."

3. "mote [καρφος] - The word καρφος refers to a tiny speck or splinter, something so small that it is barely noticeable. In this context, it represents the minor faults or shortcomings in others that we tend to focus on and criticize."

4. "beam [δοκον] - The term δοκον, on the other hand, refers to a large beam or plank of wood. It symbolizes a significant flaw or sin in our own lives that is so glaring and obvious, yet we often fail to recognize or acknowledge it."

5. "See on Matthew 7:3 - This cross-reference directs us to Matthew 7:3, where Jesus uses the same analogy of the mote and the beam to teach about the importance of self-examination and humility in our relationships with others."
