# Luke 6:43 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we learn that a person's true character is not defined by their outward claims, but by their actions. We are reminded that a good tree cannot bear bad fruit, just as a good person cannot be consumed with criticizing others while ignoring their own faults. Furthermore, this verse highlights the importance of faithful ministers who sincerely share the Gospel, without promoting false teachings or corrupt notions. Lastly, we are reassured that true believers, while not perfect, do not lead lives characterized by sin, demonstrating a commitment to righteousness.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### John Gill:
1. "As that cannot be called a good tree, which brings forth bad fruit; so such men cannot be accounted good men, let them make ever so large pretensions to such a character, who are very busy in espying, discovering, and censuring the faults of their brethren; when they take no notice of, nor refrain from, nor relinquish their own."

2. "Good and faithful ministers of the Gospel cannot, and do not bring forth, and publish corrupt notions, and false doctrines, usually and knowingly; even usual, nor can it be, that a good tree should bring forth corrupt fruit; so, neither doth a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit."

3. "True believers...do not bring forth the evil fruit of sin, as the common and constant course of their lives and conversations; for that they never commit sin, or are entirely without it, cannot be said; but sin is not their usual and common practice, or they do not live in sin."
