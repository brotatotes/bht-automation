# Luke 6:44 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse being described emphasizes the importance of evaluating individuals based on the "fruits" they produce. It alludes to the burning bush that Moses saw and highlights the distinction between good and bad preachers through their adherence to the word of God. Furthermore, it highlights how a holy life is an indication of God's grace and the inability of those who are unregenerate to perform good works that are acceptable to God.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Bramble - bush [βατου] Matthew has tribolwn, thistles. The word occurs only once outside of Luke's writings, in Mark 12:26, where it is used as the familiar title of a section of the Pentateuch." 

2. "Luke also uses it in the same way (xx. 37). He was doubtless acquainted with it medicinally, as it was extensively used by ancient physicians. Galen has a chapter on its medicinal uses, and the medical writings abound in prescriptions of which it is an ingredient."

3. "Galen also has a saying similar to our Lord 's : 'A farmer could never make a bramble bear grapes.'"

These quotes provide insights into the historical and cultural context of the word "bramble" in the Bible, its usage in other biblical texts, and its medicinal significance in ancient times.

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The fruit of each tree reveals its actual character. It is the final test." 
2. "By their fruits ye shall know them." 
3. "Bramble bush: Old word, quoted from the LXX in Mark 12:26; Luke 20:37 (from Exodus 3:6) about the burning bush that Moses saw."

### John Gill:
1. "Good and bad preachers are known by their doctrines, the one being agreeable, the other disagreeable to the word of God."
2. "A holy life is the fruit of grace, and an evidence of it."
3. "No more can an unregenerate man perform good works, or bring forth fruits of righteousness acceptable unto God; for these require a knowledge of his will, obedience to it, a principle of grace, love to God, faith in Christ, and a view to the glory of God."
