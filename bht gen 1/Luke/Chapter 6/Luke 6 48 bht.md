# Luke 6:48 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The builder in this verse is not simply digging a surface-level foundation, but continuously and intentionally going deeper into the solid rock. The digging is a progressive and persistent act, emphasizing the importance of a strong foundation. The emphasis is on the wise builder striking the rock before laying the foundation and building upon it. This diligent searching of the Scriptures leads to the discovery of the rock of ages, Christ, and the building of hope for eternal salvation. Once the soul is built upon Christ, it remains unshakable against the trials and temptations of life.
