# Luke 6:49 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Some commentators describe a situation where a person who hears but does not act upon the teachings of Jesus is like someone building a house without a secure foundation, vulnerable to collapse. This imagery of a collapsing structure, whether it be a roof, city, or house, emphasizes the consequences of not building one's life on a solid and secure base. Without a strong foundation, the destructive force of external pressures can cause great ruin. The verse warns against the importance of following the teachings of Jesus, echoing the idea that actions speak louder than words.
