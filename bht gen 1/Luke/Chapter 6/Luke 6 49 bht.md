# Luke 6:49 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the commentator describes a person who hears and understands something, but fails to act upon it. It is likened to someone who builds a house without taking the time to dig a proper foundation, constructing it on the surface of the earth. However, when the inevitable storm comes, the house is unable to withstand the strong currents, leading to its complete destruction. This verse serves as a cautionary reminder of the importance of not just hearing, but also applying wisdom in our actions.
