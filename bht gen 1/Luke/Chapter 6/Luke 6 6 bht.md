## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Matthew, as we see, describes the watching of the Pharisees as words actually spoken, and relates that they asked the question: which certainly arises from an imperfect report of what took place."
2. "There can hardly be a doubt that in Matthew’s narrative the two occurrences are blended: and this may have taken place from the very circumstance of the question about an animal having been asked on both occasions."
3. "ἡ δεξ. is a mark of accuracy, and from an eye-witness."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "His right hand [η χειρ αυτου η δεξια]. A very precise mode of statement. Lit., his hand the right one."
2. "Luke only specifies which hand was withered. This accuracy is professional."
3. "Ancient medical writers always state whether the right or the left member is affected."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "On another sabbath. Probably the next one. This seems more likely than that the next day was observed as a Sabbath."
2. "Right hand. Specified by Luke only."
3. "Luke 6:7-10 agree closely with Mark’s account. Matthew inserts in this connection a thought mentioned by Luke as uttered on a similar occasion (chap. Luke 14:1-5), but there is no reason for inferring a confusion in the statements."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "On another sabbath (εν ετερω σαββατω). This was a second (ετερον, as it often means), but not necessarily the next, sabbath."
