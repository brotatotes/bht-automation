# Luke 6:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, Jesus confidently addresses the malicious intentions of the religious leaders, who questioned him about healing on the Sabbath. He discerns their thoughts and replies not only to their words but also to the hidden purposes underlying their question. Jesus understands their insidious designs, even though they had not openly avowed them. With authority and boldness, he commands a man with a withered hand to rise and stand before everyone, creating an impactful and awe-inspiring moment for all who witnessed it.
