# Luke 6:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, Jesus demonstrates His divine knowledge by discerning the hidden thoughts of those around Him. Although they may not have openly expressed their intentions, Jesus was fully aware of their designs. He knew their thoughts, even though they had not spoken them aloud. Jesus's actions in the synagogue were deliberate, as He stood in their midst to make Himself seen by all.
