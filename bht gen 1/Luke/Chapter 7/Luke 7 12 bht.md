## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Dead bodies, being ceremonially unclean, were not allowed to be buried within the cities." 
2. "The funeral was usually on the same day as the death." 
3. "Affecting particulars, told with delightful simplicity."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The fact that the tombs were outside of the city is significant because in Jewish culture, tombs were considered unclean and anyone who came into contact with a dead body would be considered ceremonially unclean. By placing the tombs outside of the city, it ensured that the purity of the city would not be compromised."

2. "The location of the tombs also serves as a reminder of the separation between life and death. The city represents the realm of the living, while the tombs symbolize the realm of the dead. This separation highlights the contrast between the temporary nature of earthly life and the eternal nature of the afterlife."

3. "Furthermore, the placement of the tombs outside of the city serves as a visual reminder of the consequences of sin and the reality of death. It reminds us that death is a result of sin and that sin separates us from the presence of God. The tombs serve as a sobering reminder of the need for redemption and the hope of resurrection."

### John Calvin:
1. "The reason which induced Christ to restore the young man to life was, that he saw the widow bereft of her only son, and had compassion on her."
2. "We have here a striking emblem of his freely bestowed compassion in raising us from death to life."
3. "He not only deigns to touch us with his hand, in order to quicken us when we are dead, but, in order that he might raise us to heaven, himself descends into the grave."
