1. "The fact that the tombs were outside of the city is significant because in Jewish culture, tombs were considered unclean and anyone who came into contact with a tomb would be considered ceremonially unclean. By placing the tombs outside of the city, it ensured that the city remained ritually pure."

This emphasizes the extent of their suffering and the need for deliverance."
