# Luke 7:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, we see Luke, a physician himself, distinguishing between different types of diseases - chronic and acute. Jesus is not only healing bodily weaknesses and severe diseases, but also casting out evil spirits from people. He freely bestows the gift of sight upon the blind as an act of grace and kindness. Through his direct actions, he sets an example for others and allows them to witness and experience his miracles firsthand.
