## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The expression νεκροὶ ἐγ . does not necessarily imply that more than one such miracle had taken place: the plural is generic."
2. "The plural form of νεκροὶ (dead) is used here in a generic sense, indicating that Jesus had raised multiple dead individuals."
3. "The use of the plural form νεκροὶ (dead) in this context is not meant to indicate a specific number of miracles, but rather to emphasize the power and authority of Jesus over death."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The blind receive, etc." - This verse highlights the ongoing nature of the miracles performed by Jesus. It emphasizes that the blind are not just receiving sight, but they are continuously receiving it. This suggests that Jesus' healing power is not limited to a single moment, but is a continuous and transformative process.

2. "Even while Jesus is speaking and John is in doubt." - This phrase acknowledges the presence of doubt even among those closest to Jesus. It reminds us that doubt is a natural part of faith and that even John the Baptist, who had previously proclaimed Jesus as the Messiah, experienced moments of uncertainty. This serves as a reminder that doubt does not negate the power of God's work.

3. "John is in doubt." - This statement highlights the vulnerability and humanity of John the Baptist. It shows that even a great prophet like John can have moments of doubt and uncertainty. This can provide comfort to believers who may also experience doubt in their own faith, knowing that doubt is not a sign of weakness, but rather a part of the human experience.

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "What things ye have seen and heard" - This emphasizes the importance of personal experience and firsthand knowledge in understanding and testifying to the truth of Jesus' ministry.
2. "Luke mentions no raisings from the dead in verse Luke 7:21, but the language is mainly general, while here it is specific." - This highlights the specific miracles performed by Jesus, including raising the dead, as evidence of his divine power and fulfillment of messianic prophecies.
3. "Σκανδαλιζομα used here has the double notion of to trip up and to entrap and in the N.T. always means causing to sin." - This reveals the deeper meaning of the word "scandalized" in the verse, emphasizing that Jesus' actions and teachings may challenge and confront people's beliefs and behaviors, leading them to stumble or be ensnared in sin.

### John Gill:
1. "The blind see; that is, they that had been blind, and some that were born blind received their sight, which was what was never heard of before, from the beginning of the world; and which, as it is an instance of Christ's almighty power, showing him to be God; so it was a fulfilment of a prophecy concerning him as the Messiah." 

2. "The lame walk; these were among those who were cured of their infirmities; and this also was prophesied of the Messiah, and was now accomplished by Jesus, that 'the lame man' should 'leap as an hart'."

3. "The deaf hear; so in the above prophecy in Isaiah, it is predicted, that 'the ears of the deaf should be unstopped' in the days of the Messiah; and which therefore must be considered as a further confirmation of Jesus being he that was to come, and that another was not to be looked for."

### John Wesley:
1. "To the poor the Gospel is preached" - This emphasizes the inclusive nature of the Gospel, reaching out to those who are marginalized and in need. It highlights the compassion and love of God towards the poor and reminds us of the importance of addressing social and economic inequality.

2. "Which is the greatest mercy" - This quote underscores the profound mercy that is extended to the poor through the Gospel. It speaks to the transformative power of God's grace in the lives of those who are in desperate circumstances, offering them hope, redemption, and a new beginning.

3. "The greatest miracle of all" - This phrase highlights the miraculous nature of the Gospel's impact on the lives of the poor. It suggests that the transformation that takes place when the Gospel is received is even more extraordinary than physical miracles, as it brings about spiritual renewal, healing, and eternal salvation. It reminds us of the supernatural work of God in the lives of individuals and communities.
