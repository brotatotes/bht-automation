# Luke 7:25 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the focus isn't on the external appearance or attire of someone, as John Gill suggests by asking if it was merely about a person's air and action, or their apparel and dress. The commentator further emphasizes that there was nothing about the person's appearance, demeanor, or clothing that was particularly appealing. Rather, the verse addresses those who are gorgeously apparelled and live in luxury, which starkly contrasts with John's modest lifestyle, eating locusts and wild honey.

2. "There was nothing in his person, mien, and garb that was attractive."
3. "They which are gorgeously apparelled; or richly clothed, as John was not, and live delicately; in the most elegant manner, and on the richest dainties, as John did not, his food being locusts and wild honey."
