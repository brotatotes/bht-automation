# Luke 7:25 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this description, we explore the significance of a Bible verse without specifically mentioning the verse. The description draws from the commentaries of Marvin Vincent, Archibald T. Robertson, and John Gill. These commentators shed light on the verse's message by discussing John the Baptist's appearance and lifestyle. They highlight that John was not dressed in splendid clothing, lived a simple and humble life, and did not possess the luxurious qualities often associated with kings' courts. This contrast underscores that John's significance lies not in his external appearance but in his profound message and mission.

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Gorgeously apparelled [εν ιματισμω ενδοξω] . Lit., in splendid clothing." 
2. "On trufh, luxury, see on 2 Peter 2:13, the only other place where it occurs."
3. "Kings' courts [βασιλειοις] . Only here in New Testament. Often rendered palaces."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Gorgeously apparelled (εν ιματισμω ενδοξω). In splendid clothing. Here alone in this sense in the N.T." 
2. "And live delicately (τρυφη). From θρυπτω to break down, to enervate, an old word for luxurious living." 
3. "In kings' courts (εν τοις βασιλειοις). Only here in the N.T. Matthew 11:8 has it 'in kings' houses.'"

### John Gill:
1. "If not his air and action, what was it? was it his apparel and dress? was it to see a man clothed in soft raiment?"
2. "There was nothing in his person, mien, and garb that was attractive."
3. "John was not gorgeously apparelled; or richly clothed, and he did not live delicately like those in kings' courts."

These quotes highlight the contrast between John the Baptist's humble appearance and lifestyle and the expectations of those who came to see him. They emphasize that John's significance was not in his external appearance but in his message and mission.
