# Luke 7:29 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The commentators highlight the significance of John the Baptist's ministry and Jesus' baptism. They emphasize that through John's preaching, the common people and even notorious sinners acknowledged the wisdom and righteousness of God's preparatory ministry. However, the religious leaders, in refusing John's baptism and rejecting Jesus' proclamation, disregarded God's merciful plan and brought about their own destruction. Jesus, by being baptized, vindicated and affirmed the righteousness of God's will. His act served as a public declaration, demonstrating His humility, identification with humanity, and fulfillment of all righteousness as He initiated His ministry.
