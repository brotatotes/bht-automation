### Henry Alford:
1. "The term 'presbyters' here refers to the leaders or representatives of the people, not the synagogue elders. This distinction is important because it highlights the authority and influence these individuals had within the community."

2. "In Luke's account, the presbyters were not simply religious leaders, but also played a significant role in the social and political affairs of the people. They were respected figures who held sway over important decisions and were trusted to represent the interests of the community."
