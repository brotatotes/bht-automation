### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "That generation rejected both John and his Master: the one because he was too unsocial—more like a demoniac than a rational man the other, because He was too much the reverse, given to animal indulgences, and consorting with the lowest classes of society."
2. "But the children of Wisdom recognize and honor her, whether in the austere garb of the Baptist or in the more attractive style of his Master, whether in the Law or in the Gospel, whether in rags or in royalty."
3. "For 'the full soul loatheth an honeycomb, but to the hungry soul every bitter thing is sweet'."

### John Calvin:
1. "He charges them with this reproach, that while the Lord endeavored, by various methods, to draw them to himself, they repelled his grace with incorrigible obstinacy."
2. "He employs a comparison, which was probably taken from a common amusement of children."
3. "Christ intentionally borrowed from children the materials of his reproof: thus declaring that, however distinguished they were, nothing more was necessary to condemn them than a song which children were wont to sing in the market-place for their amusement."

### John Gill:
1. "This clause is not in the Syriac, Arabic, Persic, and Ethiopic versions, nor in some copies, nor in Beza's most ancient copy; and being omitted, more clearly shows, that the two former verses are the words of Christ, and not an observation the evangelist makes, on the different behaviour of Christ's hearers, upon the commendation he had given of John."
2. "Whereunto then shall I liken the men of this generation; or 'to what men shall I liken them', as the Persic version: the phrase 'men of this generation', is Rabbinical."
3. "So דרא ההוא אושי, the men of that 'generation', are more beautiful in work than these, says the Targumist on Ecclesiastes 7:11. 'And to what are they like?' To that which follows."
