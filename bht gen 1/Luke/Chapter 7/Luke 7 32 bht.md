# Luke 7:32 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this passage, we see individuals who are likened to children, not in terms of innocence or purity, but rather in their ignorance, stubbornness, and lack of understanding. They are described as sitting in the market place, representing their immaturity and resistance to change. Despite attempts to please them, they remain difficult and impossible to satisfy. Jesus clarifies that the complainers themselves are the ones displaying childish behavior, while those they criticize are not at fault. This highlights the irony of their unreasonable and unyielding nature.

1. "The Pharisees and lawyers, who rejected the counsel of God, and the baptism of John, were like to 'children'; not for innocence, simplicity, meekness, and humility; their characters were the reverse; but rather, for their ignorance, and want of understanding, their folly and weakness." 

2. "They, together with Christ, and John the Baptist, are in general likened to children, sitting in the market place; where children were wont to be, there being a variety of persons and things to be seen; and which may design the temple, or the synagogues, or any place of concourse, where the Pharisees met, with John, Christ, and their disciples."

3. "The children that imitated the pipers represent Christ and his disciples, who delivered the joyful sound of the Gospel; and the children that acted the part of the mourners signify John the Baptist, and his disciples, who preached the doctrine of repentance; and the children that would not join with, nor make any answer to the one, or the other, intend the Scribes and Pharisees, who were not pleased with either of them."
