### John Gill:
1. "The Pharisees and lawyers, who rejected the counsel of God, and the baptism of John, were like to 'children'; not for innocence, simplicity, meekness, and humility; their characters were the reverse; but rather, for their ignorance, and want of understanding, their folly and weakness." 

2. "They imitated the pipers at weddings, expecting their companions would have danced, as was usually done by the others, when the pipe was played upon; and they mimicked the mourning women at funerals, expecting their fellows would have made as though they had wept; whereas they would do neither, showing a dislike both to the one and to the other."

3. "The children that imitated the pipers represent Christ and his disciples, who delivered the joyful sound of the Gospel; and the children that acted the part of the mourners signify John the Baptist, and his disciples, who preached the doctrine of repentance; and the children that would not join with, nor make any answer to the one, or the other, intend the Scribes and Pharisees, who were not pleased with either of them."

### John Wesley:
1. "They are like children sitting in the market place" - This comparison highlights the immaturity and fickleness of the people being referred to. They are easily swayed and unsatisfied, much like children who constantly change their desires and demands.

2. "So froward and perverse, that no contrivance can be found to please them" - This phrase emphasizes the difficult nature of these individuals. They are stubborn and obstinate, making it impossible to find a solution or satisfy their ever-changing expectations.

3. "It is plain our Lord means, that they were like the children complained of, not like those that made the complaint" - This statement clarifies that Jesus is not comparing himself or his disciples to the complaining children, but rather highlighting the similarity between the people he is addressing and the children who are difficult to please.
