# Luke 7:35 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we see Christ's wisdom in reaching out to all types of people, even sinners, to bring them to repentance and save their souls. Through his sacrifice, he redeemed his children, allowing them to receive the adoption as his own. These children, in turn, bring honor to Christ by living in a way that reflects the teachings of the gospel, denying ungodliness, and living a righteous and godly life.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### John Gill:
1. "Christ, who is the wisdom of God, acted the wise part, in behaving in such a free manner with all sorts of men, and even with publicans and sinners, whereby he became useful to their souls, called them to repentance, converted and saved them."
2. "These are his children, which were given him by the Father; for whose sake he partook of flesh and blood, and whom he redeemed, that they might receive the adoption of children."
3. "These children justify him from all such scandalous imputations, and by their lives and conversations show that the doctrine of Christ is not a licentious one, but teaches them to deny ungodliness and worldly lusts, and to live soberly, righteously, and godly."
