# Luke 7:36 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
At an ensnaring entertainment, our Lord, demonstrating the wisdom of the serpent and the innocence of the dove, accepts an invitation from a Pharisee who disguises his intentions. Despite the uncertain friendship and potential harm, our Lord shows kindness and gentleness. He sits at the table, reclining with the head toward the table, supported by the left arm, demonstrating his willingness to be courteous and hospitable to all.
