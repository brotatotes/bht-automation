### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The tears, which were quite involuntary, poured down in a flood upon His naked feet, as she bent down to kiss them and deeming them rather fouled than washed by this, she hastened to wipe them off with the only towel she had, the long tresses of her own hair." 
2. "The word signifies 'to kiss fondly, to caress,' or to 'kiss again and again,' which shows is meant here. What prompted this? Much love, springing from a sense of much forgiveness."
3. "No personal interview had up to this time taken place between them but she could keep her feelings no longer to herself, and having found her way to Him, they burst forth in this surpassing yet most artless style, as if her whole soul would go out to Him."
