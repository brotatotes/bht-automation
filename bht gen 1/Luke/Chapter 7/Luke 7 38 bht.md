# Luke 7:38 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, a woman approaches Jesus with overflowing love and a deep sense of forgiveness. She expresses her devotion by pouring out unbidden tears onto Jesus' feet and using her own hair to wipe them away. Her unguarded and sincere emotions, along with her actions, speak louder than any words could. Her tears and loving gestures are powerful proof of her love and gratitude towards Jesus.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "The tears, which were quite involuntary, poured down in a flood upon His naked feet, as she bent down to kiss them and deeming them rather fouled than washed by this, she hastened to wipe them off with the only towel she had, the long tresses of her own hair." 
2. "The word signifies 'to kiss fondly, to caress,' or to 'kiss again and again,' which shows is meant here. What prompted this? Much love, springing from a sense of much forgiveness."
3. "No personal interview had up to this time taken place between them but she could keep her feelings no longer to herself, and having found her way to Him, they burst forth in this surpassing yet most artless style, as if her whole soul would go out to Him."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Genuine emotion is not intentional; only unbidden tears are precious."
2. "Her tears dropped on his feet. That she intended to do this is unlikely."
3. "Her unbidden tears outran the prepared ointment; and were more precious in the sight of the Lord."
