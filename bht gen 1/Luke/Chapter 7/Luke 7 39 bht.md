# Luke 7:39 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, we encounter a Pharisee who is internally debating the identity of Jesus. The Pharisee invites Jesus to his home, analyzing His response to determine if He is a prophet. The Pharisee's critical viewpoint is evident as he observes Jesus allowing an unclean woman to touch Him, questioning His prophetic knowledge. Despite the Pharisee's misconceptions, Jesus sees through his thoughts, knowing him better than he knows the true nature of his guest.

3. "Not so fast, Simon; thou hast not seen through thy Guest yet, but He hath seen through thee."

### Philip Schaff:

2. "The main error was in the last thought; for our Lord did allow Himself to be touched by such a person."

### John Gill:
1. "He spoke within himself; not openly and publicly, being in good manners, though not in real respect to Christ, unwilling to affront his guest; but turned these things over in his mind, and reasoned upon them within himself."
2. "Their notion with respect to the conduct of religious persons towards the common people, and those of a bad character, and which the Pharisee here suggests, was, that the touch of such persons was defiling, and therefore to be avoided."
3. "Christ, had he been a prophet, the Pharisee intimates, would have known that this woman was a vile creature; and he would have shown it; by his abhorrence and rejection of her."
