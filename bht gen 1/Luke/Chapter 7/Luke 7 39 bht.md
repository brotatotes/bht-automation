# Luke 7:39 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, a Pharisee invites Jesus as a guest but harbors doubts about His identity as a prophet. The Pharisee assumes that Jesus is unaware of the woman's reputation, which leads him to question Jesus' prophetic status. The Pharisee's objection is rooted in his narrow interpretation of ceremonial cleanliness and his expectation that a prophet would conform to societal norms. However, Jesus reveals His divine knowledge and compassion by allowing the woman, considered notorious and unclean, to touch Him. This encounter challenges the Pharisee's limited understanding and highlights Jesus' mission to save and provide solace to sinners.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The Pharisee assumes that our Lord did not know who, or of what sort, this woman was, and thence doubts His being a prophet."
2. "The possibility of His knowing this and permitting it, never so much as occurs to him."
3. "It was the touching by an unclean person which constituted the defilement. This is all that the Pharisee fixes on: his offence is merely technical and ceremonial."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The Pharisee—who had formed no definite opinion of our Lord, and invited Him apparently to obtain materials for a judgment." 
2. "Ha! I have Him now He plainly knows nothing of the person He allows to touch Him; and so, He can be no prophet." 
3. "Not so fast, Simon; thou hast not seen through thy Guest yet, but He hath seen through thee."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "If Jesus had been sent from God as a prophet, he supposed that he would have known the character of the woman and would have rebuked her."
2. "The Pharisees considered it improper to hold communion with those who were notorious sinners. They judged our Saviour by their own rules, and supposed that 'he' would act in the same way."
3. "Jesus did not refuse the society of the guilty. He came to save the lost; and no person ever came to him so sure of finding a 'friend,' as those who came conscious that they were deeply depraved, and mourning on account of their crimes."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "A prophet would know what others must learn; this man cannot be a prophet, for He does not know who is touching Him." 
2. "The main error was in the last thought; for our Lord did allow Himself to be touched by such a person."
3. "Notice that the objection of the Pharisee was against the touch by an unclean person; a technical, ceremonial, and Pharisaical one."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "This man (ουτος). Contemptuous, this fellow."
2. "The Pharisee assumes that Jesus is not a prophet (or the prophet, reading of B, that he claims to be)."
3. "She was notorious in person and character."

### John Gill:
1. "He spoke within himself; not openly and publicly, being in good manners, though not in real respect to Christ, unwilling to affront his guest; but turned these things over in his mind, and reasoned upon them within himself."
2. "This man reasoned upon the commonly received notions of the Pharisees, both of the Messiah, the prophet that Moses said should come, and of their own conduct, and of all religious men."
3. "Their notion with respect to the conduct of religious persons towards the common people, and those of a bad character, and which the Pharisee here suggests, was, that the touch of such persons was defiling, and therefore to be avoided."
