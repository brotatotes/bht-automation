# Luke 7:41 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this parable, a creditor represents God, to whom we are indebted for our existence and the blessings of life. The two debtors symbolize greater and lesser sinners, illustrating that all sins are debts and all sinners are debtors. It emphasizes that gratitude for forgiveness should be based on the sense of sin and not on our ability to measure or pay off the debt. The parable reminds us that no amount of obedience can ever satisfy the debt we owe to God, as all is due to Him.
