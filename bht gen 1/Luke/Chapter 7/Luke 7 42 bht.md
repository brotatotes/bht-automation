# Luke 7:42 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the depth of meaning is reflected in the forgiveness offered. The sense of sin and the recognition of one's own faults are crucial in acknowledging the need for forgiveness. This forgiveness is freely given, but it is also connected to the atonement made by the Lord Jesus. Grateful love, not the payment of a debt, is the response to this forgiveness. The parable highlights the attitude of the debtors towards the lender, as the wonderful grace of God forgives both their debts without any conditions, solely driven by His sovereign will.
