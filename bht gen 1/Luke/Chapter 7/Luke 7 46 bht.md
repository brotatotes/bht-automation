# Luke 7:46 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, Jesus is speaking with his host, highlighting the difference in treatment between himself and a sinful woman. He points out that the host did not offer the customary anointing of his head with common oil, as was done for guests at feasts. However, this woman, with deep love and devotion, not only used precious and costly ointment for the anointing, but she humbly applied it to Jesus' feet. The contrasting actions of the host and the woman emphasize the woman's genuine forgiveness and her profound expression of honor and respect towards Jesus.
