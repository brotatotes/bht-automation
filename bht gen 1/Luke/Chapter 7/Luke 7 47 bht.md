## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "she is no longer unclean her many sins are forgiven: for (thou seest that) she loved much: her conduct towards Me shews that love, which is a token that her sins are forgiven."
2. "The sense of forgiveness of sin is not altogether correspondent to the sense of forgiveness of a debt. The latter must be altogether past, and a fact to be looked back on, to awaken gratitude: the former, by no means so."
3. "The expectation, the desire, and hope of forgiveness, the πίστις of Luke 7:50, awoke this love; just as in our Christian life, the love daily awakened by a sense of forgiveness, yet is gathered under and summed up in a general faith and expectation, that ‘in that day’ all will be found to have been forgiven."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Her sins which are many—"Those many sins of hers," our Lord, who admitted how much more she owed than the Pharisee, now proclaims in naked terms the forgiveness of her guilt."
2. "for—not because, as if love were the cause of forgiveness, but 'inasmuch as,' or 'in proof of which.' The latter clause of the verse, and the whole structure of the parable, plainly show this to be the meaning."
3. "little forgiven . . . loveth little—delicately ironical intimation of no love and no forgiveness in the present case."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Her conduct is the 'proper expression' of that love."
2. "A man’s love to God will be in proportion to the obligation he 'feels' to him for forgiveness."
3. "They who feel - as Christians do - that they are the 'chief of sinners,' will feel under infinite obligation to love God and their Redeemer."

### John Calvin:
1. "As this woman evinces by remarkable actions, that she is full of ardent love to Christ, it would be improper for the Church to act harshly and severely towards her; but, on the contrary, she ought to be treated with gentleness, whatever may have been the aggravations of her offenses."
2. "From the eager desire which she had manifested to discharge all the duties of piety, Christ infers that, although this woman might have been guilty of many sins, the mercy of God was so abundant towards her, that she ought no longer to be regarded as a sinner."
3. "Christ does not inquire at what price men may purchase the favor of God, but argues that God has already forgiven this wretched sinner, and that, therefore, a mortal man ought not to treat her with severity."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Her sins, which are many, are forgiven, 'have been and are forgiven.'" - This quote emphasizes that the woman's sins have already been forgiven, highlighting the past and ongoing nature of her forgiveness.

2. "The forgiveness free; to the next clause, which plainly makes the forgiveness the ground of the love, not the reverse." - This quote clarifies that the forgiveness is the basis for the woman's love, rather than her love being the cause of her forgiveness.

3. "Little is forgiven, etc. One who feels little need of forgiveness is meant." - This quote explains that the reference to someone who feels little need of forgiveness is not directly applied to Simon, but left for his conscience to discern.

### John Wesley:
1. "Those many sins of hers are forgiven; therefore she loveth much." 
2. "The fruit of her having had much forgiven."
3. "Her love is mentioned as the effect and evidence, not the cause of her pardon."
