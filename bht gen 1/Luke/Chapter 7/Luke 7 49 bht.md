# Luke 7:49 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, a question arises in a reverential spirit, possibly alluding to the miracles performed. Startled by the audacity of one who reclined and forgave sins, the onlookers marvel at the prerogative of forgiveness belonging to God alone. Ignorance of Christ's office causes offense, while the amazed hypocrites fail to recognize their own wretchedness. Jesus freely forgives sins, possessing the authority and power that only God possesses. Such forgiveness is received through faith, leading to manifestations of grateful love and peace.
