# Luke 7:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, Jesus demonstrates his immediate response to a request for healing, not requiring any delay or demonstration of faith. The centurion, aware of Jesus' power and authority, sends friends to intercede on his behalf, recognizing his unworthiness for Jesus to enter his home. The centurion humbly acknowledges the greatness of the favor he is asking for, perceiving it as a significant act of grace from Jesus. This verse can be further illuminated by considering the related passage in Matthew 8:8-13.
