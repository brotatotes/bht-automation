# Luke 8:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The devil, the slanderer, is extremely cunning in snatching up the seed of the word before it can take root in the hearts of those who hear it. He is skilled in diverting their attention and causing them to forget what they have heard. The activity of the devil plays a significant role in hindering the preaching of the gospel and the salvation of souls. The wayside hearers, who listen without understanding and carelessly, are susceptible to having the word stolen from their hearts by the enemy.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The devil, the slanderer, snatches up the seed from the heart before it sprouts and takes root." 
2. "Every preacher knows how successful the devil is with his auditors." 
3. "Here is the main reason for the failure of preachers to win souls: the activity of the devil during and after the preaching of the sermon."

### John Gill:
1. "Those by the wayside are they that hear... the word of God, though only by accident, and very carelessly, and without understanding what they hear." 
2. "Then cometh the devil... and taketh away the word out of their hearts, or memories; that little of it, which is retained there, and diverts their minds from it by other objects; so that they quite forget what they have heard."
3. "Lest they should believe, and be saved: this clause is only in Luke; and with it may be compared 2 Corinthians 4:4 for with true faith in Christ the sum and substance of the word salvation is connected; and Satan being an enemy to the salvation of souls, does all he can to hinder their faith in him."
