# Luke 8:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Certain women, who had been healed of evil spirits, were among those who followed Jesus. These women had firsthand experience of the miraculous power of Jesus, as he freed them from the grip of demonic forces. The mention of being "healed of evil spirits" is to be taken literally, emphasizing the literal casting out of demons by Jesus. Among these women, Mary Magdalene holds a significant role, distinguished by her name, and she becomes a central figure in the events surrounding Jesus' crucifixion, burial, and resurrection.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The mention of demons in this verse alludes to the story in Luke 8:30, where Jesus encounters a man possessed by a legion of demons. This connection highlights the power and authority of Jesus over the spiritual realm."

2. "The use of the number seven in this verse is significant. In biblical numerology, seven represents completeness and perfection. Therefore, the presence of seven demons emphasizes the extreme possession and bondage the man in Luke 8:30 experienced."

3. "By referencing Luke 8:30, this verse serves as a reminder of the miraculous deliverance and transformation that Jesus can bring to those who are oppressed by demonic forces. It offers hope and encouragement to those who may be struggling with spiritual battles."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Blessed Saviour! It melts us to see Thee living upon the love of Thy ransomed people."

2. "All that we know of her is that she was formerly grievously afflicted by the presence of those evil spirits, that she was perfectly cured by Jesus, and that afterward she became one of his most faithful and humble followers."
3. "She was at his crucifixion and burial, and she was among those who had prepared the materials to embalm him, and who first went to the sepulchre after the resurrection; and what is particularly interesting in her history, she was the first to whom the risen Redeemer appeared, and his conversation with her is exceeded in interest and pathos by no passage of history, sacred or profane."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "All of them had probably been cured of some affliction; hence their service was one of gratitude."
2. "Christianity has done much to correct these notions [of low views of woman's virtue]."
