# Luke 8:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, someone brings word or tidings to Jesus, reporting or announcing something to him. The news is delivered to Jesus, rather than him actively seeking it out. It is worth noting that the phrase "which said" is omitted in certain versions, while others simply read "and they said unto him." This incident reminds us of a similar situation where someone informed Jesus about his mother and brethren wishing to see and speak with him.
