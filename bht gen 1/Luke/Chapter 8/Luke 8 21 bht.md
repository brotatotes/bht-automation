# Luke 8:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the Bible verse, we are reminded that our identity as children of God goes beyond human parentage and worldly ties. Our spiritual connection to God and His Word is what truly matters in the grand scheme of eternity. Through the parable of the sower, we are called to hear and internalize the word of God, and let it shape our actions and behavior in accordance with His teachings.
