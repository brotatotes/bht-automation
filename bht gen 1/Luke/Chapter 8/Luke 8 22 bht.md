## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "This serves to shew that Luke had no data by which he could fix the following events." 
2. "If he had seen the Gospel of Mark, could this have been so?" 
3. "Luke's intention is to give a general idea of the time that elapsed between the Ascension and the descent of the Holy Ghost."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Let us go over unto the other side of the lake." - This quote highlights the intention and direction of the disciples to cross the lake, emphasizing their willingness to follow Jesus' command and venture into the unknown.

2. "Launched forth [ανηχθησαν].

3. "It is the word used of Jesus' being led up into the wilderness and the mount of temptation (Matthew 4:1; Luke 2:22); also of bringing up a sacrifice to an idol - altar (Acts 7:41)." - This quote draws parallels between the disciples' journey across the lake and significant events in Jesus' life, highlighting the spiritual significance and potential trials they may encounter during their voyage.

### Archibald T Robertson:

### John Wesley:
1. "The storm on the Sea of Galilee was a real and terrifying event, but it also serves as a powerful metaphor for the storms of life that we all face. Just as the disciples were caught in a violent storm, we too can find ourselves in the midst of turbulent circumstances that threaten to overwhelm us."

2. "In their fear and panic, the disciples turned to Jesus, waking him from his sleep and pleading for his help. This is a powerful reminder that in the midst of our own storms, we can always turn to Jesus for help and find comfort in his presence."

3. "Jesus' response to the disciples' fear is a rebuke and a challenge to their lack of faith. He asks them, 'Why are you afraid, O you of little faith?' This reminds us that even in the midst of our storms, we are called to trust in Jesus and have faith that he is with us, guiding and protecting us."

4. "The calming of the storm not only demonstrates Jesus' power over the forces of nature, but also serves as a powerful reminder that he has power over the storms of our lives. Just as he spoke the words 'Peace, be still' and the storm obeyed, he can speak peace into our own storms and bring calm to our troubled hearts."

5. "The disciples' response to the calming of the storm is awe and wonder. They marvel at Jesus' authority and ask, 'Who then is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?' This question invites us to reflect on the identity of Jesus and recognize him as the Son of God, the one who has power over all creation."
