# Luke 8:26 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In a region opposite Galilee, Jesus encounters demon-possessed men living in tombs, symbolizing their spiritual darkness and separation from God's truth. Their violent behavior and supernatural strength reveal the destructive power of sin and the bondage it brings. Jesus exercises his authority over the demonic realm, commanding the unclean spirits to leave, demonstrating his dominion over all spiritual forces. The townspeople, more concerned about their economic loss, fail to grasp the spiritual significance of Jesus' actions. The transformed demoniacs bear witness to Jesus' power to bring healing and restoration to those trapped in sin's oppression.
