## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The fact of many d≈ìmons having entered into this wretched man sets before us terribly the utter break-up of his personal and rational being."
2. "The words will not bear any figurative rendering, but must be taken literally."
3. "In the same sense in which other poor creatures were possessed by one evil spirit, this man, and Mary Magdalene, were possessed by many."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "This verse highlights the power and authority of Jesus over the demonic realm. The fact that the demons recognized Jesus and acknowledged His authority is significant, as it reveals the spiritual battle that was taking place. It also emphasizes the magnitude of the deliverance that took place, as a legion of demons was cast out by Jesus."

2. "The mention of the pigs in this verse serves as a reminder of the destructive nature of the demonic forces. The demons requested to be sent into the pigs, and as soon as they entered, the pigs rushed down the steep bank into the sea and drowned. This vivid imagery underscores the havoc and destruction that the devil and his minions seek to bring upon humanity."

3. "The reaction of the people in the region is also noteworthy. Instead of rejoicing over the deliverance of the possessed man, they were filled with fear and asked Jesus to leave. This response reveals the spiritual blindness and resistance to the power of God that can exist in the hearts of people. It serves as a cautionary reminder of the importance of recognizing and embracing the authority of Jesus in our lives."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Legion refers to a Roman military unit consisting of thousands of soldiers. This term is used metaphorically in the Bible to describe a large number or multitude of demons." 

2. "The mention of Legion in this verse emphasizes the intensity and magnitude of the demonic possession. It suggests that the man was under the control of a vast number of evil spirits, highlighting the severity of his condition." 

3. "The use of the term Legion also serves to demonstrate the power and authority of Jesus. By commanding the demons to leave, he shows his dominion over not just one or a few, but a multitude of evil forces."

### John Gill:
1. "This question was put, not out of ignorance in Christ, but for the sake of those that were with him." 
2. "The miserable condition of this man might be the more known." 
3. "His own power might be the more manifest in the dispossession."
