# Luke 8:32 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the large number of swine in the herd emphasizes the potential magnitude of the event that is about to take place. The presence of the swine serves as a powerful symbol of the unclean and sinful nature of the demons, highlighting the contrast between their impurity and the purity of Jesus. As the demons request to enter the swine, it reveals their desire for embodiment and their fear of being cast out. Jesus granting permission for this demonstrates his authority and control over all creation, even the forces of evil.
