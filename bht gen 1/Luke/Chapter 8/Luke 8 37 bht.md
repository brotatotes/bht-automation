1. "Were holden with great fear" - This phrase highlights the intense fear that gripped the people. It suggests that the fear was so strong that it held them tightly, almost paralyzing them.

2. "Imperfect passive of συνεχω" - This grammatical explanation sheds light on the tense and voice of the verb used. It suggests that the fear was an ongoing and passive experience for the people, something they were subjected to rather than actively participating in.

"See a similar use of this vigorous verb in Luke 12:50 of Jesus and in Philippians 1:23 of Paul" - This reference to other biblical passages where the same verb is used adds depth to our understanding. It implies that the fear experienced by the people in this verse is not unique but has been felt by other significant figures in the Bible.
