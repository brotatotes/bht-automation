# Luke 8:38 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse describes a man who had been healed by Jesus, with the devils having been cast out of him. The man, grateful for the favor he received, wanted to accompany Jesus, but Jesus sent him away instead. This interaction signifies the power and goodness of God, as well as the desire of individuals to be close to Him and united with Him. The devils departing from the man demonstrate the difference between the knowledge of God's goodness and His power.
