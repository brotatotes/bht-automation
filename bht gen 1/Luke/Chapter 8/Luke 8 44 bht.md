# Luke 8:44 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, a woman, driven by faith and desperation, sought healing from Jesus. Hindered by her condition, she approached him from behind, humbly and discreetly touching the fringe of his garment. Instinctively, she believed that this act alone would bring about her healing. Her faith, though accompanied by an erroneous perception, was met by Jesus' compassion and power, resulting in the immediate cessation of her suffering. This miracle serves as an encouraging reminder of the importance of faith and the potential for healing even in the face of ignorance or weakness.
