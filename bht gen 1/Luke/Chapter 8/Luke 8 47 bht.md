# Luke 8:47 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this powerful verse, a woman who had been cured of a long-standing illness by Jesus comes forward, overwhelmed with awe and trembling in her response to His divine presence. Her courageous public testimony not only reveals the precise knowledge of Christ but also demonstrates the importance of openly confessing Him, even in the face of fear and opposition. Through her humble act of falling down and her bold declaration before all, she bears witness to the miraculous healing power of Jesus and her deep gratitude for the instantaneous relief He had brought her.
