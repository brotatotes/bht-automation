# Luke 8:48 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
A woman, brimming with faith, touched something that healed her. She confessed her act, and her faith was not in vain. The power that came from Jesus, activated by her unwavering belief, energetically saved her. Mark's addition brought her assurance of lasting healing. Jesus, instead of scolding her, comforted her and encouraged her to continue in peace, her body made whole by her faith.
