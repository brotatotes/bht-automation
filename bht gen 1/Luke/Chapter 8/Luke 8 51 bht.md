# Luke 8:51 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this powerful Bible verse, Jesus enters a house and finds a crowd of people, including musicians and a noisy crowd, all heading towards the room of death. With authority, Jesus commands them to leave, allowing only His chosen disciples and the parents of the deceased girl to enter. The selected three, His favorites, serve as witnesses to the astonishing miracle that is about to take place.
