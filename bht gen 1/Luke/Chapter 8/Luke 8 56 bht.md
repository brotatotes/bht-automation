# Luke 8:56 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, we are told that a command or injunction was given, but it seems like it wasn't followed as the news spread throughout the land. The commentators highlight that the miracle that occurred was not something that could be hidden, emphasizing the visible evidence and the way it captured people's attention. However, there is an instruction to keep the details and circumstances of the event private, with the purpose of not making it unnecessarily public.
