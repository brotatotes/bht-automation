# Luke 9:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the midst of their ministry, Jesus invited the apostles to a place of rest in Bethsaida. This invitation underscored the importance of prioritizing their relationship with Him above their accomplishments and reminded them that their worth was not tied to their productivity. Jesus understood their need for physical, emotional, and spiritual renewal, and demonstrated the significance of withdrawing to be alone with God through His own example. Resting in Jesus meant finding peace and contentment in His presence, receiving His love, joy, and strength, and trusting Him to provide the balance needed to fulfill their duties.
