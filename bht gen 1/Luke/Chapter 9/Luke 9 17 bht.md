## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "κλασ. in Matt. is joined with τὸ περισσεῦον, in Mark with κοφίνους πλήρεις: here it may be taken with τὸ περισ. (ordinarily, and De Wette) or κόφ. (Meyer), but best, it appears to me, the latter, because the article is not expressed as in Matt."
2. "Immediately after this miracle, Matt., Mark, and John relate the walking on the sea, which, and the whole series of events following as far as Matthew 16:12, the healings in the land of Gennesaret, the discourse about unwashen hands, the Syrophœnician woman, the healing of multitudes by the sea of Galilee, the feeding of the 4000, the asking of a sign from Heaven, and the forgetting to take bread, are wholly omitted by our Evangelist."
3. "It is also an important observation, that the omission by Luke of the second miracle of feeding is not to be adduced against its historical reality, as has been done by Schleiermacher (transl. p. 144), since it is only omitted as occurring in the midst of a large section, which the accounts gathered by Luke did not contain."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "There were taken up of fragments that remained to them twelve baskets." 
2. "And there was taken up that which remained over to them, of broken pieces, twelve baskets." 
3. "Baskets."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "The twelve baskets symbolize the abundance and provision of God. Just as Jesus miraculously multiplied the loaves and fishes to feed the multitude, he is able to provide for our needs in abundance."
2. "The mention of broken pieces highlights the idea that God can take our brokenness and use it for His glory. He can take our shattered lives and turn them into something beautiful and whole."
3. "The fact that there were twelve baskets left over is significant. It represents the twelve tribes of Israel and signifies that God's provision is not limited to a select few, but is available to all who seek Him."
