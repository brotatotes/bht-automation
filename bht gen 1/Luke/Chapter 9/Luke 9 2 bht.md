# Luke 9:2 Commentary Help Text

The disciples were sent out with a twofold purpose: to proclaim the kingdom of God and to heal the sick.

By healing the sick, they not only demonstrated the authenticity of their ministry but also showcased the transformative power of the kingdom of grace in the hearts of believers. This dual role of proclaiming and healing was central to their mission as confirmed in Matthew 10:7-8.
