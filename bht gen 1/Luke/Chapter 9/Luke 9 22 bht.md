# Luke 9:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This verse offers a glimpse into the future, depicting a transformative journey that the Son of Man must undertake. Rejecting scrutiny and deliberate rejection, he suffered physically and spiritually, facing opposition from both earthly and supernatural forces. The rejection came from the highest authority, the elders, chief priests, and Scribes, leading to his death on the cross. Yet, amidst the somber outlook, hope emerges with the promise of resurrection on the third day. This verse serves as a reminder that believers must prepare for an eternal reality, far different from the present, urging them to live with an eternal perspective.
