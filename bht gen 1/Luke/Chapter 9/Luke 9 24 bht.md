# Luke 9:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we are reminded of the duality between the lower and higher forms of life, encompassing the temporal and eternal, natural and spiritual aspects. It highlights the active role of God in deliberately saving and delivering individuals, emphasizing the value of the soul and the eternal redemption brought about through salvation. This challenges us to examine our priorities, willingness to sacrifice our own desires, and embrace a selfless and radical way of living for the sake of Christ. It calls for a daily surrender, denying ourselves and our own wills in pursuit of a deeper relationship with God.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The pith of this maxim depends...on the double sense attached to the word 'life,' a lower and a higher, the natural and the spiritual, temporal and eternal."
2. "An entire sacrifice of the lower, or a willingness to make it, is indispensable to the preservation of the higher life."
3. "He who cannot bring himself to surrender the one for the sake of the other shall eventually lose both."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Will save" (θελη σωσαι) implies a deliberate and intentional act of salvation, highlighting the active role of God in rescuing and delivering individuals from harm or destruction.
2. The use of the word "life" (ψυχην) emphasizes the significance and value of the soul, indicating that salvation is not merely a physical preservation but a spiritual redemption that brings eternal life.
3. The parallel construction with "will come after" (ver. 23) suggests that the desire to save one's life can hinder true discipleship, as it may lead to self-preservation and a reluctance to fully surrender to God's will.

### John Gill:
1. "This verse challenges us to consider what we value most in life. Are we willing to sacrifice our own desires and ambitions for the sake of something greater? It calls us to examine our priorities and to let go of our own self-centeredness." 

2. "The phrase 'save his life' implies a sense of self-preservation and selfishness. It reminds us that true fulfillment and purpose are found in surrendering our own desires and seeking to serve others." 

3. "Jesus is calling us to a radical way of living, where we are willing to lay down our own lives for the sake of the gospel. It is a call to selflessness and sacrifice, to put the needs of others before our own."

### John Wesley:
1. "To lose one's life for the sake of Christ means to surrender our own desires, ambitions, and plans to follow Him wholeheartedly. It is a call to die to self and live for Him." 

2. "The paradox of losing our life to find it in Christ is a profound truth that challenges our natural inclination to seek self-preservation and worldly success. It is a radical invitation to embrace the eternal perspective and prioritize our relationship with God above all else."

3. "The call to lose our life for Christ's sake is not a call to physical death, but a call to surrender our own will and submit to God's will. It is a daily choice to deny ourselves, take up our cross, and follow Jesus, even when it goes against our own desires and comforts."
