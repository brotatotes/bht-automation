# Luke 9:29 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, Luke presents the transfiguration of Jesus as a unique and divine event, distinct from the mythological transformations of pagan gods. Luke intentionally avoids using a term that would evoke ideas of heathen deities to his Greek readers. Instead, he portrays the transfiguration as a supernatural occurrence, emphasizing the radiant and glorious transformation in Jesus' appearance. This transformation is symbolic of the power of prayer, as Jesus was immediately answered while speaking, illustrating the potential for his followers to also experience answered prayers and a joyful countenance through communion with God.
