### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Threw him down [ερρηξεν]. See on teareth, Mark 9:18." 
2. "Tare [συνεσπαραξεν]. Only here in New Testament. Convulse, which is the exact Latin equivalent, would, perhaps, be the nearest rendering." 
3. "Sparagmov, a kindred noun, is the word for a cramp."

### John Gill:
1. "The devil threw him down, and tare him; knowing who Jesus was, and that he was able to dispossess him: and having reason to believe he would, was resolved to do all the mischief he could, and give him all the pain add distress he was able, whilst he was in him."
2. "Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit; for his malice and cruelty, and ordered him to depart."
3. "Delivered him again to his father; free from the possession, and in perfect health, and which must be very pleasing and acceptable to him."
