# Luke 9:45 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse in question contains a hidden meaning that the disciples were not able to fully comprehend at the time. The intentional concealment of the significance of the words led to their confusion and inability to accept the truth of what was being conveyed. The disciples' preconceived notions and limited understanding hindered their ability to grasp the deeper meaning behind the message. This concealment served as a way to protect them from rebuke and reprove, allowing them to grow and learn gradually.
