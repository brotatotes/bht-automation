# Luke 9:46 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the disciples engage in a deep and thoughtful debate, not simply a casual conversation. The topic of their discussion is not an abstract problem, but a personal issue within their own group. Their focus on personal status and greatness blinds them from understanding Jesus' teachings and diverts their attention from the true message. Their reasoning arises at an inappropriate time, driven by rivalries and a misguided expectation of a grand and worldly kingdom.

### Henry Alford:
1. "No interpreter would have thought of [confining the sense of διαλ.] to an inward doubt and questioning in the heart of each."
2. "The disputing of their thoughts was known to Him [Jesus]."
3. "The idea of τὸ τίς ἂν εἴη μ. meaning that each one thought 'Who is greater than I?' is absurd enough."

1. "A reasoning [διαλογισμος]": This term refers to a deep and thoughtful debate or discussion, indicating that the verse is not simply a casual conversation but a serious and intellectual exchange of ideas.
2. "See on ch. Luke 24:38": This reference suggests that the verse in question is connected to a similar concept mentioned in Luke 24:38, providing a broader context for understanding the meaning and significance of the verse.

2. "But Luke makes it plain that it was not an abstract problem about greatness in the kingdom of heaven as they put it to Jesus (Matthew 18:1), but a personal problem in their own group."

3. "Rivalries and jealousies had already come and now sharp words. By and by James and John will be bold enough to ask for the first places for themselves in this political kingdom which they expect (Mark 10:35; Matthew 20:20)."

### John Gill:
1. "A thought entered into them...suggested very likely by Satan, which broke out into words, and issued in a warm dispute among them." 
2. "The dispute was not about degrees in glory, nor in grace; nor who should be the greatest apostle and preacher of the Gospel; but who should be prime minister to the king Messiah."
