# Luke 9:48 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, Jesus teaches that true greatness comes from humility and serving others. The disciples are instructed to receive and welcome even the lowliest, for in doing so, they are receiving and welcoming Jesus himself. By acting in Jesus' name, the disciples not only represent him, but also participate in his authority and character. This passage reminds us that to be truly great, we must humble ourselves and serve others with love and compassion, following in the footsteps of our Lord.
