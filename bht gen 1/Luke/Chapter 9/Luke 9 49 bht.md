### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "As if John wanted to change the subject after the embarrassment of the rebuke for their dispute concerning greatness."
2. "It is a pitiful specimen of partisan narrowness and pride even in the Beloved Disciple, one of the Sons of Thunder."
3. "The man was doing the Master's work in the Master's name and with the Master's power, but did not run with the group of the Twelve."

### John Gill:
1. "The disciples were concerned that someone who was not part of their group was casting out demons in Jesus' name. This reveals their possessiveness and exclusivity, as if they were the only ones authorized to do such things." 

2. "Their statement implies that they saw themselves as the gatekeepers of Jesus' ministry, deciding who was allowed to participate and who was not. This attitude goes against the inclusive nature of Jesus' message."

### John Wesley:
1. "This verse reminds us that true discipleship is not limited to those who are part of our immediate community or share the same beliefs as us. It challenges us to embrace a broader perspective and recognize the work of God in the lives of others, even if they may seem different or unfamiliar to us."

2. "Jesus' response to John's concern about someone casting out demons in His name reveals His inclusive and generous nature. He teaches us that unity and cooperation should be valued over exclusivity and competition, especially when it comes to advancing the Kingdom of God."

3. "In this verse, Jesus emphasizes the importance of humility and a willingness to learn from others. He encourages us to have a teachable spirit and not be quick to dismiss or criticize those who may have a different approach or understanding of faith. It is a reminder that we are all on a journey of growth and discovery, and we can benefit from the diversity of perspectives within the body of Christ."
