# Luke 9:54 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, the disciples, known as "sons of thunder," witness an insult or refusal to let Jesus into a village. Their zeal and fiery nature are evident in their desire to call down fire from heaven, imitating the actions of Elijah. However, their misguided zeal and lack of judgment are pointed out, as they fail to consider their differences from Elijah and the true intentions of Jesus. This incident serves as a sobering reminder that rash imitation of others can lead to misguided actions.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The disciples whom He named ‘sons of thunder,’ saw some insult of manner, or actual refusal to allow the Lord to enter their village."
2. "It is exceedingly difficult to determine the true reading in this passage, which seems to have been more than usually tampered with, or wrongly written."
3. "Let it be remembered that in both cases, versions far more ancient than our oldest MSS. contain these words."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

2. "Yet this was 'the disciple whom Jesus loved,' while the other willingly drank of His Lord's bitter cup."
3. "That same fiery zeal, in a mellowed and hallowed form, in the beloved disciple, we find in 2 John 5:10; 3 John 1:10."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "James and John - They were called Boanerges - sons of thunder - probably on account of their energy and power in preaching the gospel, or of their vehement and rash zeal - a remarkable example of which we have in this instance, Mark 3:17."
2. "Wilt thou ... - The insult had been offered to Jesus, their friend, and they felt it; but their zeal was rash and their spirit bad. Vengeance belongs to God: it was not theirs to attempt it."
3. "Fire from heaven - Lightning, to consume them. As Elias did - By this they wished to justify their zeal. Perhaps, while they were speaking, they saw Jesus look at them with disapprobation, and to vindicate themselves they referred to the case of Elijah. The case is recorded in 2 Kings 1:10-12."

### John Calvin:
