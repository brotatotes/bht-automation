# Luke 9:56 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This verse speaks about the Son of man, who is a divine figure exemplifying salvation and not destruction, as demonstrated through his miracles.

The verse is a reflection on the compassionate nature of Jesus, who came to save rather than destroy, healing diseases and casting out demons, contrary to the harsh consequences of the Old Testament. It addresses the rejection Jesus faced and the possibility of continued ministry despite opposition.
