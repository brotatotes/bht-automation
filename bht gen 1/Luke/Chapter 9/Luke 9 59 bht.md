# Luke 9:59 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, Jesus issues a command to follow Him, indicating a call to discipleship. The response of the individual reflects a desire for a temporary delay or hesitation before fully committing. This hesitation may stem from the person's understanding of the importance and urgency of following Jesus, as well as potential societal obligations such as the burial of a father. The significance of the command is emphasized by the inclusion of the word "first," which suggests a prior awareness of the command to follow Jesus.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "ἀκολούθει μοι" - This command implies a call to follow Jesus, as seen in Matthew's account where the reply is "Lord, let me first..." The use of the word "first" suggests a prior understanding of the command to follow Jesus.

2. "κύριε, ἐπίτρεψόν μοι πρῶτον" - The reply to Jesus' command, "Lord, let me first..." indicates a desire for a temporary delay or hesitation before fully committing to following Him. This response further emphasizes the significance of the command to follow Jesus.

3. "…which words could hardly be spoken without a reference in the πρῶτον to it" - The inclusion of the word "first" in the reply suggests that there is an underlying understanding of the command to follow Jesus. This implies that the disciples were already aware of the importance and urgency of following Jesus, making the command even more significant.

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Matthew 8:21 omits Christ's 'Follow me' and makes this man a volunteer instead of responding to the appeal of Jesus."
2. "The scribes knew how to give plausible reasons for not being active disciples."
3. "The burial of one's father was a sacred duty, but this scribe's father probably was still alive. What the scribe apparently meant was that he could not leave his father while still alive to follow Jesus around over the country."

### John Gill:
1. "According to Matthew, one of his disciples, who had attended him some time, and whom he now called to the ministerial work."
2. "They are certainly the words of Christ, directed to another person, at the same time he met with the former."
3. "But he said, Lord, suffer me first to go and bury my father."
