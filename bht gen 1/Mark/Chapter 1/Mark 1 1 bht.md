## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "It is simpler and gives more majesty to the exordium, to put a period at the end of Mark 1:1, and make the citation from the Prophet a new and confirmatory title."
2. "If the genit. after εὐαγγ. is not a person, it is always that of the object, as εὐαγγ. τῆς βασιλείας, τῆς σωτηρίας κ.τ.λ."
3. "Here it decides for the latter (Mar 1:2-8). Render therefore, the glad tidings concerning Jesus Christ."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The abruptness with which he announces his subject, and the energetic brevity with which, passing by all preceding events, he hastens over the ministry of John and records the Baptism and Temptation of Jesus—as if impatient to come to the Public Life of the Lord of glory—have often been noticed as characteristic of this Gospel." 

2. "What strikes every one is, that though the briefest of all the Gospels, this is in some of the principal scenes of our Lord's history the fullest."

3. "Wherever the finer and subtler feelings of humanity, or the deeper and more peculiar hues of our Lord's character were brought out, these, though they should be lightly passed over by all the other Evangelists, are sure to be found here, and in touches of such quiet delicacy and power."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The word 'gospel' here has reference rather to the preaching of John, an account of which immediately follows, and means the beginning of the good news, or annunciation respecting the Messiah."
2. "The Son of God - This title was used here to attract attention, and secure the respect of those who should read the gospel."
3. "The history, therefore, 'commands' respect."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The expression 'the beginning' signifies not just the start of the book, but the commencement of the Gospel itself, the unfolding of God's plan for salvation." 
2. "By referencing the prophets, the author emphasizes that the Gospel was foretold and ordained by God, and that it was to be initiated by the coming of a forerunner." 
3. "This forerunner serves as a precursor to the main message of the Gospel, preparing the way for the arrival of Jesus Christ and the fulfillment of God's promises."

### John Calvin:
1. "The abrogation of the Law, and the beginning of the Gospel, strictly speaking, took place when John began to preach." 
2. "The Evangelist John presents to us Christ clothed in flesh, 'the Word made flesh,' so that his birth and the whole history of his appearance are included in the Gospel."
3. "Mark shows us that no redemption is to be expected but from the Son of God."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The beginning of the gospel." - This verse is seen as the title of the book, marking the start of the Gospel. However, the term "gospel" in the New Testament is not specifically used for a book but rather refers to the good news. (Mark 1:1)

2. "The Son of God." - Mark, writing for Gentile Christians, includes this title to emphasize Jesus' divine nature. This title is further explained in the prologue of the Gospel according to John. (Mark 1:1)

3. "The beginning of the gospel (was this), John did baptize, etc." - Some connect this verse with Mark 1:4, highlighting that the beginning of the gospel was marked by John's baptism. This suggests that John's ministry played a significant role in the start of Jesus' public ministry. (Mark 1:1)

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The beginning (αρχη). There is no article in the Greek. It is possible that the phrase served as a heading or title for the paragraph about the ministry of the Baptist or as the superscription for the whole Gospel."
2. "The word Gospel here (ευαγγελιον) comes close to meaning the record itself as told by Mark."
3. "If Mark wrote the words, there is no reason to doubt the genuineness since he uses the phrase elsewhere."

### John Gill:
1. "The design of this evangelist, is not to give an account of the genealogy of Christ, of his conception and birth, of what befell him in his infancy, or of any actions and sayings of his from thence, to his appearance in Israel; but to give an account of his ministry and miracles, sufferings and death."

2. "He first points out Christ, who is the author and substance, as well as the great preacher of the Gospel; the sum of which is, that he is Jesus, the Saviour and Redeemer of lost sinners; the Christ, the Messiah, that was to come."

3. "Mark begins his account of the Gospel, and which he calls the beginning of it, with the same article of the divine sonship of Christ, as the Apostle Paul began his ministry with."
