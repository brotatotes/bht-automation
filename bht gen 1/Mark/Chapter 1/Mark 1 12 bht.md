# Mark 1:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In an unknown place, possibly near Jericho, the Spirit swiftly drives Jesus into the wilderness, a desolate realm believed to be where he fasted and was tempted. This wilderness serves as a testing ground, confronting Jesus with the wild beasts of his soul and exposing his vulnerabilities. Guided by the Holy Spirit from his birth to his resurrection, Jesus's earthly life is intertwined with divine influence, leading him to face intense temptations after remarkable demonstrations of favor.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The place is unknown. Tradition fixes it near Jericho, in the neighborhood of the Quarantania, the precipitous face of which is pierced with ancient cells and chapels, and a ruined church is on its topmost peak." 

2. "Dr. Tristram says that every spring a few devout Abyssinian Christians are in the habit of coming and remaining here for forty days, to keep their Lent on the spot where they suppose that our Lord fasted and was tempted." 

3. "To be driven into the wilderness is to be brought face to face with the wild beasts of the soul, with the untamed passions and desires that lurk within us. It is a place of testing, where we are confronted with our weaknesses and vulnerabilities."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Straightway. The same favorite word as in Mark 1:10. The E. V. uses seven different words to represent this one Greek word, which may always be rendered ‘straightway.’"
2. "The spirit driveth him forth. Comp. Matthew 4:1. The expression here used is stronger than ‘led up’ (Matthew), ‘led’ (Luke)."
3. "The spirit driveth him forth. Comp. Matthew 4:1. The expression here used is stronger than ‘led up’ (Matthew), ‘led’ (Luke)."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Driveth him forth (αυτον εκβαλλε). Vivid word, bolder than Matthew's 'was led up' (ανηχθη) and Luke's 'was led' (ηγετο)."
2. "The forty days in the wilderness were under the direct guidance of the Holy Spirit."
3. "The entire earthly life of Jesus was bound up with the Holy Spirit from his birth to his death and resurrection."

### John Gill:
1. "As soon as he was baptized, and this testimony had been given of his divine sonship, the very selfsame day, the Spirit driveth him into the wilderness."
2. "For this was not the evil spirit Satan, by whom he was tempted; for Matthew expressly says, that he was 'led up of the Spirit--to be tempted by the devil.'"
3. "Moreover, in one of Beza's copies, and in his most ancient one, and in one of Stephens's, it is read, 'the Holy Spirit driveth him'."

### John Wesley:
1. "Extraordinary manifestations of his favour are wont to be followed by extraordinary temptations."
2. "The Spirit thrusteth him out into the wilderness."
3. "In all the children of God, extraordinary manifestations of his favour are wont to be followed by extraordinary temptations."
