# Mark 1:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Immediately after being baptized, the Spirit swiftly leads him into the wilderness. This swift and forceful action from the Spirit indicates a strong purpose, surpassing mere guidance. The Spirit's driving force compels him to confront extraordinary temptations following the extraordinary manifestation of divine favor at his baptism. Such temptations serve as a testament to the profound nature of the preceding events and the divine purpose behind them.
