# Mark 1:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In a harsh and dangerous wilderness, Jesus faced solitude and isolation, vulnerable to the presence of wild beasts. As the prince of darkness personally assaulted him, Jesus remained unhurt, demonstrating his innocence and purity. After forty days of invisible spiritual temptations, the visible temptation by Satan followed. Though surrounded by wild beasts, Jesus was secure, protected by divine intervention.
