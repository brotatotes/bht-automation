# Mark 1:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In a desolate wilderness, Jesus faced a harsh and dangerous environment, surrounded by wild beasts that represented the vulnerability and solitude of his solitude. The temptation continued for forty days, with Satan personally engaging in the assault. Through these trials, Jesus overcame the temptations and emerged unharmed, symbolizing his purity and innocence. Once the temptations were over, the angels ministered to Jesus, serving and providing for him after his long fast.
