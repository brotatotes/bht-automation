## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Casting a net (ἀμφιβάλλοντας) is a powerful metaphor for the act of evangelism and spreading the message of the Gospel. Just as fishermen cast their nets wide to catch as many fish as possible, believers are called to cast the net of God's love and salvation to reach as many people as they can."

2. "The act of casting a net also implies a sense of urgency and intentionality. Fishermen do not casually throw their nets, but rather they do so with purpose and determination. Similarly, believers should approach evangelism with a sense of urgency, recognizing the eternal significance of sharing the good news of Jesus Christ."

3. "Casting a net requires skill and strategy. Fishermen need to know where to cast their nets to maximize their catch. In the same way, believers should be intentional about where they share the Gospel, seeking out opportunities and contexts where it will have the greatest impact."

4. "Casting a net is an inclusive action. Fishermen do not discriminate between types of fish when casting their nets; they aim to catch as many as possible. Likewise, believers should not discriminate or exclude anyone when sharing the message of salvation. The Gospel is for all people, and we should strive to reach everyone with God's love and grace."
