2. "The reason of his being called the messenger of God, may be observed in the text itself, 'behold, I send': the words in Malachi are by us rendered, 'behold, I will send', Malachi 3:1: because this was at the time of the prophet's writing a thing future, but in the times of the evangelist a thing done."
3. "The prophet does not say before whom he should be sent, though it is implied in the next clause, but here it is expressed: besides, this messenger had now appeared before the face of Christ, had prepared his way in the wilderness, and had baptized him in Jordan; all which is designed in the following words, 'which shall prepare thy way before thee', by his doctrine and baptism."
