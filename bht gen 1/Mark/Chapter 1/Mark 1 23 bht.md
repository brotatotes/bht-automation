# Mark 1:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, a man is described as being possessed by an unclean spirit, to the point where his own personality is overwhelmed by the spirit. The presence of evil spirits and their association with impurity is significant and should not be ignored. The man's desperate cry indicates the torment caused by the unclean spirit, which seeks to disrupt religious gatherings and hinder the impact of the word of God. The fear, envy, and distress experienced by the possessed man further highlight the power and influence of Christ's ministry.
