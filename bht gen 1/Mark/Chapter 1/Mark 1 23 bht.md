## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The use of the prep. in this connexion is unusual: see reff."
2. "I think the best account of it is, that it falls under a large class of usages of ἐν, expressing the element in which the man lived and moved."
3. "As possessed and interpenetrated by the evil spirit, as in the common expressions ἐν κυρίῳ, ἐν χριστῷ, cf. 2 Corinthians 12:2, and Acts 17:28."

1. "The phrase 'straightway with an unclean spirit' emphasizes the immediate response of the unclean spirit to Jesus' presence and authority. It highlights the power and authority of Jesus over spiritual forces of evil."
