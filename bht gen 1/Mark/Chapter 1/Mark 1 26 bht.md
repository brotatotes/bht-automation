# Mark 1:26 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this passage, we see a man who was forcefully convulsed and thrown down in the midst by a powerful and disruptive spirit. The demon's presence caused intense physical and emotional turmoil, as evidenced by the man's loud cry and the violent shaking. Despite the harmlessness of the convulsions, it is clear that the demon's malignancy and rage were impotent when confronted with the superior power of Christ. This event serves as a vivid demonstration of the intense struggle between the forces of good and evil.
