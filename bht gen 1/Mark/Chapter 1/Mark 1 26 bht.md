# Mark 1:26 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this powerful verse, an impure spirit is forcibly expelled from a man, displaying its malignant cruelty and rage. The demon, unable to harm the man physically, trembles and convulses him, resulting in a loud cry. The dramatic scene unfolds as the evil spirit is compelled to leave the man, a clear demonstration of Christ's authority over the forces of darkness.
