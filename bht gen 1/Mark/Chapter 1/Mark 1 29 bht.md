## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "The mention of these four—which is peculiar to Mark—is the first of those traces of Peter's hand in this Gospel, of which we shall find many more."
2. "The house being his, and the illness and cure so nearly affecting himself, it is interesting to observe this minute specification of the number and names of the witnesses."
3. "Interesting also as the first occasion on which the sacred triumvirate of Peter and James and John are selected from among the rest, to be a threefold cord of testimony to certain events in their Lord's life."

### John Calvin:
1. "The Evangelists appear to have taken particular notice of this miracle; not that, in itself, it was more remarkable, or more worthy of being recorded, than other miracles, — but because, by means of it, Christ gave to his disciples a private and familiar illustration of his grace."
2. "A single word, in Luke’s narrative, presents to us more strikingly the power which Christ displayed; for he says, that Simon’s mother-in-law was held by a GREAT fever. It was a clearer and more affecting proof of divine power, that, in a moment, and by a single touch, he removed a strong and violent disease."
3. "He might have done it by the slightest expression of his will; but he touched her hand, either to mark his affection, or because he was aware that this sign was, at that time, advantageous: for we know, that he freely used outward signs, when the time required them."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "On the 'sabbath day' (Mark 1:21) after the occurrence in the synagogue." 
2. "The particularity favors the theory that Peter had told Mark of it." 
3. "The twelve were not yet chosen; though these four had been called to follow Christ."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Peter was evidently married before he began to follow Jesus. Later his wife accompanied him on his apostolic journeys." 
2. "Each Gospel gives touches of its own to the story. Mark has 'lay sick of a fever,' Matthew puts it 'stretched out with a fever,' Luke has it 'holden with a great fever,' a technical medical phrase."
3. "They all mention the instant recovery and ministry without any convalescence. Mark and Matthew speak of the touch of Jesus on her hand and Luke speaks of Jesus standing over her like a doctor."

### John Gill:
1. "Christ having wrought this miracle, and finished his sermon, and the whole synagogue service being over..."
2. "he, and they that were with him, departed from it, and directly..."
3. "they entered into the house of Simon and Andrew; who being brethren, dwelt together in a house at Capernaum..."

### John Wesley:
1. "In this passage, we see Jesus entering the house of Peter and finding his mother-in-law sick with a fever. This shows Jesus' compassion and willingness to heal even the most mundane illnesses."

2. "The fact that Jesus touched the hand of Peter's mother-in-law to heal her is significant. It demonstrates his personal involvement and his desire to bring healing and restoration to individuals on a personal level."

3. "The immediate response of Peter's mother-in-law after being healed is a powerful testimony to the transformative power of Jesus. She immediately gets up and begins to serve them, showing her gratitude and dedication to Jesus."

4. "This passage also highlights the importance of hospitality and service in the Christian faith. Peter's mother-in-law's response to her healing is a reminder that when we experience the healing touch of Jesus, we are called to respond by serving others and extending that same love and compassion to those around us."

5. "The healing of Peter's mother-in-law is not just a physical healing, but also a spiritual one. It symbolizes the liberation from the power of sin and the restoration of wholeness that Jesus brings to our lives."
