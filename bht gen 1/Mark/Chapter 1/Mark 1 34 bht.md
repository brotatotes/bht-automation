### John Wesley:
1. "He suffered not the devils to say that they knew him" - This verse challenges the popular belief that demoniacs were possessed by actual demons. It suggests that these individuals were actually suffering from diseases, and Jesus did not allow them to claim knowledge of him, possibly to prevent the spread of false beliefs about demonic possession.

2. "According to Dr. Mead's hypothesis, (that the Scriptural demoniacs were only diseased persons)" - This commentary introduces the hypothesis put forth by Dr. Mead, which suggests that the demoniacs mentioned in the Bible were simply individuals suffering from various diseases. It presents an alternative perspective to the traditional understanding of demonic possession.

3. "He suffered not the diseases to say that they knew him!" - This statement, based on Dr. Mead's hypothesis, humorously highlights the absurdity of attributing knowledge and speech to diseases. It challenges the notion of demonic possession by emphasizing the more plausible explanation that these individuals were afflicted with physical ailments rather than being possessed by supernatural entities.
