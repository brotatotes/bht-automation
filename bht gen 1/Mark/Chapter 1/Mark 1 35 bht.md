# Mark 1:35 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the early hours before dawn, Jesus would rise and depart to a solitary place, where he would engage in fervent prayer and communion with his Father. This act of dedicating himself in prayer before the start of the day signifies his deep connection with God and the importance he placed on seeking divine guidance and strength. Jesus' commitment to prayer, demonstrated in his early rising, serves as an example for believers to prioritize their own prayer life and seek God's presence and direction in all aspects of their lives.
