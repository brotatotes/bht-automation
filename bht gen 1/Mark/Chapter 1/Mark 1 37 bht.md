# Mark 1:37 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In a secluded place where He had been praying, Jesus was found by those who actively sought after Him. The crowd, driven by their own desires, implored Him to return. Even though the disciples were hesitant to leave, they knew the immense potential for good that was present in that moment. Jesus's response in the subsequent verse revealed that He would not be ruled by the will of the people.
