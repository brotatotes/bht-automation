In a desert and solitary place, after some search, Jesus was found by the disciples, as the multitudes sought Him and urged His return. The disciples wanted Him to come back, and the crowd beseeched Him to stay, thinking that all seek Him. However, Jesus knew that the will of the multitude did not govern Him, as there was a greater purpose behind His actions.
