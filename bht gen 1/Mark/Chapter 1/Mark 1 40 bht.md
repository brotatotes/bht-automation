# Mark 1:40 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
A man full of leprosy, deemed incurable, kneels down to Jesus in submission and reverence, saying, "Lord, if you are willing, you can make me clean," revealing his faith and recognition of Jesus' authority. Jesus, filled with compassion, reaches out and touches the leper, not only willing to heal him, but also entering into his brokenness and isolation. This physical and spiritual restoration demonstrates Jesus' authority over sickness, sin, and social barriers, bringing about a transformation that goes beyond the physical healing of the leper.

### John Wesley:
1. "The leper's plea for healing reveals his faith in Jesus' ability to heal him. He recognizes Jesus as the source of healing and acknowledges his authority by saying, 'Lord, if you are willing, you can make me clean.' This demonstrates the leper's understanding of Jesus' power and his humble submission to Jesus' will."

2. "Jesus' response to the leper's plea is filled with compassion. He reaches out and touches the leper, a gesture that would have been considered highly unusual and even taboo in that culture. This physical touch not only demonstrates Jesus' willingness to heal, but also his willingness to enter into the brokenness and isolation of the leper's condition."

3. "The healing of the leper is not just a physical restoration, but also a social and spiritual restoration. By healing the leper, Jesus is not only removing the physical disease, but also restoring him to the community and to a relationship with God. This healing is a powerful demonstration of Jesus' authority over sickness, sin, and social barriers."
