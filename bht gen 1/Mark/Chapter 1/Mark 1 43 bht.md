# Mark 1:43 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
A man, charged with strong emotion, approached Jesus, who immediately sent him away. The healing took place outside the city and not in a house. This act seemed to have stirred grief in Jesus, yet it carried a message - leprosy often stemmed from sin and the man was to avoid sin in the future. This miraculous act of healing placed the man under an obligation to shun sin and its seven manifestations.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Philip Schaff:
1. "Solemnly charged him. This implies strong emotion. Our Lord perceived the man’s disobedient spirit." 
2. "Straightway sent him away. Not out of the house, for there is no evidence that the miracle was performed in a house." 
3. "Possibly out of the city into which the leper had come (Luke 4:12); but away from Himself, for despite our Lord’s compassion, feelings of grief seem to have been awakened by the man."

### John Gill:
1. "Sin was usually the cause of leprosy, as the cases of Miriam, Gehazi, and Uzziah show."
2. "These seven things are said to be an evil tongue, shedding of blood, a vain oath, uncleanness, a proud spirit, theft, and envy."
3. "He was, by this cure, laid under an obligation, for the future, to avoid it, and all other sins."
