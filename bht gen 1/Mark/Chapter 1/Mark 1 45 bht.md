## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "He lost no time in doing it."
2. "The seeking to Him for teaching and healing still went on and that from all parts."
3. "The three are evidently independent accounts; Mark's, as usual, the most precise in details."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The city represents a place of community and civilization, where people come together to live, work, and interact with one another. It is a symbol of human society and the structures we create to govern and organize ourselves."

2. "In the context of the Bible, the city often carries a deeper spiritual significance. It can represent the kingdom of God, a place where His rule and reign are established. It is a reminder that God desires to dwell among His people and bring order, justice, and peace to the world."

3. "Furthermore, the city can also symbolize the human heart. Just as a city has many different parts and aspects, so too does the human heart. It is a complex and multifaceted entity, with various desires, thoughts, and emotions. The city reminds us of the need for self-reflection and inner transformation, as we seek to align our hearts with God's will."

### John Calvin:
1. "Hence we learn the reason why Christ did not wish the miracle to be so soon made known. It was that he might have more abundant opportunity and freedom for teaching."
2. "He wished that they would all be more attentive to the word than to signs."
3. "He avoided a crowd of men, because he saw, that he would not satisfy the wishes of the people, without overwhelming his doctrine by a superfluity of miracles."
