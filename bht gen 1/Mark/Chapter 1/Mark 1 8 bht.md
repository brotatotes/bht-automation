# Mark 1:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we see a double baptism being discussed. The first baptism, performed by John, was a symbolic act using water, representing the spiritual baptism by Jesus. This distinction is important, as it redirects the focus from John's baptism to Jesus and the gifts and graces of the Holy Spirit that can only be obtained through Him. While Matthew emphasizes the dual nature of baptism in water and in the Holy Spirit, Luke omits the mention of fire, possibly to highlight the severity of John's preaching. Regardless, the wise will understand the significance of this verse.
