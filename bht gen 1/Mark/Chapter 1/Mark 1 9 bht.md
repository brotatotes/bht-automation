# Mark 1:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we see Jesus coming from Nazareth and being baptized by John in the Jordan River. Mark's unique account highlights Jesus' origin from Nazareth and the physical action of him entering into the waters. As Jesus emerges from the water, symbolizing a moment of transition and transformation, the heavens part and a dove descends, portraying the divine presence. His baptism signifies his identification with humanity, his submission to God's plan, and sets an example for his followers of humility, obedience, and surrender to God's will.
