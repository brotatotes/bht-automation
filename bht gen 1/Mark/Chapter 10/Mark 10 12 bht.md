# Mark 10:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the unique portrayal of a woman seeking divorce is noted by commentators. While Greek and Roman law permitted wives to divorce their husbands, it was unusual among the Jews, as Jewish law did not provide for it. This alteration may have been influenced by Mark's source or added by Mark for the benefit of a Gentile audience. The delicate subject of divorce is likely discussed in a private conversation. Jesus, aware of the Roman world's customs, prohibits marrying such divorced women.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "This verse corresponds to ὁ ἀπολελυμένην γαμήσας μοιχᾶται in Mat 19:9 but it is expressed as if the woman were the active party, and put away her husband, which was allowed by Greek and Roman law."
2. "This alteration in the verbal expression may have originated in the source whence Mark’s report was drawn."
3. "On μοιχᾶται, Grotius remarks, ‘Mulier, cum domina sui non sit, si, marito relicto, ad aliud matrimonium se conferat, omnino adulterium committit, non interpretatione aliqua, aut per consequentiam, sed directe: ideo non debuit hic addi, ἐπʼ αὐτόν.’"

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Mark’s account is peculiar in representing the woman as seeking the divorce." 
2. "This was unusual among the Jews, though it occurred among the Greeks and Romans."
3. "Probably in this confidential interview, the delicate subject was discussed in all its bearings."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Greek and Roman law allowed the divorce of the husband by the wife though not provided for in Jewish law."
2. "Both Bruce and Gould think that Mark added this item to the words of Jesus for the benefit of the Gentile environment of this Roman Gospel."
3. "Surely Jesus knew that the thing was done in the Roman world and hence prohibited marrying such a 'grass widow.'"

### John Gill:
1. "Not that there was the same law, or the same sufferance by the law of Moses, for a woman to put away her husband, as for the husband to put away the wife."
2. "And we have a story told of a holy man, and a holy yeoman, who were married, and had no children, and they divorced one another."
