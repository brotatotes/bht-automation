# Mark 10:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
To understand the verse, we must acknowledge our complete dependence on God and approach Him with humility and trust, just as a little child does. Jesus calls us to lay aside all pride and receive the Gospel with simplicity and loving obedience. By surrendering our own self-sufficiency, we can enter the kingdom of God and experience His grace and mercy. Our faith, like that of a child, allows us to come to Christ and be recognized as Christians.
