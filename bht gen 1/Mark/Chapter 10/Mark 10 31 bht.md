# Mark 10:31 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we are reminded by Philip Schaff that God's economy operates differently from the world's standards. It is a realm where the last shall be first and the first shall be last. Archibald T. Robertson indicates that this paradox challenges our tendency to boast and highlights the importance of humility. John Gill adds to this, emphasizing that in God's kingdom, the values and priorities of this world are inverted. It is a call to let go of pride, seek true greatness through service and selflessness, and not measure our worth by earthly achievements.
