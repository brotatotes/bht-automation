# Mark 10:37 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The disciples, influenced by their close relationship with Jesus and their position as part of the inner circle, expressed their ambitious desire for positions of honor and power in Jesus' kingdom. This demonstrated their expectation of a grand Jewish world empire, brushing aside Jesus' teachings about his death and resurrection. Their limited understanding led them to misconstrue Jesus' resurrection as a means to establish their desired glorious kingdom, rather than recognizing it as a spiritual victory over sin and death.
