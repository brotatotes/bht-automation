# Mark 10:38 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, Jesus responds to the request of his disciples, highlighting their ignorance of the true implications. He speaks of "the cup," referring to the depth of emotional and spiritual pain he would endure, and "the baptism," symbolizing the outward sufferings he would face. These terms highlight the all-encompassing nature of Jesus' suffering, both inwardly and outwardly. It becomes clear that the disciples were unaware of the path of suffering that leads to glory, for they were unaware of what they were truly asking for.
