## BHT:
In this Bible verse, the commentators shed light on the disciples' lack of understanding and awareness of the challenges they would face on their journey of faith. Jamieson-Fausset-Brown describes James as one of the first apostles to face persecution and be baptized with Christ's "baptism of blood." John Gill highlights the disciples' ignorance of their own weaknesses and the magnitude of Christ's suffering. Despite their limited understanding, both commentators emphasize that the disciples would experience suffering for the sake of Christ, paralleling his own experiences.
