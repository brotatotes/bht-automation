# Mark 10:45 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the kingdom about to be set up, all servants shall be equal, knowing only the greatness of humility and service to others. The one who goes deepest in self-denying humility will rise highest in that kingdom, just as the Son of man's self-sacrifice gives Him a place above all. The great work of man's redemption, willingly undertaken by Christ, was a ransom for many, signifying the inclusivity and sufficiency of His sacrifice for all who would accept it.
