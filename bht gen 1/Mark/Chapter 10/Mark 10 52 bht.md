# Mark 10:52 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this account, a blind man demonstrates his unwavering faith in Jesus, acknowledging Him as the promised Messiah. Through the power of his faith, the blind man receives both physical healing and spiritual salvation. Jesus commends the man's faith, declaring that it has not only restored his sight but also saved his soul. This miraculous event serves as a powerful symbol of the journey of believers, who start blind to God's truth, but through faith in Christ, their eyes are opened, and they follow Him on the path of salvation.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The account here and in Luke seems to correspond better with the wonderful strength of his faith."
2. "Our Lord healed by a word in such cases."
3. "Luke adds, δοξάζων τὸν θεόν, and that all the people seeing him gave glory to God."

### John Calvin:
1. "By the word faith is meant not only a confident hope of recovering sight, but a loftier conviction, which was, that this blind man had acknowledged Jesus to be the Messiah whom God had promised."
2. "Now Christ attributes it to faith that the blind man received sight; for, though the power and grace of God sometimes extend even to unbelievers, yet no man enjoys His benefits in a right and profitable manner, unless he receive them by faith."
3. "And therefore, when Christ says, thy faith hath saved thee, the word saved is not limited to an outward cure, but includes also the health and safety of the soul; as if Christ had said, that by faith the blind man obtained that God was gracious to him, and granted his wish."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Go thy way. Not necessarily a command to depart, but a token that his prayer was granted."
2. "The commendation is omitted by Matthew, who speaks of our Lord touching the blind man, but this seems more accurate."
3. "Our Lord thus proved that He came to minister (Mark 10:45). This is the last miracle recorded in detail in the Gospels, and one of the most encouraging."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Followed (ηκολουθε). Imperfect tense picturing joyful Bartimaeus as he followed the caravan of Jesus into the new Jericho."
2. "Made thee whole (σεσωκεν). Perfect active indicative. The word commonly means save and that may be the idea here."
3. "The word commonly means save and that may be the idea here."

### John Gill:
1. "thy faith hath made thee whole; or 'saved thee'; and which respected not only the power of Christ in restoring his sight, but his faith in Jesus as the Messiah, the son of David: so that by Christ, the object of his faith, he was saved, both in soul and body"
2. "This man was an emblem of the people of God, before, at, and after conversion: before conversion; for, as he was blind, so are they; they are without any spiritual sight and discerning of God, as in Christ, as the God of all grace, as their Covenant God and Father"
3. "and after conversion; for, as this man, when he had received his sight from Christ, followed him in the way; so the people of God, being enlightened by Christ, follow him as their leader and commander, as the captain of their salvation, as the shepherd of the flock"
