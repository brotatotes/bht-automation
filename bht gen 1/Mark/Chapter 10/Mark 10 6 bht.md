# Mark 10:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
From the quotes of commentators on this Bible verse, it is evident that the verse emphasizes the origin of all things from the beginning of creation. The first couple, Adam and Eve, were created as one male and one female, establishing the foundation for monogamy and excluding the possibility of polygamy or divorce. God's creation of male and female was a definitive act, where He joined them together as husband and wife in a state of innocence.
