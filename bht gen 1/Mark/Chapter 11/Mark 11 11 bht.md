# Mark 11:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the passage described, Jesus enters Jerusalem to the enthusiastic praise of the people, who recognize him as the long-awaited Messiah. He then proceeds to the temple, where he demonstrates his authority by overturning the tables of the money changers and restoring the temple as a place of true worship. However, the fickleness of human allegiance is evident as the same people who praised him later question his authority. This passage highlights Jesus' mission to establish his kingdom and the need for a deeper understanding of his identity.
