# Mark 11:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In a curious encounter, Jesus approaches a fig tree that appears to be flourishing with leaves but disappointingly bears no fruit. This tree, in its barrenness, symbolizes the hypocrisy of the Jewish hierarchy and the disappointment of unfulfilled promises. While it was not yet the season for figs to ripen, the empty display of leaves highlights the tree's promise without performance. Jesus sought fruit during a time when fruit could best be expected, revealing the unfruitfulness of the Jewish Church and delivering a powerful rebuke.
