# Mark 11:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, a curse is pronounced upon a fig tree that symbolizes the Jewish people and outwardly religious individuals. The tree's barrenness represents the lack of genuine righteousness and good works despite the appearance of religious devotion. The curse is a strong prohibition, signifying the utter ruin and destruction that will befall those who merely talk about righteousness but bear no fruits of grace and righteousness. Ultimately, they will face eternal punishment as dry wood fueling everlasting burnings.

### John Gill:
1. "This tree may not only be an emblem of the Jewish people, who made a great show of religion, and enjoyed a great many privileges; and from whom, speaking after the manner of men, the fruits of good works, righteousness, and holiness, might have been hoped and looked for; when instead thereof, there was nothing but talk about them, and an observance of some insignificant rites and traditions of the 'elders'; on which account, utter ruin and destruction ensued."
2. "But also of any outward professor of religion, who enjoying the means of grace, and making great pretensions to devotion and piety, it might be expected that he should do good works, well pleasing to God, and bring forth fruit to the glory of his name: whereas he only talks of good works, but does none; at least, no fruits of grace and righteousness are to be found on him."
3. "And at the last day, he will be cast as dry wood, as a withered branch, into everlasting burnings, being fit fuel for them."
