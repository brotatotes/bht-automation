# Mark 11:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, Jesus is in Jerusalem and the religious leaders are plotting to destroy Him, driven by their hatred of change and fear of losing their authority. They had already decided to kill Him and sought an opportunity to carry out their plan. The people, on the other hand, were amazed at Jesus' teachings, both in content and in the way He spoke with extraordinary authority and power. The leaders, however, were hesitant to arrest Him openly due to their fear of a public backlash.
