## Choicest Commentary Quotes:

1. "Matthew's inclusion of the ass in addition to the colt emphasizes the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecy, specifically Zechariah 9:9, which speaks of the Messiah coming 'humble and riding on a donkey, on a colt, the foal of a donkey.'"

2. "The presence of both the ass and the colt also symbolizes the dual nature of Jesus' mission. The ass represents humility and peace, while the colt represents royalty and triumph."

3. "By riding on the colt, Jesus is making a bold statement that he is the long-awaited Messiah, the King who comes in the name of the Lord. This act of riding on the colt is a declaration of his identity and purpose."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "A colt. Matthew mentions the mother, but Mark and Luke the colt only."

3. "Animals never yet worked were used for sacred purposes."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
