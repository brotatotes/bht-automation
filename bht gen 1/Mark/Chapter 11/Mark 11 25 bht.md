# Mark 11:25 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, believers are reminded of the importance of forgiveness in prayer. As John Gill notes, standing was a common posture during prayer. Jesus emphasizes the need for believers to forgive others, as emphasized by Archibald T. Robertson, as this demonstrates a willingness to extend the same forgiveness God offers. By doing so, believers can confidently approach God and expect their prayers to be answered, as John Wesley suggests. Ultimately, this verse encourages believers to approach prayer with a forgiving heart, free from anger and doubt.
