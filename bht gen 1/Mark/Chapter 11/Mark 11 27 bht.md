# Mark 11:27 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, Jesus encounters a confrontational group consisting of chief priests, scribes, and elders. Their challenge to his authority stems from their desire to preserve their own power rather than seek the truth. Jesus responds by exposing their hypocrisy and lack of genuine faith, demonstrating his divine wisdom. This passage serves as a powerful reminder that true authority comes from God alone, and Jesus, as the Son of God, possesses ultimate authority that should be recognized and acknowledged.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The parable of the wicked tenants is a powerful illustration of the rejection of Jesus by the religious leaders of his time. It highlights the greed, arrogance, and violence of those who sought to maintain their own power and control. It serves as a warning to all who would reject the authority and message of Jesus."

2. "The vineyard in the parable represents the kingdom of God, and the tenants symbolize the religious leaders who were entrusted with the care and stewardship of God's people. However, instead of fulfilling their responsibilities, they abused their position and mistreated those who were sent to collect the fruits of righteousness."

3. "The sending of the owner's son to the tenants represents the sending of Jesus into the world. It shows the incredible love and patience of God, who sent his own Son to reconcile humanity to himself. Yet, tragically, the tenants rejected and killed the son, foreshadowing the crucifixion of Jesus."

4. "The parable ends with a warning that the kingdom of God will be taken away from those who reject it and given to others who will produce its fruits. This serves as a reminder that God's grace and blessings are not to be taken for granted, and that those who refuse to acknowledge and accept Jesus as Lord will face the consequences of their rejection."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Walking in the temple. ‘As if at home, or in His Father’s house’ (J. A. Alexander)"

3. "He seems to have taught as He walked, which was not at all singular."

3. "A formal attack upon his authority" - The confrontation was not merely a casual disagreement, but a direct challenge to Jesus' authority, questioning his right to cleanse the temple and teach in it.

### John Gill:
1. "The Persic and Ethiopic versions read, 'he came', which must be understood with his disciples; for they never parted from him till he was apprehended in the garden."
2. "It was the day after the cursing of the fig tree, and two days after his public entrance into Jerusalem."
3. "There come to him the chief priests, and the Scribes, and the elders: the Jewish sanhedrim; for of these that great council of the nation consisted."

### John Wesley:
1. "The religious leaders were not interested in seeking the truth or understanding Jesus' authority; they were only concerned with preserving their own power and position." 

2. "Jesus' response to their question about his authority reveals his divine wisdom and knowledge. He turns the tables on them by asking a question they cannot answer, exposing their hypocrisy and lack of genuine faith." 

3. "This passage serves as a reminder that true authority comes from God and is not based on human credentials or positions of power. Jesus, as the Son of God, possesses ultimate authority and should be recognized as such."
