# Mark 11:29 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the question is posed in a confident manner, directed towards a group of individuals. The use of the preposition indicates the direction of the question, rather than adding anything more to it. The one who asks is not at all intimidated by the presence of a sizable assembly. By asking this question, the questioner seeks to establish the authority behind their actions.
