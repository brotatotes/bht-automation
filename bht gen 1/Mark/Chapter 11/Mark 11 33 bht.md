# Mark 11:33 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, there are those who refuse to take a stand on a specific matter, absolving Jesus from having to give a direct answer. They find themselves in a trap of their own making, unwilling to reveal what they truly know and thereby exposing themselves to judgment. Their self-imposed ignorance and reluctance to speak reveal their unwillingness to face the consequences of their actions and beliefs.
