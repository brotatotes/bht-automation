# Mark 11:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this passage, the disciples are sent to find a colt and bring it to Jesus. The identity of the person who sent the report, possibly Peter, creates intrigue. The term "ἄμφοδ" is interpreted as a winding, crooked lane or a way round, adding depth to the understanding of the location. The presence of the colt tied to the owner's house in the street indicates a public place for this significant event to take place.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:

2. "Wordsw. interprets it, 'the back way, which led round the house'" - This quote highlights a possible interpretation of the term "ἄμφοδ" as referring to a back way or path that encircled the house.

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Amfodon is literally any road which leads round a place or a block of buildings. Hence the winding way." 
2. "The word occurs only here in the New Testament. Rev., in the open street, which in an Eastern town is usually crooked." 
3. "It is a topographical note," says Dr. Morison, "that could only be given by an eye-witness."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Mark is more detailed here: perhaps Peter was one of those sent (comp. Luke 22:8), where Peter and John are the two sent into the city."
2. "At the door without. Probably the door of the owner’s house."
3. "In the open street, or, ‘lane.’ The E. V. following the Latin Vulgate, paraphrases: ‘in a place where two ways meet.’ The phrase refers first to a way round, i.e., round a block of houses, then to the street of a town (usually winding in the East)."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "The colt was outside the house in the street, but fastened (bound, perfect passive participle) to the door." 
2. "The word αμφοδος (from αμφω, both, and οδος, road) is difficult. It apparently means road around a thing, a crooked street as most of them were."
3. "And they loose him (κα λυουσιν αυτον). Dramatic present tense."
