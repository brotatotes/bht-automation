# Mark 12:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, a man is described as planting a vineyard, equipped with a wine-press trough on a sloping rock, carefully dug to catch the grape juice. The vineyard owner, symbolizing God the Father, entrusted the vineyard to workers, representing priests and Levites. This picturesque setting reflects a parabolic mood, evoking a sense of loneliness and reflection. The imagery of the vineyard and its elements gives insight into the profound spiritual truths being conveyed.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The wine-press was constructed in the side of a sloping rock, in which a trough was excavated, which was the wine press proper." 

2. "The word here used for the whole structure strictly means this trough underneath the press." 

3. "The word means simply went abroad."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "The circumstances called forth the parabolic mood, that of one whose heart is chilled, and whose spirit is saddened by a sense of loneliness, and who, retiring within himself, by a process of reflection, frames for his thoughts forms which half conceal, half reveal them" (Bruce).
2. "A pit for the winepress (υποληνιον). Only here in the N.T. Common in the LXX and in late Greek. Matthew had ληνον, winepress. This is the vessel or trough under the winepress on the hillside to catch the juice when the grapes were trodden."
3. "Husbandmen (γεωργοις). Workers in the ground, tillers of the soil (εργον, γη)."

### John Gill:
1. "A certain man planted a vineyard. The Persic version adds, 'with many trees': that is, with vines, though sometimes other trees, as fig trees, were planted in vineyards; see Luke 13:6. This man is, by the Evangelist Matthew, called an 'householder': by whom is meant God the Father, as distinguished from his Son." 

2. "And digged a place for the winefat. The Syriac and Arabic versions add, 'in it'; and the Persic version, 'in the vineyard'; for this was made in the vineyard, where they, trod and squeezed the grapes when gathered; and may design the altar in the house of the Lord, where the libations, or drink offerings, were poured out."

3. "And let it out to husbandmen; or 'workmen', as the Arabic version renders it, who wrought in it, and took care of the vines. The Ethiopic version renders it, 'and set over it a worker and keeper of the vineyard'; by whom are meant the priests and Levites, to whom were committed the care of the people, with respect to religious things."
