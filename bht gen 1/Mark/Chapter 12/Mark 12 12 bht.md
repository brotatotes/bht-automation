# Mark 12:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, the rulers are filled with fear and anger as they realize that Jesus spoke a parable against them. Despite their desire to seize Jesus, they are held back by their fear of the people, who have become enthusiastic supporters of Jesus. The parable in question directly applies to the rulers as those who have rejected the stone and acted as wicked husbandmen. The providence of God is shown as all things work together for the good of His children, with even the rulers being restrained by fear of the multitude.
