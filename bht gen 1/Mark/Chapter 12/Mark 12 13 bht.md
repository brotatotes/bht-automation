# Mark 12:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Pharisees and Herodians, normally opposing groups, united to trap Jesus. In their crafty question about paying taxes to Caesar, they sought to incriminate him no matter his response. However, Jesus gave a brilliant answer, asserting the importance of honoring both earthly authorities and God's authority. This verse reminds us of our dual citizenship as Christians, challenging us to examine if we are giving to God what is rightfully His and living a life pleasing to both God and man.
