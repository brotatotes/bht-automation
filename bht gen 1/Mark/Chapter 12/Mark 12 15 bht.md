# Mark 12:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, there is a parable about a servant who owed a significant debt, symbolizing the magnitude of our sin and our inability to repay it through our own efforts. It emphasizes that forgiveness and mercy are central to God's kingdom and cannot be earned through works or self-righteousness. Jesus, aware of the deceitful motives of those questioning him, uses their own hypocrisy to expose their ulterior motives and reveal his discernment and wisdom. The parable reminds us of God's abundant love and grace, freely available to all who come to Him, regardless of their worthiness.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The use of the term 'denarius' in this verse is significant because it was the standard wage for a day's labor in Roman times. This helps us understand the value of the coin and the magnitude of the debt that the servant owed." 

2. "The phrase 'the kingdom of heaven' in this verse refers to God's rule and reign. It emphasizes that forgiveness and mercy are central to God's kingdom and should be reflected in the lives of His followers."

3. "The servant's inability to pay his debt highlights the fact that no one can earn or repay their way into God's forgiveness. It is a gift that is freely given and cannot be earned through our own efforts."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The malignity of their hearts took the form of craft, pretending what they did not feel—an anxious desire to be guided aright in a matter which to a scrupulous few might seem a question of some difficulty."
2. "Seeing perfectly through this, He said unto them, Why tempt ye me?—'hypocrites!'"
3. "Bring me a penny that I may see it—'the tribute money'."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The penny, here mentioned, was the usual wages of a day-laborer, and was equivalent to about fifteen cents of our money. This small sum was sufficient to support a family in those times and places where the necessaries of life were cheap and easily procured."
2. "The penny given to each laborer represents the grace and mercy of God, which is freely given to all who come to Him, regardless of their background or worthiness."
3. "This parable teaches us that God's grace is not based on our merit or works, but on His abundant love and generosity. It reminds us that God's kingdom is not about fairness or equality in the worldly sense, but about His grace and the salvation He freely offers to all who believe in Him."
