By doing so, he reminds his listeners of their creation in the image of God and calls for their ultimate allegiance to God alone. Additionally, Jesus subtly critiques the oppressive Roman rule, reminding his followers that their true citizenship lies in the Kingdom of God, despite their earthly obligations. The coin bearing the image and name of the Roman emperor represents the authority and power held by Caesar, acknowledging the reality of Roman rule in their lives.
