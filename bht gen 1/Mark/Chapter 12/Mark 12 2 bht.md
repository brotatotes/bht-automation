1. "At the season (τω καιρω). For fruits as in the end of the sentence." 
2. "A servant (δουλον). Bondslave. Matthew has plural."
3. "Wounded in the head (εκεφαλιωσαν). An old verb (κεφαλαιω), to bring under heads (κεφαλη), to summarize. Then to hit on the head. Only here in the N.T."

### John Gill:
1. "The fruit of the vineyard: by the hands of his servants; for in Matthew it is, 'that they might receive', such as righteousness and judgment, truth and holiness, so as to give an account of them, which might have been expected from a people under such advantages." 

2. "The vineyard represents the people of Israel, who were chosen by God and given the privilege of bearing fruit for Him. The servant symbolizes the prophets who were sent to call upon the people to bring forth fruits of righteousness."

3. "The fourth year of the vineyard was considered holy to the Lord, and its fruit was not to be eaten until the fifth year. This highlights the expectation that after a certain period of time, the vineyard should have produced abundant fruit, which represents the righteous actions and obedience of the people."
