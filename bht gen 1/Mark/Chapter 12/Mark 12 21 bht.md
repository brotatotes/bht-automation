## BHT:
In this Bible verse, there is a command given to the eldest brother to marry his deceased brother's wife. If he refuses, the responsibility is passed down to the other brothers until it returns to the eldest. There is an option for the eldest to either marry or perform a symbolic act of removing his shoe. This tradition specifically applies to the firstborn among the brothers, ensuring that the deceased brother's name is carried on.

### John Gill:
1. "The command is, 'for the eldest' to marry his brother's wife: if he will not, they go to all the brethren; if they will not, they return to the eldest, and say, the command is upon thee, either pluck off the shoe, or marry." 

2. "From tradition, it is learned that it does not speak but of the firstborn among the brethren; and it is all one as if it was said, the eldest of the brethren shall succeed in the name of his brother that is dead."

3. "And they do not compel him to marry, but they compel him to pluck off the shoe; i.e. in case he will not marry."
