1. "This last clause, 'when they shall rise', is omitted in two copies of Beza's, and in the Syriac, Arabic, Persic, and Ethiopic versions, because, perhaps, it might be thought superfluous; but this is agreeably to the way of speaking and writing with the Jews."
2. "The question put on supposition of a resurrection, and that these seven brethren, and the wife they all had should rise, then is, whose wife shall she be of them? of the seven brethren; for the seven had her to wife."
3. "She was, according to law, the lawful wife of all seven; what particular and special claim could one have to her above the rest?"
