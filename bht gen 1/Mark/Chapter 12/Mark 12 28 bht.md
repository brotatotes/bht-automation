## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The motive, as shewn by the subordination of ἀκούσας to προσελθών, and of εἰδώς to ἐπηρώτησεν, seems to have been, admiration of our Lord’s wise answer, and a desire to be instructed further by Him."
2. "This was one of the μάχαι νομικαί (Tit 3:9), which was the greatest commandment. The Scribes had many frivolous enumerations and classifications of the commands of the law."
3. "πάντων, not πασῶν: πρώτη - πάντων is treated almost as one word, so that πάντων does not belong to ἐντ. understood, but, q. d. ‘first-of-all of the commandments.’"

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "When Matthew ( :-) therefore says he came 'tempting,' or 'trying him,' as one of the Pharisaic party who seemed to enjoy the defeat He had given to the Sadducees, we may suppose that though somewhat priding himself upon his insight into the law, and not indisposed to measure his knowledge with One in whom he had not yet learned to believe, he was nevertheless an honest-hearted, fair disputant."
2. "Which is the first commandment of all?—first in importance; the primary, leading commandment, the most fundamental one. This was a question which, with some others, divided the Jewish teachers into rival schools."
3. "Our Lord's answer is in a strain of respect very different from what He showed to cavillers—ever observing His own direction, 'Give not that which is holy to the dogs, neither cast ye your pearls before swine; lest they trample them under their feet, and turn again and rend you' (Matthew 7:6)."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "This scribe no doubt rejoiced in the defeat of the Sadducees, but was also really pleased with our Lord’s answers."
2. "The fearfully belittling tendencies of Pharisaical legalism may be inferred from the following statement: ‘The Jews enumerated six hundred and thirteen ordinances; three hundred and sixty-five prohibitions, according to the days of the year; two hundred and twenty-eight commandments, according to the parts of the body."
3. "The Pharisees distinguished between lesser and greater commandments."

### Archibald T Robertson:

2. "A few, among whom was the scribe, were constrained to admire, even if they were willing to criticize, the Rabbi who though not himself a Pharisee, surpassed the Pharisees as a champion of the truth."

2. "The answer here was with great solidity, and judgment, and strength of argument, to their utter confusion and silence."
