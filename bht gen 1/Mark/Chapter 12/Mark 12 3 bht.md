# Mark 12:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the Jewish prophets are depicted as being mistreated by their own people, symbolizing the harsh rejection they faced. They were not only physically assaulted but also stripped of their dignity and left empty-handed, unable to bring forth any meaningful results or message from the vineyard of the Lord. This portrayal highlights the brutality and lack of appreciation that the prophets experienced in their mission to bring divine truths to a stubborn nation.
