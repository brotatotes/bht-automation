### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Well [καλως]. Exclamatory, as one says good! on hearing something which he approves."
2. "The truth [επ αληθειας]. Incorrect. The phrase is adverbial; of a truth, in truth, truthfully, and qualifies the succeeding verb, thou hast said."
3. "For [οτι]. The A. V. begins a new and explanatory sentence with this word; but it is better with Rev. to translate that, and make the whole sentence continuous: Thou hast truthfully said that he is one."

### John Calvin:
1. "Mark alone mentions that the scribe was softened down; and it is worthy of notice that, though he had attacked Christ maliciously, and with the intention of taking him by surprise, not only does he silently yield to the latter, but openly and candidly assents to what Christ had said."
2. "Thus we see that he did not belong to the class of those enemies whose obstinacy is incurable; for, though they have been a hundred times convinced, yet they do not cease to oppose the truth in some manner."
3. "From this reply it may also be concluded, that Christ did not precisely include under these two words the rule of life, but embraced the opportunity which presented itself for reproving the false and hypocritical holiness of the scribes, who, giving their whole attention to outward ceremonies, almost entirely disregarded the spiritual worship of God, and cared little about brotherly kindness."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Without doubt the scribe spoke candidly, though Matthew states that his question was put, ‘tempting’ our Lord."
2. "He may have been chosen by the Pharisees as their unconscious tool, because of his candor."
