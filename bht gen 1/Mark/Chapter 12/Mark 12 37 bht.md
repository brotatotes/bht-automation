# Mark 12:37 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse under observation presents a moment of perplexity as commentators ask how to reconcile the concept of the Messiah being both David's son and his Lord. The passage indicates that a huge crowd, mainly the common people, were eagerly listening to Jesus, who was gaining popularity as a hero figure. While the masses relished hearing Christ, they did not necessarily accept Him as their Savior. Through this account, the verse brings to light the divine nature of the Messiah, emphasizing that He transcends being just a human descendant of David.
