# Mark 12:42 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In a crowd of generous givers, one particular individual caught Jesus' attention. She was a widowed and impoverished woman who freely offered her gift. This gift, described as "mites" or small coins, held significant value for her. These coins were likely the smallest in use among the Jews, comparable to an Italian farthing. Despite its minimal worth, the Jewish tradition recognized and accepted even the tiniest contributions from the poor.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The λεπτά, or the smallest Jewish coin, is equivalent to the פרוטות, as noted by Lightfoot." 
2. "Mark adds the explanation ὅ ἐστιν κοδ for his Roman readers, as the λεπτόν is equivalent to ⅛ of an as." 
3. "Bengel points out that two λεπτά are mentioned, suggesting that she could have kept back one."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The word translated 'mite' denotes a small coin made of brass - the smallest in use among the Jews."
2. "The precise value cannot now be easily estimated. It was much less than any coin we have."
3. "It was in value about three mills and a half, or one-third of a cent."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "A certain [μια] . Not a good translation. Lit., one as distinguished from the many rich." 
2. "Poor [πτωχη] . See on Matthew 5:3." 
3. "Mites [λεπτα] . From leptov, peeled, husked; and thence thin or fine. Therefore of a very small or thin coin."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "‘One’ in contrast with the ‘many’ just spoken of, not without a suggestion of her loneliness."
2. "The ‘mite’ (lepton) was the smallest Jewish copper coin. The Greek name means ‘fish-scale,’ suggesting its diminutive size."
3. "Mark (not Luke) adds for his Roman readers an explanation, using a Greek word (taken from the Latin) meaning the fourth part, as our word ‘farthing’ does."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "The πτωχος is the pauper rather than the mere peasant, the extreme opposite of the rich (πλουσιο)." 
2. "The money given by most was copper (χαλκον)."
3. "Two λεπτα were about two-fifths of a cent."

### John Gill:
1. "Among the many that came to offer their gifts freely, there came one that was particularly taken notice of by Christ; and she was a 'widow', had no husband to provide for her, and was a 'poor' one."
2. "These mites seem to be the same with the 'prutas', the Jews often speak of; who say that a 'pruta' is the eighth part of an Italian farthing."
3. "And that the Jews took the freewill offerings of the poor as well as the rich, though ever so little, is clear from this canon of theirs: 'a poor man that gives a 'pruta', or mite, into the alms dish, or a 'pruta' into the poor's chest, they take it of him; but if he does not give, they do not oblige him to give.'"

Note: The commentary is quite lengthy and contains a lot of historical and cultural information about the verse. I have selected the quotes that provide insight into the widow's situation and the significance of her offering.
