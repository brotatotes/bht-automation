# Mark 12:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This verse describes a conversation taking place privately and intimately, with a sense of responsibility and accountability. The characters involved are like tenants entrusted with the care of a vineyard, expected to produce fruit and yield a return on the landowner's investment. As they consult together, they recognize the rightful ownership and authority of another. Their motive, however, is rooted in self-interest and aimed at preserving their own power and control.

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The term 'husbandmen' refers to tenants or workers who are entrusted with the care and cultivation of a vineyard or farm. This highlights the idea that the landowner has entrusted his property to others, expecting them to produce fruit and yield a return on his investment."

2. "The use of the word 'husbandmen' also suggests a sense of responsibility and accountability. These individuals have a duty to faithfully tend to the land and ensure its productivity. They are not mere laborers, but stewards who are expected to manage the resources entrusted to them."

3. "The mention of 'husbandmen' in this verse serves as a metaphor for humanity's relationship with God. We are like tenants who have been given the gift of life and the resources of the earth. God expects us to use these blessings wisely, to bear fruit in our lives, and to give Him the honor and glory that is due."
