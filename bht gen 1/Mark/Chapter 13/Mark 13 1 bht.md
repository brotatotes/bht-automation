# Mark 13:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As they left the temple, Christ and his disciples marveled at the impressive stones and buildings that surrounded them. Josephus describes these stones as massive in size and superior in quality, with some measuring up to 50 feet long and weighing over a hundred tons. The strength and durability of the construction were evident even after continuous battering for six days. Christ's departure from the temple marked a significant moment, symbolizing his final separation from it and laying the groundwork for the profound events that were to come.
