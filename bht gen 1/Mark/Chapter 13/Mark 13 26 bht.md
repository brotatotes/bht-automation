# Mark 13:26 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we are presented with a vivid portrayal of the Second Personal Coming of Christ. The Son of man is described as coming in the clouds with great power and glory, symbolizing his arrival for judgment and to assert his regal claims. The mention of the clouds signifies the investiture of the Son of man in the kingdom, as seen in Daniel 7:13-14. This coming of Christ signifies the establishment of his kingdom and the manifestation of his power and glory, which is both a fulfillment of divine prophecy and an act of divine vengeance.
