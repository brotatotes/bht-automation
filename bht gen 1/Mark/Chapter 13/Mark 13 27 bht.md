# Mark 13:27 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
From the extremity of the visible plane of the earth, where the sky touches that plane on the other side, God's gathering of His elect shall span from the tip of the earth to the tip of heaven. This all-encompassing gathering illustrates the vastness and all-encompassing nature of God's power and authority. It is through the ministry of angels and the preaching of the Gospel that God's chosen ones from all corners of the earth will be gathered into a universal Church, obtained salvation by Christ, unto Christ, and into a Gospel church state.
