The disciples who approached him privately - Peter, John, James, and Andrew - were his chosen inner circle, trusted and favored disciples who sought his guidance and teachings in a more intimate setting. By asking Jesus privately, these disciples demonstrated their desire to deepen their understanding and strengthen their faith, showing their commitment to personal growth and spiritual development.
