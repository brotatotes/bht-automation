# Mark 13:32 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the commentators highlight the paradoxical nature of the knowledge of Jesus regarding the day and hour of a future event. While some argue that Jesus, as the Son of God, knows all things, others emphasize his self-limitation as the Son of Man. They also differentiate between the destruction of Jerusalem and the day of judgment, recognizing that Jesus' statement refers specifically to the latter. Overall, they shed light on the complexity of Jesus' divine and human natures and the mystery surrounding his knowledge in different contexts.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "We must not deal unfaithfully with a plain and solemn assertion of our Lord."
2. "He does not know it so as to reveal it to us."
3. "The account given by the orthodox Lutherans, as represented by Meyer, that our Lord knew this κατὰ κτῆσιν, but not κατὰ χρῆσιν, is right enough if at the same time it is carefully remembered, that it was this κτῆσις of which He emptied Himself when He became man for us."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "But of that day and that hour—that is, the precise time. knoweth no man—literally, no one." 
2. "This very remarkable statement regarding 'the Son' is peculiar to Mark." 
3. "Whether it means that the Son was not at that time in possession of the knowledge referred to, or simply that it was not among the things which He had received to communicate—has been a matter of much controversy."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "If Jesus had a divine nature, how could he say that he knew not the day and hour of a future event?"
2. "The passage means, 'that day and hour none makes known, neither the angels, nor the Son, but the Father.'"
3. "He had a human nature. He grew as a man in knowledge. As a man his knowledge must be finite, for the faculties of the human soul are not infinite."
