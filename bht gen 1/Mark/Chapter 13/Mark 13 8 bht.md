# Mark 13:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
By using repetitions and emphasizing the certainty and importance of future events, this verse speaks of the beginnings of sorrows and travail-pangs. It highlights the convulsions in the Roman world before the destruction of Jerusalem, with its rival claimants of power. The repetition also serves to highlight the conflicts between nations and the Jews, particularly during the siege of Jerusalem. Comparing these sorrows to the pains of a woman in labor, it signifies that though they are just the beginnings, they foreshadow the even greater events that will follow.
