# Mark 14:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we see the calculated and secretive plot of Judas to betray Jesus. Judas sought a convenient opportunity, one that would not lead to an uproar or riot among the people. He continuously searched for the right moment, one that would allow him to betray Jesus discreetly and effectively. Judas, driven by his own greed, agreed to betray Jesus for thirty pieces of silver, a sum equivalent to a slave's price. This deceitful act of betrayal was enabled by Judas' knowledge of Jesus' habits and the trust placed in him as one of Jesus' own disciples.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "And he sought how he might conveniently betray him... That he should avoid an 'uproar' or 'riot' among the people, which probably was made an essential condition by the Jewish authorities, was thus assented to by the traitor." 
2. "Had we only the first three Gospels, we should have concluded that our Lord was led immediately to Caiaphas, and had before the Council. But as the Sanhedrim could hardly have been brought together at the dead hour of night... we should have had some difficulty in knowing what was done with Him during those intervening hours."
3. "This successful Annas... appears, however, to have possessed vast influence, having obtained the high priesthood, not only for his son Eleazar, and his son-in-law Caiaphas, but subsequently for four other sons, under the last of whom James, the brother of our Lord, was put to death."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "He kept seeking: busied himself continuously from that time." 
2. "Conveniently, he might find a good opportunity." 
3. "Money."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The treachery of Judas as a veritable dispensation of Providence amply justifying their plots against Jesus." 

2. "He claimed that he knew enough of the habits of Jesus to enable them to catch him 'in the absence of the multitude' without waiting for the passover to be over." 

3. "Mark merely notes the promise of 'money' while Matthew mentions 'thirty pieces of silver,' the price of a slave."

### John Gill:
1. "That such an opportunity offered, and from such a quarter, by one of his own disciples; so that it might be done more secretly and effectually, and with less blame to themselves."
2. "Any sum he should ask; and what was agreed upon were thirty pieces, or shekels of silver."
3. "After this promise, and upon this agreement: henceforward he sought the most fitting opportunity, and the best season of betraying his master into the hands of these men."
