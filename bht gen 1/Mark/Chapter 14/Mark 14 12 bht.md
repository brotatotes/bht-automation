# Mark 14:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
During the Passover meal, Jesus and his disciples commemorated the liberation of the Israelites from Egypt, unaware that it would mark a pivotal moment in salvation history. As they observed this tradition, Jesus revealed his role as the ultimate Passover Lamb, whose sacrificial death would bring salvation to believers. The unleavened bread, symbolizing the haste of the Israelites' departure from Egypt, took on new significance as it represented Jesus' body, to be broken for the forgiveness of sins and the establishment of a new covenant of eternal life.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "ὅτε τὸ π. ἔθυον, like Luke’s expression ᾗ ἔδει θύεσθαι τὸ π., denotes the ordinary day, when they (i.e. the Jews) sacrificed the Passover."
2. "We may notice that if this Gospel, as traditionally reported, was drawn up under the superintendence of Peter, we could hardly have failed to have the names of the two disciples given."
3. "It becomes a duty to warn students of the sacred word against fanciful interpretations."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "The paschal lamb (note πασχα) was slain at 6 P.M., beginning of the fifteenth of the month." 

2. "The preparations were made beforehand on the fourteenth (Thursday)." 

3. "See on Matthew 26:17 for discussion of 'eat the passover.'"

### John Gill:
1. "Their canon runs thus, 'an Israelite kills (the passover), and a priest receives (the blood), and gives it to his neighbor, and his neighbor to his neighbor, and he receives (the basin) full, and returns it empty; the priest that is near to the altar sprinkles it, at one sprinkling, over against the bottom of it.'" This commentary highlights the process of how the passover was prepared and shared among the people.

2. "The slaying of the passover by strangers; that is, such as are not priests, lawful." This quote emphasizes that it was permissible for non-priests to participate in the slaying of the passover, as long as it was done according to the prescribed regulations.

3. "But then it was always killed in the court of the temple, and after the middle of the day." This statement clarifies the specific time and location where the passover was to be killed, reinforcing the importance of following the established customs and traditions.

### John Wesley:
1. "The Passover meal was a significant event in Jewish culture, commemorating the liberation of the Israelites from slavery in Egypt. Jesus and his disciples were observing this tradition, but little did they know that this particular Passover would mark the beginning of a new era in salvation history."

2. "By choosing to celebrate the Passover with his disciples, Jesus was not only affirming his Jewish identity but also foreshadowing his role as the ultimate Passover Lamb. Just as the blood of the lamb protected the Israelites from the angel of death, Jesus' sacrificial death would bring salvation and deliverance to all who believe in him."

3. "The unleavened bread served during the Passover meal symbolized the haste with which the Israelites left Egypt. In the context of Jesus' Last Supper, this bread takes on a deeper meaning. It represents his body, which would be broken for the forgiveness of sins. Through this act, Jesus was establishing a new covenant, one that would bring eternal life to all who partake in it."
