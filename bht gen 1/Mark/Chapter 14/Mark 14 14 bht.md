## BHT:
The Bible verse being described involves a word that is not commonly used in classical literature, but in the context of the verse, it signifies a place of rest or lodging. The verse also mentions a "goodman of the house," who is the owner and master of the house. This goodman may have some knowledge and faith in Christ, even if it is not openly expressed. Additionally, the verse refers to a guest chamber, specifically prepared for the expected guests, where Christ would eat the passover with his disciples.
