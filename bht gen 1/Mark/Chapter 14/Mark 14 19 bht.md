# Mark 14:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
With an adverb of distribution and a broken construction suitable to the Evangelist's graphic tendency, the verse creates a sense of unity among the disciples. Their sorrow arises from the impact of Christ's words, prompting them to question their own loyalty and acknowledge the possibility of betrayal within their midst. The omission of Judas' question and the reference to John 13:23-30 further deepen the significance of their individual introspection in light of Christ's impending betrayal.
