# Mark 14:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The religious leaders, aware of the potential for unrest among the large gathering of people during the feast, carefully planned the timing of Jesus' arrest. Their concern for maintaining control and avoiding any disruption to their plans is evident. They were cautious and strategic in their approach, keenly aware of the power and following that Jesus possessed. Their fear and insecurity were evident, as they prioritized their own authority and control over seeking truth or considering the impact on the people.
