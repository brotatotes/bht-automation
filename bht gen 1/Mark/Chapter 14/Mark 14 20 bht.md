# Mark 14:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we see a heartbreaking portrayal of betrayal and deception. The betrayer, who has an incredibly close relationship with the Betrayed, is described as one who dips in the same dish, symbolizing their intimacy and camaraderie. This act of dipping also signifies the act of serving and hospitality, reminding us of Jesus' humble nature. The moment of betrayal is depicted as a sudden revelation, and the betrayer is fully aware that their treachery has been exposed.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "This description of the traitor here again does not seem to designate one especially, nor to describe an action at that moment proceeding, but, as before, pathetically to describe the near relation of the betrayer to the Betrayed."
2. "Now however the relation pointed out is still closer than before, it is that of one dipping in the same dish."
3. "One of those nearest and most trusted."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The Greek word used here for 'dish' is 'τρυβλιον' which refers to a shallow bowl or platter used for serving food. This detail helps us understand the context of the verse and the significance of the action being described."

2. "The mention of the dish in this verse highlights the intimate nature of the Last Supper. Jesus was reclining at the table with his disciples, sharing a meal together. This emphasizes the close relationship and fellowship they had with one another."

3. "The dish also symbolizes the act of serving and hospitality. In this context, it reminds us of Jesus' humble and selfless nature, as he willingly took on the role of a servant to wash his disciples' feet. It serves as a powerful example of love and humility for all believers."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "The sign that Jesus gave, the one dipping in the dish with me, escaped the notice of all."
