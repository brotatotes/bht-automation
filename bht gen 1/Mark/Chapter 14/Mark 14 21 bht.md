This verse reflects the departure of the son of man from the world, as predicted in both the book of divine decrees and the writings of the Old Testament. The betrayal of the son of man is lamented, with emphasis on the gravity of the betrayer's sin, which cannot be excused or diminished by fulfilling God's decrees and fulfilling the prophecies of Scripture. The severity of the betrayer's actions is underscored, as the verdict is passed that it would have been better for him to never have been born.
