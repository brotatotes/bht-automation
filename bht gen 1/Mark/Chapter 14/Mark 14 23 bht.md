# Mark 14:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, Jesus takes an ordinary cup of wine mixed with water and blesses it, giving thanks for its purpose. He then shares the cup with his disciples, symbolizing his love and care for them. Interestingly, everyone, including Judas, drinks from it, highlighting Jesus' inclusivity and forgiveness. This account closely aligns with the description in 1 Corinthians 11:23-26, where Paul claims to have received the details of this event through direct revelation from the Lord Jesus.
