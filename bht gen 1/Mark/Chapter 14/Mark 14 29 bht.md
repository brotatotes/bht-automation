# Mark 14:29 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, we find Peter making a bold declaration of loyalty amidst the prediction that all his companions will turn away. The commentators note how Peter's claim stands out, emphasizing the seriousness of the situation. The verse also highlights the exceptional force of Peter's statement, hinting at the magnitude of his commitment. However, the commentators also point out the superficiality of Peter's conviction, as it is based on self-confidence rather than a genuine awareness of his own frailty.
