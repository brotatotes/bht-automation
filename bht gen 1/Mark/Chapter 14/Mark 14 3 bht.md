## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The modern interpretations of the word are principally of two kinds: the first, agreeing with Euth. and Theophyl., ‘genuine,’ ‘unadulterated;’ which sense however of the word does not any where else occur."
2. "The uncertainty being so great, the best rendering would be to leave the word untranslated, as Jer. Taylor does in his 'Life of Christ' (sect. 15): 'Nard Pistick.'"
3. "Bp. Wordsw. sees in the word the mystical sense, that 'offerings to Christ should be ... the fruits of a lively and loving πίστις, or faith, in Him.'"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Mary...having an alabaster box of ointment of spikenard—pure nard, a celebrated aromatic—very precious." 
2. "She broke the box and poured it on his head...and anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped His feet with her hair." 
3. "The house was filled with the odor of the ointment."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The best authorities define it genuine or unadulterated: pure nard." 
2. "Possibly by striking the brittle neck of the flask." 
3. "This detail is peculiar to Mark."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Ointment. John: ‘a pound,’ etc." 
2. "Spikenard, or ‘nard pistic.’ ‘Nard’ means an oriental gum, but the Greek word ‘pistic’ is akin to the word meaning ‘faithful,’ and probably refers to the purity of the precious gum."
3. "She brake the box. Crushing the neck of the cruse with the hand. See notes on Matthew. Mark alone gives this detail."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Matthew 26:7 uses ανακειμενου, both words meaning reclining (leaning down or up or back) and in the genitive absolute."
2. "The adjective πιστικος is common enough in the older Greek and appears in the papyri also in the sense of genuine, unadulterated, and that is probably the idea here."
3. "She probably broke the narrow neck of the vase holding the ointment."

### John Gill:
1. "A place he often went to, and from, the last week of his life."
2. "Ointment made of nard was...the principal among ointments."
3. "She poured it on his head."

### John Wesley:
1. "This passage highlights the extravagant love and devotion of a woman who poured expensive perfume on Jesus' head. It serves as a powerful reminder of the value of sacrificial worship and the importance of giving our best to God."

2. "The act of pouring the perfume on Jesus' head symbolizes anointing, which was a significant act in biblical times to honor and set apart someone for a special purpose. This woman's action demonstrates her recognition of Jesus' divinity and her desire to honor and worship Him."

3. "The disciples' reaction to the woman's act reveals their lack of understanding and appreciation for the magnitude of Jesus' sacrifice. It serves as a cautionary reminder for us not to underestimate or undervalue the worth of our worship and devotion to Christ."

4. "Jesus' response to the disciples' criticism shows His acceptance and appreciation of the woman's act. He commends her for her understanding of His impending death and burial, and declares that her act of devotion will be remembered and spoken of wherever the gospel is preached."

5. "This passage challenges us to examine our own worship and devotion to Jesus. Are we willing to pour out our best, our most valuable possessions, and our very lives for Him? It calls us to a radical and sacrificial love for Christ, recognizing His worthiness of our all."
