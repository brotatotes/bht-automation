# Mark 14:31 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the narrator tells us that someone is speaking with great intensity and repeating their words emphatically. This demonstrates the person's strong denial or affirmation of something. This person is making a bold assertion, even to the point of claiming they will not deny someone even if it means facing death. Interestingly, others also make similar declarations, highlighting the shared conviction or loyalty among them. These statements reveal the passion, conviction, and commitment of the individuals involved.
