## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "ἀββᾶ = אַבָּא, an Aramaic form, and after Mark’s manner inserted, as ‘Ephphatha,’ ch. Mark 7:34, ‘Talitha cum,’ ch. Mark 5:41." 
2. "ὁ πατήρ is not the interpretation of ἀββᾶ, but came to be attached to it in one phrase, as a form of address."
3. "Meyer rightly supplies the ellipsis after ἀλλ ʼ: nevertheless, the question is not …: not οὐ γινέσθω, which would not come into construction with τί … τί."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "‘Abba’ is the word for ‘Father’ in the dialect of that time and country." 
2. "‘Abba Father’ came into general use as an address to God, probably from our Lord’s use of the former word."
3. "Howbeit, not what I will. The form differs from that of Matthew, and might be paraphrased: ‘But, the great question is, not what I will, but what thou wilt.’"

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Abba, Father (Αββα ο πατηρ). Both Aramaic and Greek and the article with each. This is not a case of translation, but the use of both terms as is Galatians 4:6, a probable memory of Paul's childhood prayers." 

2. "It is not possible to take the language of Jesus as fear that he might die before he came to the Cross. He was heard (Hebrews 5:7) and helped to submit to the Father's will as he does instantly."

3. "We see the humanity of Jesus in its fulness both in the Temptations and in Gethsemane, but without sin each time. And this was the severest of all the temptations, to draw back from the Cross. The victory over self brought surrender to the Father's will."

### John Gill:
1. "Abba, Father": or "my Father, my Father"; expressing the vehemency of his affection and strong confidence in God amidst his distress.
2. "All things are possible unto thee": suggesting that God could easily provide a solution, and Christ acknowledges that everything consistent with God's perfections, counsels, and covenant is possible for Him.
3. "Take away this cup from me; nevertheless, not what I will, but what thou wilt": Christ submits to God's sovereign will, demonstrating his obedience and surrender to God's plan.

### John Wesley:
1. "Abba, Father" - This phrase emphasizes the intimate and personal relationship between God and his children. It reflects the deep love and closeness that believers can experience with their heavenly Father.

2. "By way of explication" - St. Mark's addition of the word "Father" helps to clarify and further define the term "Abba." It highlights the paternal nature of God and reinforces the idea that believers can approach him with the same trust and affection as a child would approach their earthly father.

3. "Emphasizes the familial bond" - The use of the term "Abba, Father" underscores the familial bond between God and his children. It reminds believers of their adoption into God's family through Christ, and the privilege they have to call him their loving Father. This understanding brings comfort, security, and a sense of belonging to believers' relationship with God.
