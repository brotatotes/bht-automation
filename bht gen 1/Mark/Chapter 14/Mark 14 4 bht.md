# Mark 14:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we see a complex scene unfold where a woman pours expensive ointment on Jesus' head as an act of worship and devotion. While some disciples, including Judas, are filled with indignation and question the purpose of this act, others recognize the profound significance of her gesture. The diverse reactions and actions of the disciples, incited by Judas, invite us to reflect on our own devotion to Jesus and consider the various factors that shape our response to acts of worship and sacrifice.

2. "Doubtless the thought stirred first in his breast, and issued from his base lips and some of the rest, ignorant of his true character and feelings, and carried away by his plausible speech, might for the moment feel some chagrin at the apparent waste."
3. "Why was this waste of the ointment made?"

### Marvin Vincent:

### John Wesley:
1. "Some had indignation" - This shows that not everyone was supportive of the actions being taken. It highlights the diversity of opinions and reactions within the group.

2. "Being incited thereto by Judas" - Judas played a role in influencing others to feel indignant. This suggests that he may have had ulterior motives or personal grievances that drove his actions.

3. "Probably to the women" - This comment hints at the possibility that the indignation was directed towards the women involved in the situation. It raises questions about gender dynamics and societal expectations at that time.
