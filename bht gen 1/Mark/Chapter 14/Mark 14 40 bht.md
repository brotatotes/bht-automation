# Mark 14:40 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the disciples are depicted as being weighed down and burdened, carrying a heavy load of responsibility, possibly causing weariness and oppression. They are unable to comprehend or respond appropriately, either due to their own lack of understanding or physical exhaustion. Their inability to fully sympathize with Jesus in his greatest trials stems from weakness, confusion, shame, and a combination of sleep and sorrow. This verse serves as a reminder that during trying times, we can seek strength and solace in God, who is ready to assist us in carrying our burdens.

1. "The word 'heavy' in this verse conveys the idea of being weighed down, burdened, or oppressed. It suggests a sense of heaviness and weariness that comes from carrying a heavy load or being under great pressure."

2. "The Greek word 'καταβαρυνομενοι' used here emphasizes the intensity of the burden, indicating that it is not just a light or temporary burden, but one that is significant and overwhelming."

3. "This verse reminds us that in our journey of faith, we may encounter seasons where we feel weighed down by the challenges, trials, and responsibilities of life.
