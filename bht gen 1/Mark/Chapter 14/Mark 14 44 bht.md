# Mark 14:44 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we see a later Greek word, "σύσσημον," used as a token or a common sign among the disciples. There is speculation that Judas' ironic use of the word "ἀπάγετε ἀσφαλῶς" suggests his intention to ensure Jesus' safekeeping. However, the despicable act of betraying Jesus with a kiss shows the hypocrisy in Judas' reverence. While Mark and Matthew don't mention it, there was also a significant moment when Jesus challenged the crowd with Judas and they all fell back upon the ground.
