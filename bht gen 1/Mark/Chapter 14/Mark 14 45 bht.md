# Mark 14:45 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we witness the heartbreaking scene where Judas approaches Jesus with a deceitful kiss, an act that was not driven by genuine affection, but rather by treacherous intent. The kiss, carried out in the presence of the soldiers, serves as a stark reminder of humanity's capacity for betrayal, even among those who are close to Jesus. It also emphasizes the contrast between outward displays of loyalty and internal motives, urging us to reflect on our own hearts and devotion to Christ.
