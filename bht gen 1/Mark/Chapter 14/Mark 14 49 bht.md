# Mark 14:49 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we witness the significance of Jesus' presence within the temple, as John Gill notes, "I was daily with you in the temple... teaching." However, despite this, the people did not seize or capture him, as Gill suggests, "And ye took me not; did not attempt to lay hands on him, seize him, and carry him away." This event, as Gill explains, fulfills the Scriptures, which foretold the betrayal by Judas and the disciples' subsequent flight, illustrating the divine orchestration behind each unfolding step.
