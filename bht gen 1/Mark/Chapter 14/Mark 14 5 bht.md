## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "This he said," remarks John (John 12:6), and the remark is of exceeding importance, "not that he cared for the poor but because he was a thief, and had the bag"—the scrip or treasure chest—"and bare what was put therein." 

2. What a remarkable arrangement was this, by which an avaricious and dishonest person was not only taken into the number of the Twelve, but entrusted with the custody of their little property!

3. The purposes which this served are obvious enough; but it is further noticeable, that the remotest hint was never given to the Eleven of his true character, nor did the disciples most favored with the intimacy of Jesus ever suspect him, till a few minutes before he voluntarily separated himself from their company—for ever!

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The word used here for 'murmured' carries the connotation of deep indignation and disapproval. It suggests that the people were not just expressing a casual complaint, but rather a strong and intense reaction to what Jesus was saying or doing."

2. "This word implies that the people were not just murmuring among themselves, but that they were vocalizing their discontent and dissatisfaction with Jesus. It reveals their lack of faith and their resistance to accepting his teachings."

3. "The use of this word highlights the contrast between the people's negative response and Jesus' unwavering commitment to his mission. Despite the murmuring and opposition, Jesus remained steadfast in his purpose and continued to teach and minister to those who were willing to listen and receive his message."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The original seems to indicate a harsh address to Mary." 
2. "There was probably also a general murmur against her." 
3. "The murmuring against Mary highlights the disapproval and judgment of those present."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The use of 'far above' may be a detail from Peter's memory of Judas' objection whose name in this connection is preserved in John 12:4."
2. "Imperfect tense of this striking word used of the snorting of horses and seen already in Mark 1:43; Mark 11:38."
3. "Judas made the complaint against Mary of Bethany, but all the apostles joined in the chorus of criticism of the wasteful extravagance."
