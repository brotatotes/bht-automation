# Mark 14:51 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this intense moment, a young man, not one of Christ's disciples, was suddenly awakened by the commotion and rushed out of his nearby house, wrapped only in a sheet. This incident serves as a striking example of the relentless cruelty of those who opposed Jesus, seizing anyone suspected of being His follower. However, despite the violence directed at this innocent bystander, the disciples themselves remained untouched, a testament to the miraculous protection they received from Christ.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "It is impossible to determine, and therefore idle to enquire, who this was." 
2. "The disciples were not laid hold of: this person perhaps was throwing some obstacle in the way of the removal of Jesus."
3. "Or he may have been laid hold of merely in wantonness, from his unusual garb."

### Marvin Vincent:

### John Calvin:
1. "The chief point is, to ascertain for what purpose Mark has related this transaction."
2. "I think that his object was, to inform us that those wicked men — as usually happens in riotous assemblies stormed and raved without shame or modesty."
3. "We certainly perceive — as I just now said — that those wicked men raged with cruel violence, when they did not even spare a poor young man, who had left his bed, almost naked, and run, on hearing the noise."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "A certain young man. Not one of the Apostles, all of whom had fled (Mark 14:50), but a disciple." 
2. "He may have been seized because of some expression of sympathy, or simply because of his strange attire."
3. "On his naked body. He had just risen from bed, having probably been asleep in a house near by, possibly on the ‘place’ itself."
