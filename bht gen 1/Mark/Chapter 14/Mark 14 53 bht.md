## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1) "Caiaphas, de facto, and in the view of our narrator; so Matt. and Luke: but Jesus was first taken before Annas, who was de jure the high-priest: see John 18:12-23."
2) "It is not easy to interpret συνέρχονται αὐτῷ. Meyer, relying on the fact that the dative after συνέρχεσθαι is always one of companionship, maintains that αὐτῷ refers to our Lord 'there come with him.'"
3) "I venture therefore to prefer the usual construction of the words, 'there come together to him.'"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "It was then a full and formal meeting of the Sanhedrim."
2. "The natural impression is that the scene around the fire took place overnight."
3. "If our Lord had to be transferred from the residence of Annas to that of Caiaphas, one is apt to wonder that there is no mention of His being marched from the one to the other."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Mark mentions the three orders of the Sanhedrin." This highlights the significance of the high-priest's presence, indicating the involvement of the religious authorities in Jesus' trial.
