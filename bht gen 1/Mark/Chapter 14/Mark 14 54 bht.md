# Mark 14:54 Commentary Help Text

In this particular Bible verse, we see the practical function of light, which provides illumination and enables activities to take place. The light of the fire in the courtyard shines on Peter's face, making him recognizable to those around him. Peter follows Jesus at a distance, unwilling to openly stand with him, yet unable to stay away. Despite his attempts to hide, the light of the fire reveals his presence, emphasizing the irony of his denials.
