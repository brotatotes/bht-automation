# Mark 14:55 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this passage, the commentators highlight the motives and actions of the religious authorities. They eagerly sought evidence, even if false, to bring Jesus before Pilate. Despite their determination, they struggled to find valid charges against him. Their efforts to condemn him were driven by their authority and the rewards they could gain from his death. Yet, their quest for evidence ultimately revealed the overruling providence of God, as no credible witnesses could be found to support their accusations.
