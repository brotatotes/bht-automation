The commentators allude to the connections with Daniel 2:34 and John 2:19, emphasizing the misunderstood meaning of Jesus' words and the witnesses' flawed understanding. Furthermore, they point out the unjust accusations against Jesus, which serve as a silent testimony to his blameless conduct throughout his ministry.
