# Mark 14:64 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, Jesus is accused of blasphemy, a grave offense in Jewish law. The religious leaders unanimously condemn him to death, reflecting the severity of the situation. Jesus, the Blessed One, is shamefully mistreated, indicating the suffering and humiliation he will endure. The accusation not only reveals the hostility of the religious leaders but also foreshadows the purpose of Jesus' crucifixion - to bear the weight of humanity's sins and bring redemption to those who believe in him. The absence of certain figures, such as Joseph of Arimathea and Nicodemus, reflects their dissent or sympathetic support for Jesus.
