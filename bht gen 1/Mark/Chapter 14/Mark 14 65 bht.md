# Mark 14:65 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the men who held Jesus mock him, casting jeers and demanding him, as the Christ, to prophesy who struck him. The use of the verb "ἔλαβον" may seem harsh, but its presence in multiple manuscripts suggests authenticity. The unique text of the Codex Bezæ, deviating from other manuscripts, provides insight into the history of the text. The cruelty is attributed to members of the Sanhedrin, who blindfold Jesus and subject him to physical abuse. His endurance of abuse fulfills prophecy and exemplifies the humiliation he experienced.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Prophesy, who smote thee?" - Matt. and Luke explain this question that was asked to Jesus when the sentence was pronounced. (Quote 65)

2. "The reading ἔλαβον is harsh in sense, but the coincidence of ἐλάμβανον in [47] [48] alli [49] . seems to stamp it with genuineness." - The use of the verb "ἔλαβον" in this context may seem harsh, but its presence in multiple manuscripts suggests its authenticity. (Quote 65)

3. "The text of the Codex Bezæ is a very peculiar one, deviating more from the received readings and from the principal manuscript authorities than any other." - The Codex Bezæ, a significant manuscript, has a unique text that differs greatly from other manuscripts, making it an important source for understanding the history of the text. (Quote 47)

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "And the men that held Jesus mocked him"—or cast their jeers at Him. (Also see on Matthew 26:67- :.)
2. "Prophesy unto us, thou Christ, Who is he that smote Thee?" The sarcastic fling at Him as "the Christ," and the demand of Him in this character to name the unseen perpetrator of the blows inflicted on Him, was in them as infamous as to Him it must have been, and was intended to be, stinging.
3. "I gave My back to the smiters, and My cheeks to them that plucked off the hair: I hid not My face from shame and spitting!" (Luke 22:64- :). "And many other things blasphemously spake they against Him" (Luke 22:65).

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Palms of their hands [ραπισμασιν]. An unclassical word, but used also by John (xix. 3). The word means blows."
2. "Did strike. Following the old reading, eballon. The Correct reading is elabon, received."
3. "Received him into custody."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The context (Mark 14:64) points to members of the Sanhedrin as engaged in this cruelty."
2. "The officers. Probably those who had been by the fire (Mark 14:54)."
3. "Received him with blows of their hands. The correct reading is thus translated, describing the conduct of the officers when they received Jesus again as their prisoner."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Put a veil around his face." 
2. "All three Gospels give the jeering demand of the Sanhedrin: 'Prophesy.'" 
3. "The verb ραπιζω in Matthew 26:67 originally meant to smite with a rod. In late writers it comes to mean to slap the face with the palm of the hands."

### John Gill:
1. "The men that held him, fulfilling the prophecy in Isaiah 50:6."
2. "To blindfold him, as a person unworthy to behold the light."
3. "They gave him slaps on the face."

These quotes highlight the fulfillment of prophecy, the humiliation and dehumanization of Jesus, and the physical abuse he endured at the hands of the officers of the high priest.
