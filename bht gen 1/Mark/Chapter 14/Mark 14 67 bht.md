## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "His demeanor and timidity, which must have attracted notice, as so generally happens, 'leading,' says OLSHAUSEN, 'to the recognition of him.'" 
2. "The sense of this is given in John's report of it (John 18:17), 'Art not thou also one of this man's disciples?' that is, thou as well as 'that other disciple,' whom she knew to be one, but did not challenge, perceiving that he was a privileged person." 
3. "If so expressed in Peter's hearing—drawing upon him the eyes of every one that heard it (as we know it did, John 18:17- :), and compelling him to answer to it—that would explain the different forms of the report naturally enough."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The use of the term 'Nazarene' in contempt highlights the disdain and mockery that Jesus faced during his trial. It serves as a reminder of the opposition and rejection he experienced from those who did not believe in him." 

2. "This accusation not only identifies Jesus as a Nazarene, but also associates him with a specific group of people who were despised and looked down upon. It underscores the social and cultural challenges that Jesus had to overcome in order to fulfill his mission." 

3. "The mention of Jesus being with the Nazarenes emphasizes his identification with the marginalized and outcasts of society. It reveals his solidarity with those who were considered insignificant and unworthy, reflecting his message of love, compassion, and inclusion."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Warming himself (θερμαινομενον). Mark mentions this fact about Peter twice (Mark 14:54; Mark 14:67) as does John (John 18:18; John 18:25). He was twice beside the fire." 

2. "It is quite difficult to relate clearly the three denials as told in the Four Gospels. Each time several may have joined in, both maids and men." 

3. "The Nazarene (του Ναζαρηνου). In Matthew 26:69 it is 'the Galilean.' A number were probably speaking, one saying one thing, another another."

### John Gill:
1. "She looked upon him; very earnestly, knowing him to be the same." This quote highlights the intensity of the woman's gaze as she recognizes Peter and realizes his association with Jesus. It emphasizes her keen observation and perception.

2. "And thou also wast with Jesus of Nazareth." This quote captures the woman's accusation against Peter, implying that he was a follower of Jesus. It reveals her awareness of Peter's connection to Jesus and sets the stage for Peter's denial.

3. "At the life which was in the midst of the hall." This quote draws attention to the contrast between the warmth and life inside the hall where Peter was warming himself and the hostile environment outside. It adds depth to the setting and enhances the understanding of Peter's situation.
