# Mark 15:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The religious authorities utilized fear and manipulation to influence the crowd, even employing officers to stir them up, as the politicians were more concerned with maintaining their power than recognizing the innocence of Jesus. The high priest Caiaphas was filled with envy and malice, choosing to release a murderer instead of the holy and just one. The clash between the established religious leaders and the prophet Jesus revealed the depths of their corruption and disregard for righteousness.
