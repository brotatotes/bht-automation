### John Gill:
1. "The repetition of the cry 'crucify him' emphasizes the intensity of the crowd's demand for Jesus' crucifixion. It reveals the deep-seated hostility and rejection that Jesus faced from the people who had once hailed him as the Messiah." 

2. "The fact that Matthew and Mark do not mention the previous cry for Jesus' crucifixion, but Luke does, highlights the different perspectives and details that each Gospel writer chose to include. It reminds us that the Gospels are not identical accounts, but rather unique testimonies that complement and enrich one another."
