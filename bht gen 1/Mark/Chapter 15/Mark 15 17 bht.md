# Mark 15:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The text describes a scene where Jesus, mocked as the "King of the Jews," is dressed in a robe that is referred to both as purple and scarlet. The commentators note that these colors were associated with royalty and power, emphasizing the irony and humiliation Jesus endured. The robe is placed on Jesus' head like a garland, accompanied by a crown made of thorns, which symbolizes the ridicule he faced. The soldiers' actions and choice of attire are not only intended to mock Jesus, but also to reject his authority as King.
