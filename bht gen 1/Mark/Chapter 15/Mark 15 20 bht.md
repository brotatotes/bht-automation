As Jesus is led out of the city, we see the immediate and forceful nature of his removal, emphasizing the deliberate action taken by those who wanted to unking him.

Yet, amidst the ridicule, Jesus willingly carries his own cross, symbolizing his submission to the Father's will and his sacrifice for humanity's redemption. Ultimately, the crucifixion represents a profound spiritual event, fulfilling God's divine plan for salvation.
