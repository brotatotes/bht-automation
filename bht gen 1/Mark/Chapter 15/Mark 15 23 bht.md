# Mark 15:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we see that Jesus was offered wine mixed with myrrh, which could be translated as vinegar mixed with gall. This substance was typically given to those about to die to ease their pain. Jesus, however, refused to drink it, showing his courage to face death without any external means. His rejection of the wine also reaffirmed his earlier statement about not drinking until he was in his Father's kingdom. Exploring the related passages in Matthew can provide additional context for a deeper understanding of this verse.
