## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The difficulty is of a kind in no way affecting the authenticity of the narrative, nor the truthfulness of each Evangelist."
2. "It is preposterous to imagine that two such accounts as these of the proceedings of so eventful a day should differ by three whole hours in their apportionment of its occurrences."
3. "Meanwhile the chronology of our text, as being carried on through the day, and as allowing time both for the trial, and the events of the crucifixion, is that which will I believe be generally concurred in."

### Albert Barnes:
1) "The Jews divided both the night and the day into four equal parts of three hours each...The 'third' hour mentioned by Mark would therefore correspond with our nine o’clock; the 'sixth' hour mentioned by John would correspond with our twelve, or noon."
2) "A mistake in 'numbers' is easily made...An error of this kind in an early manuscript might be extensively propagated, and might have led to the present reading of the text."
3) "Now suppose that John meant to indicate the time when he was 'actually' suspended on the cross - that he spoke of the 'crucifixion' denoting the 'act of suspension,' as it struck 'him' - and there is no difficulty."

### John Calvin:
1. "The whole time, from sunrise to the second part of the day, they called the first hour."
2. "The second part, which lasted till noon, was called by them the third hour."
3. "But this is not inconsistent with the assertion, that our Lord was crucified about the close of the third hour; for it is plain enough, that no sooner was he hastily condemned, than he was immediately executed."

### Philip Schaff:
1) "The period could not have been shorter than from nine o’clock to early evening, before sunset." 
2) "The accounts of Matthew and Luke accord with that of Mark in regard to the time of the darkness, and thus support the accuracy of this verse." 
3) "An apparent discrepancy of such long standing is a proof (1) that there was no collusion between the two writers, if the difference originally existed; (2) that those who have held these writings as sacred have been very honest, or such an apparent disagreement would have disappeared long ago."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "The third hour (nine A.M.) is significant because it marks the time when Jesus was brought before Pilate for trial, which aligns with the sixth hour (six A.M.) in Roman time." 

2. "The mention of Jewish time highlights the cultural context of the events, emphasizing the connection to the Jewish religious practices and traditions." 

3. "The specific mention of the hours adds a sense of precision and detail to the narrative, allowing readers to envision the sequence of events and the timing of Jesus' trial."

### John Gill:
1. "The time of the daily sacrifice of the morning, at which the priests ought to have been."
2. "The grand sanhedrim sat from the daily sacrifice of the morning, to the daily sacrifice of the evening."
3. "This was about nine o'clock in the morning, and takes in the time between that and twelve at noon."
