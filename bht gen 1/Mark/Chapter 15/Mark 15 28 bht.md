# Mark 15:28 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the Servant is described as someone who was not a transgressor but was regarded and treated as one in his death. He willingly and selflessly poured out his soul, sacrificing himself completely, even unto death. Through his suffering, he would ultimately be exalted and rewarded, sharing in the spoils of victory. The Servant's identification with sinners, being numbered among transgressors, illustrates his compassionate willingness to bear the guilt and punishment of others, serving as the ultimate substitute for humanity's salvation.
