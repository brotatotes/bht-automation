# Mark 15:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we witness the relentless accusations and harmful intent directed at Jesus, as the chief priests accused him of many things, including claiming to be the Son of God and inciting discord. Despite these serious accusations, Jesus chose to remain silent, displaying his submission to the will of the Father and his willingness to endure the cross. Pilate's amazement at Jesus' silence further highlights the contrast between earthly power and divine authority. This powerful example of Jesus remaining steadfast in the face of injustice teaches believers to trust in God's sovereignty and find ultimate vindication in Him alone.
