# Mark 15:33 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the darkness of the sixth hour, as Jesus hung upon the cross, the world was enveloped in a supernatural darkness that symbolized the weight of sin and separation between humanity and God. This darkness was not just a physical phenomenon, but a profound moment of judgment and fulfillment of prophecies. It extended beyond the immediate vicinity, covering the whole land and even the entire world. In that moment, Jesus willingly bore the burden of sin, experiencing abandonment and desolation, to offer us the opportunity to walk in the light of His grace and salvation.
