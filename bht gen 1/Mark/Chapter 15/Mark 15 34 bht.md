## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The Syro-chaldaic form, ἑλωΐ, is used here, which corresponds to ἡλί in Matthew. This indicates that the words spoken by Jesus must have been accurately recorded, as it aligns with the taunt that He called for Elias." 

2. "The mention of Elias in Matthew's account adds weight to the authenticity of Jesus' words, as it reflects the mockery and disbelief of those present at the crucifixion." 

3. "The use of the Syro-chaldaic form highlights the cultural context in which Jesus spoke, emphasizing the significance of His words and their impact on the audience."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Eloi. This is in the Aramaic dialect then in use."
