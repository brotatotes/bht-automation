The tearing of the thick veil in the temple, a symbol of the separation between God and humanity, signifies a profound change.

This event, accompanied by an earthquake and other striking signs, demonstrates the cosmic significance of Jesus' sacrifice and the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies. It is a powerful declaration that salvation and reconciliation with God are now available to all who come to Him in faith.
