## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "ἐλθών, or ἦλθεν, is common to Matt., Mark, and John, but in different connexion." 
2. "εὐσχήμων probably in its later sense of noble, ‘honourable,’ i.e. in station."
3. "τολμήσας εἰς ., characteristic of Mark’s narrative."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The word 'honorable,' here, is not a mere title of 'office,' but is given in reference to his personal character, as being a man of integrity and blameless life."
2. "But this expression means more than an 'indefinite' expectation that the Messiah 'would' come, for all the Jews expected that. It implies that he believed 'Jesus' to be the Messiah, and that he had 'waited' for Him to build up the kingdom of God."
3. "As soon as they have evidence satisfactory to their own mind that they are Christians, or have a 'prevalent' belief, after faithful examination, that they truly love God, and that they depend on the Lord Jesus for salvation, so soon are they bound to profess Christ before men."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Joseph, he from Arimathaea: the article indicating a man well known."
2. "Honorable: in its earlier use this adjective would, therefore, emphasize the dignified external appearance and deportment."
3. "Went in boldly: daring all possible consequences."

### John Calvin:
1. "The highest commendation bestowed on Joseph is, that he waited for the kingdom of God."
2. "By the kingdom of God, we must understand the renovation promised through Christ."
3. "It is therefore pointed out in commendation of Joseph’s piety, that, during the disorder which then prevailed, he cherished the hope of that redemption which God had promised."

These quotes emphasize the importance of waiting for the kingdom of God, understanding it as the promised renovation through Christ, and cherishing hope in the midst of disorder. They highlight the connection between piety, faith, and the expectation of God's deliverance.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "An honourable councillor. A member of the Sanhedrin (comp. Luke 23:51). ‘Honorable’ here means noble in station."
2. "Who also himself was, etc. He expected the Messiah, and had been a secret disciple of Jesus (John 19:38)."
3. "And he boldly went in. The decisive act which marked the change from a secret to an open discipleship."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "A councillor of honourable estate (ευσχημων βουλευτης). A senator or member of the Sanhedrin of high standing, rich (Matthew 27:57)."

3. "Boldly (τολμησας). Aorist (ingressive) active participle, becoming bold. It is the glory of Joseph and Nicodemus, secret disciples of Jesus, that they took a bold stand when the rest were in terror and dismay. That is love psychology, paradoxical as it may seem."
