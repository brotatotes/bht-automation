# Mark 15:45 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we see the confirmation of Jesus' death through multiple eyewitness testimonies. The first commentator observes how Jesus was found truly dead when the soldiers came to break the legs of the criminals. Another commentator mentions the piercing of Jesus' side, which resulted in the flow of blood and water, further demonstrating the finality of his death. A third commentator emphasizes that there is no room for doubt regarding Jesus' death. These details collectively affirm the undeniable reality of Jesus' crucifixion and subsequent passing.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The passage cited (Meyer, De Wette) from Cicero (in Verrem, Mar 15:45) to shew that it was customary to give money on such occasions, is not to the point."
2. "'mortis celeritatem pretio redimere cogebantur parentes' is not said of the body after death, but of a fee given to the officer."
3. "'ne diu crucietur' refers to the officer being bribed to ensure that the deceased does not suffer for a long time."

Note: The commentary seems to be discussing the act of giving money in relation to a specific passage in Cicero, but it is not directly related to the Bible verse mentioned.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Being informed by the centurion of the fact that he was dead." 
2. "The centurion had charge of the soldiers who watched him, and could therefore give correct information." 
3. "The centurion's testimony served as a reliable confirmation of the death of the individual."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The word 'corpse' emphasizes the lifeless state of the body, highlighting the finality and inevitability of death."

2. "By using the term 'corpse,' the author draws attention to the physicality and tangible reality of death, reminding readers of the stark contrast between life and death."

3. "The choice of the word 'corpse' also implies a sense of decay and deterioration, underscoring the temporary nature of our earthly existence and the need for spiritual renewal."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The position of Joseph seems to have occasioned this ready compliance." 
2. "Pilate was doubtless glad to hear that Jesus was dead and to have Him buried."
3. "Granted the corpse to Joseph. Presented it to him."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Granted the corpse (εδωρησατο το πτωμα)." - This phrase highlights the significance of Pilate giving permission for Joseph to take Jesus' body. It emphasizes the official nature of the act and the necessity of this information before the burial.

2. "Pilate was probably glad to turn the body over to Joseph." - This statement suggests that Pilate may have been relieved to have someone willing to take responsibility for Jesus' body, as it would have otherwise been disposed of in a less honorable manner.

3. "This is the only instance when πτωμα (cadaver, corpse) is applied to the body (σωμα) of Jesus." - This observation points out the unique usage of the term "πτωμα" to describe Jesus' body, as opposed to the more commonly used term "σωμα." This distinction may carry symbolic or theological implications.

### John Gill:
1. "...how he was found to be really dead when they came to break the legs of the malefactors..."
2. "...one of the soldiers pierced his side with a spear, from whence flowed blood and water..."
3. "...there was no room to doubt of his being really dead..."
