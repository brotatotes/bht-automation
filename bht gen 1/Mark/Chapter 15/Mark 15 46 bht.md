## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Therefore it was not the first day of unleavened bread, which was one of sabbatical sanctity; as indeed the whole of this narrative shews, but such expressions as this more strikingly."
2. "καθαιρεῖν is the technical word for taking down bodies from the cross. See the examples in Kypke from Philo and Josephus. So is κατατιθέναι for placing bodies in the tomb: cf. ibid."
3. "It is not said, but implied, both here and in Luke and John, that the tomb was his own for how should he place the Body there otherwise? The newness of the tomb is not mentioned here, but by the other three Evangelists."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The stone that was rolled away from the tomb of Jesus is a powerful symbol of victory over death and the resurrection. It represents the removal of the barrier between humanity and God, and the opening of a new way to eternal life."
2. "The stone also serves as a reminder of the power and authority of God. Just as He moved the stone to reveal the empty tomb, He has the power to move any obstacle in our lives and bring about miraculous transformations."
3. "In the context of Matthew 27:60, the stone represents the finality of death. It is a reminder that Jesus truly died and was buried, but it also foreshadows the incredible event of His resurrection, where the stone was rolled away to reveal the empty tomb."
