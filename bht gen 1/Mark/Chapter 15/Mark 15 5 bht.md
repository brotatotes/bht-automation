# Mark 15:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, Pilate is portrayed as recognizing the innocence of Jesus and seeing through the envy of those who accused him. He is struck by the self-control displayed by Jesus, marveling at his silence and refusal to defend himself. Pilate is also portrayed as hoping that Jesus would answer the charges against him, seeking to relieve himself of the burden of making a decision. This silence both perplexes and exposes Jesus to danger, as Pilate believes he has the ability to defend himself.
