# Mark 15:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
During the Passover festival, it became customary for the Roman governor to release a prisoner as an act of goodwill and mercy towards the Jewish people. This habitual action, symbolically representing freedom and redemption, allowed the people to partake in the festivities by choosing which prisoner would receive their release. The choice between Jesus, the innocent and righteous one, and Barabbas, the guilty and rebellious one, emphasized the profound decision the people had to make. This repeated occurrence within a specific time frame underscored the significance and meaning behind the release of Barabbas.
