# Mark 16:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
After the Sabbath had ended, the women purchased spices to anoint the Body of Christ before the dawn of day. Nicodemus, who had previously hurriedly wrapped the Body in spices, now had the opportunity to anoint it more thoroughly. The act of anointing the dead with spices was a customary Jewish practice, but it was superseded by the resurrection of Christ, which rendered such outward ceremonies unnecessary.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "It was strictly when the Sabbath was ended, i.e. at sunset, that they bought the spices." 
2. "Luke 23:55 places it on the evening before the Sabbath; a slight but valuable discrepancy, as showing the independence of the accounts."
3. "Nicodemus (Joh 19:40) had only wrapped the Body hurriedly in the spices with the linen clothes."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "And when the sabbath was pastâ€”that is, at sunset of our Saturday."
2. "But our translators are perhaps right in rendering it here 'had bought,' since it would appear, from Matthew 27:56- :, that they had purchased them immediately after the Crucifixion, on the Friday evening, during the short interval that remained to them before sunset, when the sabbath rest began."
3. "On this 'anointing,' see on Matthew 27:56- :."

### John Calvin:
1. "The women resolved among themselves to visit the sepulcher, so as to come there before the dawn of day."
2. "The custom of anointing the dead...was applied to a lawful use by the Jews alone, to whom it had been handed down by the Fathers, to confirm them in the faith of the resurrection."
3. "The resurrection of Christ...abolished those outward ceremonies. For himself, he needed not those aids, but they were owing to the ignorance of the women, who were not yet fully aware that he was free from corruption."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The resting on the Sabbath is expressly affirmed by Luke."
2. "Nicodemus had done this [anointing] in a necessarily hasty manner."
3. "Luke 22:56 does not necessarily imply that the preparation of spices took place on Friday, before the beginning of the Sabbath."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "The sabbath having come in between, and now over." 
2. "It was therefore after sunset." 
3. "They could buy them after sundown."

### John Gill:
1. "It was not lawful to buy spices, and anoint with on the sabbath day."
