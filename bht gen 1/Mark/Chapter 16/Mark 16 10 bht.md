# Mark 16:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this passage, we encounter a significant moment in the Gospels that holds both historical and transformative significance. The disciples, mourning and weeping, were met with the unexpected news of Christ's resurrection from none other than Mary Magdalene. Their mourning reflections as "doves of the valley" were interrupted by the joyous reality of the empty tomb. This encounter beautifully showcases the personal and intimate relationship we have with Jesus, who seeks us out in our despair and offers us His love and grace, challenging us to trust in His plan even when it defies our understanding.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "ἐκεῖνος is no where found used absolutely by Mark, but always emphatically."
2. "πορευθ is never used by Mark, is three times contained in this passage."
3. "τοῖς μετʼ αὐτοῦ γεν., though found in the Acts, never occurs in the Gospels."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "An absolute use of the pronoun unexampled in Mark."
2. "It would imply an emphasis which is not intended."
3. "A circumlocution foreign to the Gospels."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Emphasis seems to rest on the word ‘she;’ she was the first to tell them, the others probably returning later, after they had seen the Lord on the way." 
2. "Them that had been with him. An unusual expression for ‘disciples,’ probably including the whole company of His followers."
3. "As they mourned and wept. A natural touch, showing how little they anticipated His resurrection."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "She (εκεινη). Only instance of this pronoun (=ιλλα) absolutely in Mark, though a good Greek idiom." 
2. "Went (πορευθεισα). First aorist passive participle. Common word for going, but in Mark so far only in Mark 9:30 in the uncompounded form." 
3. "As they mourned and wept (πενθουσιν κα κλαιουσιν). Present active participles in dative plural agreeing with τοις ... γενομενοις and describing the pathos of the disciples in their utter bereavement and woe."

### John Gill:
1. "She went, as she was bid by Christ, and told his disciples, what she had heard and seen."
2. "Even those who had been with him from the beginning, and had heard his doctrines, and seen his miracles, and had had communion with him, and truly believed in him, and were his constant followers, and real disciples."
3. "Thus were they like doves of the valley, mourning for their absent Lord, and for their own iniquities; and in this condition were they, when Mary brought them the joyful news of Christ's resurrection from the dead."

### John Wesley:
1. "The resurrection of Jesus is not just a historical event, but a life-transforming reality. It is the ultimate victory over sin and death, offering hope and redemption to all who believe."
2. "The women's response to the empty tomb is a powerful reminder that faith often requires us to let go of our preconceived notions and embrace the unexpected. It challenges us to trust in God's plan, even when it doesn't align with our own understanding."
3. "Mary Magdalene's encounter with the risen Jesus demonstrates the personal and intimate nature of our relationship with Him. It reminds us that Jesus knows us by name, and He seeks us out in our moments of doubt and despair, offering us His love and grace."
