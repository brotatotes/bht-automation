# Mark 16:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
On the road to Emmaus, Jesus appeared in a different form, not immediately recognizable by His disciples. As they walked and sat together, Jesus patiently listened, revealed Himself through the breaking of bread, and expounded the Scriptures to them. This encounter reminds us of Jesus' constant presence with us, His intimate connection through communion, and the transformative power of encountering Him, which ignites our hearts with love and fuels our mission to share His good news with others.

These quotes highlight the unique language choices made by the author of the commentary.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "This expression, peculiar to this section, marks definitely a second appearance, after the ‘first’ (Mark 16:9)."
2. "The appearance to Peter is not mentioned; the author is emphasizing the unbelief of the eleven, so that he chooses a revelation to two, not of their number."
3. "In another form, so that they did not recognize Him. Luke, says: ‘their eyes were holden.’ But there was some actual difference in the bodily appearance of our Lord."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Luke tells us that it was on the same day (Luke 24:13)." 
2. "It was not a μεταμορφωσις or transfiguration like that described in Mark 9:2." 
3. "Luke explains that their eyes were holden so that they could not recognize Jesus (Luke 24:16)."

### John Gill:
1. "He appeared in another form: it seems to have been the form, or habit of a gardener that he appeared in to Mary; since she thought him to be one, and to be the gardener that belonged to the garden, in which the sepulchre was: but now it was in another form, or habit, that he appeared." 
2. "Very likely in the habit of a Scribe, or doctor; since he took upon him to expound the Scriptures to the persons he appeared to; as also took bread, and blessed it, when at supper with them."
3. "This is not to be understood of any change in the shape of his body, or the features of his face; for as soon as their eyes were opened, which had been before held, they knew him perfectly well."

### John Wesley:
1. "The road to Emmaus is a powerful reminder that Jesus is always with us, even in our moments of doubt and confusion. He walks alongside us, patiently listening to our questions and concerns, and gently guiding us towards a deeper understanding of His truth."

2. "The disciples' eyes were opened when Jesus broke bread with them. This act of communion symbolizes the intimate connection between Jesus and His followers. It reminds us that when we partake in the Eucharist, we are not only nourishing our bodies but also communing with the living Christ."

3. "The burning hearts of the disciples signify the transformative power of encountering Jesus. When we truly encounter Him, our hearts are set ablaze with love, joy, and zeal for His kingdom. It is through this encounter that we are empowered to go forth and share the good news with others."
