# Mark 16:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Despite the repeated testimony and the affirmation from women and other disciples, the remaining few in Jerusalem, including the eleven apostles, struggled with skepticism and disbelief regarding the resurrection of Jesus. This conflict between doubt and belief, division of opinion, and independence of narratives led to an element who discredited the resurrection stories. Yet, amidst this struggle, there were those who were moved and a small glimmer of belief began to emerge, although not fully.
