## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The following narrative...joins together in one at least four appearances of the Lord."
2. "The latter part of this Mar 16:14 appears to be an epitome of what our Lord said to them on several occasions."
3. "The appearance which terminated with the Ascension."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "This is a most important circumstance in the history of our Lord’s resurrection. Never were people more difficult to be convinced of anything than they were of that fact."
2. "And this shows conclusively that they had not conspired to impose on the world; that they had given up all for lost when he died; that they did not expect his resurrection; and all this is the strongest proof that he truly rose."
3. "It may be added that it was impossible that eleven men of good natural understanding should have been deceived in so plain a case. They had been with Jesus three years; they perfectly knew his features, voice, manner; and it is not credible that they should have been deceived by anyone who might have pretended to have been the Lord Jesus."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The word 'afterward' indicates a sequence of events, suggesting that what follows is a continuation or consequence of what has already occurred." 

2. "The absence of this word in other parts of Mark, but its frequent use in Matthew, highlights the unique style and emphasis of each Gospel writer." 

3. "The use of 'afterward' in this context serves to connect the previous events with what is about to happen, creating a sense of anticipation and progression in the narrative."

### John Calvin:
1. "The participle (ἀνακειμένοις) which some have rendered sitting at table, ought, in my opinion, to be simply rendered sitting; and it is not without reason that I take this view of it, if it be agreed that the Evangelist here describes the first appearance." 

2. "And upbraided them with their unbelief and hardness of heart. This reproof corresponds more to the first appearance than to the second; for since, the disciples, as John tells us, (John 20:20) were glad when they had seen the Lord on the day after the Passover, their unbelief was then rebuked."

3. "To restrict these words of Mark to Thomas alone, as some have done, appears to be forced; and, therefore, I prefer to explain them simply as meaning, that when Christ first appeared to the apostles, he reproved them for not believing the testimony of eye-witnesses, who informed them of his resurrection."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Afterward. ‘Later’ not ‘last,’ though the word may bear such a meaning. This was the last manifestation of that day..."
2. "Sat at meat. In strict accordance with Luke 24:41-43, though evidently independently written."
3. "Upbraided them with their unbelief. He instructed, as well as upbraided them; but the matter is here described from one point of view."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Doubt is not necessarily a mark of intellectual superiority."
2. "One must steer between credulity and doubt."
3. "Some of the highest men of science today are devout believers in the Risen Christ."

### John Gill:
1. "Their hearts were much affected, and they were filled with sorrow and trouble for the loss of Christ."
2. "Their unbelief increased by their fears, and so much prevailed, that all that were said by one, and another, made no impression on them."
3. "A great aggravation of their incredulity, and a reason of Christ's upbraiding them in this manner were, because they believed not them which had seen him after he was risen."

### John Wesley:

3. "Jesus' greeting of 'Peace be with you' not only reassured the disciples but also conveyed the profound peace that comes from the reconciliation and forgiveness made possible through his sacrificial death and resurrection." - This quote highlights the significance of Jesus' greeting, showing that it not only brought comfort to the disciples but also symbolized the peace that comes from the redemption offered through his sacrifice.
