## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Unbelief by which is meant the rejection of the gospel in heart and life, not weakness or doubt as in Mar 16:14 shall condemn a man, whether baptized or unbaptized." 
2. "But that general necessity extends to all to whom Baptism is accessible; and it was well said ‘Non privatio Baptismi, sed contemtus, damnat.’"
3. "These words cannot be taken, as those in Matthew 28:19-20, as setting forth the order in which faith and baptism must always come; belief and disbelief are in this verse the great leading subjects, and πιστεύσας must on that account stand first."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Baptism is here put for the external signature of the inner faith of the heart."
2. "This outward manifestation, once mentioned as the proper fruit of faith, is not repeated in what follows."
3. "These awful issues of the reception or rejection of the Gospel, though often recorded in other connections, are given in this connection only by Mark."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He who credits it to be true, and acts as if it were true." 
2. "To have faith in him is to believe that this is true, and to act accordingly; that is, to trust him, to rely on him, to love him, to feel that we have no merit, and to cast our all upon him."
3. "Faith is feeling and acting as if there were a God, a Saviour, a heaven, a hell; as if we were sinners and must die; as if we deserved eternal death and were in danger of it; and, in view of all, casting our eternal interests on the mercy of God in Christ Jesus."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The word is a judicial term, and, as Dr. Morison truthfully says, 'determines, by itself, nothing at all concerning the nature, degree, or extent of the penalty to be endured.'"
2. "See on the kindred noun, krima, judgment, rendered by A. V. damnation, 1 Corinthians 11:29."
3. "Rev., rightly, condemned."

### John Calvin:
1. "This promise was added in order to allure all mankind to believe; as it is followed, on the other hand, by a threatening of awful destruction, in order to terrify unbelievers."
2. "By believing in the only begotten Son of God, not only are they reckoned among the children of God, but receiving the gift of free justification and of the Spirit of regeneration, they possess what constitutes eternal life."
3. "Baptism is joined to the faith of the gospel, in order to inform us that the Mark of our salvation is engraved on it; for had it not served to testify the grace of God, it would have been improper in Christ to have said, that they who shall believe and be baptized shall be saved."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The belief is belief in Jesus of Nazareth, crucified and risen again, as an all-sufficient Personal Saviour, It is belief of the gospel (Mark 16:15), because the gospel presents Christ."
2. "Baptism is generally but not absolutely necessary to salvation...Yet the other clause shows the general necessity. Baptism cannot be deemed indifferent in view of this command."
3. "Nothing can be proved from this passage as to the order in which faith and baptism must always come. In Matthew 28:19-20, it is altogether different."
4. "The form of the original is peculiar, and points to a future and permanent division of mankind into ‘saved’ and ‘condemned.’"
5. "The condemnation for the sin of unbelief, implies a previous offer of the gospel. Blessedness is impossible for those who when they know of Christ do not trust Him."
6. "The word ‘condemned’ implies just what our Lord has expressed again and again in awful language."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The omission of baptized with 'disbelieveth' would seem to show that Jesus does not make baptism essential to salvation."
2. "Condemnation rests on disbelief, not on baptism. So salvation rests on belief."
3. "Baptism is merely the picture of the new life, not the means of securing it."

### John Gill:
1. "Not notionally only, or that gives a bare assent to the truth of the Gospel; but spiritually, who sees Christ, his need of him, and the worth and excellency, suitableness and fulness of him."
2. "Faith must precede baptism, as these words of Christ, and Scripture examples show; and such as have it, ought to make a profession of it, and be baptized; and in which way it is that faith discovers itself, and works by love to Christ."
3. "Baptism, though it is said to save by the resurrection of Christ, as it is a means of leading faith to Christ's resurrection for justification, yet has no casual influence upon salvation; it is not essential to it; the thief on the cross, went to heaven without it, and Simon Magus to hell with it."
