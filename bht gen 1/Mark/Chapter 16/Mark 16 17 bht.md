# Mark 16:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Believers who have true faith, akin to that mentioned in the previous verse, can expect to experience signs and wonders as a result. These miracles, though not limited to the early days of the Church, served as a confirmation of the Gospel message and the authority of Christ. Miracles continue to be an integral part of the Christian faith, demonstrating the power of genuine belief and providing a focal point for faith in the present age.
