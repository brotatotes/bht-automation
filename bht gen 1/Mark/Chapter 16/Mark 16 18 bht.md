# Mark 16:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, commentators describe the extraordinary powers and protection granted to believers. They mention examples from the Acts of the Apostles, where believers handle poisonous snakes unharmed and heal the sick through the laying on of hands. The commentators highlight Jesus' compassion and concern for physical well-being, emphasizing that the fulfillment of these promises may extend beyond what is recorded in the New Testament. However, some commentators caution against interpreting these actions as a call for believers to deliberately undergo dangerous tests.
