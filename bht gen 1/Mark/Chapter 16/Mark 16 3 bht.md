2. "By including this verse, Mark emphasizes the urgency and immediacy of Jesus' ministry. It portrays Jesus as a man of action, constantly on the move and actively engaging with people. This adds a sense of dynamism and energy to the narrative."

3. "The use of the term 'immediately' in this verse underscores the fast-paced nature of Mark's Gospel. It conveys a sense of urgency and emphasizes the swift response and decisive actions of Jesus. This highlights the importance of immediate obedience and the need for prompt action in following Jesus."

### John Calvin:

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Who shall roll us away the stone?" - This question reveals the practical concern of the women as they approach the tomb of Jesus. It highlights their uncertainty and lack of hope regarding the resurrection. 

2. "The opposite of προσκυλιω in Mark 15:46." - This statement points out the contrast between the action of rolling the stone to seal the tomb in Mark 15:46 and the concern of the women about who will roll the stone away in Mark 16:3.

### John Gill:
1. "This was the only difficulty they had, that they were aware of; for they seem to know nothing of the sealing of the stone, and of the watch that was set to guard the sepulchre: things which were done on the sabbath day, on which they rested."
2. "For had they, in all likelihood they would never have attempted to have gone to it; the guard of soldiers would have been a sufficient discouragement."
3. "But all their concern was, how, and by whom, the stone should be rolled away, that lay at the door of the sepulchre; and perhaps their concern might be, not only on account of the largeness of the stone, as being too much for them to remove, but because such a stone defiled by touching it, according to the Jewish traditions."

### John Wesley:
1. "Who shall roll us away the stone" - The disciples were only concerned about the physical obstacle of the stone blocking the entrance to the tomb.
