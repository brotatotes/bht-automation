# Mark 16:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As the disciples approached the tomb, their eyes were filled with anticipation and concern. Looking up, they noticed the tomb above them, carved into the rock face. To their surprise and relief, the stone that sealed the tomb had been rolled back or possibly "rolled up." Its significant size was not only a cause for anxiety but also a surprising sight that captivated their attention. This sudden and unexpected sight of the rolled-back stone ignited their wonder about who could have moved it, given its immense size.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Philip Schaff:
1. "Looking up. They may have been looking down before, absorbed in their conversation; the tomb was probably above them, cut horizontally in the face of the rock at a slight elevation."
2. "They see that the stone is rolled back. Possibly ‘rolled up,’ as if it had rested in a hollow at the door of the tomb."
3. "For it was exceeding great. This does not mean that the greatness of the stone was the reason of their anxiety and questioning, although this was doubtless true, but that its size enabled them to notice the position even in the early morning."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "With downcast eyes and heavy hearts (Bruce) they had been walking up the hill."
2. "Their problem is solved for the stone lies rolled back before their very eyes."
3. "Mark explains by the size of the stone this sudden and surprising sight right before their eyes."

### John Gill:
1. "They saw that the stone was rolled away; they perceived it lay at some distance from the door of the sepulchre, which doubtless was very grateful, and matter of rejoicing to them."
2. "For it was very great; these words are to be read, in connection with the preceding verse; for they are not a reason, why when they looked towards the sepulchre, they saw the stone rolled, because it was a very large one, and so easily to be seen at a distance."
3. "But a reason why they were so thoughtful and concerned, who should roll it away for them, it being so big, that they could not think that they were able to do it themselves."
