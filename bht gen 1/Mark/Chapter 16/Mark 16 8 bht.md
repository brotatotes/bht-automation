# Mark 16:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The women, filled with trembling, fled from the sepulchre in terror, astonished and amazed by what they had witnessed. The intensity of their fear and astonishment made it difficult for them to convey the message. While their fear was mingled with joy upon hearing of the resurrection, they hesitated to share their experience out of fear of being accused by the Jews. Their silence and reticence reveal the weight of their emotions and the delicate nature of the situation.
