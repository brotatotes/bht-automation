2. "Noised. This suggests a private entrance into the city, and then a general report that He was there." 
3. "In the house. The article is wanting in the original; the phrase is equivalent to 'at home;' but with the additional idea of having come there. It is therefore probable that the house was His usual residence in Capernaum, but this is not definitely expressed."
