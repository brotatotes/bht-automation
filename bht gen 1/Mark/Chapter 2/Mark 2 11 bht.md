# Mark 2:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this passage, a paralytic is commanded to rise from his bed and take up his mat. This act signifies not only physical healing, but also a call to a new life and restoration of dignity and purpose. Jesus challenges societal norms and expectations by redefining what is possible and acceptable. The emphasis on going to one's own house highlights the personal and intimate nature of the healing, as it allows the man to show his wholeness to his loved ones and return to his everyday life.
