# Mark 2:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, Jesus is seen dining at Levi's house, who was not only a tax collector but also someone of means. Levi invites Jesus and his disciples, demonstrating his willingness to associate with Jesus despite the societal stigma attached to tax collectors. By dining with tax collectors and sinners, Jesus challenges social norms, showcasing his mission to reach out to those considered outcasts or unworthy. This gathering of people, both publicans and sinners, shows the popularity of Jesus in the early stages of his ministry, with multitudes attending and following him.

2. "Sinners of abandoned character - of the same character that publicans commonly sustained - fit companions of publicans - great sinners."
3. "There is no doubt that our Saviour, in the early part of his ministry, was extremely popular. Multitudes of the common people attended him, and gave conclusive evidence that they were his real disciples."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The mention of 'his house' indicates that Levi was not only a tax collector but also a person of means, as tax collectors were known to accumulate wealth through their profession."

### Philip Schaff:

2. "Mark alone gives this reason for the number of publicans and sinners gathered there, namely, that persons of these classes were numerous and that they very generally followed Christ."
3. "The fact that the host was one of the former class (and would naturally gather his associates), is brought out by Luke."

1. "Many publicans and sinners sat also together, with Jesus, and his disciples; being invited by Levi, and not objected to by Christ." 
2. "For there were many, and they followed him; either Christ whom they had observed to have called Matthew, and had heard preach by the sea side; or else Matthew."
3. "Though true it is, that not only a large number of publicans and sinners followed Christ, but also many of the Scribes and Pharisees; yet with a different view from the former, not to get any advantage to themselves, but, if they could, an advantage against Christ."

### John Wesley:
1. "Some of them doubtless invited by Matthew, moved with compassion for his old companions in sin."
2. "Encouraged by his gracious words and the tenderness of his behaviour, and impatient to hear more, [they] pressed in after him."
