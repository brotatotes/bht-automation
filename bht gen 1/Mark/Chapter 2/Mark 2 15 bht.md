# Mark 2:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this passage, a wealthy tax collector named Levi is mentioned, implying that he was successful and had a large house. Jesus challenges societal norms by dining with tax collectors and sinners, showing his compassion and acceptance of those considered outcasts. Levi's decision to leave everything behind and follow Jesus exemplifies the transformative power of encountering Christ and the call to discipleship. The gathering at Levi's house includes both tax collectors and notorious sinners, who are drawn to Jesus' gracious words and compassionate behavior.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The mention of 'his house' implies that Levi was a man of means, as he had a house large enough to accommodate Jesus and his disciples. This suggests that Levi was a successful tax collector, as tax collectors were known to be wealthy due to their ability to collect taxes and take a portion for themselves."

2. "By eating with tax collectors and sinners, Jesus was breaking societal norms and challenging the religious leaders of his time. This act of fellowship and acceptance shows Jesus' compassion and desire to reach out to those who were considered outcasts or morally corrupt."

3. "The fact that Levi left everything behind to follow Jesus demonstrates his willingness to leave his former life of wealth and social status behind in order to pursue a deeper relationship with God. It serves as a powerful example of the transformative power of encountering Jesus and the call to discipleship."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The passage before us does not decide this, but any other view needlessly creates a discrepancy."
2. "Mark alone gives this reason for the number of publicans and sinners gathered there, namely, that persons of these classes were numerous and that they very generally followed Christ."
3. "The fact that the host was one of the former class (and would naturally gather his associates), is brought out by Luke."

### John Gill:
1. "Many publicans and sinners sat also together, with Jesus, and his disciples; being invited by Levi, and not objected to by Christ." 
2. "For there were many, and they followed him; either Christ whom they had observed to have called Matthew, and had heard preach by the sea side; or else Matthew." 
3. "Though true it is, that not only a large number of publicans and sinners followed Christ, but also many of the Scribes and Pharisees; yet with a different view from the former, not to get any advantage to themselves, but, if they could, an advantage against Christ."

### John Wesley:
1. "Many publicans and notorious sinners sat with Jesus...encouraged by his gracious words and the tenderness of his behaviour." 
2. "Moved with compassion for his old companions in sin." 
3. "Impatient to hear more, stayed for no invitation, but pressed in after him, and kept as close to him as they could."
