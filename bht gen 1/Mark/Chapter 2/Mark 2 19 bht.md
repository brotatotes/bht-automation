# Mark 2:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the primary authority reveals a touching repetition emphasized by Mark, as he expresses the solemnity of the occasion. The sons of the bride-chamber and groomsmen are differentiated by Vincent, who highlights their roles during a wedding celebration. Jesus, comparing himself to the bridegroom in the Old Testament, rejects fasting, as it is unsuitable for the joyful wedding feast. His emphasis on the spiritual over ritualistic practices challenges the traditional views of the ecclesiastics.

2. "St. Mark especially loves these solemn repetitions."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The sons of the bride-chamber are different from the groomsmen. They are the guests invited to the bridal."
