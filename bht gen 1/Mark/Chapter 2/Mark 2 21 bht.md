# Mark 2:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, there is a contrast between the old and the new. Some commentators mention the concept of sewing or attaching something new onto something old, emphasizing the intentional process. The verse also refers to the traditions of the elders, which are seen as new things in comparison to the commands of God. These traditions, while important to the Jewish people, should not be mixed with the moral and ceremonial righteousness in order to gain justification before God. The verse highlights the danger of neglecting the commandments of God due to the focus on human traditions.
