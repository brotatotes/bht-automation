# Mark 2:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the commentator's notes emphasize the contrast between the old and new. "The filling-up takes away from it, the new from the old," as one commentator observes. The traditions of the elders are seen as a new addition, "which occasioned this parable" and were not to be joined with the moral and ceremonial righteousness, which "were not sufficient for such a purpose." The variations in the verse indicate "entire independence" and the consequences of prioritizing man-made traditions over God's commands.
