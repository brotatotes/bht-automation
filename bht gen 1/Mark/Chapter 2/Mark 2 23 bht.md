# Mark 2:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, Jesus and his disciples are walking through the cornfields, plucking ears of corn to eat as they go.

He emphasizes the importance of mercy and compassion over strict adherence to rules, asserting his authority as the Lord of the Sabbath. Jesus reminds us that the Sabbath was made for the benefit of humanity, not as a burden, and that acts of genuine love and kindness should always take precedence over rigid religious rituals.
