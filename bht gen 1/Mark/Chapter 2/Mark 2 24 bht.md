## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### John Calvin:
1. "The only reason for keeping the Sabbath was, that the people, by sanctifying themselves to God, might be employed in true and spiritual worship; and next, that, being free from all worldly occupations, they might be more at liberty to attend the holy assemblies."
2. "The lawful observation of it, therefore, must have a reference to this object; for the Law ought to be interpreted according to the design of the Legislator."
3. "This shows clearly the malicious and implacable nature of superstition, and particularly the proud and cruel dispositions of hypocrites, when ambition is joined to hatred of the person."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The Pharisees had developed a strict set of rules and regulations regarding the observance of the Sabbath, and they were quick to accuse Jesus and his disciples of breaking these rules." 

2. "Jesus, however, challenges their legalistic interpretation of the Sabbath and emphasizes the true purpose of the Sabbath, which is to bring rest, healing, and restoration to people's lives."

3. "This verse serves as a reminder that the Sabbath was not meant to be a burden or a legalistic obligation, but rather a gift from God to be enjoyed and a time to focus on worship and renewal."

### John Gill:
1. "The Pharisees questioned Jesus about his disciples' actions on the Sabbath, accusing them of doing what was not lawful. This highlights the Pharisees' strict adherence to the letter of the law, rather than understanding the spirit of the law." 

2. "The act of plucking and rubbing the ears of corn was considered work according to the traditions of the elders. Jesus' disciples were challenging these man-made rules by prioritizing their physical needs over legalistic observance."
