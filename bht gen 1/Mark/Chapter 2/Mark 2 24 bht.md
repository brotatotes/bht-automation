## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### John Calvin:
1. "The only reason for keeping the Sabbath was, that the people, by sanctifying themselves to God, might be employed in true and spiritual worship; and next, that, being free from all worldly occupations, they might be more at liberty to attend the holy assemblies."
2. "The lawful observation of it, therefore, must have a reference to this object; for the Law ought to be interpreted according to the design of the Legislator."
3. "This shows clearly the malicious and implacable nature of superstition, and particularly the proud and cruel dispositions of hypocrites, when ambition is joined to hatred of the person."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The Pharisees had developed a strict set of rules and regulations regarding the observance of the Sabbath, and they were quick to accuse Jesus and his disciples of breaking these rules." 

2. "Jesus challenges the Pharisees' legalistic interpretation of the Sabbath by reminding them of the true purpose of the Sabbath - to bring rest, healing, and restoration to people's lives."

3. "Through his actions, Jesus demonstrates that the Sabbath is not meant to be a burden or a day of strict adherence to rules, but rather a day of freedom, joy, and compassion."

### John Gill:
