# Mark 2:26 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this historical account, during a time of confusion over names, the event takes place in the house of God, not in the temple but rather the tabernacle at Nob. The priests meticulously prepared the shewbread, the loaves of presentation symbolizing the presence of God. The mention of Abiathar the high priest provides historical context, highlighting the lineage and succession in the priesthood. Hungry and in need, David and his men partook of bread meant for the priests, affirming the importance of God's house as a place of provision and nourishment.
