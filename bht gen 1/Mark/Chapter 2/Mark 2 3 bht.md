# Mark 2:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, individuals come to Jesus, bringing a paralyzed man who is carried by four friends, showcasing their unity and care. The mention of the number four symbolizes collective effort and highlights the importance of community support. The paralyzed man's condition represents the spiritual state of a sinner who is unaware of their desperate need for salvation. Jesus, with authority as both the Son of God and Son of Man, not only forgives the man's sins but also heals his physical ailment, demonstrating his power and divine authority to both the faithful and the religious leaders.
