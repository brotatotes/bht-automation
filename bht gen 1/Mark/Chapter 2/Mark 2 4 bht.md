## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Their whole object was to bring the patient into the presence of Jesus; and this not being possible in the ordinary way, because of the multitude that surrounded Him, they took the very unusual method here described of accomplishing their object, and succeeded."
2. "Several explanations have been given of the way in which this was done; but unless we knew the precise plan of the house, and the part of it from which Jesus taught, it is impossible to determine precisely how the thing was done."
3. "One thing, however, is clear, that we have both the accounts from an eye-witness."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "They uncovered (unroofed) the roof where he was." 
2. "It is most probable that our Lord was in the upper room, usually the largest in an Eastern house; that the crowd was in the court, as Mark 2:2 implies, and that these men actually removed the tiles on the roof and broke through the plaster or clay of the roof itself." 
3. "This was an evidence of their earnestness."
