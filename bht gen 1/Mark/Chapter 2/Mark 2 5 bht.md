## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "It is remarkable that all the three narratives call it 'their faith' which Jesus saw. That the patient himself had faith, we know from the proclamation of his forgiveness, which Jesus made before all."
2. "This was the faith for which He was ever on the watch, and which He never saw without marking, and, in those who needed anything from Him, richly rewarding."
3. "And yet, as the Pharisees understood our Lord to be dispensing pardon by this saying, and Jesus not only acknowledges that they were right, but founds His whole argument upon the correctness of it, we must regard the saying as a royal proclamation of the man's forgiveness by Him to whom it belonged to dispense it."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Be of good cheer" is omitted in Mark's account, suggesting that the focus is not on the emotional state of the paralyzed man, but rather on the power and authority of Jesus to forgive sins and heal.
2. The use of "Son" instead of "Man" in Luke's account highlights the divine nature of Jesus, emphasizing his role as the Son of God who has the authority to forgive sins.
3. These variations in the different Gospel accounts of the same event show the unique perspectives and theological emphases of each Gospel writer, enriching our understanding of the overall message of the passage.

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "There is no reason for excluding his faith. They all had confidence in the power and willingness of Jesus to heal this desperate case."
2. "The astonishing thing both to the paralytic and to the four friends is that Jesus forgave his sins instead of healing him."
3. "The sins had probably caused the paralysis."

### John Gill:
1. "The faith of the sick man, and his friends, who seemed confident, that could they get at Christ, a cure would be wrought."
2. "Christ calls him son, though, in this afflicted condition a person may be a child of God, and yet greatly afflicted by him; afflictions are not arguments against, but rather for sonship."
3. "The blessing Christ conferred on this poor man is of the greatest consequence and importance, forgiveness of sin: it is what springs from the grace and mercy of God; it is provided in a promise in the covenant of grace."
