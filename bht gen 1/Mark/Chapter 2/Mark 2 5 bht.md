## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "That the patient himself had faith, we know from the proclamation of his forgiveness, which Jesus made before all; and we should have been apt to conclude that his four friends bore him to Jesus merely out of benevolent compliance with the urgent entreaties of the poor sufferer. But here we learn, not only that his bearers had the same faith with himself, but that Jesus marked it as a faith which was not to be defeated—a faith victorious over all difficulties."
2. "This was the faith for which He was ever on the watch, and which He never saw without marking, and, in those who needed anything from Him, richly rewarding."
3. "By the word 'be,' our translators perhaps meant 'are,' as in Luke (Luke 5:20). For it is not a command to his sins to depart, but an authoritative proclamation of the man's pardoned state as a believer."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Be of good cheer" is omitted in Mark's account, suggesting that the focus is not on the emotional state of the paralyzed man, but rather on the power and authority of Jesus to forgive sins.
2. The use of "Son" in Luke's account instead of "Man" emphasizes the divine nature of Jesus and his authority to forgive sins, highlighting his unique role as the Son of God.
3. These variations in the different Gospel accounts highlight the different perspectives and emphases of the authors, providing a richer and more comprehensive understanding of the event.

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "There is no reason for excluding his faith. They all had confidence in the power and willingness of Jesus to heal this desperate case."
2. "The astonishing thing both to the paralytic and to the four friends is that Jesus forgave his sins instead of healing him."
3. "The sins had probably caused the paralysis."

### John Gill:
1. "The faith of the one appears in suffering himself to be brought in such a manner, under so much weakness; and with so much trouble; and of the other in bringing him, and breaking through so many difficulties to get him to Christ."
2. "Christ calls him son, though, in this afflicted condition a person may be a child of God, and yet greatly afflicted by him; afflictions are not arguments against, but rather for sonship."
3. "The blessing Christ conferred on this poor man is of the greatest consequence and importance, forgiveness of sin: it is what springs from the grace and mercy of God; it is provided in a promise in the covenant of grace."
