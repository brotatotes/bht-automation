# Mark 2:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, a gathering of Jewish religious leaders has come to observe and scrutinize Jesus, not with a teachable spirit, but with a venomous and murderous feeling. They reason within themselves, engaging in a thoughtful dialogue with themselves, and their skepticism and doubt are evident in their hearts. Jesus recognizes the hostile atmosphere and is aware of their thoughts and intentions, demonstrating his divine knowledge and authority. These scribes, with their lack of faith and desire to trap Jesus, serve as a cautionary tale, symbolizing the danger of putting darkness for light and the consequences of being blind guides.
