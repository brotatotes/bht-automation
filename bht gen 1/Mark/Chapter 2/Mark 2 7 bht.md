# Mark 2:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the commentators emphasize the tension between understanding Jesus' words as either an exaggeration or a blasphemy. The scribes accuse Jesus of blasphemy, believing that only God can forgive sins. However, the commentators highlight that Jesus' claim to forgive sins challenges their understanding of him as merely a man. They note that Jesus' true identity is key to interpreting his words, as no mere creature can possess the power to forgive sins. This passage invites further exploration of the delicate balance between Jesus' humanity and divinity.

2. "The word βλασφημεω means injurious speech or slander. It was, they held, blasphemy for Jesus to assume this divine prerogative."

2. "They were right in saying, that none but God could forgive sin, against whom it is committed; but wrong in charging Christ with blasphemy on this account; because he is truly God, as well as man."
