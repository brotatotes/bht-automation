# Mark 2:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we see a clear depiction of the immediate and supernatural knowledge possessed by Jesus. His understanding of people's thoughts and intentions is not only fully and clearly aware, but also extends to the depths of their thinking. This divine awareness of their innermost thoughts serves as powerful evidence of His ability to forgive sins. Jesus reproves those who reason in their hearts, emphasizing the importance of guarding against the first risings of evil in our hearts and striving for purity in our thoughts and desires.
