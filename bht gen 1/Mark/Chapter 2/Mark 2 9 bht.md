# Mark 2:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, commentators reflect on the power and significance of both healing diseases and forgiving sins. They question whether it is easier to command physical healing or to pardon spiritual wrongdoings. While both actions are possible for God, they emphasize that the ability to forgive sins may be the greatest evidence of divine power and goodness. Additionally, they note that the miraculous healing of a paralyzed man provides a powerful demonstration of Christ's deity to skeptics. Through these reflections, the verse illuminates the profound impact of both physical healing and spiritual forgiveness.
