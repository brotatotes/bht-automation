# Mark 3:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we see Jesus' healing power extending beyond physical ailments and encompassing spiritual and emotional needs. The phrase 'power went out from him' suggests that His healing was not passive, but an active and intentional outpouring of divine energy. As people pressed upon Him, eager to have their afflictions attended to, Jesus responded with compassion, healing diseases and maladies of body and mind. These healing miracles served as a demonstration of His divine authority and the expression of God's desire for repentance and restoration.
