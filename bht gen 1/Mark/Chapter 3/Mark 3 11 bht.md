# Mark 3:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we witness the power and authority of Jesus over demonic forces. The evil spirit identified itself through the possessed man's confession, demonstrating an intimate possession. The title "Son of God" highlights Jesus' divine nature and his authority over the spiritual realm. As soon as they encountered Christ, the unclean spirits fell down before him, acknowledging his power and submitting to his command. Through his words and actions, Jesus revealed himself to be a divine person, equal to God, with unparalleled power over demons and the ability to heal all manner of diseases.
