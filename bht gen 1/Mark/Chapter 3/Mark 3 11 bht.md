# Mark 3:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As soon as Jesus is beheld by the unclean spirits, they fall down before him. These spirits, being recognized as specifically involved in the event, are utterly subjected to Christ's authority. Their cries affirm Jesus as the Son of God, revealing his divine nature and power over the spiritual realm. Jesus, aware of their acknowledgement, charges them not to make him known, as they have done before.
