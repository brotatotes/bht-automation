In this verse, Jesus, with his authority and sovereignty, hand-picks a select group of individuals for a special purpose.

From a larger number of followers, Jesus intentionally selects twelve disciples, setting them apart for a unique and significant role. This act of selection highlights God's mercy and sovereignty, as he chooses individuals based on his own will and grace.
