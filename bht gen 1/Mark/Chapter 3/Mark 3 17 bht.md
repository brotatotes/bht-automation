# Mark 3:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This verse describes the event where Jesus surnames James and John as Boanerges, meaning "sons of thunder." It could be due to their vehement and zealous disposition, powerful preaching, or even their courage in opposing enemies. This title reflects their fiery temperament, sonorous voices, and the power that accompanied their words. Interestingly, there is a connection to an ancient city called "Bene-berak," meaning "sons of lightning," known for gathering of important Rabbins.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Sheva being expressed by οα in Aramaic, perhaps on account of their vehement and zealous disposition." 
2. "Both bore the name, and the Hebrew word is plural."
3. "There is an interesting notice of the catalogues of the Apostles, and the questions arising out of them."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "He surnamed them Boanerges [επεθηκεν αυτοις ονομα βοανηργες]. Lit., he put upon them the name. Some uncertainty attaches to both the origin and the application of the name." 
2. "It seems to have been intended as a title of honor, though not perpetuated like the surname Peter, this being the only instance of its occurrence."
3. "It is justified by the impetuosity and zeal which characterized both the brothers, which prompted them to suggest the calling of fire from heaven to consume the inhospitable Samaritan village (Luke 9:54); which marked James as the victim of an early martyrdom (Acts 12:2); and which sounds in the thunders of John's Revelation."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Boanerges. A transfer into Greek of an Aramaic word, which was modified from the Hebrew. Mark, writing for other than Jews, interprets it. He alone mentions it."
2. "Sons of thunder. This seems to have been occasioned by their 'vehement and zealous disposition, as indicated in Luke 9:54; comp. Mark 9:38.' This does not imply censure; for these traits, when sanctified, would be praiseworthy."
3. "The name may refer also to the corresponding character of their eloquence. Powerful, fervid preachers are still thus termed. With the ancients, thunder was the symbol for profound and solemn utterances."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Boanerges, which is Sons of thunder... may refer to the fiery temperament revealed in Luke 9:34 when James and John wanted to call down fire on the Samaritan villages that were unfriendly to them."
2. "The word literally means sons of tumult, sons of thunder in Syriac."
3. "Matthew is a Hebrew name meaning gift of God."

### John Gill:
1. "He surnamed them Boanerges, which is, the sons of thunder: either because of their loud and sonorous voice; or their warm zeal for Christ, and fervency in their ministry."
2. "Or for their courage in opposing the enemies of Christ, and the power that went along with their words; which either put to confusion and silence, or issued in conviction and conversion."
3. "There is a city which was in the tribe of Dan, mentioned in Joshua 19:45, which is called 'Bene-berak, the sons of lightning'; and is spoken of in the Jewish writings, as a place where several of the Rabbins met, and conversed together."
