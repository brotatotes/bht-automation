# Mark 3:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This verse portrays a significant moment where Jesus gives James and John the nickname "Boanerges," which means "the sons of thunder." This designation represents their passionate and zealous nature in preaching. The term "thunder" denotes the profound and solemn character of their oratory skills, as well as the conviction and power that accompanied their words. Additionally, this nickname may be influenced by Jewish references to lightning, symbolizing their courage and opposition to Christ's adversaries. Mark alone mentions this distinctive title, emphasizing its significance in understanding the temperament and charisma of James and John.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Philip Schaff:
1. "Boanerges. A transfer into Greek of an Aramaic word, which was modified from the Hebrew. Mark, writing for other than Jews, interprets it. He alone mentions it."
2. "Sons of thunder. This seems to have been occasioned by their vehement and zealous disposition, as indicated in Luke 9:54; comp. Mark 9:38. This does not imply censure; for these traits, when sanctified, would be praiseworthy."
3. "The name may refer also to the corresponding character of their eloquence. Powerful, fervid preachers are still thus termed. With the ancients, thunder was the symbol for profound and solemn utterances. The name would be prophetic in this application."

### John Gill:
1. "He surnamed them Boanerges, which is, the sons of thunder: either because of their loud and sonorous voice; or their warm zeal for Christ, and fervency in their ministry."
2. "Or for their courage in opposing the enemies of Christ, and the power that went along with their words; which either put to confusion and silence, or issued in conviction and conversion."
3. "There is a city which was in the tribe of Dan, mentioned in Joshua 19:45, which is called 'Bene-berak, the sons of lightning'; and is spoken of in the Jewish writings, as a place where several of the Rabbins met, and conversed together."
