# Mark 3:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, Jesus' immediate family, including his mother and siblings, along with other relatives and friends, attempt to reach him amidst a large crowd. They do so either out of concern for his well-being or with the intention of taking him away due to their belief that he is either mentally disturbed or excessively zealous. However, the popularity and demanding schedule of Jesus' ministry make it challenging for his family to access him personally. This showcases the close familial ties of Jesus, the impact of his public figure status, and the demands placed on him as a result.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Philip Schaff:
1. "The nearer relatives, spoken of in Mark 3:31, may not be included, since they waited outside; but probably the whole circle was engaged in this effort with varying feelings, the immediate family persisting longer."
2. "They may have heard that the scribes had come with a hostile purpose."
3. "This implies either actual insanity in a bad sense, or religious enthusiasm and ecstasy, even to derangement, in a good sense."

### John Gill:
1. "When they heard where he was, and what a crowd was about him, so that he could not so much as take the necessaries of life for his refreshment and support, they went out to lay hold on him." 
2. "They came to take him with them, to their own habitations, to prevent the ill consequences of such constant exercise without refreshment."
3. "The kinsmen and friends of Christ, having heard of the situation that he was in, said one to another, he is in a transport and excess of mind; his zeal carries him beyond due bounds; he has certainly forgotten himself; his understanding is disturbed; he is unmindful of himself; takes no care of his health."

### John Wesley:
1. "His relations â€” His mother and his brethren" - This highlights the close familial ties of Jesus, emphasizing his human nature and the significance of his earthly family.
2. "But it was some time before they could come near him" - This suggests that Jesus' popularity and busy ministry schedule made it difficult for his family to have personal access to him, highlighting the demands and challenges he faced as a public figure.
3. "His relations" - This phrase implies that Jesus had a network of family members beyond just his mother and brothers, indicating the broader scope of his familial relationships and the potential impact of his ministry on those close to him.
