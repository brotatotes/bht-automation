## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "His relations, beyond a doubt for the sense is resumed in Mark 3:31."
2. "He is mad: thus E. V.; and the sense requires it."
3. "The understanding this that his disciples went out to repress the crowd, for they said, 'It is mad,' is as contrary to Greek as to sense."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "This shows that by 'his friends' were not meant the apostles, but his neighbors and others who 'heard' of his conduct."
2. "The reason why this report gained any belief was, probably, that he had lived among them as a carpenter; that he was poor and unknown; and that now, at 30 years of age, he broke off from his occupations, abandoned his common employment, spent much time in the deserts, denied himself the common comforts of life, and set up his claims to be the Messiah."
3. "The charge of 'derangement' on account of attention to religion has not been confined to the Saviour. Let a man be made deeply sensible of his sins, and spend much of his time in prayer, and have no relish for the ordinary amusements or business of life; or let a Christian be much impressed with his obligation to devote himself to God, and 'act' as if he believed there was an 'eternity,' and warn his neighbors of their danger; or let a minister show uncommon zeal and spend his strength in the service of his Master, and the world is not slow to call it derangement."

2. "This implies either actual insanity in a bad sense, or religious enthusiasm and ecstasy, even to derangement, in a good sense."
3. "While an accusation of madness on the part of His relatives is neither impossible nor improbable, so long as they were not true believers, it may have been a mere pretext."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "The idiom most likely means the kinspeople or family of Jesus as is common in the LXX." 
2. "Certainly Mary did not believe that Jesus was in the power of Beelzebub as the rabbis said already." 
3. "Mary probably felt that Jesus was overwrought and wished to take him home out of the excitement and strain that he might get rest and proper food."

### John Gill:
1. "When his friends heard of it, they went out to lay hold on him: either out of their houses at Capernaum, or they went forth from Nazareth, where they dwelt, to Capernaum, to take him from this house, where he was thronged and pressed, along with them; where he might have some refreshment without being incommoded, and take some rest, which seemed very necessary."
