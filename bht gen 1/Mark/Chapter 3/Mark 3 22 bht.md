# Mark 3:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, Jesus is being falsely accused by the scribes and Pharisees who had traveled from Jerusalem with the intention to trap and oppose Him. They accused Jesus of exercising Satanic power and being possessed by an evil spirit. The accusations were not just random, but intentional and connected, aimed at discrediting Jesus' ministry. The learned individuals who made these accusations failed to see the undeniable truth of Jesus' miracles and instead sought to undermine Him through their own reasoning.
