# Mark 3:29 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Bible verse being described is a warning against committing the unpardonable sin of blaspheming against the Holy Spirit. This sin is characterized by attributing the work of the Holy Spirit to the devil. It is an eternal sin, lacking forgiveness and leading to everlasting punishment. Those who commit this sin are in a state of perpetual guilt and sinful activity, forever deprived of the influences of the Holy Spirit. Despite some theological debates and erroneous translations, the severity and consequences of this sin remain unchanged.
