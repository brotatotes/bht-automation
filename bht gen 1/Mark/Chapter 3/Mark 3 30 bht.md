# Mark 3:30 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, there is a continuous insistence or repetition as people persistently accuse Jesus of having a devil and performing miracles through the help of evil forces. Jesus, in turn, looks around at the people, showing his compassion and concern for those who accused him. These accusations, as the commentators highlight, point to the sin against the Holy Ghost, where the people attribute the miraculous works of the Holy Spirit to the power of the devil. This sin is seen as unpardonable, for they rejected the evidence of the true character and origin of these miracles.
