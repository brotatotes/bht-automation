# Mark 3:30 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the people persistently accused Jesus of performing miracles by the power of the devil, committing the sin of blasphemy against the Holy Spirit. Their words expressed their doubts about Jesus' miracles, attributing them to evil rather than divine power. Jesus, aware of their accusations, looked attentively at the crowd, demonstrating his concern for their understanding. This sin, according to commentators, is unpardonable and has no forgiveness in this world or the next.
