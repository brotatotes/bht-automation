## BHT:
In this Bible verse, we witness a profound display of emotions by Jesus. His anger is not driven by a desire for revenge, but rather by his grief over the spiritual blindness of those around him. This anger is a result of his purity and holiness, expressing God's character of holy love. Despite his anger, he also feels pity and compassion for those he rebukes, demonstrating the delicate balance between righteous anger at sin and a desire for the sinner's repentance. Ultimately, this verse exemplifies the power and compassion that only a true believer in Christ can embody.
