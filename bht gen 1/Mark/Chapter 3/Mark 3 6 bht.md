## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Philip Schaff:
1. "The Herodians were the court party, the adherents of the Herods. As friends of the Romans they were the political antagonists of the Pharisees."
2. "Hatred of the truth produced this strange alliance. The Pharisees were 'filled with madness' (Luke), and would seek the support of those who could help them in their purpose."
3. "Dislike of John the Baptist may have made the Herodians hostile to Jesus also. 'Hierarchs and despots are necessary to each other,' and combine against Christ."

### John Gill:
1. "Being dreadfully galled with the reasonings of Christ, at the silence and confusion they were put to, and with the miracle he wrought, to the exposing of them, and establishing his own credit." 
2. "Persisting still in their evil intentions, though Christ had so fully and clearly exposed the wickedness of them." 
3. "It is to be observed, that those men who thought it was not lawful to heal a lame man on the sabbath day, yet make no scruple of meeting and consulting together on that day, and even with profane men, what measures and methods were best to take, to destroy the life of an innocent person."

### John Wesley:
1. "The Pharisees going out...took counsel with the Herodians" - This collaboration between the Pharisees and the Herodians, who were typically enemies, highlights the intensity of their opposition to Jesus. It underscores the threat that Jesus posed to both religious and political authorities.

2. "As bitter as they usually were against each other" - The fact that the Pharisees and the Herodians were willing to put aside their differences and join forces against Jesus demonstrates the magnitude of their concern. It reveals the extent to which Jesus challenged the established order and provoked a united response from his adversaries.

3. "Leaving the scribes to watch him still" - While the Pharisees and the Herodians conspired against Jesus, the scribes were left behind to monitor his actions. This suggests that Jesus was constantly under scrutiny and that his every move was being closely observed by those who sought to discredit him.
