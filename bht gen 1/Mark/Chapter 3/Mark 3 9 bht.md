# Mark 3:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Bible verse in question describes a situation where Jesus ordered a small boat to be prepared and nearby. This boat served the purpose of giving Jesus the option to use it if needed. It was a practical measure to avoid being overwhelmed by the crowds who were pressing upon him, allowing him to serve the people more effectively. By having the boat ready, Jesus could freely move between addressing the crowds and seeking personal comfort.
