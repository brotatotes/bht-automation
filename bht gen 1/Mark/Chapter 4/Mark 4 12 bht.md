# Mark 4:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse being described emphasizes the purpose and effects of speaking in parables. It reveals that God's intention in using parables was not to make the truth more accessible, but rather to separate those who were genuinely seeking understanding from those who were resistant or superficial in their approach. The verse highlights the willful ignorance and resistance to understanding of some individuals, leading to a state of spiritual blindness that they themselves have chosen. Ultimately, the parables serve as a test, revealing the true nature of the listener's faith and receptivity to the message.
