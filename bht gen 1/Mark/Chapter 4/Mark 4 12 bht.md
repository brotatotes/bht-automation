# Mark 4:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the speaker uses parables to both reveal and conceal the truth, depending on the moral state of the hearers. By speaking in parables, the speaker engages the hearts and minds of the listeners, separating those who genuinely seek understanding from those only seeking signs and wonders. The purpose is not to make the truth more accessible, but rather to challenge the willful ignorance and stubbornness of those who choose to remain blind to the truth. Ultimately, God allows their spiritual blindness, respecting their free will and giving them over to the consequences of their choices.

2. "When the word of God blinds and hardens the reprobate, as this takes place through their own depravity, it belongs truly and naturally to themselves, but is accidental, as respects the word."
3. "The true end for which God desires that his word should be preached is, to reconcile men to himself by renewing their minds and hearts."

### Philip Schaff:

### John Wesley:

2. "They would not see before now they could not" - This quote suggests that their inability to see and perceive was a consequence of their own stubbornness and resistance. It implies that their hearts were hardened, preventing them from recognizing the truth.

3. "God having given them up to the blindness which they had chosen" - This statement underscores the idea that God allowed their blindness as a result of their own choices.
