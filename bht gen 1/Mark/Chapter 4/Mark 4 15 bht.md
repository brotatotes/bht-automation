# Mark 4:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, we are reminded that hardened and unbroken hearts are not receptive to the saving truth. The mention of Satan in the verse emphasizes the ongoing spiritual battle between good and evil, highlighting the constant temptation and opposition that believers face. The verse also portrays those who hear the word but fail to truly understand or internalize it, allowing distractions and the influence of the devil to prevent the seed of the Gospel from taking root in their hearts.
