# Mark 4:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the commentators describe a scenario where the word of God is hindered and choked by the distractions and worries of the world, represented by thorns. These distractions could be anything that consumes our thoughts and energies, such as money, possessions, or relationships. When we prioritize worldly concerns over our relationship with God, we hinder our spiritual growth and prevent the fruit of the Spirit from flourishing in our lives. To truly understand and bear fruit that glorifies God, we need to recognize and remove these thorns, prioritizing our relationship with Him above all else.
