# Mark 4:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse speaks about how the worries of the world, the allure of material wealth, and the pursuit of earthly desires can suffocate and make unproductive the word of God within us. These distractions drain our attention and time, leaving only a shallow and empty form of spirituality. The verse also warns of the potential harm that innocent pleasures can cause if they become a snare. Ultimately, these hindrances prevent spiritual growth and fulfillment.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "The cares of this world" - anxious, unrelaxing attention to the business of this present life.
2. "The deceitfulness of riches" - those riches which are the fruit of this worldly "care".
3. "The pleasures of this life" or "the lusts of other things entering in" - the enjoyments in themselves may be innocent, which worldly prosperity enables one to indulge.
4. These "choke" or "smother" the word; drawing off so much of one's attention, absorbing so much of one's interest, and using up so much of one's time.
5. Only the dregs of these remain for spiritual things, and a fagged, hurried, and heartless formalism is at length all the religion of such persons.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The lusts of other things. This includes all other worldly distractions." 
2. "The desires become 'lusts,' because the objects interfere with spiritual growth." 
3. "What is in itself innocent may become a snare."

### John Gill:
1. "The perplexing and distressing cares of [the world]... fill their minds, and possess their souls even when and while they are hearing the word."
2. "Riches... are deceitful, especially when trusted in, and being obtained, they do not give the satisfaction they promise."
3. "Carnal desires after other objects, which are pleasing to the sensual mind, entering into their hearts, and gaining the ascendant there: choke the word, and it becomes unfruitful."

These quotes highlight how the cares of the world, the deceitfulness of riches, and the lusts of other things can distract and hinder the effectiveness of the word, rendering it unfruitful.

### John Wesley:
1. "The desire of any thing, otherwise than as it leads to happiness in God, directly tends to barrenness of soul."
2. "Let him therefore who has received and retained the word, see that no other desire then enter in, such as perhaps till then he never knew."
3. "After the fruit had grown almost to perfection."
