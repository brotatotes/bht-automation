# Mark 4:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The commentators agree that the distractions and desires of the world, including cares, riches, and other lustful pursuits, can hinder the growth and effectiveness of the word in one's life. These distractions can lead to barrenness of soul and a lack of spiritual fruit. It is important for believers to guard their hearts and prioritize their pursuit of God's truth, ensuring that no other desires enter in to choke and hinder their spiritual growth.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "The cares of this world"—anxious, unrelaxing attention to the business of this present life.
2. "The deceitfulness of riches"—of those riches which are the fruit of this worldly "care."
3. "The pleasures of this life," or "the lusts of other things entering in"—the enjoyments in themselves may be innocent, which worldly prosperity enables one to indulge.
4. These "choke" or "smother" the word; drawing off so much of one's attention, absorbing so much of one's interest, and using up so much of one's time.
5. Only the dregs of these remain for spiritual things, and a fagged, hurried, and heartless formalism is at length all the religion of such persons.

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The lusts of other things entering in [αι περι τα λοιπα επιθυμιαι] . Lusts not in the limited sense of mere sexual desire, but in the general sense of longing." 

2. "The word is also used of desire for good and lawful things (Luke 22:15; Philippians 1:23)."

3. "The lusts of other things entering in can distract us from our true focus and devotion to God."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The lusts of other things. This includes all other worldly distractions." 
2. "The desires become ‘lusts,’ because the objects interfere with spiritual growth." 
3. "What is in itself innocent may become a snare."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "The lusts of other things (α περ τα λοιπα επιθυμια). All the passions or longings, sensual, worldly, 'pleasures of this life' (ηδονων του βιου) as Luke has it (Luke 8:14), the world of sense drowning the world of spirit."

2. "The word επιθυμια is not evil in itself. One can yearn (this word) for what is high and holy (Luke 22:15; Philippians 1:23)."

3. "The lusts of other things, the desires for worldly pleasures, can distract us from pursuing what is truly important in our spiritual lives."

### John Gill:
1. "The perplexing and distressing cares of it to get as much of it as they can, for themselves and families, fill their minds, and possess their souls even when and while they are hearing the word."
2. "Riches which are deceitful, especially when trusted in, and being obtained, they do not give the satisfaction they promise."
3. "Carnal desires after other objects, which are pleasing to the sensual mind, entering into their hearts, and gaining the ascendant there: choke the word, and it becomes unfruitful."

These quotes highlight how the cares of the world, the deceitfulness of riches, and the lusts of other things can distract and hinder the growth of the word in one's life.

### John Wesley:
1. "The desire of any thing, otherwise than as it leads to happiness in God, directly tends to barrenness of soul."
2. "Let him therefore who has received and retained the word, see that no other desire then enter in, such as perhaps till then he never knew."
3. "After the fruit had grown almost to perfection."
