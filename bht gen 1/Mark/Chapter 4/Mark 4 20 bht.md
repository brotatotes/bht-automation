# Mark 4:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, the commentators emphasize the importance of understanding and bearing fruit in the Christian life. The use of the pronoun oitinev highlights the specific group of people being referred to, namely those who hear and receive the word of God with a soft and tender heart. The varying order of thirty, sixty, and a hundred in different Gospel accounts underscores the different levels of productivity and effectiveness in the lives of believers. Ultimately, the emphasis is on the quality and faithfulness of the believer in fulfilling their purpose and calling, rather than the quantity of fruit produced.
