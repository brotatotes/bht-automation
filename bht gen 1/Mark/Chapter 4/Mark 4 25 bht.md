# Mark 4:25 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This verse teaches that those who have, and use what they have for the benefit of others, will be given even more. Similarly, those who do not use what they have, will lose what they think they possess. It illustrates the imperceptible growth of the word sown in the heart, from its earliest stage to the ripest fruits of righteousness. This paradoxical teaching of Jesus prompts reflection and action, highlighting the importance of acquiring and making use of Gospel knowledge, grace, and gifts for the betterment of oneself and others.
