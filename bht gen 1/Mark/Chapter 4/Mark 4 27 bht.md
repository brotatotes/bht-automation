# Mark 4:27 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, commentators highlight the mysterious process of growth, both in the physical realm and the realm of faith. The seed is sown and the grain grows, but the farmer does not understand the intricate workings involved. Similarly, the ministers of the word sow the seeds of the Gospel, but they cannot fully comprehend the inner workings of grace that bring about spiritual growth. They trust in God's providence and have confidence in the transformative power of His Word, knowing that ultimately, it is God who brings forth the increase.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Albert Barnes:
1. "Should sleep in the night and rise by day, for so the expression is to be understood. That is, should live in his usual way, without exerting any influence over the growing grain."
2. "By this we are not to infer that men are to use no diligence in the obtaining and in the growth of piety; but the illustration shows only that as we cannot tell how grain grows, so we cannot tell the mode in which piety increases in the heart."
3. "After all the researches of philosophers, no one has been able to tell the way in which grain grows. They can observe one fact after another; they can see the changes; they can see the necessity of rains and suns, of care and shelter, but beyond this they cannot go."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Grow [μηκυνηται] . Lit., lengthen; be extended by the seed lengthening out into blade and stalk."
2. "He knoweth not how (wJv oujk oiden aujtov). The Greek order is very lively : how knoweth not he."
3. "The Greek order is very lively: how knoweth not he."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "He who sows does not know how that takes place which he expects to occur, and to occur for his benefit." 
2. "A true picture, since such knowledge is not permitted to the wisest of men."
3. "What is known helps the growth very little."

### John Gill:
1. "And, as applied to them, is not to be understood of natural sleep, and indulging themselves in that; much less of spiritual sloth and indolence, as if they cared not what became of the seed sown, whether it sprung up, and came to any thing, or not; for neither of these belong to the characters of the true ministers of the word."
2. "But rather, this may be understood of their holy security, confidence, and satisfaction in their own minds, that it will turn to profit and advantage, both to the good of souls, and glory of God, not despairing of success; but having left their work with their Lord, they sit down easy and satisfied, believing that the word shall prosper to the thing whereunto it is sent."
3. "This work is done secretly, and powerfully, under the influence of divine grace, without their knowledge, though by them as instruments; so that though the sowing and planting are theirs, all the increase is God's."
