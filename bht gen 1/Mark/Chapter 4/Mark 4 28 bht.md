# Mark 4:28 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The growth and development of the Christian life is beautifully illustrated in this verse. Like the stages of a growing plant, spiritual growth takes time and goes through different phases. It is not dependent on human effort, but rather a natural and gradual process that is guided by the power of God. This growth is marked by the gradual increase of grace and faith, and it requires patience and trust in the Lord's timing and work in our lives.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "No trouble of ours can accelerate the growth, or shorten the stages through which each seed must pass."
2. "It is the mistake of modern Methodism, for instance, to be always working at the seed, taking it up to see whether it is growing, instead of leaving it to God’s own good time."
3. "The text of the Codex Bezæ is a very peculiar one, deviating more from the received readings and from the principal manuscript authorities than any other."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "For the earth bringeth forth fruit of herself; first the blade, then the ear, after that the full corn in the ear" - This verse beautifully illustrates the gradual growth and development in the Christian life and the kingdom of God. It reminds us that spiritual growth takes time and goes through different stages, just like the growth of a plant.
2. "Beautiful allusion to the succession of similar stages" - The commentary highlights the parallel between the stages of growth in nature and the stages of growth in the Christian life. This connection emphasizes the natural and organic progression of spiritual development.
3. "Though not definitely marked periods" - The commentary acknowledges that the stages of growth in the Christian life may not have specific time frames or clearly defined boundaries. This understanding allows for individual variations in spiritual growth and encourages patience and trust in the process.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "So religion in the heart is not by the power of man. It grows he cannot tell how, and of course he cannot without divine aid, control it. It is by the power of God."
2. "Both are connected with his effort; both are to be measured commonly by his effort...both grow he cannot tell how; both increase when the proper means are used, and both depend on God for increase."
3. "By this is denoted, undoubtedly, that grace or religion in the heart is of gradual growth. It is at first tender, feeble, perhaps almost imperceptible, like the first shootings of the grain in the earth."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Of herself [αυτοματη] . Lit., self-acting." 
2. "It occurs in only one other passage of the New Testament, Acts 12:10."
3. "Of the city gate which opened to Peter of its own accord."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The growth in nature is according to certain laws which act independently of man’s agency, though the agency of God who established these laws and acts through them, is not denied."
2. "The growth of the kingdom of God, in general and in individuals, is according to a development which is natural, i.e., in accordance with certain laws in the realm of grace, which are analogous to what are called natural laws, and like them acting with a certain spontaneousness; though God’s constant energy is present in both."
3. "The maturity of the Church or of individual Christians does not come at once. The repeated ‘then‘ marks the gradual progress better than ‘after that‘ The same word is used in the Greek in both clauses. The lesson is therefore one of patience."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The secret of growth is in the seed, not in the soil nor in the weather nor in the cultivating."
2. "The Holy Spirit works on the heart and uses the seed sown and makes it germinate and grow."
3. "This is the law and order of nature and also of grace in the kingdom of God."

### John Gill:
1. "Men are regenerated according to the abundant mercy of God, of water and of the Spirit, by the word of truth, through the sovereign will and pleasure of God."
2. "The whole work of grace is not by might, nor by power of man, but by the Spirit of the Lord of hosts."
3. "Grace at first appearance is very small, like the small green spire, when it first shoots out of the earth... but in process of time there is a growth and an increase; light increases, which shines more and more unto the perfect day; faith grows stronger and stronger; experience of the love of God is enlarged."
