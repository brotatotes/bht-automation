### Philip Schaff:
1. "The growth in nature is according to certain laws which act independently of man's agency, though the agency of God who established these laws and acts through them, is not denied." 
2. "The growth of the kingdom of God, in general and in individuals, is according to a development which is natural, i.e., in accordance with certain laws in the realm of grace, which are analogous to what are called natural laws, and like them acting with a certain spontaneousness; though God's constant energy is present in both." 
3. "The maturity of the Church or of individual Christians does not come at once. The repeated 'then' marks the gradual progress better than 'after that'. The same word is used in the Greek in both clauses."

### John Gill:
1. "For all these things are owing to the Spirit, power, and grace of God."
2. "But the design is to show, that as the earth without human power, without the husbandman, under the influence of the heavens, brings forth fruit; so without human power, without the Gospel minister, the word having taken root under divine influence, through the sun of righteousness, the dews of divine grace, and operations of the blessed Spirit, it rises up and brings forth fruit."
3. "Grace at first appearance is very small, like the small green spire, when it first shoots out of the earth: light into a man's self, his heart, his state and condition, in the knowledge of Christ, and the doctrines of the Gospel, is but very small; he is one of little faith, and weak in the exercise of it."
