# Mark 4:30 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the teacher opens the discussion by posing a question, a common method used by Jewish teachers. This gesture demonstrates that the disciples are included in sharing the teachings of the kingdom of God, indicating that they too should adopt the same approach as Christ. By asking this question, Christ prompts us to reflect on how we can apply the truths of the kingdom of God to our own lives and the lives of those around us.
