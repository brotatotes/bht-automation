## BHT:
From the commentaries, we can gather that the verse being described focuses on the concept of small beginnings with the potential for significant growth and transformation. The repetition of expressions in Mark indicates the intentional composition of his Gospel. The use of a mustard seed as a metaphor highlights the smallness and unassuming nature of the kingdom of God, which has the power to grow and expand beyond expectations. This verse emphasizes that even the smallest beginnings, whether in preaching the Gospel or the grace of God in our lives, can lead to great things.
