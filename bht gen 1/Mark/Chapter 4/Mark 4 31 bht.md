# Mark 4:31 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we see the repetition of expressions which indicates that Mark's Gospel is distinct and not simply a condensed version. The phrase "in the earth" emphasizes the humble nature of the kingdom of God, grounding it in the daily lives of people. The comparison to a mustard seed highlights the small beginnings of the kingdom, both in its initial preaching by ordinary individuals and the smallness of grace within the hearts of believers. This verse offers unique insights into the nature of God's kingdom and the growth of His grace.
