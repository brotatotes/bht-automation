# Mark 4:33 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus spoke the word of God in parables, tailoring his teachings to the capacity of his hearers, using plain and relatable language to ensure understanding. He used parables extensively, but there was a limit to their use for these men. His intention was to reveal the mystery of the kingdom in a veiled form, accessible to all, but not fully comprehended by his audience. This approach was a deliberate choice to convey deeper truths in a way that could be grasped by his listeners, while challenging them to seek further understanding.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "according to their capacity of receiving"
2. "see note on Matthew 13:12"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Had this been said in the corresponding passage of Matthew, we should have concluded that what that Evangelist recorded was but a specimen of other parables spoken on the same occasion."
2. "Matthew says, 'All these things spake Jesus unto the multitude in parables'; and as Mark records only some of the parables which Matthew gives, we are warranted to infer that the 'many such parables' alluded to here mean no more than the full complement of them which we find in Matthew."
3. "The phrase 'as they were able to hear it' implies that Jesus tailored his teaching to the capacity of his hearers, adapting his language and style to ensure they could understand and grasp the message he was conveying."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Spake he the word - The word of God. The doctrines of his gospel."
2. "As they were able to hear it - As they could comprehend it."
3. "They were like children; and he was obliged to lead them along cautiously and by degrees to a full understanding of the plan of salvation."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Mark's use of the word 'such' suggests that there were additional parables that Jesus spoke, which were not recorded in the Gospel. This implies that there is a depth and richness to Jesus' teachings that goes beyond what is written in the Scriptures."

2. "The fact that the people were able to hear the parables indicates that Jesus spoke in a way that was accessible and understandable to the common people. This highlights the inclusive nature of Jesus' teachings and his desire to reach out to all."

3. "Mark's emphasis on the uniqueness of these parables being 'peculiar to Mark' suggests that he had a specific purpose in including them in his Gospel. Perhaps he wanted to emphasize certain aspects of Jesus' teachings that were particularly relevant to his audience or to address specific issues that were prevalent at that time."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The many such expressions in the Gospels should put an end to the foolish assumption that each Evangelist intended to tell all he knew."
2. "Not merely as they had opportunity of listening to His instructions, but 'according to their capacity of receiving,' the ability being a moral as well as mental."
3. "It is taken for granted that He intuitively knew their capacity, a point in which well-meaning instructors may fail."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Jesus used parables now largely, but there was a limit even to the use of them to these men." 
2. "He gave them the mystery of the kingdom in this veiled parabolic form which was the only feasible form at this stage." 
3. "But even so they did not understand what they heard."

### John Gill:
1. "He spoke the word to them in parables, as they were able to hear, without understanding them; and in such a manner, on purpose that they might not understand." 
2. "He condescended to their weakness, accommodated himself to their capacities, and made use of the plainest similes." 
3. "Took his comparison from things in nature, the most known and obvious, that what he intended might more easily be understood."

### John Wesley:

3. "A rule never to be forgotten by those who instruct others"
