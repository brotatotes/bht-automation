# Mark 4:34 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this passage, Jesus is described as primarily teaching through parables, using symbolic stories to convey truths about His kingdom. However, in private moments with His disciples, He went beyond the parables, explaining everything to them in plain language. This private instruction allowed the disciples to gain a deeper understanding of Jesus' teachings and prepared them for their future work. The use of parables served multiple purposes, including gradually instilling truth and overcoming prejudice. Additionally, the subsequent Epistles provide further clarification and insight into the teachings given by Jesus.
