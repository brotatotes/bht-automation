# Mark 4:35 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the midst of teaching parables, Jesus sets off to the other side of the sea, seeking rest and a chance to perform a miraculous healing. However, as soon as they set sail, a violent storm arises, testing the disciples' faith and causing fear and panic. Yet, even in the chaos, Jesus demonstrates his authority over the elements, rebuking the wind and waves, and bringing about calm and peace. This story serves as a powerful reminder that when faced with trials and doubts, Jesus is present, in control, and able to bring tranquility to any situation.
