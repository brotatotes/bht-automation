# Mark 4:37 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In a sudden and furious storm, violent winds descended from Mount Hermon, colliding with the Sea of Galilee, causing the waves to beat against the boat and fill it rapidly. The boat was on the brink of sinking, with the disciples facing imminent danger. This storm, characteristic of the Sea of Galilee, arose with great rapidity and intensity, leaving the disciples in a perilous situation.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "To such sudden squalls the Sea of Galilee is very liable from its position, in a deep basin, skirted on the east by lofty mountain ranges, while on the west the hills are intersected by narrow gorges through which the wind sweeps across the lake, and raises its waters with great rapidity into a storm."
2. "And the waves beat into the ship- kept beating or pitching on the ship."
3. "So that it was now full- rather, 'so that it was already filling.' In Matthew (Matthew 8:24), 'insomuch that the ship was covered with the waves'; but this is too strong. It should be, 'so that the ship was getting covered by the waves.'"

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Distinctively furious storm or hurricane." 
2. "The wind has a singular force and suddenness."
3. "The wind, speeding swiftly above a long and level plateau, gathers much force as it sweeps through flat deserts, until suddenly it meets this huge gap in the way, and it tumbles down here irresistible."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "From Mark 4:35, we infer that it was already night when the storm arose."
2. "All three accounts of this storm and its effects differ in form, but agree in substance."
3. "The lake was and is still subject to sudden storms, but very few boats are seen there now."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Luke's 'came down' shows that the storm fell suddenly from Mount Hermon down into the Jordan Valley and smote the Sea of Galilee violently at its depth of 682 feet below the Mediterranean Sea."
2. "The hot air at this depth draws the storm down with sudden power. These sudden storms continue to this day on the Sea of Galilee."
3. "The waves beat into the boat 'so that the boat was covered with the waves' (Matthew 8:24). Mark has it: 'insomuch that the boat was now filling.' Graphic description of the plight of the disciples."

### John Gill:
1. "And there arose a great storm of wind... a sort of a hurricane." 
2. "The waves beat into the ship, so that it was full... ready to sink." 
3. "They were in imminent danger, in the utmost extremity."
