In this verse, the person in question is described as sinking into a deep sleep despite the raging tempest around them. The commentators highlight the fatigue of this individual and the unbelief and fear expressed by others. They mention the location of this person "on the pillow," which signifies the specific part of the vessel near the rudder where they lay. The commentators also note the unkindness, complaint, and lack of faith exhibited by those around the person in this moment of trial.
