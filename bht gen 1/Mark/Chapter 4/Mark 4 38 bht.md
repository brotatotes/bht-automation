# Mark 4:38 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, we see Jesus on the boat, using the cushion at the stern as a pillow, possibly to find some comfort and rest from the fatigue of his day. Despite the raging storm, Jesus remains asleep, which causes the disciples to express their fear and lack of faith, both in their words and in their unkindness towards him. This story serves as a reminder that even in moments of trial, our faith can falter, just like the disciples', as we question God's concern and protection over us.
