# Mark 4:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The seed of the word fell by the wayside, where the hard path made it difficult for the seed to take root. Not only was the soil unprepared, but external forces destroyed the seed, preventing it from penetrating beneath the surface. The second case involved rocky ground, posing its own challenges for growth. The seed fell on the common beaten path, making no impression, and was hindered by the ravenous bird of prey, Satan, seeking to devour its usefulness.

"The devils, who have their abode in the air, especially the prince of the posse of them; and the Syriac version reads it in the singular number, 'and the fowl came'; that ravenous bird of prey, Satan, who goes about seeking what he may devour; and for this purpose attends where the word is preached, to hinder its usefulness as much as in him lies."
