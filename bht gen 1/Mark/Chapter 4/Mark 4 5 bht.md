# Mark 4:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the ground being described is not one with a deep layer of soil but rather a thin surface covering a rock. The commentator suggests that the intention is to convey the idea of a superficial faith. Another commentator adds that the message was preached to those with hardened hearts, which prevented the seed from taking root. These individuals made a quick and shallow profession of the word, lacking a genuine and transformative experience.
