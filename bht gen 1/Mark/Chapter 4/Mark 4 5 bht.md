# Mark 4:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this passage, the commentators suggest that the verse refers to a specific type of ground. It is ground that has a thin surface of earth covering a rock, signifying a lack of depth. They argue that the word or message being preached is received by individuals with hardened hearts or those who make a quick profession without truly experiencing its power. If this ground had more depth, it would have taken more time for the message to take root and result in genuine transformation.

2. "What means this? See on Matthew 13:5- :."
3. "Third Case: THE THORNY GROUND."

### John Gill:
1. "The word was preached to some persons who had hearts of stone, and which remained so."
2. "A sudden and hasty profession of the word was made, without a powerful experience of it."
3. "If it had [depth of earth], it would have been longer in coming up; more work would have been done by it, which would have required more time, before a profession of it had been made."
