# Mark 4:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
A verse in the Bible describes a situation where persecution arises due to the strength and power of the Word. This persecution becomes intense, testing the superficial knowledge of the Word which cannot withstand such heat. The Word is merely a mental concept, lacking any deep connection to the heart, causing the profession of faith to quickly fade away. Ultimately, the Word withers and fades due to its lack of a firm foundation in times of trial and persecution.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### John Gill:
1. "Persecution arose because of the word, and that became very hot and vehement, it tried and pierced through this thin speculative knowledge of the word, which could not stand before it, and bear the heat of it."
2. "The word had only a place in the head, and not in the heart; wherefore the profession of it was soon dropped, and came to nothing."
3. "It withered away; the word had no root, no deep foundation to sustain it in times of trial and persecution."
