# Mark 4:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the seed represents the word of God being ministered to individuals who are consumed by the distractions of the world, the allure of wealth, and various desires. Unfortunately, the word does not have the desired effect on them. It does not have the power to overcome or weaken these worldly influences, allowing them to prevail over the word and render it ineffective and unfruitful. Thus, the verse highlights the struggle between the word and the overwhelming temptations of the world.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "This case is that of ground not thoroughly cleaned of the thistles, c. which, rising above the good seed, 'choke' or 'smother' it, excluding light and air, and drawing away the moisture and richness of the soil."
2. "The evil here is neither a hard nor a shallow soil - there is softness enough, and depth enough; but it is the existence in it of what draws all the moisture and richness of the soil away to itself, and so starves the plant."
3. "The thorns represent the distractions and cares of this world that can suffocate and hinder the growth of the good seed within us."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Choked [συνεπνιξαν] . The preposition, sun = com (together), carries the idea of com - pression." 
2. "It yielded no fruit." 
3. "Added by Mark."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "And it yielded no fruit." - This phrase added by Mark emphasizes the lack of productivity in the situation being described. It highlights the failure of the seed to produce any desired outcome, serving as a reminder that not all efforts will bear fruit.
2. "His account is not an abridgment." - Mark's inclusion of this detail indicates that his version of the story is not a condensed or summarized version. It suggests that he is providing additional information to enhance the reader's understanding of the situation.
3. "The same result is of course implied in the other narrative." - This statement acknowledges that the lack of fruit is already implied in the other accounts of the story. It suggests that Mark's addition serves to reinforce and emphasize this important aspect of the narrative.

### John Gill:
1. "The word was ministered to some who were eat up with the cares of the world, and the deceitfulness of riches, and other lusts."
2. "The word did not take place so as to beat down, overcome, and root out these things, nor even to weaken, and keep under, and prevent the influence of them."
3. "These got the ascendant of the word, and prevailed over it, and made it altogether useless and unsuccessful."
