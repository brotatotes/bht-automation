# Mark 4:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the seed of the word is sown among those who are consumed by the worries of the world, the allure of wealth, and various other desires. The thorns that grow up alongside the seed overwhelm it, preventing it from truly taking root and bearing fruit. These worldly concerns gain the upper hand, rendering the word ineffective and unproductive in their lives. The result is an unfortunate situation where the seed yields no fruit and fails to triumph over the distractions and temptations of the world.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "This case is that of ground not thoroughly cleaned of the thistles, c. which, rising above the good seed, 'choke' or 'smother' it, excluding light and air, and drawing away the moisture and richness of the soil."
2. "The evil here is neither a hard nor a shallow soil—there is softness enough, and depth enough; but it is the existence in it of what draws all the moisture and richness of the soil away to itself, and so starves the plant."
3. "What now are these 'thorns?'"

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Choked [συνεπνιξαν]... carries the idea of compression." 
2. "The preposition, sun = com (together), carries the idea of compression."
3. "It yielded no fruit. Added by Mark."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "And it yielded no fruit." - This phrase added by Mark emphasizes the lack of productivity in the situation, highlighting the failure of the seed to bear fruit. It underscores the importance of fruitful growth in the context of the parable.
2. "His account is not an abridgment." - Mark's inclusion of this detail indicates that his version of the story is not a condensed or summarized version. It suggests that Mark's intention is to provide a comprehensive and detailed account of the events, adding depth and richness to the narrative.
3. "The same result is of course implied in the other narrative." - This statement acknowledges that the lack of fruitfulness is already implied in the other accounts of the parable. It suggests that the absence of fruit is a common and expected outcome in this particular scenario, reinforcing the lesson being taught in the parable.

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Choked (συνεπνιξαν). Πνιγω means to strangle, throttle. Mark has the compounded form with συν-, squeezed together." This quote explains the meaning of the word "choked" in the verse, providing insight into the intensity of the action.

2. "Matthew 13:7 has απεπνιξαν, choked off." This quote highlights a variation in wording between Mark and Matthew, showing how different translations can provide additional nuances to the verse.

3. "Yielded no fruit (καρπον ουκ εδωκαν). In Mark alone. Barren in results." This quote emphasizes that the plants being choked did not produce any fruit, emphasizing the lack of productivity and the negative outcome of being choked.

### John Gill:
1. "The word was ministered to some who were eat up with the cares of the world, and the deceitfulness of riches, and other lusts."
