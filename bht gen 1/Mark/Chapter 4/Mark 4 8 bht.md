### Philip Schaff:
1. "Growing up and increasing." - This phrase, unique to Mark, emphasizes the continuous and progressive nature of the growth process. It suggests that spiritual growth is not a one-time event but a lifelong journey of development and maturation.

2. "The whole progress of the plant." - This phrase highlights that the growth of the plant is not limited to the production of fruit alone. It encompasses all aspects of the plant's development, including roots, stems, leaves, and branches. Similarly, our spiritual growth involves various dimensions of our lives, such as character, knowledge, and relationships.

3. "The smallest proportion first." - This observation points out the interesting choice of words in Mark's account, where the smallest proportion is mentioned first. This may imply that even the smallest signs of growth and progress should be acknowledged and celebrated, as they are essential steps towards the ultimate fruition of our spiritual journey.

### John Gill:
1. "The word was preached to some whose hearts were disposed by the Spirit and grace of God to receive it."
2. "They not only appeared, and made an outward profession of the word, and brought forth a little show of fruit, which comes to nothing, as in others; but they were filled with the fruits of righteousness."
3. "In some the word of God produced larger and greater effects; the grace of God was more in exercise in some, than in others, and some were more fruitful and useful."
