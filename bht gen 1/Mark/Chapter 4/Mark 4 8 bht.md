# Mark 4:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the soil represents different hearts and responses to the word of God. Some receive the word with readiness and produce abundant fruit, their lives filled with the fruits of righteousness. Others may make an outward profession but only bear a shallow display of fruit, which ultimately comes to nothing. The varying degrees of fruitfulness reflect the different levels of grace and impact of the word in each individual's life.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The goodness of this last soil consists in its qualities being precisely the reverse of the other three soils."
2. "From its softness and tenderness, receiving and cherishing the seed."
3. "In such a soil the seed 'brings forth fruit,' in all different degrees of profusion, according to the measure in which the soil possesses those qualities."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The Rev. literally renders the participles, growing up and increasing, thus describing the process more vividly."
2. "These two participles, moreover, explain the use of the imperfect tense, denoting continuance."
3. "It began to yield and kept yielding as it increased."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Growing up and increasing." - This phrase used by Mark is unique to his account of the parable. It emphasizes the continuous growth and progress of the plant, which is necessary for the production of fruit or grain. (Quote 1)
2. "The whole progress of the plant." - The phrase highlights that the growth of the plant is not limited to the fruit alone, but encompasses the entire development process. This broader perspective helps us understand the significance of each stage in the plant's growth. (Quote 2)
3. "Puts the smallest proportion first." - Mark's arrangement of the parable places the smallest proportion of the fruit's yield at the beginning, while Matthew's account places it at the end. This difference in sequencing demonstrates the independence of the Gospel writers and provides additional insights into the intended message of the parable. (Quote 3)

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Growing up and increasing" - A vivid detail enlarging on the continued growth implied in the imperfect "yielded fruit." It emphasizes the ongoing process of growth and development.

2. "It kept on yielding as it grew" - This quote highlights the continuous nature of the fruit-bearing process. It suggests that as the plant grows, it continues to produce fruit, emphasizing the importance of consistent productivity.

3. "Fruit is what matters" - This statement underscores the significance of the fruit produced by the plant. It implies that the ultimate goal or measure of success is the tangible results or outcomes that are produced.

### John Gill:
1. "The word was preached to some whose hearts were disposed by the Spirit and grace of God to receive it."
2. "They not only appeared, and made an outward profession of the word, and brought forth a little show of fruit, which comes to nothing, as in others; but they were filled with the fruits of righteousness."
3. "In some the word of God produced larger and greater effects; the grace of God was more in exercise in some, than in others, and some were more fruitful and useful."
