## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "The journey to the other side of the sea symbolizes a transition from the familiar to the unknown, from comfort to challenge. It reminds us that growth and transformation often require us to step out of our comfort zones and face the unfamiliar." 

2. "The country of the Gadarenes represents a place of darkness and spiritual bondage. It serves as a reminder that sometimes we find ourselves in situations that seem hopeless and overwhelming. But even in the darkest places, Jesus is there, ready to bring light and deliverance." 

3. "This verse teaches us the importance of crossing over to the other side, both physically and metaphorically. It encourages us to embrace new experiences and challenges, trusting that God is with us every step of the way.

3. "On the locality and in explanation of the cut, see Matthew 8:28."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "The ruins of the village Khersa (Gerasa) probably point to this site which is in the district of Gadara some six miles southeastward." 

2. "The Gerasenes, or Gadarenes, were a region known for their possession by demons, as evidenced by the presence of the demon-possessed man in this story." 

3. "The mention of the Gerasenes or Gadarenes highlights the power of Jesus over the forces of darkness, as he successfully casts out the demons and restores the man to his right mind."

### John Gill:
1. "The country of the Gadarenes, also known as the Gergesenes or Gerasenes, was located near the Sea of Galilee. It was a region with both Jewish and Gentile inhabitants, evident from its proximity to pagan hot baths and its mention in ancient Greek and Roman texts." 

2. "The mention of the whirlpool of Gadara, said to have existed since the time of the flood, adds a sense of mystery and ancient history to the region."

3. "The location of Gadara in Decapolis and Coelo Syria, as mentioned by Pliny and Ptolemy, respectively, further highlights the significance and prominence of this region in ancient times."

### John Wesley:
1. "The demon-possessed men in this story represent the extreme manifestation of evil and spiritual bondage. They were completely under the control of demonic forces, living among the tombs and causing terror in the region. This highlights the reality of spiritual warfare and the power of Jesus to set people free from the grip of darkness."

2. "The reaction of the demons to Jesus' presence is significant. They recognized Him as the Son of God and begged Him not to torment them. This shows that even the forces of evil acknowledge the authority and power of Jesus."

3. "The pigs rushing down the steep bank into the lake after the demons were cast out is a powerful image. It demonstrates the destructive nature of evil and how it ultimately leads to destruction. Jesus' deliverance not only sets the men free but also brings about the destruction of the demonic forces."

4. "The response of the people in the region is intriguing. Instead of rejoicing over the deliverance of the demon-possessed men, they were filled with fear and asked Jesus to leave. This reveals the resistance and fear that often accompany the work of God in people's lives."

5. "This story serves as a reminder of the power and authority of Jesus over all forces of darkness. It encourages us to trust in Him for deliverance from any form of spiritual bondage and to have faith in His ability to bring about transformation and freedom."
