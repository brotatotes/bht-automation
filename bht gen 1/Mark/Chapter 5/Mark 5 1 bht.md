## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "The location of this event is significant because the Gadarenes were predominantly Gentiles, symbolizing Jesus' mission to bring salvation to all people, not just the Jews." 

2. "By crossing over to the other side of the sea, Jesus demonstrates his willingness to go to great lengths to reach those who are in need, even if it means venturing into unfamiliar territory." 

3. "The mention of the Gadarenes also highlights the spiritual darkness and bondage that existed in this region, emphasizing the transformative power of Jesus' presence and his ability to set people free from their chains."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The Gerasenes. The preferable form here. 'Gergesenes' is found in some of the best authorities." 

2. "The latter is the preferable reading in Luke, although there is good authority for 'Gerasenes' there also." 

3. "On the locality and in explanation of the cut, see Matthew 8:28."

### John Gill:
1. "The country of the Gadarenes, also known as the country of the Gergesenes or Gerasenes, was located near the Sea of Galilee. It was a place with hot baths and was known for its whirlpool that had existed since the time of the flood." 

2. "The mention of the Gadarenes being a Heathen country suggests that the people living there were not followers of the Jewish faith." 

3. "The proximity of Gadara to Tiberias, the town from where Jesus and his disciples crossed the sea, indicates that the events described in this verse took place in close proximity to each other."

1. "The demons recognized Jesus as the Son of God, acknowledging his authority and power over them. This highlights the divinity of Jesus and his ability to conquer evil forces." 

2. "The presence of the demons in the tombs symbolizes the spiritual death and bondage that sin brings. Jesus' encounter with the demon-possessed men demonstrates his mission to bring freedom and new life to those who are trapped in darkness." 

3. "The response of the townspeople, who were more concerned about their economic loss than the miraculous deliverance of the demon-possessed men, reveals the hardness of their hearts and their lack of understanding of the true value of spiritual transformation."
