# Mark 5:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, we see a request being made by a singular spirit on behalf of many. The commentators point out that the earnestness of the plea indicates a preparation for a subsequent petition. It is noteworthy that the devilish entities are subject to the authority of Christ, being unable to go anywhere or act without His permission. Despite their hatred, they are surprisingly willing to humble themselves and seek favors, as long as it serves their ultimate agenda.
