# Mark 5:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, we see the relentless and malevolent nature of the devils, who plead to continue their work of mischief in order to harm people and turn them against Jesus. They are determined and restless in their pursuit of causing harm, and even if they are prevented from destroying lives and souls, they find some satisfaction in inflicting physical harm. Despite their desire to continue wreaking havoc, they are met with resistance and are unable to escape the consequences of their destructive actions.
