# Mark 5:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This passage narrates a remarkable event involving spirits being cast out into a herd of swine, resulting in the swine plunging into the sea and perishing. Mark provides us with vivid details, including the exact number of swine, addressing the graphic nature of their demise in the waters. The commentators note the significance of this event, not only in relation to the miracle itself but also in terms of its theological implications. The casting out of the spirits demonstrates not only their existence and limited spatial presence but also the superiority of human lives over worldly possessions.
