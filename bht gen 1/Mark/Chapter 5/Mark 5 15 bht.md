# Mark 5:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, the commentators describe a powerful scene where a man, previously possessed by a legion of devils, is transformed by Jesus. They emphasize the man's complete transformation - from being naked and insane to being seated, clothed, and of sound mind. The commentators also mention the fear that grips those who witness this extraordinary change, which prevents them from acting rudely or violently towards the man. This transformation serves as a symbol of the spiritual conversion experienced by those who encounter Jesus.
