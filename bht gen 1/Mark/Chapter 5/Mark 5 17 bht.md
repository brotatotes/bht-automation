# Mark 5:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this passage, we find a vivid account of a powerful and miraculous encounter. The people in this region, driven by fear and astonishment, plead for Jesus to leave their borders, not recognizing the divine presence among them. The clash between the spiritual welfare brought by Jesus and the worldly concerns of the people is evident, as they prioritize their own material possessions over the healing and salvation that Jesus offers. Their lack of understanding and fear of being affected negatively by Jesus' power illustrate the contrasting perspectives between the spiritual and the worldly.
