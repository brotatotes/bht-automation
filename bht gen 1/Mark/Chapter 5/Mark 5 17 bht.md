# Mark 5:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, the people in the region are afraid and uncomfortable with Jesus' presence because they do not fully recognize or understand his power and purpose. They see him as a potential threat or punishment rather than as the Son of God and Savior of the world. Their fear and misunderstanding prevent them from fully embracing the salvation and blessings that Jesus can offer.
