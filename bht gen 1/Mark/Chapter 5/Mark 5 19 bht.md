# Mark 5:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
A man is sent to his own house, to his friends and family, proclaiming the great things the Lord has done for him. This task holds a significant purpose as his example previously may have harmed them, but now he must testify in the region where Christ was known and dreaded. This opportunity to witness and share the Lord's blessings is particularly important where Christ did not go in person, as it reminds us to be ambassadors of His love and miracles.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "There was perhaps some reason why this man should be sent to proclaim God’s mercy to his friends."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "He may have been in danger of despising his friends in the district that rejected Christ. His previous life may have harmed them; our Lord would make his future life a blessing to them."
2. "The command to those healed was often to keep silence, here it is the reverse, and for a good reason. There was no danger of tumult attending such a proclamation in that region as in Galilee. Then our Lord, even when rejected, would leave a preacher behind Him."
3. "How great things the Lord hath done for thee. Luke: ‘God hath done for thee.’ So that ‘the Lord ‘means Jehovah, but it is also a fair inference that it means Christ Himself (see Mark 5:20)."
4. "And hath had mercy on thee. This hints at a spiritual blessing."

### Archibald T Robertson:

### John Gill:
1. "He bids him go to his 'own house', as it is in Luke, Luke 8:39 to the place of his former abode; to the town, or city, where he before dwelt, and where his father and mother, brethren and sisters, wife and children might live; and there relate to them what great things the Lord, or God, as the Ethiopic version reads, had done for him."
2. "So such as are called by grace, and are turned from darkness to light; and from the power of Satan unto God, ought to go, to their Christian friends, and to the church of God, and declare in Zion the great things which God has done for their souls; in enlightening, quickening, converting, and comforting them, to the glory of his rich mercy, and abundant grace."
3. "They are 'great things' indeed which the Lord has done for his people: he has done great things for them in eternity; he has loved them with an everlasting love; he has chosen them in his Son to holiness and happiness; he has made a covenant with him, for them, full of spiritual blessings and promises; he has provided him, as a Saviour, for them, and has appointed, and called him to that work; all which is more or less made known to them in the effectual calling, when they receive the Spirit of God, that they may know the things which are freely given to them of God."
