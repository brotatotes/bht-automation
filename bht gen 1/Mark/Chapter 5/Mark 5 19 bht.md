# Mark 5:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, a man is called to proclaim God's mercy to his friends, despite the possibility that his previous life may have harmed them. His transformed life and powerful testimony of God's grace would serve as a blessing and a testimony to others, especially in regions where Jesus did not personally go. This emphasizes the importance of believers sharing their personal experiences of God's work and being witnesses for Christ, carrying out the mission even in places where He is not physically present.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "There was perhaps some reason why this man should be sent to proclaim God's mercy to his friends."
2. "His example may in former times have been prejudicial to them."
3. "His transformation and proclamation of God's mercy would serve as a powerful testimony to the transformative power of God's grace."

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "To be a missionary for Christ, in the region where he was so well known and so long dreaded, was a far nobler calling than to follow Him where nobody had ever heard of him." 

2. "Other trophies not less illustrious could be raised by the same power and grace." 

3. "Jesus suffered him not."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "He may have been in danger of despising his friends in the district that rejected Christ. His previous life may have harmed them; our Lord would make his future life a blessing to them."
2. "The command to those healed was often to keep silence, here it is the reverse, and for a good reason. There was no danger of tumult attending such a proclamation in that region as in Galilee. Then our Lord, even when rejected, would leave a preacher behind Him."
3. "How great things the Lord hath done for thee. Luke: 'God hath done for thee.' So that 'the Lord' means Jehovah, but it is also a fair inference that it means Christ Himself (see Mark 5:20)."
4. "And hath had mercy on thee. This hints at a spiritual blessing."

### John Gill:
1. "He bids him go to his 'own house', as it is in Luke, Luke 8:39 to the place of his former abode; to the town, or city, where he before dwelt, and where his father and mother, brethren and sisters, wife and children might live; and there relate to them what great things the Lord, or God, as the Ethiopic version reads, had done for him."
2. "So such as are called by grace, and are turned from darkness to light; and from the power of Satan unto God, ought to go, to their Christian friends, and to the church of God, and declare in Zion the great things which God has done for their souls; in enlightening, quickening, converting, and comforting them, to the glory of his rich mercy, and abundant grace."
3. "They are 'great things' indeed which the Lord has done for his people: he has done great things for them in eternity; he has loved then with an everlasting love; he has chosen them in his Son to holiness and happiness; he has made a covenant with him, for them, full of spiritual blessings and promises; he has provided him, as a Saviour, for them, and has appointed, and called him to that work; all which is more or less made known to them in the effectual calling, when they receive the Spirit of God, that they may know the things which are freely given to them of God."

### John Wesley:
1. "Tell them how great things the Lord hath done for thee" - This emphasizes the importance of sharing the blessings and miracles that God has done in our lives. It encourages us to testify to others about the goodness of God and the ways He has worked in our own personal experiences.

2. "This was peculiarly needful there, where Christ did not go in person" - This highlights the significance of personal testimony in spreading the message of God's work, especially in places where Jesus may not physically be present. It emphasizes the role of believers in sharing the Gospel and being witnesses for Christ.

3. "Where Christ did not go in person" - This phrase underscores the idea that believers are called to be ambassadors of Christ, representing Him and sharing His message wherever He has not physically gone. It reminds us of our responsibility to proclaim the good news and make disciples in all corners of the world.
