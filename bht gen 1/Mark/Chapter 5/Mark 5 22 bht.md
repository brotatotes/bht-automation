# Mark 5:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this passage, we encounter a ruler who approaches Jesus, possibly after eagerly waiting for Him to return. Another account suggests that the ruler approached Jesus while He was speaking about fasting. This ruler, whose name is Jairus, sought Jesus' help fervently, falling at His feet upon seeing Him. It is interesting to note that Matthew does not mention Jairus by name. The synagogue rulers, like Jairus, held positions of authority and were responsible for overseeing the affairs of the synagogue.
