# Mark 5:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, a ruler of the synagogue named Jairus approaches Jesus, seeking his help. The ruler seems desperate, as commentators describe him as anxiously awaiting Jesus's arrival and throwing himself at his feet in reverence. Despite the ruler's respect, it is noted that he may not have worshiped Jesus as God. Jairus's role as a ruler of the synagogue is essential, with commentators explaining how synagogue councils, presidents, and rulers oversaw the affairs of the synagogue.
