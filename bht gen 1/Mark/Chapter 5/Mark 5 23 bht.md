# Mark 5:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, a desperate father seeks help from Jesus for his daughter who is gravely ill. The father's urgent requests are met with a display of faith in Jesus' healing power. Through the commentaries, we learn that the daughter is referred to as a "little maid" or "young woman" depending on her age, and that the father's faith is noteworthy due to the great prejudice of his social class. The father's persistence and belief in Jesus' ability to restore his daughter's life form the focal point of this poignant verse.
