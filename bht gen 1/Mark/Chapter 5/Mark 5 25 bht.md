# Mark 5:25 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, a woman with an incurable illness symbolizes the natural state of a sinner, defiled and unfit for the company of others according to the law. Sin, like her disease, pollutes every aspect of our being, making us unclean in the eyes of God. Yet, this story also highlights the power of faith and persistence, as the woman's touch represents her unwavering belief in Jesus' divine power and her desperate desire for healing. In response, Jesus shows compassion and disregards societal norms, demonstrating his willingness to meet us in the depths of our needs.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### John Gill:
1. "This profluvious woman is an emblem of a sinner in a state of nature: as her disease was in itself an uncleanness, and rendered her unclean by the law, whereby she was unfit for the company and society of others; so the disease of sin, with which all are infected, is a pollution itself, and of a defiling nature."
2. "All the members of the body, and all the powers and faculties of the soul are polluted with it, and the whole man is filthy in the sight of God, and is pronounced unclean by the law of God; and such persons are very unfit for the society of saints on earth, and much less to be with those in heaven."
3. "The disease of sin, and indeed it is much worse; it is what is brought into the world with men, and is as old as themselves; is natural to them, and cannot be removed by any ordinary and natural methods, but requires supernatural power and grace."

### John Wesley:
1. "The woman with the issue of blood teaches us the power of faith and persistence in seeking healing and restoration." 

2. "Her touch of Jesus' garment signifies her belief in his divine power and her desperate desire for healing." 

3. "Jesus' response to her demonstrates his compassion and willingness to meet us in our deepest needs, regardless of societal norms or expectations."
