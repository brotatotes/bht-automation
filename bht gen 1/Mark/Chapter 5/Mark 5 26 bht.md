# Mark 5:26 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, a woman is described who had suffered greatly under various forms of treatment and had exhausted all her resources in seeking healing. This highlights the futility of human efforts to address spiritual maladies, symbolizing the fallen state of humanity. The woman's desperate pursuit of a cure through physicians emphasizes the failure of worldly remedies. However, Jesus' healing of her serves as a powerful protest against such futile attempts and demonstrates His authority over both physical and spiritual ailments, offering hope and liberation from the bondage of self-reliance and legalistic practices.
