# Mark 5:26 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this passage, a woman is depicted who has suffered greatly, enduring various treatments that have failed to heal her. She represents our fallen state as humans, highlighting the futility of human remedies for spiritual ailments. The vivid account by Mark emphasizes her worsening condition, contrasting with the hopeful response of Jesus. Despite her financial and physical struggles, her encounter with Jesus becomes her one chance for healing. This story serves as both a protest against mistreatment and a reminder that true healing is found in the tender care of Jesus, rather than in human efforts.
