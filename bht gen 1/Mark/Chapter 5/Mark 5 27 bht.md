# Mark 5:27 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
A woman, having heard of Jesus and His ability to heal, approached Him with a firm confidence that He could relieve her desperate condition. In the midst of a crowd, she stealthily touched the hem of His garment, knowing that His touch had the power to heal. This act demonstrated her faith that Jesus was above any ceremonial laws and that His healing was accessible even in the smallest, trembling gesture. Her determination and knowledge of His miraculous works drove her to seek Him as her last and only hope for relief.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "What had she 'heard of Jesus?' No doubt it was His marvellous cures she had heard of; and the hearing of these, in connection with her bitter experience of the vanity of applying to any other, had been blessed to the kindling in her soul of a firm confidence that He who had so willingly wrought such cures on others was able and would not refuse to heal her also."
2. "According to the ceremonial law, the touch of anyone having the disease which this woman had would have defiled the person touched. Some think that the recollection of this may account for her stealthily approaching Him in the crowd behind, and touching but the hem of His garment."
3. "But there was an instinct in the faith which brought her to Jesus, which taught her, that if that touch could set her free from the defiling disease itself, it was impossible to communicate defilement to Him, and that this wondrous Healer must be above such laws."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "She came because she had heard." - This emphasizes the woman's faith and determination to seek Jesus based on what she had heard about Him.
2. "She had heard of His doings, as well as His name." - This highlights that the woman's knowledge of Jesus extended beyond just His name; she was aware of His miraculous deeds.
3. "Mark alone mentions this." - This points out a unique detail in Mark's account, highlighting his attention to specific details such as the presence of a crowd during this event.
4. "Matthew and Luke are more particular: 'the hem of His garment.'" - This shows that Matthew and Luke provide additional details about the woman's specific action of touching the hem of Jesus' garment, providing a more vivid picture of the event.

### John Gill:
1. "Christ is the sinner's last shift; he tries every one first before he comes to him; he spends all his money, strength, and time, with others, to no purpose; and finding them all to be useless and unserviceable, he applies to him, who is the only physician that can give relief in this case."
2. "Like this woman, having heard of his ability to save to the uttermost those that come to him; and being encouraged by the many cures of the worst of sinners, of such who were in the most desperate condition, presses in the throng, through a great many temptations, difficulties, and discouragements thrown in the way by Satan, and its own evil heart of unbelief."
3. "Though I am such a vile, sinful, unrighteous, and impotent creature, yet surely in the Lord there is righteousness and strength, if I can but by faith lay hold thereon; though it be but in a weak way, only by a touch, and in a trembling manner; I shall be justified from all things, I could not be justified by all the works of righteousness I have been doing, and that evidentially and comfortably."
