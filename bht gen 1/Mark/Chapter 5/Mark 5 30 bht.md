# Mark 5:30 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, Jesus, fully aware of the power and virtue that resided within Him, felt that it had gone forth to heal. With divine authority and deep connection, Jesus turned around to ask who had touched Him, acknowledging the complex object of His knowledge: His own power and its outward manifestation. This internal, essential virtue was not borrowed or dependent on another, but was His own, exerted by the Lord God omnipotent. Just as the apostles derived power from Christ to cure diseases, Jesus, being God, possessed infinite virtue within Himself to heal all diseases.
