# Mark 5:31 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, Jesus is in a crowded place and someone touches him in an intentional, faith-filled way. The disciples are surprised at Jesus' awareness of the touch and question the necessity of the inquiry. Jesus, however, perceives the power that has gone out from him and shows compassion and sensitivity towards the crowd's demands. Though the disciples may not fully grasp it, Jesus's response reveals his attentiveness and sympathy towards those seeking healing and connection.
