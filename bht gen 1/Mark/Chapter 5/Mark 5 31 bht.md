# Mark 5:31 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this vivid verse, we witness the disciples' astonishment as Jesus asks who touched him in the midst of a crowded gathering. Their limited understanding of his power and authority is emphasized, highlighting their human weakness and lack of faith. While the disciples fail to comprehend the significance, Jesus, with his utmost human sympathy, acknowledges the drain on his energy caused by the voluntary touch of faith that drew virtue out of him.
