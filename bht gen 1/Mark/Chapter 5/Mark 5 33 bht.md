# Mark 5:33 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, a woman, who had experienced physical suffering and had tried various unsuccessful remedies, approaches Jesus with fear and timidity. Her disease and the harsh treatment she had undergone explain her secretive and cautious approach. However, her faith triumphs over her fears, as she touches Jesus and receives instant and complete healing. This woman's story serves as a reminder that even after experiencing divine grace and deliverance, fears and doubts may still linger, but sharing our testimonies can bring glory to God and benefit others.

2. "Her faith is brought out and triumphs thus over her timidity."
3. "To this day, physicians complain of want of candor in female patients, or at least of a failure to accurately state their symptoms, etc. So that the naturalness of the picture is remarkable."

### John Gill:
1. "After conversion, after souls have laid hold on Christ for righteousness and life; after they have had the pardon of their sins, and are cured of their diseases, they are not without their fears and tremblings, though there is no just reason for them."
2. "They fear where no fear is; that is, where there is no true cause of fear; which was this woman's case."
3. "The secret experiences of grace in our souls we should not be ashamed to relate to others; this makes for the glory of divine grace, and the good of others."
