# Mark 5:33 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, a humble and timid woman is brought forth by Christ to publicly testify to the facts of her case. Her past experiences explain her initial hesitation to come forward, but her faith ultimately triumphs over her fear. Through her confession, she reveals the true nature of her chronic misery, which had compelled her to hide in the crowd. Despite the absence of a legitimate reason for fear, she, like many souls after conversion, still experiences trembling and uncertainty. Nevertheless, she courageously shares her story, showcasing the power of divine grace and providing hope to others.

3. "To this day, physicians complain of want of candor in female patients, or at least of a failure to accurately state their symptoms, etc. So that the naturalness of the picture is remarkable."

2. "They fear where no fear is; that is, where there is no true cause of fear; which was this woman's case."
3. "The secret experiences of grace in our souls we should not be ashamed to relate to others; this makes for the glory of divine grace, and the good of others."
