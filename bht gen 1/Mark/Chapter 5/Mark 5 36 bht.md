1. "The correct reading is parakousav, which may be rendered either not heeding, as Rev. (compare Matthew 28:17), or over - hearing, as Rev. in margin, which, on the whole, seems the more natural."
2. "Disregarding would be more appropriate if the message had been addressed to Jesus himself; but it was addressed to the ruler. Jesus overheard it."
3. "The present participle, laloumenon, being spoken, seems to fall in with this."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The correct reading introduces a word, which usually means, to pass by as unheard, not to heed: more rarely, to overhear. In either case, it is a mark of accuracy in this account."
2. "The delay seemed fatal, was in itself a trial to the faith of Jairus, especially now that the crisis had come."

1. "Do not be discouraged at these tidings, or distrust my power to help thee, only believe that I am able to raise her, even from the dead; and fear not, but it will be done."
2. "If a man can but believe, he has no reason to fear; for what is it that almighty power cannot do? it can raise the dead; there is nothing can stand in its way, or stop its course; and faith in it surmounts difficulties which are insuperable to carnal sense and reason."
3. "This word 'only' does not exclude the exercise of other graces, but rather implies it, for where this grace is in exercise, generally speaking, others are; nor the performance of good works, which are the fruits and effects of true faith, and without which faith is dead; but it stands opposed to fears and doubting, and to all carnal reasonings, as well as to all trust and confidence in other objects besides Christ."
