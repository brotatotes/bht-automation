# Mark 5:37 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, Jesus selects Peter, James, and John to accompany him, indicating the special relationship he had with these disciples. By allowing only a small group, Jesus creates an intimate setting for teaching and fostering a stronger bond. This selection also foreshadows the future leadership roles of Peter, James, and John in the early Christian community, as Jesus prepares them for spreading his message and establishing the Church. The exclusivity of this event demonstrates Jesus' intention to avoid distraction and preserve the significance of the miracle he is about to perform.
