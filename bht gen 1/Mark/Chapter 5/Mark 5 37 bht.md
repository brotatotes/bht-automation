# Mark 5:37 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, Jesus chooses to reveal a special moment to only Peter, James, and John, showcasing their deep connection and trust. The exclusivity may have been to prevent a noisy crowd from overpowering the significance of the event. This select group of disciples, having witnessed previous miracles, were chosen to witness the restoration of a young girl to life. Their presence in these moments of great importance and revelation further strengthens their faith and commitment to Jesus.

It highlights the special relationship Jesus had with these three disciples, and the significance of their presence in moments of great importance and revelation."

3. "The exclusion of the other disciples from this particular event may have been a way for Jesus to prepare Peter, James, and John for the challenges and trials they would face in the future. It was a way of equipping them with a unique experience that would strengthen their faith and commitment to Jesus."
