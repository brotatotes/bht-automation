# Mark 5:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we see a man who is possessed by a dark tyrant-power that gives him superhuman strength and makes him scorn restraint. He is known as the terror of the whole locality and has been bound with shackles for his feet and chains all over his body to physically confine and restrain him. Despite these precautions, he has torn the chains asunder and broken the fetters into pieces. His strength is so immense that he cannot be managed either by art or force, posing a great danger to himself and others.
