# Mark 5:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, a dark and powerful tyrant held a man captive, engulfing him with unimaginable strength and a disdain for any form of restraint. This man became a terror to the entire area, exuding an exceeding fierceness that deterred anyone from passing by. Attempts to control him were made, using chains and fetters, but these were futile as he tore them apart with ease, displaying his immense strength that seemed to originate from his madness and demonic possession. This man's fury and unruliness made him uncontrollable, defying all attempts to manage him by any means necessary.
