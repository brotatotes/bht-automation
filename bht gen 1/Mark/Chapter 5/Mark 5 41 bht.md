# Mark 5:41 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this particular Bible verse, Jesus speaks in Aramaic to a young girl. The use of an endearing term, "maid," emphasizes her youth and innocence, inviting empathy for her unjust treatment.

Jesus' command to the girl to arise displays his authority and power over death, while the mention of him taking her by the hand shows a touch of life, providing her with confidence and help.
