## BHT:
In this verse, we see a powerful display of divine intervention. The child, who was described as a young maiden, was brought back to life, causing great bewilderment and amazement among those who witnessed it. The incident was so extraordinary that it left them in a state of both astonishment and fear. The spectators were left in awe, utterly amazed at the miraculous power displayed by the Lord.
