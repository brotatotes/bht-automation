# Mark 5:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, someone is described as running towards Jesus to worship Him, compelled by a deep acknowledgment of His power. This act of running signifies a response to Christ's authority, even if initially reluctant or hostile. This individual's approach reflects both the divine power of Christ in overcoming opposition and the humble submission of a sinner seeking salvation from the bondage of sin and the forces of darkness.
