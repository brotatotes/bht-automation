# Mark 5:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Even the most wicked demons acknowledge the being and supreme authority of God, recognizing His title as the Most High. They confess that Jesus of Nazareth is the divine Son of God, born of a virgin, yet their belief remains superficial. This highlights the distinction between merely knowing and confessing Christ as God, and truly having a personal connection with Him. One can possess knowledge of Christ and His attributes, yet still lack a genuine relationship with Him, like the demons themselves.
