# Mark 5:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, Mark presents a unique encounter where Jesus addresses a demon directly. The demon's plea, "Torment me not," is simultaneous with Christ's command to come out. Christ's authority and power are evident in His ability to command and drive out the demon. This interaction highlights that Jesus does not tolerate the presence of evil but sanctifies and cleanses those who come to Him, delivering them from the power of Satan through His efficacious grace.
