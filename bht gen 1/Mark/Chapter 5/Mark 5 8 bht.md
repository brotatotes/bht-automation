# Mark 5:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, Mark uses direct address in the second person, highlighting the immediacy and power of Christ's command. The imperfect tense emphasizes the concurrent actions of Christ's exorcism, the demon's malicious outburst, and the plea "Torment me not." Through this encounter, Jesus demonstrates His authority over evil spirits and His ability to sanctify and cleanse the heart, casting out Satan to prepare it as a dwelling place for Himself. This liberation and sanctification can only be accomplished through the efficacious grace of Christ.
