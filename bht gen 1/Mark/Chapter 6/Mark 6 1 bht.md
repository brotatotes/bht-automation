# Mark 6:1 Commentary Help Text

Jesus left Capernaum and traveled to his own country, Nazareth. This visit to Nazareth is distinct from a previous one mentioned in another account.

Though Nazareth is not explicitly mentioned, it is clear that by "his own country," the verse refers to the region of Nazareth. Jesus' disciples faithfully accompanied him during this journey, exemplifying the commitment expected of true followers.
