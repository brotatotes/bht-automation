# Mark 6:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, believers are urged to "shake off the dust" as a testimony against those who reject the Gospel, symbolizing a rejection or disassociation from something negative. This action serves as evidence that they had attempted to preach the Gospel, but it was despised and rejected. The verse also highlights the certainty of a future day of judgment, where all, including the inhabitants of Sodom and Gomorrha, will appear before God for a reckoning, regardless of the judgments they may have faced in this world.
