# Mark 6:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, individuals are seen anointing many who were sick with oil. The oil was not meant for medicinal purposes, but rather as a symbol of healing power and a connection to God's supernatural blessing. This act of anointing, reminiscent of the early Christian Church, was a means of seeking spiritual and physical restoration. It is important to note that this practice predates the concept of extreme unction and should not be equated with it.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "This oil was not used medicinally, but as a vehicle of healing power committed to them; a symbol of a deeper thing than the oil itself could accomplish."
2. "That such anointing has nothing in common with the extreme unction of Romanists."
3. "See for instances of such symbolic use of external applications, 2 Kings 5:14; Mark 8:23; John 9:6, &c."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Anointing with oil was in common use among the Jews in cases of sickness. It was supposed to have a mild, soothing, and alleviating effect on the body."
2. "The good Samaritan poured oil and wine into the wounds of the waylaid Jew, Luke 10:34."
3. "It need not be supposed, however, that the apostles used oil for mere 'medical' purposes. It was used, probably, like the imposition of hands, or like our Saviour’s anointing the eyes of the blind with clay; also as a sign, in expectation of imparting that aid and comfort from God which was sought."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "To suppose that the oil was used medicinally is contrary to the whole tenor of the narratives."
2. "It was 'the vehicle of healing power committed to them' (Alford), an external sign such as our Lord sometimes used to connect Himself and the person cured."
3. "It was probably also a symbol of anointing by the Holy Spirit."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "This is the only example in the N.T. of αλειφω ελαιω used in connection with healing save in James 5:14." 
2. "It was the best medicine of the ancients and was used internally and externally."
3. "The only problem is whether αλειφω in Mark and James is used wholly in a ritualistic and ceremonial sense or partly as medicine and partly as a symbol of divine healing."

### John Gill:
1. "And they cast out many devils,.... Which they had power given them to do; and this they did, in confirmation of their mission and doctrine, and for the benefit of miserable creatures, who were possessed by them; and to show their power over the devils, and as a prelude of what they were to be the instruments of, in casting Satan out of the souls of men, both Jews and Gentiles; and especially, in the ejection of him out of the Gentile world."

2. "But that oil was used by the apostles as a medicine for the healing of diseases, cannot well be thought; since oil, though it may be useful in some cases, it is not an universal medicine, which is proper to all; nor were the apostles instructed by Christ in the art of physic, but were possessed by him with extraordinary gifts, to cure the disorders of the body, for the confirmation of the Gospel, which they preached."

3. "Hence it appears, that this passage gives no countenance to the use of such a practice in our days; since these were apostles only, who used it, who were extraordinary persons, and whose office in the church was an extraordinary one, and is now ceased; and healing in this way, was by an extraordinary power bestowed upon them, which has ceased; and therefore the rite, or ceremony of anointing with oil, for such a purpose, should be of course discontinued."

### John Wesley:
1. "They anointed with oil many that were sick... And the Lord shall heal him" - St. James gives this direction, emphasizing that the healing comes from God's supernatural blessing rather than the natural efficacy of the oil.

2. "This was the great standing means of healing, desperate diseases in the Christian Church" - Anointing with oil was a common practice in the early Church for healing severe illnesses, serving as a means of seeking health and restoration.

3. "Long before extreme unction was used or heard of" - Anointing with oil predates the concept of extreme unction, which is only used when life is despaired of. The two practices bear little resemblance to each other.
