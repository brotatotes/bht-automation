# Mark 6:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the commentators provide insights into the significance of anointing with oil. According to Philip Schaff, the oil was not used medicinally but symbolized anointing by the Holy Spirit. John Gill emphasizes that the oil was used by the apostles to confirm their mission, show power over demons, and benefit those possessed. John Wesley highlights that the healing power of the oil came from the supernatural blessing of God and suggests that anointing with oil was a common practice for healing in the early Christian Church.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Philip Schaff:
1. "To suppose that the oil was used medicinally is contrary to the whole tenor of the narratives."
2. "It was 'the vehicle of healing power committed to them' (Alford), an external sign such as our Lord sometimes used to connect Himself and the person cured."
3. "It was probably also a symbol of anointing by the Holy Spirit."

### John Gill:
1. "This they did, in confirmation of their mission and doctrine, and for the benefit of miserable creatures, who were possessed by them; and to show their power over the devils."
2. "But that oil was used by the apostles as a medicine for the healing of diseases, cannot well be thought; since oil, though it may be useful in some cases, it is not an universal medicine, which is proper to all."
3. "However, it cannot be supported by this instance, whatever countenance it may seem to have from James 5:14, for it must be owned, there is some difference in the passages: the persons that anointed here were apostles, there the elders of the church; the persons anointed there, were good people, the members of the church, but here any sort of persons, and chiefly, if not altogether unbelievers."

### John Wesley:
1. "And the Lord shall heal him - He shall be restored to health: not by the natural efficacy of the oil, but by the supernatural blessing of God."
2. "And it seems this was the great standing means of healing, desperate diseases in the Christian Church, long before extreme unction was used or heard of."
3. "The former being used only as a means of health; the latter only when life is despaired of."
