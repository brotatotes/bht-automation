# Mark 6:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, we see the tragic consequences of Herod's sinful actions and the corrupting influence of worldly desires. Herodias, the granddaughter of Herod the Great, forsakes her husband to be with Herod Antipas, despite the fact that he is already married to another woman. John the Baptist's bold condemnation of their sinful relationship led to his imprisonment and eventual execution. This serves as a cautionary tale, reminding us of the dangers of prioritizing our own desires over God's commandments and the cost of speaking truth to power in a world that often opposes righteousness.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Herodias was the granddaughter of Herod the Great."
2. "This Philip, however, was not the tetrarch of that name mentioned in (see on), but one whose distinctive name was 'Herod Philip,' another son of Herod the Great."
3. "Herod Antipas' own wife was the daughter of Aretas, king of Arabia; but he prevailed on Herodias, his half-brother Philip's wife, to forsake her husband and live with him."

### John Gill:
1. "Herod's actions reveal the power of sin and the corrupting influence of worldly desires. He was willing to imprison and eventually execute John the Baptist simply to please Herodias, his unlawful wife. This serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of prioritizing our own desires over God's commandments." 

2. "The imprisonment of John the Baptist highlights the cost of speaking truth to power. John fearlessly denounced Herod's sinful actions, and as a result, he was silenced and imprisoned. This reminds us that standing up for righteousness may come at a great personal cost, but it is a necessary and noble calling for believers." 

3. "The story of Herod and Herodias serves as a warning against the dangers of compromising our faith for the sake of worldly relationships. Herod's decision to marry his brother's wife was not only morally wrong but also led to a series of tragic events. It reminds us of the importance of upholding God's standards in our relationships, even when it may be difficult or unpopular."
