# Mark 6:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we see the fear and power dynamics between Herod and John. John's fearlessness and God's protection are highlighted by commentators, as Herod feared John but John did not fear Herod. Herod's recognition of John's righteousness is contrasted with his weak moral standing, as seen with his adulterous marriage. The enmity of Herodias and Herod's manipulations are also emphasized, as Herod observed and preserved John against her wicked designs.
