# Mark 6:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, we see that Herod had a combination of fear and respect for John the Baptist, considering him a just and holy man. However, Herod's actions were inconsistent, vacillating between his fear of John and his desire to please Herodias. John's influence had an impact on Herod, as he heard him gladly during their occasional prison conversations. This joy, however, was deceptive, as it coexisted with Herod's conflicted loyalty to Herodias.
