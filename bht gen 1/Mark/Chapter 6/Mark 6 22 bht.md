# Mark 6:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In a captivating and manipulative dance, the daughter of Herodias, Salome, caught the attention and desire of Herod, leading him to make a rash promise. Herod's infatuation was so intense that he offered Salome anything she desired, up to half his kingdom. This cunning request, instigated by Salome's mother, Herodias, reveals her manipulative nature and her desire to use her daughter as a pawn to achieve her own ambitions. The licentious and almost unprecedented nature of the dance pleased Herod and led him down a path he did not wish to go.
