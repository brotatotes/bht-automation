# Mark 6:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, we see the malicious and shameless nature of a woman named Herodias, who sought to get rid of a man who spoke the word of God. Herodias's desire for revenge was calculated and deliberate, as she longed for the death of this man who opposed her. Even the daughter of Herodias played a role, seeking her mother's guidance on what to ask for. This verse reveals the power of the word of God, as even in prison, the voice of this holy man wounded and tormented the minds of those who opposed him.
