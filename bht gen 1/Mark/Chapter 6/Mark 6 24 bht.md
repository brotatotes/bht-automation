# Mark 6:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, we witness the treacherous actions of a woman driven by vengeance. The abandon of shame and heartlessness seen in abandoned women is amplified in her calculated and deliberate desire for revenge. This opportunity to harm an innocent man was too good for her to pass up, leaving her unprepared for the ghastly response of her mother. The cunning nature of this woman is brought to light as she seeks guidance from her mother and withdraws to carefully consider her next move.
