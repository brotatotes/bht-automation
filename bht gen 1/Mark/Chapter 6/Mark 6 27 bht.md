# Mark 6:27 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we witness the dark and tragic end of a blessed martyr, receiving their Master's benediction. The urgency and severity of the situation are emphasized by the king's swift action in sending an executioner and his desire for a tangible proof of the execution. The beheading, carried out in the prison, adds to the sense of secrecy and darkness surrounding this event. Despite the darkness, questions remain about those who are connected to the martyr's blood-stained clothing.
