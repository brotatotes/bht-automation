## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "At the sight of the multitudes who had followed Him... He was so moved, as was His wont in such cases, with compassion, because they were like shepherdless sheep, as to forego both privacy and rest that He might minister to them."
2. "Here we have an important piece of information from the Fourth Evangelist... This accounts for the multitudes that now crowded around Him. They were on their way to keep that festival at Jerusalem."
3. "But Jesus did not go up to this festival, as John expressly tells us, remaining in Galilee, because the ruling Jews sought to kill Him."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Upon landing they went up some hill or cliff and from that point saw the great crowd."
2. "He had compassion on them, for they were like sheep without a shepherd."
3. "He began to teach them many things, showing what He deemed their greatest need to be."

### John Gill:
1. "Christ observed, that they were hungering and thirsting after the word of righteousness, and had no faithful, spiritual pastors to feed them with knowledge and understanding."
2. "Hence they followed Christ, wherever he went, with great zeal and fervency, earnestly desiring the bread of life: this moved his compassion."
3. "Instead of reproving them for giving him this fresh trouble, [Jesus] kindly and tenderly received them."

These quotes highlight the compassion of Jesus towards the people who were in need of spiritual guidance and nourishment. Despite his initial intention for rest, Jesus prioritized their well-being and taught them many things, addressing both their spiritual and physical needs.

1. "Coming out of the vessel signifies a departure from the familiar and comfortable, stepping out into the unknown and unfamiliar. It requires courage and faith to leave behind what is known and venture into new territory."

2. "The vessel represents the limitations and boundaries that we often confine ourselves to. Coming out of the vessel symbolizes breaking free from these constraints and embracing the limitless possibilities that lie ahead."

3. "This act of coming out of the vessel is not just a physical action, but also a spiritual one. It is a surrendering of our own will and desires, and a willingness to submit to God's plan and purpose for our lives."

4. "Coming out of the vessel is a transformative experience that leads to growth and expansion. It allows us to discover new aspects of ourselves, develop new skills, and experience a deeper level of intimacy with God."

5. "Ultimately, coming out of the vessel is an act of obedience and trust in God. It is a step of faith that opens the door to new opportunities, blessings, and a closer walk with Him."
