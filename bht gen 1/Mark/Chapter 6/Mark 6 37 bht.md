# Mark 6:37 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we see the disciples' limited understanding of the situation. Their practical thinking and lack of faith are evident as they question the feasibility of buying enough bread to feed the crowd. However, Jesus's response challenges their perspective and prepares them for the miracle that is about to take place. Through this interaction, we are reminded to shift our focus from the material to the spiritual and trust in God's abundant provision.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "This verse is rather a decisive proof that Mark had not seen John's account."
2. "How could he, having done so, and with his love for accurate detail, have so generalized the particular account of Philip's question?"
3. "That generalization was in the account which he used, and the circumstance was more exactly related by John."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Give ye them to eatâ€”doubtless said to prepare them for what was to follow." This quote highlights the intention behind Jesus' statement, emphasizing that he was setting the stage for a miracle to occur.
2. "Shall we go and buy two hundred pennyworth of bread, and give them to eat?" This quote showcases the disciples' disbelief and lack of understanding of Jesus' power to provide for the multitude.
3. "Two hundred pennyworth of bread is not sufficient for them, that every one of them may take a little." This quote reveals Philip's practical thinking and limited perspective, failing to recognize the magnitude of Jesus' ability to multiply the loaves and fishes.

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The question posed by the disciples, 'Shall we go and buy?' reveals their limited understanding of the situation. They were focused on the practicality of acquiring enough food to feed the crowd. However, Jesus' response challenges their perspective and invites them to see beyond the physical realm."

2. "In his answer, Jesus redirects their attention to a deeper truth - that it is not about the physical act of buying bread, but about recognizing the power and provision of God. He reminds them that with faith, even a small amount can be multiplied to meet the needs of many."

3. "This passage serves as a reminder for us today to shift our focus from the material and temporal to the spiritual and eternal. It encourages us to trust in God's abundance and to seek His guidance and provision in all aspects of our lives."

### John Gill:
1. "This he said to try their faith, and make way for the following miracle."
2. "Shall we lay out the two hundred pence, which is all we have in hand, to buy bread for this multitude?"
3. "They say this, as amazed that he should propose such a thing unto them."
