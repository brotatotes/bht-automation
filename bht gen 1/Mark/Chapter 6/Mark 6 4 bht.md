# Mark 6:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we see Jesus facing rejection and a lack of recognition from his own hometown and relatives. Despite being a prophet, Jesus was not honored in his own country, which is a common experience for prophets. This rejection is further highlighted by the phrase "among his own kindred," emphasizing that familiarity can sometimes breed contempt and lead to underestimating one's true potential. The underlying motive behind this rejection seems to be envy and jealousy, as some of those who rejected Jesus may have envied his gifts and accomplishments.
