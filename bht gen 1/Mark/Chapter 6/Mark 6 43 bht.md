# Mark 6:43 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we see a miraculous multiplication of loaves and fishes, as witnessed by the disciples. The commentators highlight the details of this event, from the baskets used by the Jews on their journey to the dissimilarity in the accounts given by the Evangelists. The phrase "full of the fragments" emphasizes the abundance and provision of God, while also symbolizing the brokenness and imperfection of our lives. This verse serves as a reminder of God's power to multiply and transform what may seem insufficient, and calls us to be faithful stewards of His blessings.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The article here rendered 'baskets' in all the four narratives was part of the luggage taken by Jews on a journey—to carry, it is said, both their provisions and hay to sleep on, that they might not have to depend on Gentiles, and so run the risk of ceremonial pollution."
2. "In this we have a striking corroboration of the truth of the four narratives."
3. "Internal evidence renders it clear, we think, that the first three Evangelists wrote independently of each other, though the fourth must have seen all the others."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Baskets full [κοφινων πληρωματα] . Lit., fillings of baskets." 
2. "Mark alone adds, and of the fishes."
3. "See on Matthew 14:20."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Among the many peculiarities of the various accounts of this miracle...none are more remarkable than the variety of expressions used to tell of what was gathered by the disciples." 
2. "It is impossible to reproduce the dissimilarity." 
3. "What remained of the fishes was probably included in the contents of the twelve baskets, although John seems to limit these to the fragments of the loaves."

### John Gill:
1. "Through the wonderful power of Christ increasing both, as they were distributing and eating, there was enough of both for them all." 
2. "There was but one loaf for a thousand persons and more, and two small fishes to be divided among five thousand and more."
3. "Such a quantity of each left as filled twelve baskets."

### John Wesley:
1. "The phrase 'full of the fragments' highlights the abundance and provision of God. Even in the midst of scarcity, God is able to multiply what little we have and make it more than enough."
2. "The fragments of bread symbolize the brokenness and imperfection of our lives. Just as Jesus took the broken pieces and made them whole, He can take our brokenness and bring healing and restoration."
3. "The gathering of the fragments also teaches us the importance of stewardship. We are called to be good stewards of the blessings God has given us, not wasting or taking for granted what He has provided."
