### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "The article here rendered 'baskets' in all the four narratives was part of the luggage taken by Jews on a journeyâ€”to carry, it is said, both their provisions and hay to sleep on, that they might not have to depend on Gentiles, and so run the risk of ceremonial pollution."
2. "In this we have a striking corroboration of the truth of the four narratives."
3. "Internal evidence renders it clear, we think, that the first three Evangelists wrote independently of each other, though the fourth must have seen all the others."
