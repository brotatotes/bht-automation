# Mark 6:44 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This remarkable miracle, recorded by all Four Gospels, tells of Jesus feeding a multitude of five thousand men. The emphasis on the number of men in Mark's account highlights the magnitude of the miracle and the certainty of the number. Matthew's addition of "beside children and women" suggests that the actual number of people fed was likely much larger, emphasizing Jesus' compassion and provision for all. The fact that they all ate and there were leftovers demonstrates Jesus' abundance, power, and ability to provide beyond what is expected or needed.
