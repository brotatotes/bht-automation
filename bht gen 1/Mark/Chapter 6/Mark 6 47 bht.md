# Mark 6:47 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the midst of a stormy night, the disciples found themselves in distress out at sea, with their Master yet to join them. The wind blew fiercely, causing the sea to rise, making their situation even more precarious. As darkness set in, Jesus had not yet come to them, and it seemed impossible for Him to reach the ship. However, this darkness and the disciples' despair would serve as a backdrop for the great miracle that was about to unfold – Jesus walking upon the water towards them.
