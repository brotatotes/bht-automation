# Mark 6:47 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the midst of a stormy night on a turbulent sea, the disciples found themselves battling against the wind, filled with distress as their Master was not with them. Despite their initial hope that Jesus would join them, he remained alone on the land after praying on the mountains. With no humanly possible way for Jesus to reach them, the stage was set for the forthcoming miracle of Jesus walking on water, demonstrating his authority and power over the forces of nature.
