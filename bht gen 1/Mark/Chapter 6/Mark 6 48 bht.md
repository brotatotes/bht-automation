# Mark 6:48 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, we see Jesus' incredible perception and awareness even in the darkness, as he observed his distressed disciples from a mountain. He had initially intended to pass by them, testing their faith and resolve, while also possibly teaching them a lesson. His actions seemed deliberate, as if he was intentionally walking past them, to demonstrate that they need not rely on their own efforts but trust in him. The verse showcases Jesus' divine power and the way he interacts with his disciples.
