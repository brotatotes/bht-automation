# Mark 6:48 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, the scene unfolds with Jesus observing his disciples in distress as they row against a contrary wind. Though it appears that Jesus intends to pass by them without intervening, his omniscience allows him to fully comprehend their situation. Despite their exhaustion and despair, Jesus sees their struggles and is present with them in their toiling. While it initially seems that Jesus intends to continue on his course without aiding them, his true intention is to walk alongside them and offer his help.
