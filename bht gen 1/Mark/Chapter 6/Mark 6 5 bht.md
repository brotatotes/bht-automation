# Mark 6:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Bible verse describes a situation where Jesus is not able to perform miracles due to specific conditions. Commentators emphasize that these conditions include the lack of opportunity, a sufficient moral purpose, or the absence of belief in Jesus. Some commentators argue that it is against Jesus' purpose to perform miracles for those who do not have faith in Him. Others assert that Jesus could perform miracles but refrained from doing so due to the circumstances. This verse highlights the wisdom and almighty power of Christ, who selectively performs miracles to serve His ultimate purpose.
