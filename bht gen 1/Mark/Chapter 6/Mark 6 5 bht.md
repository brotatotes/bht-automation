# Mark 6:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Bible verse describes a situation where Jesus could not perform miracles due to certain conditions. Commentators explain that this inability was not absolute, but rather relative to the circumstances. It was not fitting for Jesus to perform miracles in places where there was a lack of faith or opportunity for a sufficient moral purpose. In these instances, Jesus refrained from displaying His almighty power, as it would not have served its intended purpose. This highlights the wisdom and goodness of Jesus, who reserved His miracles for situations where they could have the greatest impact.
