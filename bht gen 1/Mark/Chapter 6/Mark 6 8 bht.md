# Mark 6:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In these verses, the independence of the three reports is evident, and the discrepancy between Matthew, Mark, and Luke is explained. The command to take nothing for the journey emphasizes the need for complete reliance on God's provision, while the inclusion of a staff demonstrates that those who already had one were not to provide another. The absence of wallets and provisions signifies the disciples' trust in the hospitality of others, allowing them to remain unencumbered and ready for motion.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Striking instances occur in these verses, of the independence of the three reports in their present form."

3. "See notes on Matt., also in the next clause."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Save a staff only, i.e., if, as was usual, each had a staff for walking, let him take it, but not provide one especially. This explanation, which is strictly grammatical, removes the apparent difference between the command as recorded here and by Matthew and Luke."
2. "Our Lord did not prescribe minutely what each should wear and carry, as monkish rules do. The point is: make no special preparation, take no special care."
