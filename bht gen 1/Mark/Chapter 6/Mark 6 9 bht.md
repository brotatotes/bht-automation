# Mark 6:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the actions described suggest some limitations or restrictions, as if being bound or constrained. The disciples are instructed to go forth without waiting for proper provisions, relying on the provision and guidance of God. They are to be intentional and deliberate in their actions, clothing themselves in the mission. As ministers of the Gospel, they are called to be free from worldly concerns and anxieties about their subsistence, trusting that God will provide. This initiation into their apostolic work would be a lifelong encouragement, as they reflect on God's care in their unfurnished beginnings.
