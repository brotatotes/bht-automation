## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The verse highlights the importance of honoring one's parents, even in the context of religious practices. It reminds us that our actions towards our parents should reflect our love and respect for them, and that true worship involves not only our external rituals, but also our internal attitudes and relationships." 

2. "This verse challenges us to examine our own hearts and motivations. Are we merely going through the motions of religious observance, or are we truly honoring God with our whole being? It calls us to a deeper level of authenticity and sincerity in our worship."

3. "By quoting the commandment to honor one's parents, Jesus is emphasizing the timeless and universal nature of this principle. It is not something that is limited to a specific time or culture, but rather a fundamental aspect of human relationships that transcends boundaries."

### Philip Schaff:
