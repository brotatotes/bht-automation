# Mark 7:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Bible verse emphasizes the internal state of a person, rather than external actions. It teaches that it is not what a person consumes or touches that defiles them, but rather the sinful thoughts and intentions that come from within. The focus is on the heart, representing a person's innermost thoughts and desires, which can bring moral defilement upon oneself. This serves as a reminder that true purity and righteousness come from cultivating a pure heart and guarding against sinful thoughts and desires.
