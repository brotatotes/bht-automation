# Mark 7:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, Jesus is depicted as entering a house, suggesting a shift in setting and a departure from public view. The disciples, driven by a desire for deeper understanding, approach Jesus with questions about a parable he had previously shared with the crowd. The variation in wording among the Gospel accounts indicates different perspectives and emphasizes Peter's role as the spokesperson for the disciples. Despite these variations, the disciples' eagerness to comprehend the meaning behind Jesus' words remains consistent.
