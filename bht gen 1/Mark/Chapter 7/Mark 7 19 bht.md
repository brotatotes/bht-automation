1. "Purging all meats" refers to the practice of cleansing or purifying food, likely by washing it with running water. This suggests a concern for hygiene and cleanliness in relation to the consumption of food.

2. The mention of a "seat" being placed over running water implies a practical and convenient setup for purging meats. This suggests that the process of purging was a regular and systematic practice.

3. The emphasis on purging meats highlights the importance of maintaining purity and avoiding contamination. This could be seen as a metaphorical reminder to be cautious and discerning in all aspects of life, not just in relation to food.
