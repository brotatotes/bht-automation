# Mark 7:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Bible verse unveils the source of sin and corruption within individuals. It highlights how evil actions, words, and thoughts stem from the corrupted heart of man. The verse emphasizes that these impure streams do not arise from external influences but originate from within a person. Ultimately, this internal corruption taints the entirety of an individual, defiling both the soul and body, and marking them as sinful in the eyes of others.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### John Gill:
1. "All evil thoughts, words, and actions, take their rise from the inward parts of man; from his heart; which is sadly corrupted, and is the fountain from whence all these impure streams flow."
2. "And if these come from within, then not from without; they are not by imitation or are the mere effects of example in others: example may indeed, and often does, draw out the evil that is within; but it does not produce it there; if it was not there before, it could not draw it out from thence."
3. "And defile the man; both soul and body; all the powers and faculties of the soul, and all the members of the body; or 'make a man common': these show him to be one of the common people, a very sinful man; as such were reckoned, and therefore are called emphatically, 'sinners'."
