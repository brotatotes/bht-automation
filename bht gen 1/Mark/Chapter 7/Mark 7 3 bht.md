# Mark 7:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we see an ancient tradition being practiced diligently by the Pharisees. The ceremony involves rubbing the hands and arms up to the elbow, with the fist clenched, performing a ritualistic cleansing. This ritual, not grounded in the authority of scriptures, was instead a strict tradition upheld by the Scribes and Pharisees. The act of washing hands before eating was a significant part of their culture, showcasing their adherence to tradition and social customs.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The two meanings between which our choice lies are, (3) ‘frequently’ (as E. V. ‘oft,’ and Vulg. ‘crebro’), taking πυγμῇ = πυκνῇ = πυκνῶς, which however is not very probable."
2. "Or (4), to which I most incline, and which Kuinoel gives, ‘sedulo,’ ‘fortiter,’ diligently; πυγμή, he observes, meaning ‘the fist,’ answers in the LXX to the word אֶגְרֹף, see reff."
3. "But this same word אֶגְרֹף is used to signify strength and fortitude, and strong men are called in the Rabbinical writings בעלי אגרופין, ‘lords of fists.’"

### Philip Schaff:
1) "Pharisaism had the upper hand."
2) "Probably it was part of the rite, that the washing hand was shut."
3) "The main point is, that the ceremony was formal."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Diligently (πυγμη). Instrumental case, with the fist, up to the elbow, rubbing one hand and arm with the other hand clenched."

3. "The middle voice νιψωντα means their own hands."
