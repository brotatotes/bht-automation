# Mark 7:34 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, Jesus is depicted as looking up to heaven, sighing in distress and compassion, and uttering the word "Ephphatha," which means "be opened." Commentators explain that Jesus lifted His eyes to heaven as a prayer to God for aid, contrasting His power with magical influences. His sigh expressed sympathy for human suffering and distress at ignorance and superstition. The word "Ephphatha" carries the authoritative power to open not just physical ears and mouths, but also hearts and minds to receive God's grace and instruction.
