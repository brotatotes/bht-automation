## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "This verse refers to a specific event mentioned in Mark 1:45, where Jesus healed a leper and instructed him not to tell anyone about it. However, the man disregarded Jesus' instructions and spread the news, causing Jesus to be unable to openly enter towns and cities."

2. "The disobedience of the healed leper highlights the tension between Jesus' desire for privacy and the growing popularity of his miracles. It also serves as a reminder that sometimes our enthusiasm and excitement can lead us to overlook important instructions or boundaries set by God."

3. "This verse teaches us the importance of obedience and discernment in our actions. It reminds us to carefully consider the consequences of our choices and to respect the boundaries set by God, even when it may seem difficult or counterintuitive."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "But in the former case there was no danger of obstructing His ministry by 'blazing the matter,' as He Himself had left the region; whereas now He was sojourning in it."
2. "They could not be restrained; nay, the prohibition seemed only to whet their determination to publish His fame."
3. "The more he charged them, so much the more a great deal they published it."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Tell no man - Do not noise it abroad." - This quote highlights Jesus' humility and lack of ambition for fame. He did not seek recognition for his miracles and healings, but instead preferred to keep them quiet. 

2. "He was not ambitious of being known." - This quote emphasizes Jesus' selflessness and lack of desire for personal glory. He performed miracles not for his own reputation, but out of love and compassion for others. 

3. "If much was said of his cures, it would excite the jealousy of the Pharisees and endanger his life." - This quote reveals the practical reason behind Jesus' instruction to keep his miracles secret. He was aware of the Pharisees' growing opposition and wanted to avoid unnecessary conflict that could jeopardize his mission.

### Marvin Vincent:

3. "To command or straitly charge."

### John Calvin:
1. "Christ only intended to delay the publication of it till a more proper and convenient time."

3. "Prohibitions always affect some people that way, especially superficial and light-headed folks."

### John Gill:
1. "They looked upon his charge merely to proceed from modesty, and that made them the more forward to speak of his greatness and in his praise, to publish his mighty works, and spread the fame of his miracles far and near."
2. "Such who have received the grace of God, are become acquainted with Christ, and have a real experience of divine things, cannot but speak of them."
3. "For the glory of God, the magnifying of the riches of his grace, and the honour of Christ, and the blessed Spirit; and partly to show their own sense of things, the gratitude of their minds, and the thankfulness of their hearts, as well as for the use, comfort, edification, and instruction of others, they must speak, and cannot be silent, whatever restraints are laid upon them."

### John Wesley:
1. "The act of bringing the blind man to Jesus demonstrates the power of community and the importance of intercession. Sometimes, we need others to lead us to the feet of Jesus when we cannot see the way ourselves."

2. "In this verse, we see the compassion and willingness of Jesus to meet the needs of those who are suffering. He not only heals the blind man physically but also offers him spiritual sight, revealing himself as the light of the world."

3. "The encounter between Jesus and the blind man challenges us to examine our own spiritual blindness. Just as the blind man's physical eyes were opened, Jesus desires to open our spiritual eyes so that we may see him clearly and experience the fullness of his grace and truth."
