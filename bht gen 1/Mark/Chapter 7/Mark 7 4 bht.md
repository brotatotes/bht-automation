## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "It certainly refers to themselves; as it would not be any unusual practice to wash things bought in the market."
2. "These βαπτισμοί, as applied to κλινῶν (meaning probably here couches (triclinia) used at meals), were certainly not immersions, but sprinklings or affusions of water."
3. "On the whole subject, see Lightfoot ad loc."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The New Testament use of the word to denote submersion for a religious purpose, may be traced back to the Levitical washings."
2. "The word appears to have been at that time the technical term for such washings."
3. "The word may be taken in the sense of washing or sprinkling."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The passage clearly proves the wider usage of the terms ‘baptism ‘and ‘baptize ‘in Hellenistic Greek, whether by immersion, or pouring, or sprinkling. Christianity does not prescribe any particular mode as essential."
2. "Disputes about the form of baptism savor much of what our Lord is rebuking in the discourse which follows."
3. "All these things were ceremonially washed, or baptized, in case of defilement. Ordinary washing for cleanliness is not referred to."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Ceremonial defilement was inevitable in the mixing with men in public."
2. "The statement proceeds by way of climax: before eating they wash the hands always. When they come from market they take a bath before eating."
3. "We must let the Jewish scrupulosity stand for itself."

### John Gill:
1. "The word βαπτιζω, here used: for,"if the Pharisees touched but the garments of the common people, they were defiled, all one as if they had touched a profluvious person, וצריכן טבילה, 'and needed immersion';'and were obliged to it."
2. "And here the word βαπτισμος, 'baptism', is rightly used in its proper and primary signification; for all these things were, according to the traditions of the elders, washed by immersion."
3. "Various rules, concerning these things, may be seen in the treatises 'Celim' and 'Mikvaot'. Hence it appears, with what little show of reason, and to what a vain purpose this passage is so often appealed to, to lessen the sense of the word βαπτιζω, 'baptizo'; as if it did not signify to dip, but a sort of washing, short of dipping."

### John Wesley:
1. "The Greek word (baptisms) means indifferently either washing or sprinkling."
2. "The cups, pots, and vessels were washed."
3. "The couches were sprinkled."
