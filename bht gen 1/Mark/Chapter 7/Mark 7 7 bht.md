# Mark 7:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the commentator describes the futility of worship that lacks true spirituality and life. Despite the impressive outward display of religiosity, this worship fails to bring glory to God and provide genuine joy and peace. As a result, those who place their hope in this empty worship will ultimately be disappointed in their pursuit of divine favor and eternal happiness.

2. "It neither issued in the glory of God, nor brought any true pleasure, or solid peace to themselves."
