### Henry Alford:

2. "A striking instance of the independence of Mark: called by the Harmonists 'an addition to St. Matthew's narrative, to show his independent knowledge of the fact.'" 
3. "What very anomalous writers the Evangelists must have been!"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Magdala and Dalmanutha were both on the western shore of the lake, and probably not far apart."

3. "Dalmanutha may have been a village, but it cannot now be identified with certainty."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The mention of Dalmanutha in Matthew 15:39 is significant because it reveals Jesus' intentional movement towards the region of Magdala. This demonstrates his purposeful ministry and his desire to reach out to all people, regardless of their location or background."

2. "The reference to Dalmanutha also highlights the geographical context of Jesus' ministry. It reminds us that Jesus was not confined to one specific area but traveled extensively, spreading his message of love and salvation to different regions."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The two were probably near each other, north of Tiberias, and our Lord seems to have landed at some retired point between them."
