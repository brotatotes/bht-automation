# Mark 8:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This verse reminds us that signs and miracles are not enough to convince those who are determined to reject the truth. Jesus is not interested in performing miracles as a means of entertainment or to prove Himself to skeptics. The demand for a sign reveals a lack of faith and a desire for personal validation. Ultimately, belief in Jesus as the Son of God is not based on external signs, but on a personal encounter with Him and a willingness to submit to His lordship.
