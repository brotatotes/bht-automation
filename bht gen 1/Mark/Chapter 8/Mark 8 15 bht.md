# Mark 8:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Beware of the influence of the Pharisees, Sadducees, and Herodians, whose teachings and actions are characterized by hypocrisy, bad theology, and bad politics. The leaven of these groups, though different in nature, is equally pernicious. The urgency of the warning lies in the disciples' familiarity with these influences and the need for discernment in navigating both political and theological dangers. Take heed and be cautious, for their doctrines can harden hearts and hinder spiritual understanding.
