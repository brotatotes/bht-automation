# Mark 8:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we witness a powerful demonstration of Jesus' divine power and provision. Despite facing scarcity, Jesus displays that with Him, there is always an abundance. The question about the number of leftover baskets serves as a spiritual reminder that God's blessings are boundless and overflow in abundance, unconstrained by human limitations. Collecting the fragments signifies the importance of being good stewards of God's blessings, not wasting or taking them for granted. The number of baskets, which was double the number of loaves, showcases the miraculous multiplication of resources by Jesus.
