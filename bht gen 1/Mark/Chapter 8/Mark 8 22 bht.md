# Mark 8:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In a place called Bethsaida Julias on the northeast side of the lake, Jesus was seeking solitude, preparing His disciples for the future. As they brought a blind man to Him, they beseeched Him to touch the man, believing His touch would restore his sight. The healing was not instant but gradual, as drops of grace flowed upon the blind man, symbolizing the spiritual blindness of those lost in darkness until touched by Christ. This incident, recorded only in Mark, reveals the power of Christ to open the eyes of those who are spiritually blind.
