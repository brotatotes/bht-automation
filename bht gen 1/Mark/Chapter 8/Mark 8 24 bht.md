## BHT:
In this verse, the blind man shares his experience of receiving partial sight restoration from Jesus. As his vision begins to clear, he initially sees people as "trees walking," indicating a blurred perception and incomplete understanding. This unique healing is a gradual process, symbolizing the spiritual journey of gaining clearer insight and renewed faith. Jesus' touch not only brings physical restoration but also serves as a catalyst for the man's deeper reliance and recognition of Jesus' transformative power.
