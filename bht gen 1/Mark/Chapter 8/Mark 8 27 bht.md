## BHT:
In a quiet moment of prayer, Jesus prepares himself for the important revelation that is about to come. He journeys through the region of Caesarea Philippi, where he is safe from interference, and takes the opportunity to teach his disciples about the impending crucifixion.

Peter's confession of Jesus as the Christ, the Son of the living God, marks a significant turning point, revealing the divine nature of Jesus and the importance of divine revelation in understanding his true identity.
