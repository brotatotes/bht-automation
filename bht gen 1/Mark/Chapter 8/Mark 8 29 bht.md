# Mark 8:29 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, Jesus questions Peter, seeking communication and understanding. Mark's account focuses on a different perspective, omitting Peter's commendation. The parallel passage in Matthew's Gospel provides additional insights. Peter's full confession asserts that Jesus is the promised Messiah, surpassing the people's exalted sentiments. This confession affirms that Jesus is the Messiah spoken of by all the holy prophets since the beginning of the world. This interaction with Peter serves as a serious test of the disciples' belief in Jesus as the Messiah.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Marvin Vincent:
1. "He questioned or asked." This highlights the action of Jesus in seeking to understand Peter's thoughts and intentions, emphasizing the importance of open communication and dialogue in relationships.

2. "Rev. Mark omits the commendation of Peter." This suggests that Mark's focus is not on praising Peter but rather on presenting a different aspect of the story or a different perspective on the events.

3. "Compare notes on Matthew 16:21-28." This encourages readers to refer to the parallel passage in Matthew's Gospel, indicating that there may be additional insights or details to be gained by examining the two accounts side by side.

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "The full confession is the form in Matthew. Luke's language means practically the same, while Mark's is the briefest. But the form in Mark really means the full idea."
2. "Mark omits all praise of Peter, probably because Peter had done so in his story of the incident."
3. "But did the disciples still believe in Jesus as Messiah after all the defections and oppositions seen by them? It was a serious test to which Jesus now put them."

### John Gill:
1. "Thou art the Christ; the Messiah that was long ago promised and so often prophesied of in the books of Moses and the prophets." 

2. "This confession of Peter's...speaks out what Jesus really was, and exceeds the most exalted sentiments which the people had of him."

3. "He was not the harbinger of the Messiah but the Messiah himself; not Elias in whose Spirit his forerunner was to come and did come; nor any one of the prophets; but he who was spoken of by all the holy prophets; which have been since the beginning of the world."
