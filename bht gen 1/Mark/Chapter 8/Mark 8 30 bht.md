# Mark 8:30 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, the Messiah charges his disciples to keep his identity secret for now, as he is not yet ready for public acknowledgment. He is like a rock upon which the church will be built, strong and unyielding to the forces of darkness. The Messiah's silence serves not to hide his power, but to ensure that the full extent of his divinity is revealed at the appointed time.
