# Mark 8:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In a deserted mountainous region, the disciples, feeling helpless, question how a man could possibly satisfy the multitude's hunger. Despite witnessing the recent miracle of feeding thousands with only a few loaves and fishes, they struggle to believe in Jesus's unlimited power. Their doubts demonstrate a modest acknowledgment that they do not possess the means to provide for the hungry crowd, leaving the decision of what to do in the hands of the Lord. The disciples are confronted with the challenge of finding enough bread to satisfy the hungry stomachs of such a large number of people in the wilderness.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Though the question here is the same as when He fed the five thousand, they evidently now meant no more by it than that they had not the means of feeding the multitude; modestly leaving the Lord to decide what was to be done."
2. "And this will the more appear from His not now trying them, as before, by saying, 'They need not depart, give ye them to eat'; but simply asking what they had, and then giving His directions."
3. "From whence can a man satisfy these men with bread here in the wilderness?"

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Of all places, in this desert region in the mountains."
2. "The disciples feel as helpless as when the five thousand were fed."
3. "They do not rise to faith in the unlimited power of Jesus after all that they have seen."

### John Gill:
1. "Forgetting the late miracle of feeding five thousand with five loaves and two fishes..."
2. "From whence can a man satisfy these men with bread here in the wilderness?"
3. "From what place, and by what ways and means can it be thought, that such a quantity of bread can be got at any rate in a desert, as to satisfy so large a number of hungry men?"
