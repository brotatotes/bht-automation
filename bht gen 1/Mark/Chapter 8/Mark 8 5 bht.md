# Mark 8:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we see the disciples facing a test of their faith and trust in Jesus as the provider of their needs. Jesus's question about the number of loaves is meant to show them that their resources alone are insufficient for the task. The mention of the "few little fishes" highlights the meagerness of their offerings, reminding us that God often works with what seems insufficient to demonstrate his power and provision. This passage encourages us to bring whatever we have, no matter how insignificant, and trust in God's ability to multiply it beyond our expectations.
