# Mark 8:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Those who earnestly seek after righteousness will find a deep satisfaction and contentment, as their spiritual hunger and thirst are fully satisfied.

Even the seemingly insignificant fragments that remain are not wasted, but can be used by God to fulfill His purposes. This verse reminds us that Christ is the true bread that satisfies our spiritual hunger, and we should continually seek His provision in our lives.
