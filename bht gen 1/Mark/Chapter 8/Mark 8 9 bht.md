## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Had not our Lord distinctly referred, in this very chapter and in two successive sentences, to the feeding of the five thousand and of the four thousand as two distinct miracles, many critics would have insisted that they were but two different representations of one and the same miracle."
2. "The localities, though both on the eastern side of the lake, were different; the time was different; the preceding and following circumstances were different; the period during which the people continued fasting was different."
3. "In view of these things, who could have believed that these were one and the same miracle, even if the Lord Himself had not expressly distinguished them?"

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Baskets." - This commentary draws attention to the mention of baskets in Matthew 14:20, highlighting their significance in the context of the verse.

2. "Four thousand." - The commentary notes that Matthew includes the detail of the four thousand people in Matthew 15:38, which adds a layer of specificity to the account.

3. "Beside women and children." - This quote points out the additional detail provided by Matthew, mentioning that women and children were present in the crowd, which is a noteworthy inclusion.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Mark's omission of 'besides women and children' in this verse suggests that he is focusing on the larger crowd and their response to Jesus' miracle, rather than the specific demographics present."
2. "By leaving out this detail, Mark emphasizes the significance of the miracle itself and the impact it had on the entire crowd, regardless of gender or age."
3. "This omission also highlights Mark's intention to present Jesus as a figure who transcends societal boundaries and reaches out to all people, regardless of their background or status."
