# Mark 9:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse in question describes the sufferings of the predicted Elijah, believed to be embodied by John the Baptist. There is no direct prophecy of Elijah's sufferings, but it can be inferred from the Old Testament that the forerunner of the Messiah would suffer, as Elijah did. The disciples understood this interpretation, and it is believed that the prophecies regarding Elijah, as mentioned in Malachi 4:5, were fulfilled through John the Baptist. People have done to him whatever they pleased, as seen in the accomplishments of these prophecies.
