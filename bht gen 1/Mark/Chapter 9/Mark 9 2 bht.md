# Mark 9:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, Jesus takes Peter, James, and John, his favorite and closest disciples, and brings them apart from the multitude to witness his transfiguration. The disciples see Jesus being transfigured before them, revealing his divine glory and true nature as the Son of God. The transfiguration serves as a moment of revelation, where Jesus' heavenly glory is unveiled and his unity with the Father is displayed.
