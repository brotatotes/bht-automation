# Mark 9:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, the Kingdom of Satan is stirred into fiercer activity by the imminent arrival of the Kingdom of Christ. The demon, filled with indignation and rage, recognizing that his time is short, tares the possessed child grievously. The convulsions and violent motions of the child as he falls to the ground and wallows in agony are a pitiful and distressing sight. This intense spiritual battle takes place as the evil spirit knows that his reign in the child's soul is nearing its end.
