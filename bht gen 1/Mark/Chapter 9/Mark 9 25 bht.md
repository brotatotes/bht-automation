# Mark 9:25 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, a powerful and authoritative Jesus confronts a foul spirit that has inflicted both physical and speech impairments upon a child. Jesus rebukes the spirit, a separate being from the child, and commands it to leave the child's possession forever. Despite the child being deaf and mute, the devil still hears Jesus speak and recognizes His authority over him.
