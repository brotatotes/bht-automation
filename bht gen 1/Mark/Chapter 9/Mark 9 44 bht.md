# Mark 9:44 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the oldest and best manuscripts omit two verses, which are merely a repetition of a previous verse. Consequently, we lose the numbering of certain verses. However, the concept remains powerful. The verse speaks of the torment sinners will endure, with their conscience incessantly gnawing at them like a worm, causing them anguish and misery. This torment, represented by the fire, will never be extinguished, causing never-ending distress and torture. It is a vivid depiction of the eternal consequences of sin.

### John Gill:
1. "By their worm is meant, their conscience; for as a worm that is continually gnawing upon the entrails of a man, gives him exquisite pain; so the consciences of sinners, will be continually flying in their faces, bringing their sins to remembrance, accusing them of them, upbraiding them with them, aggravating them, tormenting them for them, filling them with dreadful anguish and misery, with twinging remorses, and severe reflections, and which will never have an end."
2. "This will be always the case; conscience will be ever distressing, racking, and torturing them; it will never cease, nor cease doing this office."
3. "By 'the fire' may be meant the fire of divine wrath let into their souls, which will never be extinguished."
