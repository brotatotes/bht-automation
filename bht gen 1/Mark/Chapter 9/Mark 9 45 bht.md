# Mark 9:45 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we are reminded of the significance of our companions and associations in life. One commentator describes them as the support and sustenance in our journey, much like how the foot is to the body. However, we need to be cautious because if these relationships lead us astray, we should avoid them. As another commentator adds, it is better to walk alone towards heaven than to have company that could lead us towards the eternal fire.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### John Gill:
1. "Such who are that to men, as the foot is to the body, the support of them through whom they have their maintenance and subsistence."
2. "If they are a means of causing them to stumble and fail, or of leading out of the ways of Christ, and off from him, their company is to be shunned and abstained from."
3. "It is better to go alone without such company into heaven than having two feet to be cast into hell, into the fire that never shall be quenched."
