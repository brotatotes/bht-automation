# Mark 9:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In a remarkable moment of divine revelation, the Lord's transfiguration invites a response from him. As the disciples marvel at the glorious appearance of Christ, they are filled with a sense of awe and the desire to stay in that place. This desire is expressed through a resolution to build three tabernacles - one for Jesus, one for Moses, and one for Elijah. It is a moment that surpasses all previous experiences, as the disciples recognize the unparalleled glory of God's presence.
