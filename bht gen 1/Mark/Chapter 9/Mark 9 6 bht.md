# Mark 9:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the disciples are filled with religious awe and fear as they witness the transfiguration of Jesus. The powerful experience evokes a continued and growing sense of awe in them, to the point where they are not fully aware of what they say. Peter, for instance, speaks inappropriately, not knowing the significance of the moment. This fear and awe are intensified by the divine glory that surrounds them, leaving them filled with consternation and barely recognizing their own words and actions.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Philip Schaff:
1. "All three Evangelists speak of this fear, or religious awe: Mark here, Luke: ‘as they entered into the cloud.’ Matthew: when ‘they heard ‘the voice." 
2. "This indicates a continued and growing awe."
3. "It is placed earliest by Mark, who thus accounts for Peter’s words."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Luke says that he spoke, 'not knowing what he said,' as an excuse for the inappropriateness of his remarks."
2. "Perhaps Peter felt embarrassed at having been asleep and the feast of tabernacles or booths was near."
3. "Peter and the others apparently had not heard the talk of Moses and Elijah with Jesus about his decease and little knew the special comfort that Jesus had found in this understanding of the great approaching tragedy."

### John Gill:
1. "He did not know what he should say, or what was proper to be said by him, at such a time, in such circumstances, and before such persons."
2. "For all three were filled with consternation at what they saw and heard; so that they were scarcely themselves, and knew not well what they said or did."
3. "They were sore afraid, filled with fear and awe in the presence of the divine glory that surrounded them."

Note: The commentary is on Luke 9:33, which describes Peter's response to the transfiguration of Jesus.
