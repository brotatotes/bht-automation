# Matthew 1:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This book presents the genealogy of Jesus Christ, tracing his lineage from Abraham to David and from David to his birth. Jesus is referred to as the Messiah, the promised descendant of David and the one through whom God's covenant with Abraham would be fulfilled. This genealogy establishes Jesus' rightful place as the anointed one, combining the roles of king, prophet, and priest in the Old Testament theocracy. It highlights the fulfillment of prophecy and the significance of Jesus' lineage in God's redemptive plan.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "βίβλος γενέσεως] Not always used of a pedigree only: see reff. Here however it appears that it refers exclusively to the genealogy."
2. "Ἰησοῦ χριστοῦ being used in the enunciation, and the close being Ἰησοῦς ὁ λεγόμενος χριστός."
3. "That He should be son of Abraham, was too solemn a subject of prophecy to be omitted here, even though implied in the other."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The book of the generation—an expression purely Jewish; meaning, 'table of the genealogy.' We have here, then, the title, not of this whole Gospel of Matthew, but only of the first seventeen verses."
2. "The word 'Christ'—though applied to Him as a proper name by the angel who announced His birth to the shepherds—only began to be so used by others about the very close of His earthly career."
3. "To a Jewish reader, accordingly, these behooved to be the two great starting-points of any true genealogy of the promised Messiah; and thus this opening verse, as it stamps the first Gospel as one peculiarly Jewish, would at once tend to conciliate the writer's people."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The phrase is common in Jewish writings. Compare Genesis 5:1. 'This is the book of the generations of Adam,' i. e., the genealogical table of the family or descendants of Adam." 

2. "To anoint, therefore, means often the same as to consecrate, or to set apart to an office. Hence, those thus set apart are said to be anointed, or to be the anointed of God. It is for this reason that the name is given to the Lord Jesus." 

3. "The promise was made to Abraham also. See Genesis 12:3; Genesis 21:12; compare Hebrews 11:13; Galatians 3:16. The Jews expected that the Messiah would be descended from him; and it was important, therefore, to trace the genealogy up to him also."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Christ" is a translation of the Hebrew word "Messiah," which refers to the promised king and spiritual ruler from David's lineage. (John 1:41)
2. The word "Christ" represents Jesus as the Messiah, who combines the roles of king, prophet, and priest. (John 1:41)
3. Anointing was a significant act in biblical times, symbolizing hospitality, festivity, and respect. Jesus was anointed by a woman as a guest in Simon the Pharisee's house. (Luke 7:35, Luke 7:46)

### John Calvin:
1. "The common and well-known reply is, that in the person of Joseph the genealogy of Mary also is included, because the law enjoined every man to marry from his own tribe."
2. "The Evangelists, trusting to what was generally understood in their own day, were, no doubt, less solicitous on that point: for, if any one entertained doubts, the research was neither difficult nor tedious."
3. "Matthew, therefore, presents him to our contemplation as belonging to that holy race, to which he had been expressly appointed."
4. "Though he was not naturally descended from Solomon, yet he was reckoned his son by legal succession, because he was descended from kings."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The combination of Jesus Christ is the Gospel in a nutshell, declaring Jesus as the promised Messiah." 
2. "Jesus, meaning 'the Lord is Helper, Saviour,' and Christ, the official title of the Anointed One, combine the three offices of the Old Testament theocracy: prophet, priest, and king." 
3. "Jesus being the Son of David fulfills the expectation of a descendant of David becoming the King of the Jews."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "It is our word Bible that is here used, the Book as Sir Walter Scott called it as he lay dying."
2. "Matthew proposes to show that Jesus Christ is on the human side the son of David, as the Messiah was to be, and the son of Abraham, not merely a real Jew and the heir of the promises, but the promise made to Abraham."
3. "The names are given in three groups, Abraham to David, David to Babylon Removal, Jechoniah to Jesus. This great event is used to mark off the two last divisions from each other."

### John Gill:
1. "This is the genuine title of the book, which was put to it by the Evangelist himself; for the former seems to be done by another hand."
2. "This account of Christ begins with the name of the Messiah, well known to the Jews, the son of David; not only to the Scribes and Pharisees, the more learned part of the nation, but to the common people, even to persons of the meanest rank and figure among them."
3. "The reason why Christ is first called the son of David, and then the son of Abraham, is partly because the former was a more known name of the Messiah; and partly that the transition to the genealogy of Christ might be more easy and natural."

### John Wesley:
1. "The book of the generation of Jesus Christ — That is, strictly speaking, the account of his birth and genealogy."
2. "They unquestionably prove the grand point in view, that Jesus was of the family from which the promised seed was to come."
3. "He is so called, because to these he was more peculiarly promised; and of these it was often foretold the Messiah should spring."
