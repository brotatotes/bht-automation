# Matthew 1:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we are presented with the book of the generation, a table of genealogy, which gives us insight into Jesus Christ, the name familiarly known to Him during His time on Earth. This combination of Jesus Christ is significant, as it declares Jesus as the promised Messiah, the Anointed Prophet, Priest, and King. The verse aims to establish the crucial truth that Jesus is from the family line of the promised seed, a fact that would have prevented disputes between believers and non-believers.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "The book of the generation—an expression purely Jewish; meaning, 'table of the genealogy.' We have here, then, the title, not of this whole Gospel of Matthew, but only of the first seventeen verses."
2. "Jesus, the name given to our Lord at His circumcision, was that by which He was familiarly known while on earth."
3. "The full form, 'Jesus Christ,' though once used by Himself in His Intercessory Prayer, was never used by others till after His ascension and the formation of churches in His name."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The book of the generation (or, birth, the same word in Greek as in Matthew 1:18). Literally, 'book of birth, birth-book,' i.e., pedigree, genealogy." 
2. "Jesus Christ. This combination is the Gospel in a nutshell, a declaration that Jesus is the Christ, the promised Messiah, the great truth, which the following narrative is to establish." 
3. "Christ is our Anointed Prophet, Priest, and King. That of 'King' was most prominent in the expectations of the Jews."

### John Wesley:
1. "The book of the generation of Jesus Christ — That is, strictly speaking, the account of his birth and genealogy."
2. "They unquestionably prove the grand point in view, that Jesus was of the family from which the promised seed was to come."
3. "For such alterations would have occasioned endless disputes between them and the disciples of our Lord."
