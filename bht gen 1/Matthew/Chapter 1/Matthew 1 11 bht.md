# Matthew 1:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This verse reveals a complex family lineage, where Jeconiah is the grandson of Josiah and the son of Jehoiakim. Jehoiakim, however, is merely a puppet under the control of the king of Egypt. The term "brethren" refers to Jeconiah's uncles, particularly Zedekiah, who later ascended the throne. The mention of "carrying away to Babylon" respectfully alludes to the bitter memory of the Jewish exile. It is worth noting that the term "brethren" encompasses all kinsmen in Jewish culture.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Jeconiah was Josiah's grandson, being the son of Jehoiakim, Josiah's second son, but Jehoiakim might well be sunk in such a catalogue, being a mere puppet in the hands of the king of Egypt."
2. "The 'brethren' of Jechonias here evidently mean his uncles - the chief of whom, Mattaniah or Zedekiah, who came to the throne, is called 'his brother' in 2 Chronicles 36:10, as well as here."
3. "The Jews avoided the word 'captivity' as too bitter a recollection, and our Evangelist studiously respects the national feeling."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Jehoia-kim was forcibly placed on the throne by the king of Egypt, hence unworthy of mention." 
2. "The removal extended over a considerable period of time during three successive reigns." 
3. "The word used does not necessarily imply a forcible removal, the Jews being accustomed to speak of the Captivity in this mild way."

### John Gill:
1. "Jechonias, who does not appear to have had any brethren, is mentioned to distinguish him from Jechonias in the next verse." 
2. "These brethren were about the time they were carried away to Babylon." 
3. "The phrase 'his brethren' can be rendered as 'which were at, or about the carrying away to Babylon'."

### John Wesley:
1. "Josiah begat Jeconiah — Mediately, Jehoiakim coming between." 
2. "And his brethren — That is, his uncles. The Jews term all kinsmen brethren." 
3. "About the time they were carried away — Which was a little after the birth of Jeconiah."
