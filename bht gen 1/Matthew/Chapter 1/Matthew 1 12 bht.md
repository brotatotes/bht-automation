# Matthew 1:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This verse speaks of a descendant of David, Jeconiah, who was deemed "childless," but the phrase actually suggests that he would not have a reigning child on the throne of David. Jeconiah's descendants, including Zerubbabel, experienced a change in their royal status and became exiles and slaves. However, even through this dispersion, the grace of God still illuminated the nation. The genealogical records can be unclear, but it is certain that Jesus, as the descendant of Jechonias, fulfills the royal lineage of David.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "When, therefore, it is denounced (Jer 32:30) that Jeconiah should be ‘childless,’ this word must be understood as explained by the rest of the verse, ‘for no man of his seed shall prosper, sitting upon the throne of David and ruling any more in Judah.’" 
2. "The LXX render this word עֲרִירִי, ἐκκήρυκτον: but the Talmudical writers explain it according to our rendering."
3. "Either this may have been a different Zerubbabel, or Salathiel may, according to the law, have raised up seed to his brother."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Nor does this contradict Jeremiah 22:30, 'Thus saith the Lord, Write ye this man (Coniah, or Jeconiah) childless'; for what follows explains in what sense this was meant—'for no man of his seed shall prosper, sitting upon the throne of David.' He was to have seed, but no reigning child."
2. "But it would appear from 1 Chronicles 3:19 that Zerubbabel was Salathiel's grandson, being the son of Pedaiah, whose name, for some reason unknown, is omitted."
3. "Salathiel—or Shealtiel—begat Zorobabel."

### John Calvin:
1. "The descendants of David, from being kings, then became exiles and slaves."
2. "The fragments of the royal scepter lasted till the coming of Christ was at hand."
3. "Even during that wretched and melancholy dispersion, the nation never ceased to be illuminated by some rays of the grace of God."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The succeeding list cannot be verified, although we meet with the names of Salathiel (Shealtiel), Zerrubbabel in the Old Testament." 
2. "Either this may have been a different Zerubbabel, or Salathiel may, according to the law, have raised up seed to his brother." 
3. "In 1 Chronicles 3:19, Zerubbabel is said to have been the son of Pedaiah, brother of Salathiel."

### John Gill:
1. "The sentence does not imply that he should have no children, but rather that he should, as will appear upon reading the whole; 'thus saith the Lord, write ye this man childless, a man that shall not prosper in his days; for no man of his seed shall prosper, sitting on the throne of David, and ruling any more in Judah'." 

2. "The Hebrew wordערירי, rendered 'childless', comes from ערה, which signifies 'to make naked' or 'bare' and so denotes not only such as have no children, or are bereft of them, but such as are by any providence stripped of the blessings of life, and are left bare, destitute, and unhappy, as Jechonias and his posterity were."

3. "However, it is certain, as a genealogical writer among the Jews observes, that he was of the son's sons of Jechonias, king of Judah, from whom our Evangelist makes him to descend."
