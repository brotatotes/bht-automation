# Matthew 1:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This verse talks about a man named Jechonias or Jeconiah who was prophesied to be childless and not have any descendants who would sit on the throne of David. However, commentators explain that this does not mean he would have no children at all, but rather that he and his seed would be stripped of blessings and prosperity. It is also mentioned that a descendant of Jechonias named Zerubbabel is mentioned in the Old Testament, but there is some confusion regarding his lineage.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Nor does this contradict Jeremiah 22:30, 'Thus saith the Lord, Write ye this man (Coniah, or Jeconiah) childless'; for what follows explains in what sense this was meant - 'for no man of his seed shall prosper, sitting upon the throne of David.'" 
2. "He was to have seed, but no reigning child."
3. "But it would appear from 1 Chronicles 3:19 that Zerubbabel was Salathiel's grandson, being the son of Pedaiah, whose name, for some reason unknown, is omitted."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The succeeding list cannot be verified, although we meet with the names of Salathiel (Shealtiel), Zerrubbabel in the Old Testament." 
2. "Either this may have been a different Zerubbabel, or Salathiel may, according to the law, have raised up seed to his brother." 
3. "In 1 Chronicles 3:19, Zerubbabel is said to have been the son of Pedaiah, brother of Salathiel."

### John Gill:
1. "The sentence does not imply that he should have no children, but rather that he should, as will appear upon reading the whole; 'thus saith the Lord, write ye this man childless, a man that shall not prosper in his days; for no man of his seed shall prosper, sitting on the throne of David, and ruling any more in Judah'." 
2. "The Hebrew wordערירי, rendered 'childless', comes from ערה, which signifies 'to make naked' or 'bare' and so denotes not only such as have no children, or are bereft of them, but such as are by any providence stripped of the blessings of life, and are left bare, destitute, and unhappy, as Jechonias and his posterity were."
3. "However, it is certain, as a genealogical writer among the Jews observes, that he was of the son's sons of Jechonias, king of Judah, from whom our Evangelist makes him to descend."
