## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "And yet it is here studiously proclaimed that Joseph was not the natural, but only the legal father of our Lord. His birth of a virgin was known only to a few; but the acknowledged descent of his legal father from David secured that the descent of Jesus Himself from David should never be questioned."
2. "Christ—signifying 'anointed.' It is applied in the Old Testament to the kings, the priests, and the prophets—these all being anointed with oil, the symbol of the needful spiritual gifts to consecrate them to their respective offices."
3. "It was applied, in its most sublime and comprehensive sense, to the promised Deliverer, inasmuch as He was to be consecrated to an office embracing all three by the immeasurable anointing of the Holy Ghost."

### John Calvin:
1. "Matthew points out his office, to inform the readers that this was not a private person, but one divinely anointed to perform the office of Redeemer."
2. "What that anointing was, and to what it referred, I shall not now illustrate at great length."
3. "But that the fearful desolation which followed might not throw the minds of the godly into despair, it pleased God to appropriate the name of Messiah, Anointed, to the Redeemer alone."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Luke gives the genealogy of Mary, Hell being her father, and the father-in-law of Joseph. This is the most probable view, since the writers of the New Testament assume that Jesus was descended from David through his mother." 
2. "Both are genealogies of Joseph. This assumes one, or perhaps two, levirate marriages in the family of Joseph."
3. "According to another hypothesis, the royal ancestry of Joseph is given by Matthew, a descent from David through private persons is traced by Luke."

### John Gill:
1. "Joseph, who is here called the husband of Mary, was, as is evident by this genealogy, of the house and lineage of David; though a mean and obscure person, and by trade a carpenter." 

2. "From the whole of this genealogy it appears, that Jesus was of the seed of Abraham, of the tribe of Judah, and of the family of David; whereby several ancient prophecies have their accomplishment, and therefore he ought to be acknowledged as the true Messiah."

3. "And also that he was of the blood royal, and had his descent from the kings of Judah, and was heir apparent to the throne and kingdom of his father David."

### John Wesley:
1. "It was needful for all who believed this, to know, that Joseph was sprung from David. Otherwise they would not allow Jesus to be the Christ."
2. "The name Jesus respects chiefly the promise of blessing made to Abraham: the name Christ, the promise of the Messiah's kingdom, which was made to David."
3. "And if we look into ourselves, we shall find a want of Christ in all these respects. We are by nature at a distance from God, alienated from him, and incapable of a free access to him. Hence we want a mediator, an intercessor, in a word, a Christ, in his priestly office."
