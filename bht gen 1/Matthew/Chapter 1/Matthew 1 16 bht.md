# Matthew 1:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Bible verse being described is about the genealogy of Jesus and the significance of his lineage. Commentators emphasize that Joseph, Jesus' legal father, was not his natural father, but their descent from David was important to establish Jesus' rightful lineage. It is suggested that Mary's genealogy is given in Luke's account, and that the use of the names "Jesus" and "Christ" signifies the fulfillment of the promises of blessing and the Messiah's kingdom. Overall, the verse highlights the need for a mediator like Christ, who bridges the gap between humanity and God.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "And yet it is here studiously proclaimed that Joseph was not the natural, but only the legal father of our Lord."
2. "His birth of a virgin was known only to a few; but the acknowledged descent of his legal father from David secured that the descent of Jesus Himself from David should never be questioned."
3. "Christ—signifying 'anointed.' It is applied in the Old Testament to the kings, the priests, and the prophets —these all being anointed with oil, the symbol of the needful spiritual gifts to consecrate them to their respective offices."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Luke gives the genealogy of Mary, Hell being her father, and the father-in-law of Joseph. This is the most probable view, since the writers of the New Testament assume that Jesus was descended from David through his mother." 
2. "Both are genealogies of Joseph. This assumes one, or perhaps two, levirate marriages in the family of Joseph."
3. "The objection to the whole theory is, that Jewish usage would insert in the genealogy not the name of the second husband (the real father), but only that of the first husband who died childless."

### John Wesley:
1. "It was needful for all who believed this, to know, that Joseph was sprung from David. Otherwise they would not allow Jesus to be the Christ."
2. "The name Jesus respects chiefly the promise of blessing made to Abraham: the name Christ, the promise of the Messiah's kingdom, which was made to David."
3. "And if we look into ourselves, we shall find a want of Christ in all these respects. We are by nature at a distance from God, alienated from him, and incapable of a free access to him. Hence we want a mediator, an intercessor, in a word, a Christ, in his priestly office."
