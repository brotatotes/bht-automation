# Matthew 1:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this genealogical record, the names of ancestors are carefully arranged by commentators into three parts, each representing a significant era in Israel's history. The divisions form a thoughtful structure to aid in memorization. With each generation, we are reminded of the passing of time and the continuity of God's faithfulness through the generations. As the names fade from human memory, we find solace in the assurance that our names may still be eternally remembered by God.

3. "We may safely say, that the πᾶσαι does not, as Meyer, imply that Matthew intended to give the genealogy complete, and was not aware of the omissions."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The whole may be conveniently divided into three fourteens, each embracing one marked era, and each ending with a notable event, in the Israelitish annals." 
2. "Such artificial aids to memory were familiar to the Jews, and much larger gaps than those here are found in some of the Old Testament genealogies."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "This division of the names in the genealogical tables was doubtless adopted for the purpose of aiding the memory." 
2. "The Jews were destitute of books besides the Old Testament, and they had but few copies of that among them, and those chiefly in their synagogues. They would therefore naturally devise plans to keep up the remembrance of the principal facts in their history."
