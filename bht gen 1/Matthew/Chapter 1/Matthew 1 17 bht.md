# Matthew 1:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This passage details a genealogical table that divides the names into three periods, each ending with a significant event. The purpose of these divisions was to aid in the memorization of the nation's history, as they lacked written records. The numbers in the table hold symbolic meaning, but the primary reason for the arrangement is not the symbolism. The passage reflects on the continuous passing of generations but also highlights the enduring goodness of the Lord and the hope that remains for future generations. Ultimately, it emphasizes the importance of being remembered by God, even if forgotten by humanity.
