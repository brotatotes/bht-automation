# Matthew 1:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the Holy Ghost is described as a distinct conscious Person within the unity of the Godhead. The narrative suggests a distinction between betrothal and marriage, where unfaithfulness during betrothal was considered adultery. The miraculous conception of Jesus by the Holy Ghost is mentioned, indicating something unique about this birth. Joseph's perplexity is emphasized as this statement of fact, not a part of the discovery, is made. The verse also highlights the significance of the betrothal period in Jewish culture, where unfaithfulness carried severe consequences.
