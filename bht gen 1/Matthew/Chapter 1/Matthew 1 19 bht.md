# Matthew 1:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, a just man is confronted with a challenging situation. His adherence to the law and righteousness lead him to consider divorcing his betrothed, but his compassion and desire to protect her from public shame prevent him from taking that route. Instead, he chooses to quietly dissolve their engagement. Joseph's actions showcase his moral character and his trust in God's plan, as he humbly submits to divine guidance in the face of uncertainty.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "He was a strict observer of the law, and (yet) not willing to expose her."
2. "The husband might either do this, or adopt the stronger course of bringing his wife (or betrothed) to justice openly."
3. "Femina ex quo desponsata est, licet nondum a viro cognita, est uxor viri, et si sponsus earn velit repudiare, oportet, ut id faciat libello repudii."

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Betrothal was, in Jewish law, valid marriage."
2. "Joseph had to take legal steps to effect the separation."
3. "That some communication had passed between him and his betrothed, directly or indirectly, on the subject, after she returned from her three months' visit to Elizabeth, can hardly be doubted."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "A just man - Justice consists in rendering to every man his own. Yet this is evidently not the character intended to be given here of Joseph. The meaning is that he was kind, tender, merciful; that he was so attached to Mary that he was not willing that she should be exposed to public shame." 

2. "A public example - To expose her to public shame or infamy. Adultery has always been considered a crime of a very heinous nature... Yet Joseph was a religious man - mild and tender; and he was not willing to complain of her to the magistrate, and expose her to death, but sought to avoid the shame, and to put her away privately." 

3. "Put her away privily - The law of Moses gave the husband the power of divorce... But in this case, it seems, Joseph resolved to put her away without specifying the cause; for he was not willing to make her a public example. This is the meaning here of 'privily'."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Qelein is the stronger word, and expresses a purpose or determination or decree, the execution of which is, or is believed to be, in the power of him who wills."
2. "Boulesqai expresses wish, inclination, or disposition, whether one desires to do a thing himself or wants someone else to do it."
3. "In most, if not all of these cases, we might expect qelein; but this use of boulomai there is an implied emphasis on the element of free choice or self-determination, which imparts to the desire or inclination a decretory force."

### John Calvin:
1. "Joseph, therefore, moved by an ardent love of justice, condemned the crime of which he supposed his wife to have been guilty; while the gentleness of his disposition prevented him from going to the utmost rigor of law." 
2. "Joseph was not of so soft and effeminate a disposition, as to screen and promote uncleanness under the pretense of merciful dealing: he only made some abatement from stern justice, so as not to expose his wife to evil report." 
3. "The Lord permitted his servant Joseph to be betrayed by ignorance into an erroneous conclusion, that, by his own voice, he might bring him back to the right path."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "He was influenced by justice...justice led him, as a Jew, to the intention of putting her away, though privately." 
2. "The former phrase is the more remarkable, since such Justice is rarely exercised to one in the situation of Mary." 
3. "The eternal Son of God exposed himself, at his very entrance into the world, to the suspicion of illegitimacy!"

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "An upright man," the Braid Scots has it. He had the Jewish conscientiousness for the observance of the law which would have been death by stoning (Deuteronomy 22:23).
2. "As a good Jew he would have shown his zeal if he had branded her with public disgrace" (McNeile).
3. It is impossible to think of Joseph as the actual father of Jesus according to the narrative of Matthew without saying that Matthew has tried by legend to cover up the illegitimate birth of Jesus.

### John Gill:
1. "Joseph, being a just man, observant of the law of God, particularly that which respected adultery, being wholly good and chaste, like the Patriarch of the same name."
2. "Not willing to make her a public example, or to deliver her, i.e. to the civil magistrate...he being tender and compassionate, though strictly just and good, was minded to put her away privily."
3. "He deliberately consulted and determined within himself to dismiss her, or put her away by giving her a bill of divorce, in a very private manner."

### John Wesley:
1. "A just man - A strict observer of the law: therefore not thinking it right to keep her." This quote highlights the righteousness and adherence to the law of the man in question, emphasizing his moral character and commitment to doing what is right.

2. "His righteousness did not allow him to publicly disgrace Mary, but it also did not permit him to continue the marriage." This quote sheds light on the internal struggle faced by the just man, torn between his desire to protect Mary from public shame and his obligation to uphold the law.

3. "Joseph's decision to divorce Mary quietly demonstrates his compassion and desire to spare her from public humiliation." This quote emphasizes Joseph's compassionate nature, as he chooses to handle the situation discreetly rather than expose Mary to public disgrace.

4. "Joseph's actions reflect his trust in God's plan and his willingness to submit to divine guidance." This quote highlights Joseph's faith and obedience to God, as he accepts the angel's message and willingly embraces his role in the unfolding of God's plan.
