# Matthew 1:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This verse in Matthew focuses on the genealogy of Jesus, tracing it back to Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and Judas (also known as Judah) to highlight the lineage and connection between Jesus and the people of Israel. The inclusion of Judah specifically emphasizes the fulfillment of the prophecy that the Messiah would come from his line. The genealogy not only establishes Jesus' connection to the Twelve Patriarchs and the whole covenant nation but also emphasizes the continuation of God's promises and the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "These additions probably indicate that Matt. did not take his genealogy from any family or public documents, but constructed it himself."
2. "Obiter Matthæus Christum ut cognatum omnibus Israelitis commendat." (Translation: "By the way, Matthew presents Christ as a relative to all Israelites.")
3. "Matt. wanted to emphasize the connection between Jesus and the people of Israel, highlighting his role as the long-awaited Messiah."

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Abraham begat Isaac; and Isaac begat Jacob; and Jacob begat Judas and his brethren." - This verse highlights the genealogy of Jesus, tracing it back to Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and Judas. It emphasizes the importance of lineage and how Jesus fulfills the Messianic prophecy from the descendants of Jacob.

2. "Only the fourth son of Jacob is here named, as it was from his loins that Messiah was to spring." - This quote explains why only Judas (also known as Judah) is mentioned in the genealogy. It clarifies that the Messiah was prophesied to come from the line of Judah, making his inclusion significant in establishing Jesus' lineage.

3. "Messiah was to spring (Genesis 49:10)." - This reference to Genesis 49:10 points to the specific prophecy that the Messiah would come from the tribe of Judah. It adds depth to the understanding of Jesus' lineage and the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies in the New Testament.

### John Calvin:
1. "He properly assigns a place in the genealogy to the Twelve Patriarchs, on all of whom God had bestowed a similar favor of adoption."
2. "He intimates that the blessing promised in Christ does not refer to the tribe of Judah alone, but belongs equally to all the children of Jacob."
3. "God gathered [the children of Jacob] into his Church, while Ishmael and Esau were treated as strangers."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "‘Begat,’ repeated throughout, makes prominent the idea of a living connection and succession."
2. "Judah, the direct ancestor, is named; his brethren are added, to indicate the connection with the whole covenant nation."
3. "The mention of Abraham begetting Isaac emphasizes the fulfillment of God's promise and the continuation of the covenant."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "The word itself does not always mean immediate parentage, but merely direct descent."
2. "The mention of the brethren of Judah and of both Phares and Zara may show that Matthew was not copying a family pedigree but making his own table."
3. "The evidence as it now stands does not justify changing the text of the Greek uncials to suit the Sinaitic Syriac. The Virgin Birth of Jesus remains in Matthew 1:16."

### John Gill:
1. "The descent of Christ from Abraham is in the line of Isaac; Abraham begat Ishmael before Isaac, and others after him, but they are not mentioned; because the Messiah was not to spring from any of them, but from Isaac." 

2. "Isaac begat Jacob. The genealogy of Christ proceeds from Isaac, in the line of Jacob. Isaac begat Esau, as well as Jacob, and they two were twins, but one was loved, and the other hated; wherefore no mention is made of Esau, he had no concern in the Messiah, nor was he to spring from him, but from Jacob, or Israel."

3. "Jacob begat Judas and his brethren. The lineage of Christ is carried on from Jacob in the line of Judah; the reason of which is, because it was particularly prophesied that the Messiah, Shiloh, the prince and chief ruler, should be of him."
