# Matthew 1:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In a moment of despair, with dark prospects and a shattered happiness, there is a glimmer of hope. The relationship that was clouded and unsullied still holds promise for redemption. Despite the weight of doubt and passion, there is a chance for light to shine through and provide salvation, delivering us from the power of sin and guiding us towards divine guidance. It is a reminder that in the depths of our struggle, God's opportunity arises when man reaches his extremity.
