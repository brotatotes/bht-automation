# Matthew 1:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, we are introduced to Jesus, the sweetest and most fragrant name for the Savior, who personally saves and redeems people from every nation and tongue. Derived from the verb "to save," Jesus' purpose is to save us from the power and dominion of sin, truly renewing and transforming us. This verse emphasizes that Jesus is the Lord of Salvation, a name that echoes the significance of remarkable biblical figures like Joshua, offering salvation to all the people of God.
