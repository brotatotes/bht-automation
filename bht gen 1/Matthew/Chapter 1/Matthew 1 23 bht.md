# Matthew 1:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This Bible verse speaks of a significant figure, a particular virgin or "the virgin" chosen for an extraordinary purpose. This person would be known as Emmanuel, which means "God with us." The verse signifies a deep and everlasting connection between God and humankind. It emphasizes the fulfillment of prophecy and the unity between the Old and New Testaments. The name Emmanuel is not merely a label, but a description of Jesus Christ, who incarnates God's presence among humanity.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Behold, a virgin—It should be 'the virgin' meaning that particular virgin destined to this unparalleled distinction."
2. "They shall call his name Emmanuel, which, being interpreted, is, God with us—Not that He was to have this for a proper name (like 'Jesus'), but that He should come to be known in this character, as God manifested in the flesh."
3. "The living bond of holy and most intimate fellowship between God and men from henceforth and for ever."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The Old and New Testaments are related to each other as type and antitype, prophecy and fulfilment, preparation and consummation."
2. "The New Testament writers do not, however, use the Scriptures by way of accommodation; whenever a passage is explained by them as having a second fulfilment, as in the present case, that fulfilment is in accordance with the first, only fuller, broader, more spiritual."
3. "God with us. Applied to Christ in the highest and most glorious sense: God incarnate among us, He is still Immanuel, God with us; once He came among men and identified himself with them; now He saves men and identifies them with Himself."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "The interest of the evangelist, as of all New Testament writers, in prophecy, was purely religious" (Bruce).
2. "But surely the language of Isaiah has had marvellous illustration in the Incarnation of Christ."
3. "This is Matthew's explanation of the meaning of Immanuel, a descriptive appellation of Jesus Christ and more than a mere motto designation."

### John Wesley:
1. "To be called, only means, according to the Hebrew manner of speaking, that the person spoken of shall really and effectually be what he is called, and actually fulfil that title."
2. "He shall be all these, though not so much nominally, as really, and in effect."
3. "It is observable, the words in Isaiah are, Thou (namely, his mother) shalt call; but here, They - that is, all his people, shall call - shall acknowledge him to be Emmanuel, God with us."
