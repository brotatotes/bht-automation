# Matthew 1:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This verse speaks of a remarkable prophecy in which a virgin would conceive and give birth to a child. This child would be called Emmanuel, which means "God with us." Through the miraculous conception of Jesus, God manifested Himself in human form, becoming the living bond between Himself and humanity. This name signifies the intimate fellowship between God and mankind, where believers are united with Him through faith. It is a fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies and the fulfillment of God's promise to be present and save His people.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The LXX rendering as a proof that the prophecy was then understood of the Messiah."
2. "Men shall call i.e. it shall be a name by which He shall be called one of his appellations."
3. "The Hebrew has קָרָאת , ‘ thou shalt call ’ (fem.)."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Behold, a virgin—It should be 'the virgin' meaning that particular virgin destined to this unparalleled distinction."
2. "they shall call his name Emmanuel, which, being interpreted, is, God with us—Not that He was to have this for a proper name (like 'Jesus'), but that He should come to be known in this character, as God manifested in the flesh."
3. "the living bond of holy and most intimate fellowship between God and men from henceforth and for ever."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Behold, a virgin shall be with child - Matthew clearly understands this as applying literally to a virgin. Compare Luke 1:34. It thus implies that the conception of Christ was miraculous, or that the body of the Messiah was created directly by the power of God."
2. "And they shall call his name Emmanuel - That is, his name shall be so called... Matthew doubtless understands it as denoting that the Messiah was really 'God with us,' or that the divine nature was united with the human."
3. "He had just given an account of the miraculous conception of Jesus: of his being begotten by the Holy Spirit. God was therefore his Father. He was divine as well as human. His appropriate name, therefore, was 'God with us.'"

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The original of Isaiah (vii. 14) has she shall call; but Matthew generalized the singular into the plural, and quotes the prophecy in a form suited to its larger and final fulfilment: men shall call his name Immanuel, as they shall come to the practical knowledge that God will indeed dwell with men upon the earth."
2. "Immanuel (Hebrew, God is with us). To protect and save. A comment is furnished by Isaiah 8:10, 'Devise a device, but it shall come to naught; speak a word, but it shall not stand, for with us is God.'"
3. "The promise of the name is fulfilled in Jesus (compare 'Lo, I am with you always,' Matthew 28:20) by his helpful and saving presence with his people in their sorrow, their conflict with sin, and their struggle with death."

### John Calvin:
1. "For out of Christ we are alienated from him; but through Christ we are not only received into his favor, but are made one with him."
2. "His seat and residence is placed 'between the Cherubim,' because the ark was the figure and visible pledge of his glory. But in Christ the actual presence of God with his people, and not, as before, his shadowy presence, has been exhibited."
3. "But we must not, at the same time, forget the fruit which God intended that we should collect and receive from this name. For whenever we contemplate the one person of Christ as God-man, we ought to hold it for certain that, if we are united to Christ by faith, we possess God."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The Old and New Testaments are related to each other as type and antitype, prophecy and fulfilment, preparation and consummation."
2. "Whenever a passage is explained by them as having a second fulfilment, as in the present case, that fulfilment is in accordance with the first, only fuller, broader, more spiritual."
3. "God with us. Applied to Christ in the highest and most glorious sense: God incarnate among us, He is still Immanuel, God with us; once He came among men and identified himself with them; now He saves men and identifies them with Himself."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "The interest of the evangelist, as of all New Testament writers, in prophecy, was purely religious" (Bruce).
2. "But surely the language of Isaiah has had marvellous illustration in the Incarnation of Christ."
3. "This is Matthew's explanation of the meaning of Immanuel, a descriptive appellation of Jesus Christ and more than a mere motto designation."

### John Gill:
1. "The prophecy is introduced here as in Isaiah with a 'behold!' not only to raise and fix the attention, but to denote that it was something wonderful and extraordinary which was about to be related."
2. "But the sign or wonder lay in this, that a 'virgin' should 'conceive' or 'be with child'; for the Evangelist is to be justified in rendering,עלמה by παρθενος 'a virgin'."
3. "The meaning is, not that he should be commonly known and called by such a name, any more than by any, or all of those mentioned in Isaiah 9:6, but only that he should be so, which is a frequent use of the word; or he should be that, and so accounted by others, which answers to the signification of this name, which the Evangelist says, being interpreted is God with us."

### John Wesley:
1. "To be called, only means, according to the Hebrew manner of speaking, that the person spoken of shall really and effectually be what he is called, and actually fulfil that title."
2. "He shall be all these, though not so much nominally, as really, and in effect."
3. "It is observable, the words in Isaiah are, Thou (namely, his mother) shalt call; but here, They - that is, all his people, shall call - shall acknowledge him to be Emmanuel, God with us."
