# Matthew 1:25 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The commentator quotes shed light on a biblical verse that is often subject to interpretation. The verse does not imply that Joseph had relations with Mary after Jesus' birth, but rather emphasizes their abstinence before. The mention of "first-born" does not necessarily suggest the existence of other children. Similar uses of the term "first-born" in the Bible do not always indicate subsequent offspring. Luke 2:7 further supports this understanding by referring to Jesus as Mary's first-born son without mentioning any other children.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The primâ facie impression on the reader certainly is, that οὐκ ἐγίνωσκεν was confined to the period of time here mentioned."
2. "Everywhere in the N.T. marriage is spoken of in high and honourable terms; and the words of the angel to Joseph rather imply, than discountenance, such a supposition."
3. "No one would ever have thought of interpreting the verse any otherwise than in its primâ facie meaning, except to force it into accordance with a preconceived notion of the perpetual virginity of Mary."

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "The word 'till' does not necessarily imply that they lived on a different footing afterwards."
2. "The word 'first-born' does not decide the much-disputed question, whether Mary had any children to Joseph after the birth of Christ."
3. "The law, in speaking of the first-born, regarded not whether any were born after or no, but only that none were born before."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The doctrine of the virginity of Mary before the birth of Jesus is a doctrine of the Scriptures, and is very important to be believed."
2. "The language here evidently implies that she lived as the wife of Joseph after the birth of Jesus."

### John Calvin:
1. "Let us rest satisfied with this, that no just and well-grounded inference can be drawn from these words of the Evangelist, as to what took place after the birth of Christ."
2. "Certainly, no man will ever raise a question on this subject, except from curiosity; and no man will obstinately keep up the argument, except from an extreme fondness for disputation."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The words answering to ‘her ‘and ‘first-born ‘are omitted by some of the best authorities. They may, however, have been left out to support the doctrine of the perpetual virginity of Mary." 

2. "Matthew, with the whole history of Christ before him, would scarcely have used the expression, had he held the Roman Catholic notion of the perpetual virginity."

3. "Many Protestant commentators suppose that the genealogy of David found its end in Christ, and that Mary could not have given birth to children after having become the mother of the Saviour of the world."

1. "Joseph lived in continence with Mary till the birth of Jesus."
2. "The perpetual virginity of Mary is not taught here."
3. "Joseph showed that he was an upright man in a most difficult situation."

### John Gill:

2. "That it might be manifest not only that she conceived, being a virgin, but also that she brought forth, being a virgin."
3. "Christ is called Mary's firstborn, because she had none before him, whether she had any after him or not."

### John Wesley:
1. "He knew her not, till after she had brought forth" - This phrase does not imply that Joseph had sexual relations with Mary after Jesus was born. It simply means that he did not have sexual relations with her before Jesus was born.

2. "No more than it can be inferred from that expression, 2 Samuel 6:23, Michal had no child till the day of her death, that she had children afterward" - Just because the phrase "till the day of her death" is used in another context does not mean that it implies something happened after that point. It is a common expression to emphasize a particular period of time.

3. "Nor do the words that follow, the first-born son, alter the case" - The mention of Jesus being the first-born son does not necessarily imply that there were subsequent children. The term "first-born" can be used in various contexts without implying the existence of other children.

4. "For there are abundance of places, wherein the term first born is used, though there were no subsequent children" - The term "first-born" is often used in the Bible to denote a position of importance or preeminence, regardless of whether there were other children or not.

5. Luke 2:7 - This verse further supports the understanding that "he knew her not" does not imply sexual relations after Jesus' birth, as it states that Mary gave birth to her first-born son without mentioning any subsequent children.
