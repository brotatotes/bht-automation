# Matthew 1:25 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The commentators provide insights into the understanding of a Bible verse that involves the relationship between Joseph and Mary throughout and after the birth of Jesus. While some argue for the perpetual virginity of Mary, others note that the phrase "he knew her not" is a euphemism for refraining from having sexual relations until after Jesus was born. The mention of Jesus as the "first-born" does not necessarily indicate that Mary had other children afterwards. It is important to consider the broader context and other biblical references to understand the true meaning of the verse.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "The word 'till' does not necessarily imply that they lived on a different footing afterwards."
2. "The word 'first-born' does not decide the much-disputed question, whether Mary had any children to Joseph after the birth of Christ."
3. "The law, in speaking of the first-born, regarded not whether any were born after or no, but only that none were born before."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The doctrine of the virginity of Mary before the birth of Jesus is a doctrine of the Scriptures, and is very important to be believed."
2. "The language here evidently implies that she lived as the wife of Joseph after the birth of Jesus."
3. "His name Jesus - This was given by divine appointment."

Note: The commentary provides insight into the belief in the virginity of Mary before the birth of Jesus, the implication of her continued marriage to Joseph, and the divine appointment of the name Jesus.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The words answering to 'her' and 'first-born' are omitted by some of the best authorities. They may, however, have been left out to support the doctrine of the perpetual virginity of Mary." 
2. "Matthew, with the whole history of Christ before him, would scarcely have used the expression, had he held the Roman Catholic notion of the perpetual virginity."
3. "The brethren of our Lord' are frequently mentioned (four by name, besides sisters), in close connection with Mary, and apparently as members of her household."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Joseph lived in continence with Mary till the birth of Jesus." 
2. "The perpetual virginity of Mary is not taught here." 
3. "Joseph showed that he was an upright man in a most difficult situation."

### John Gill:
1. "The words are an euphemism, or a modest way of expressing the conjugal act, and is a very ancient one."
2. "And this conduct of his was necessary, till she had brought forth her firstborn; that it might be manifest not only that she conceived, being a virgin, but also that she brought forth, being a virgin."
3. "Christ is called Mary's firstborn, because she had none before him, whether she had any after him or not; for her perpetual virginity seems to be no necessary article of faith."

### John Wesley:
1. "He knew her not, till after she had brought forth" - This phrase does not imply that Joseph had sexual relations with Mary after Jesus was born. It simply means that he refrained from having sexual relations with her until after Jesus was born.

2. "Nor do the words that follow, the first-born son, alter the case" - The mention of Jesus being the first-born son does not necessarily mean that Mary had other children afterward. The term "first-born" can be used in Scripture even when there are no subsequent children.

3. "Luke 2:7" - This verse is referenced to support the idea that the term "first-born" does not automatically imply the existence of other children. It is important to consider the broader context and other biblical references to understand the true meaning of the term.
