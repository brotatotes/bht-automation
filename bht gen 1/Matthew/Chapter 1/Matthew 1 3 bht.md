# Matthew 1:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the genealogy of Christ is presented, tracing His lineage through generations. Notably, the inclusion of women in the genealogy, such as Thamar, highlights their significant role in the divine plan of salvation. These women, though imperfect and facing scandalous circumstances, serve as a testament to God's ability to work through broken individuals. By including their names, St. Matthew emphasizes the importance of these women in the unfolding of God's redemptive plan.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "These children of Judah were not born in marriage."
2. "The reason for the women being mentioned has been variously assigned."
3. "There may be something also in that suggested by Grotius: 'Mulieres in hoc sensu obiter paucæ nominantur, extraneo ortiaut criminibus nobiles, quarum historia ad vocationem idololatrarum et criminosorum per Christi evangelium proludit.'"

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Four women are here introduced; two of them Gentiles by birth—Rachab and Ruth; and three of them with a blot at their names in the Old Testament—Thamar, Rachab, and Bath-sheba."
2. "This feature in the present genealogy—herein differing from that given by Luke—comes well from him who styles himself in his list of the Twelve, what none of the other lists do, 'Matthew the publican'; as if thereby to hold forth, at the very outset, the unsearchable riches of that grace which could not only fetch in 'them that are afar off,' but teach down even to 'publicans and harlots,' and raise them to 'sit with the princes of his people.'"
3. "David is here twice emphatically styled 'David the king,' as not only the first of that royal line from which Messiah was to descend, but the one king of all that line from which the throne that Messiah was to occupy took its name—'the throne of David.'"

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Tamar, a heathen woman, guilty of intentional incest."
2. "The mention of this name not only proves the correctness of the genealogy, but tends to humble Jewish pride."
3. "The stain must be admitted, but it also exalts the grace of God."

### John Gill:

2. "Thamar, daughter-in-law to Judah, has the honour to be named in the genealogy of Christ, who came to save Gentiles as well as Jews."
3. "The account proceeds from Phares, in the line of Esrom."

Note: The commentary provides historical and cultural context regarding the inclusion of Thamar in the genealogy of Christ, highlighting the significance of Phares in the lineage of the Messiah.

### John Wesley:
1. "St. Matthew adds the names of those women also, that were remarkable in the sacred history." 
2. "The inclusion of Thamar's name in the genealogy highlights the scandalous circumstances of her story and serves as a reminder of God's ability to work through imperfect and broken individuals."
