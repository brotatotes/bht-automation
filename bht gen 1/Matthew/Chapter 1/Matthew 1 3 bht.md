# Matthew 1:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this genealogy, we see the astonishing grace of God at work. The inclusion of these women, both Gentiles and those with blemishes in their past, shows that God's redemptive plan is not limited to a select few. These women, through their flaws and unique stories, played significant roles in shaping the lineage that would lead to the birth of the Messiah. By including their names, the genealogy highlights the diverse and inclusive nature of God's grace and the unsearchable riches of His mercy.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "These children of Judah were not born in marriage: see Genesis 28:16-22."
2. "The reason for the women (Thamar, Rahab, Ruth, and Bathsheba) being mentioned, has been variously assigned: by Wets, ut tacitæ Judæorum objectioni occurreretur: by Fritzsche, for the sake of minute accuracy."
3. "There may be something also in that suggested by Grotius: ‘Mulieres in hoc sensu obiter paucæ nominantur, extraneo ortiaut criminibus nobiles, quarum historia ad vocationem idololatrarum et criminosorum per Christi evangelium proludit:’ as also in De Wette’s view, that they serve as types of the mother of our Lord, and are consequently named in the course of the genealogy, as she is at the end of it."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Four women are here introduced; two of them Gentiles by birth—Rachab and Ruth; and three of them with a blot at their names in the Old Testament—Thamar, Rachab, and Bath-sheba."
2. "This feature in the present genealogy—herein differing from that given by Luke—comes well from him who styles himself in his list of the Twelve, what none of the other lists do, 'Matthew the publican'; as if thereby to hold forth, at the very outset, the unsearchable riches of that grace which could not only fetch in 'them that are afar off,' but teach down even to 'publicans and harlots,' and raise them to 'sit with the princes of his people.'"
3. "David is here twice emphatically styled 'David the king,' as not only the first of that royal line from which Messiah was to descend, but the one king of all that line from which the throne that Messiah was to occupy took its name—'the throne of David.'"

### John Calvin:
1. "The Son of God might have kept his descent unspotted and pure from every reproach or mark of infamy. But he came into the world to 'empty himself, and take upon him the form of a servant,' to be 'a worm, and no man; a reproach of men, and despised of the people,' and at length to undergo the accursed death of the cross." (quote 3)
2. "He therefore did not refuse to admit a stain into his genealogy, arising from incestuous intercourse which took place among his ancestors." (quote 3)
3. "But the astonishing goodness of God strove with the sin of both; so that, nevertheless, this adulterous seed came to possess the scepter." (quote 3)

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Tamar, a heathen woman, guilty of intentional incest."
2. "The mention of this name not only proves the correctness of the genealogy, but tends to humble Jewish pride and exalt the grace of God."
3. "The stain must be admitted."

### John Gill:
1. "The line of the Messiah was in Phares, and very rightly is he put in the genealogy of Christ, the Jews themselves being witnesses; who expressly say, that 'the Messiah comes from him.'"
2. "Thamar, daughter-in-law to Judah, who, though she was a Canaanitish woman, has the honour to be named in the genealogy of Christ, who came to save Gentiles as well as Jews."
3. "Elihu, who conversed with Job, is said to be of the kindred of Ram, Job 32:2 whether the same with Ram or Aram, may be inquired."

### John Wesley:
1. "St. Matthew adds the names of those women also, that were remarkable in the sacred history." 
2. "The inclusion of these women's names highlights their significance and the important roles they played in the unfolding of God's plan." 
3. "By including the names of these women, St. Matthew emphasizes the diverse and inclusive nature of God's redemptive work."
