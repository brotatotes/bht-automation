# Matthew 1:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse describes the lineage of the Messiah through the line of David, the anointed and established king of Israel. David's status as the king reflects the divine blessing and prosperous condition of the people. Despite David's human flaws and sinful past, the mention of his wife Bathsheba highlights both his deep guilt and profound penitence. Through this verse, we see the humble yet significant role that David plays in the genealogy of the Messiah, as his throne is passed down to the promised Savior.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:

2. "Grotius compares 'Hectoris Andromache,' Virg., Meyer, Luther's Katharina, and Bernhardy, Syntax, p. 160..."

### John Calvin:
1. "The kingly office had been formerly held by Saul; but, as he reached it through tumult and the ungodly wishes of the people, the lawful possession of the office is supposed to have commenced with David, more especially in reference to the covenant of God, who promised that 'his throne should be established for ever.'" 

2. "Let this expression, David the King, be understood by us as pointing out the prosperous condition of the people, which the Lord had appointed. Meanwhile, the Evangelist adds a human disgrace, which might almost bring a stain on the glory of this divine blessing."

3. "It was the design of God to show that, in establishing this kingdom, nothing depended on human merits. Comparing the inspired history with the succession described by Matthew, it is evident that he has omitted three kings."
