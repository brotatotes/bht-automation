# Matthew 1:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This verse describes the genealogy of Jehoshaphat, a good prince who ruled in Judah, but three kings were intentionally omitted - Ahaziah, Joash, and Amaziah. Some commentators suggest this was to reduce the number of generations or due to their connection with the accursed house of Ahab. Nevertheless, the purpose of this genealogy is to establish Jesus' lineage from the house of David, emphasizing that God's plan of salvation extends through many generations. By including the names of these kings, it serves as a reminder of the consequences of unfaithfulness and the importance of righteousness in the lineage of Jesus.
