# Matthew 1:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we see a genealogy that intentionally omits three names, highlighting the consequences of unfaithfulness and emphasizing the importance of righteousness in Jesus' lineage. Jehoshaphat is described as a good prince, while the omission of certain names in the genealogy is explained as three kings who were either unworthy or descended from Jezebel. This omission, however, does not undermine the purpose of establishing Jesus' lineage from the house of David. Ultimately, this verse portrays Jesus as mediately, yet unmistakably, descended from David and Abraham.
