# Matthew 10:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The chosen disciples, known as apostles, were both qualified and authorized by Jesus. They were sent forth as ambassadors of Christ, like plain men with honest characters, to bear witness to the truth. Jesus privately called them together and appointed them as ministers of the word, giving them both power and authority. With this authority, they were able to cast out unclean spirits and heal various kinds of ailments, all in order to confirm the validity of their teachings.
