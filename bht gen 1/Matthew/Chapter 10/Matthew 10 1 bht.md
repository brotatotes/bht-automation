# Matthew 10:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse describes how Jesus empowered and authorized his disciples, who had been previously chosen before the Sermon on the Mount. They were sent out as laborers, specifically entrusted with the ability to heal the sick, to attest to the truth of Christ's teachings. Although Matthew's account focuses on the healing aspect, it should not overshadow the greater spiritual distress that Jesus sought to address through his disciples' actions. This verse reminds us of God's power to work through earthly means to bring about healing as He wills.
