It is also emphasized that this commandment does not conflict with the practice of ministers receiving support from the people they serve.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "This is a common truth of life men give one who works for them his food and more; here uttered however by our Lord in its highest sense, as applied to the workmen in His vineyard."
2. "It is a gross perversion and foolish bondage to the letter, to imagine that ministers of congregations, or even missionaries among the heathen, at this day are bound by the literal sense of our Lord’s commands in this passage."
3. "But we must not therefore imagine that they are not bound by the spirit of them. This literal first mission was but a foreshadowing of the spiritual subsequent sending out of the ministry over the world, which ought therefore in spirit every where to be conformed to these rules."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Take no change of dress, no additional articles."
2. "They were not to procure even that much expressly for this missionary journey, but to go with what they had."
3. "The workman is worthy of his meat—his 'food' or 'maintenance'; a principle which, being universally recognized in secular affairs, is here authoritatively applied to the services of the Lord's workmen."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The Teaching of the Twelve Apostles" instructs that every apostle should be received as the Lord, but not stay longer than one or two days. If they stay longer, they are considered false prophets.
2. According to the text, when an apostle departs, they should take nothing except enough bread for their next lodging. If they ask for money, they are deemed false prophets.
3. The commentary emphasizes that a true teacher, like a workman, is worthy of support. The first-fruits of wine, oxen, sheep, and other products should be given to the prophets, as they are considered high-priests.

### John Calvin:
1. "Christ tells them, that they have no reason to dread that they will suffer hunger; because, wherever they come, they will at least be worthy of their food."
2. "He calls them laborers, not that they resembled ordinary ministers, but merely because they were the heralds of a richer and more complete doctrine."
3. "They did not at that time receive the office of preaching any farther than to render the Jews attentive to the preaching of the Gospel."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "They were to be free from care, not seeking any profit from their office; outwardly unburdened, inwardly carrying the greatest treasures."
2. "Without money or luggage they would be most free from care, for the workman is worthy of his meat (or 'sustenance.')"
3. "Matthew 10:8, in forbidding the spirit of covetousness in the ministry, shows that the preaching of the gospel should not become a mere livelihood; this verse shows that the laborers should be without worldly care."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "No wallet (μη πηραν). Better than 'scrip.' It can be either a travelling or bread bag." 
2. "For the labourer is worthy of his food (αξιος γαρ ο εργατης της τροφης αυτου). The sermon is worth the dinner, in other words."
3. "The well-known Didach or Teaching of the Twelve (xiii) shows that in the second century there was still a felt need for care on the subject of receiving pay for preaching."

### John Gill:
1. "They were not allowed change of raiment; either because superfluous, or too magnificent to appear in, or too troublesome to carry."
2. "Now these several things were forbidden them, partly because they would be burdensome to them in travelling; and partly because they were not to be out any long time, but were quickly to return again; and chiefly to teach them to live and depend upon divine providence."
3. "So that this whole context is so far from militating against a minister's maintenance by the people, that it most strongly establishes it; for if the apostles were not to take any money or provisions with them, to support themselves with, it clearly follows, that it was the will of Christ, that they should live by the Gospel, upon those to whom they preached."

### John Wesley:
1. "Neither scrip — That is, a wallet, or bag to hold provisions: Nor yet a staff - We read, Mark 6:8, Take nothing, save a staff only. He that had one might take it; they that had none, might not provide any." 

2. "For the workman is worthy of his maintenance — The word includes all that is mentioned in the 9th and 10th verses; Matthew 10:9,10 all that they were forbidden to provide for themselves, so far as it was needful for them." 

3. "Luke 10:7."
