# Matthew 10:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the commentators shed light on the concept of worthiness and divine justice. They emphasize that God's blessings, including peace, are conditional upon the worthiness of the recipient. If a house or individual is worthy, God will grant them the desired peace. However, if they are unworthy, God will give the petitioner what is rejected. This highlights the idea that God's response to prayer is just and consistent, regardless of the worthiness of the subject.
