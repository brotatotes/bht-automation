# Matthew 10:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, the disciples are instructed to shake off the dust from their feet as a testimony against those who reject the Gospel. This symbolic act conveys a complete separation and disassociation from those who have rejected God's message. It signifies that they are no longer considered part of the holy community but are equated with heathens and idolaters. By shaking off the dust, the disciples vividly demonstrate the division between the believers and those who refuse to accept the Gospel.
