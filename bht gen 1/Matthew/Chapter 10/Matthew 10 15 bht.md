# Matthew 10:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
On the day of judgment, those who reject the Gospel message will face harsher punishment than even the infamous cities of Sodom and Gomorrah. This severe judgment applies specifically to the people who had the privilege of knowing and hearing the Gospel but rejected it. Rejecting the Gospel is considered a greater offense than immorality and goes against the authority of the Creator. The day of judgment refers to the final judgment at the end of the world, a time appointed by God and unknown to both angels and humankind.
