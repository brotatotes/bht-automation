# Matthew 10:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Sent out in pairs, the disciples are being entrusted with the mission to spread the gospel, supported by Christ himself. As they go forth, they are likened to sheep amidst wolves, embodying innocence in the face of a hostile world. This necessitates a delicate balance of wisdom and simplicity, wherein they use the wisdom of serpents to navigate danger and the harmlessness of doves to retain their innocence. Their journey is characterized by community, reliance on God's provision, and a humble, peaceful spirit.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "I" here is emphatic, holding up Himself as the Fountain of the Gospel ministry, as He is also the Great Burden of it.
2. To be left exposed, as sheep to wolves, would have been startling enough; but that the sheep should be sent among the wolves would sound strange indeed.
3. Alone, the wisdom of the serpent is mere cunning, and the harmlessness of the dove little better than weakness: but in combination, the wisdom of the serpent would save them from unnecessary exposure to danger; the harmlessness of the dove, from sinful expedients to escape it.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "As sheep in the midst of wolves - That is, I send you, inoffensive and harmless, into a cold, unfriendly, and cruel world. Your innocence will not be a protection."
2. "Be wise as serpents ... - Serpents have always been an emblem of wisdom and cunning... Probably the thing in which Christ directed his followers to imitate the serpent was in its caution in avoiding danger."
3. "He directs them, also, to be harmless, not to provoke danger, not to do injury, and thus make their fellow-men justly enraged against them. Doves are, and always have been, a striking emblem of innocence."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "I who know what awaits you, send you into these trials, but as my 'Apostles,' with my authority and promise and support."
2. "Contrary to the order of nature, the meek and defenceless are sent among the fierce and cruel, their natural enemies."
3. "Wisdom to avoid persecution without cowardice, simplicity to encounter it without compromise. The spirit of Christ alone can combine these apparently antagonistic qualities of serpents and doves."

### John Wesley:
1. "The sending of the disciples two by two is a reminder that the work of spreading the gospel is not meant to be done alone. It emphasizes the importance of community and partnership in carrying out the mission of Christ."

2. "The instruction to go 'like lambs among wolves' highlights the challenging nature of the disciples' task. It serves as a reminder that they will face opposition and hostility, but they are called to remain gentle and peaceful in their approach."

3. "The command to carry no money bag, knapsack, or sandals signifies the disciples' complete dependence on God's provision. It teaches them to rely on God's faithfulness and to trust in His ability to meet their needs as they engage in His work."
