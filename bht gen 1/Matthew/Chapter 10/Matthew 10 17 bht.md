# Matthew 10:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Beware of both men and wolves, for they may deliver you up to the councils and scourge you in their synagogues. It is essential to exercise caution and discernment, as some individuals, including religious and civil authorities, may act against believers. Human nature can be selfish and intolerant, often slow to learn the lessons of mercy and charity. However, it is important not to fear or worry, for in times of persecution, innocence and wisdom may not shield believers. Yet, there is no need to be anxious about how or what to answer, for divine wisdom will guide their words.
