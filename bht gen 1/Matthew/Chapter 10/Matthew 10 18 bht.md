# Matthew 10:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Believers may face harsh persecution and trials for their faith, even being brought before powerful rulers and authorities. The purpose of enduring this persecution is not only to testify against those who oppose the truth, but also to bear witness to the transformative power of the Gospel. This testimony, originally directed at the Jews, eventually extended to the Gentiles, signifying the universal nature of the Gospel. This persecution served as a witness to the truths of the Gospel, either leading to the conviction and conversion of many or standing against those who rejected the Gospel and persecuted its messengers.
