# Matthew 10:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The disciples were called to a mission that involved testifying for and against others. They would face persecution and trials before governors and kings, standing as witnesses to the transformative power of the Gospel. This mission extended beyond the Jewish community, reaching out to the Gentiles. The disciples' testimony would convict and convert many, but also serve as a testimony against those who rejected the truth. They would face judgment and be brought before tribunals, yet their purpose was to bear witness to the truth and the message of Christ, regardless of the opposition they faced.
