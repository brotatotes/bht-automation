# Matthew 10:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this passage, the names of the twelve apostles are listed. They are called "apostles," which means messengers or persons sent forth to preach publicly. Simon is mentioned first because he was the first to be called and had a significant role in opening the door of faith to the Gentiles. It is worth noting that Andrew had seen Jesus before Simon, but Simon was the first called to constant attendance on Christ.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Peter, Philip, and James the (son?) of Alphœus; and the traitor is always last."
2. "We find Simon Peter, not only in the lists of the Apostles, but also in their history, prominent on various occasions before the rest."
3. "That however no such idea was current among the Apostles as that he was destined to be the Primate of the future Church is as clear as the facts above mentioned."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Our Evangelist, not intending to record the appointment, but only the Mission of the Twelve, gives their names here."
2. "And as in the Acts we have a list of the Eleven who met daily in the upper room with the other disciples after their Master's ascension until the day of Pentecost, we have four catalogues in all for comparison."
3. "James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother—named after James, as the younger of the two."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Each of those evangelists has recorded the circumstances of their appointment. They agree in saying it was done on a mountain; and, according to Luke, it was done before the sermon on the mount was delivered, perhaps on the same mountain, near Capernaum."
2. "This name was given probably in reference to the 'resoluteness and firmness' which he was to exhibit in preaching the gospel. Before the Saviour’s death he was rash, impetuous, and unstable. Afterward, as all history affirms, he was firm, zealous, steadfast, and immovable."
3. "This James was killed by Herod in a persecution, Acts 12:2. The other James, the son of Alpheus, was stationed at Jerusalem, and was the author of the epistle that bears his name."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Apostles is the official term, used here for the first time. They were merely learners (disciples, maqhtai), until Christ gave them authority."
2. "An apostle is one sent forth. Compare John 13:16 and Rev., one that is sent."
3. "Cremer (" Biblico - Theological Lexicon ") suggests that it was the rare occurrence of the word in profane Greek that made it all the more appropriate as the distinctive appellation of the twelve."

### John Calvin:
1. "The Church of Rome displays extreme folly in drawing from this passage their doctrine of the primacy."
2. "That Simon Peter was the first among the apostles we readily allow, but what was true in reference to a few persons, cannot, on any proper grounds, be extended to the whole world."
3. "Granting all that they ask regarding Peter, his rank will be of no avail to the Roman See, till they prove that wicked and sacrilegious apostles are Peter’s successors."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "On its fuller meaning see Acts 1:2 ff."
2. "Peter was therefore personally, not officially, ‘the first.’"
3. "His character constituted him a leader, but he neither claimed nor possessed this position as one of office or rank."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Simon heads the list (πρωτος) in all four lists including Acts 1:13. He came to be first and foremost at the great Pentecost." 
2. "Judas Iscariot comes last each time save that he is absent in Acts, being already dead. Matthew calls him the betrayer (ο παραδιδους)." 
3. "Bartholomew is the name for Nathanael. Thaddaeus is Judas the brother of James. Simon Zelotes is also called Simon the Canaanean (Zealous, Hebrew word)."

### John Gill:
1. "Now the names of the twelve apostles are these,.... This is the first time these disciples are called 'apostles', they were learners before; now being instructed, they are sent forth to preach publicly, and therefore are called apostles, or messengers, persons that were sent."
2. "It was proper to give the names of them, for the truth of the history, and confirmation of it; for the sake of the persons themselves, and the honour done them; and for the exclusion and detection of false apostles."

1. "Simon - The first who was called to a constant attendance on Christ." 

2. "The first who was called to a constant attendance on Christ; although Andrew had seen him before Simon."
