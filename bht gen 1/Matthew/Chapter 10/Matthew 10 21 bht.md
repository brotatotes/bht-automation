In this verse, we find a specific situation where Christians were being reported or accused, with an emphasis on the absence of any mention of women. The verse speaks to the deep hostility and dreadful opposition faced by believers, even from their own family members. It warns of a division of sentiment on religious subjects that can cause loved ones to forget their tender relations. However, amidst this persecution, there is hope and comfort in the promise of the Holy Spirit's presence, empowering believers to endure and trust in God's sovereignty.

"The father laying aside his natural affection for his child, whom he has begotten, and brought up, and has taken so much care of, and delight in, and perhaps his only one, his son and heir; and yet, professing a faith different from his, such is his blind zeal and bigotry, that, breaking through all the ties of parental relation and affection, he delivers him up into the hands of wicked magistrates, to put him to death."
3. "Children, forgetting the bonds they are in, and the obligations they lie under to their aged parents, rise up against them, and either with their own hands murder them, or appear as witnesses against them, and give their hearty consent to the taking away of their lives; even of them who have been the means and instruments of bringing them into the world, and of bringing them up in it."
