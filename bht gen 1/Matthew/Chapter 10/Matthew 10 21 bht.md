# Matthew 10:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the midst of trials and tribulations, our faith is tested and refined. We may face persecution even from our closest relatives, but it is important to remember that following Jesus does not guarantee a life free from suffering. However, we can find solace in the promise of the Holy Spirit's guidance and wisdom, trusting that God will provide us with the strength and courage to endure. We are called to stand firm in our beliefs, unwavering in the face of adversity, and not be swayed by the pressures of the world.
