Yet, enduring to the end and remaining faithful to God and His truth will be the evidence of genuine faith and will lead to a prosperous and eternal salvation. The verse emphasizes the importance of persevering in the Christian journey, finding strength in the transformative relationship with God, even in the face of tribulations and persecution.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "The universality of this hatred would make it evident to them, that since it would not be owing to any temporary excitement, local virulence, or personal prejudice, on the part of their enemies, so no amount of discretion on their part, consistent with entire fidelity to the truth, would avail to stifle that enmity."
2. "He that endureth to the end shall be saved—a great saying, repeated, in connection with similar warnings, in the prophecy of the destruction of Jerusalem."
3. "As 'drawing back unto perdition' is merely the palpable evidence of the want of 'root' from the first in the Christian profession, so 'enduring to the end' is just the proper evidence of its reality and solidity."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The human heart would be opposed to them, because it is opposed to Christ."

### John Gill:
1. "This hatred they should be exposed to, would not be on account of any ill will to their persons; or because of any evil or immorality committed by them; but purely, and alone, for the name of Christ, in whom they believed, by which they were called, of which they made a profession, and zealously preached."
2. "These words suggest that the tribulations and persecutions of the disciples of Christ, through the hatred of wicked men against them, shall not last always; there will be an end to them."
3. "Such persons are happy, who patiently endure the hatred of men, and all manner of persecution, for Christ's sake; who are not moved by the afflictions they suffer, but stand fast in the faith, hold fast the profession of it, go on in their Christian course, and hold out to the end; for such shall be saved, not only with a temporal salvation, but with an eternal one."
