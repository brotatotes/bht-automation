## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "This, though applicable to all time, and exemplified by our Lord Himself once and again, had special reference to the brief opportunities which Israel was to have of 'knowing the time of His visitations.'"
2. "What will startle you, but at the same time show you the solemnity of your mission, and the need of economizing the time for it."
3. "To understand this...seems almost trifling. 'The coming of the Son of man' has a fixed doctrinal sense, here referring immediately to the crisis of Israel's history as the visible kingdom of God, when Christ was to come and judge it."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Flight in persecution, from selfish regard to personal safety and comfort, is cowardice and sin; but flight from conscientious conviction of duty to God and to the Church, is commanded by Christ, and sanctioned by the conduct of the Apostles and martyrs."
2. "It often transfers to a wider field of usefulness."
3. "In general, there will always be a new sphere of labor for Christ's people when excluded from the old one; this succession of opportunities will not cease until the end comes; the missionary work of the Church shall continue till the second coming of Christ."

### John Gill:
1. "They were not to be discouraged, and to leave off, because of persecution in one place, but to persist in the ministration of the Gospel, by carrying it to other cities."
