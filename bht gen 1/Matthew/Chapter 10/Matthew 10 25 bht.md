# Matthew 10:25 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, Jesus encourages his disciples to expect to face the same treatment that he himself faces. The disciples are to imitate their master while servants are to imitate their lord. Jesus is referred to as "Beelzebul," a term of reproach associated with Satan and demonic worship. The verse highlights the close bond between Jesus and his followers, with Jesus being the teacher, lord, and master of his people. It also emphasizes the certainty and inevitability of reproach and persecution for those who follow Christ.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "It is enough for the disciple that he be as his master, and the servant as his lord." - This quote emphasizes the expectation that disciples should strive to be like their master and servants should be like their lord. It highlights the importance of following the example set by Jesus.

2. "As all idolatry was regarded as devil worship, so there seems to have been something peculiarly satanic about the worship of this hateful god, which caused his name to be a synonym of Satan." - This quote provides insight into the significance of the name "Beelzebul" and its association with Satan. It suggests that the worship of this god was particularly demonic and explains why it was used as an insult against Jesus.

3.

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Jesus calls himself 'the Master of the house,' and the Jews apply to him the corresponding title of the Devil, Heb., Beelzebul, Master of dwelling."
2. "The Lord of the temple was to them the chief of idolatrous worship; the representative of God, that of the worst of demons."
3. "Beelzebul was Beelzibbul. What, then, might his household expect at their hands?"

### John Calvin:
1. "Though he bestows on them the honor of calling them brethren, yet he is the first-born and head of the whole church; and, in short, he possesses supreme government and power."
2. "Nothing, therefore, can be more unreasonable than to wish to be accounted believers, and yet to murmur against God when he conforms us to the image of his Son."
3. "We carry our delicacy and tenderness to excess, if we account it a hardship to endure reproaches to which our Prince willingly submitted."

Note: The provided commentary is quite long, so I have selected three quotes that I believe provide valuable insights into the verse.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Beelzebul means either, (1) 'lord of dung,' the word being changed from Beelzebub to Beelzebul to admit of this contemptuous sense; or (2) 'lord of the habitation.' The latter corresponds better with the expression, 'master of the house.'"
2. "Satan is referred to, but with a special reference to the indwelling of evil spirits in man; Satan being their lord."
3. "This view agrees with the allusions to a 'house' in connection with the casting out of devils."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Beelzebub, an opprobrious epithet, is a term of reproach with an exact form and meaning that has given more trouble to commentators than it is all worth." 
2. "The etymology of Beelzebub is unknown, with various interpretations including 'lord of a dwelling,' 'lord of flies,' 'lord of dung,' or 'lord of idolatrous sacrifices.'"
3. "Beelzebub is mentioned in Matthew 12:24 as a term used to accuse Jesus of casting out demons by the power of the prince of demons."

### John Wesley:
1. "How much more" refers to the certainty of reproach and persecution, rather than the quantity of it.
2. The servant cannot be above his lord in terms of reproach and persecution.
3. The verse emphasizes the inevitability of facing reproach and persecution as a follower of Christ.
