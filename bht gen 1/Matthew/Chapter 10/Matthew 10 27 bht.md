# Matthew 10:27 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, Jesus urges his disciples to boldly proclaim the teachings and message of the kingdom of God. He emphasizes the confidential and intimate nature of the teachings he imparts to them, but also encourages them to openly share these teachings with others. They are commissioned to publicly announce and proclaim the good news, just as a herald would on behalf of a ruler. Their duty is to fearlessly declare what they have learned, not keeping it hidden, but passionately preaching it from the housetops for all to hear.
