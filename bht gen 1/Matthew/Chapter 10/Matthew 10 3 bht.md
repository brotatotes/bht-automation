# Matthew 10:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Among the disciples, there is one named Lebbeus, or Judas, who may not be as widely recognized as others. Despite this, his role in the list of apostles serves as a reminder of the power of grace and the importance of community within the early Christian movement. The fact that Lebbeus is referred to as the brother of James further emphasizes the significance of familial bonds and the collective efforts of all believers in building God's kingdom. This serves as an encouragement to value the contributions of every member of the body of Christ, regardless of their level of prominence.
