# Matthew 10:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, we encounter a diverse group of individuals who were called by our Lord to be apostles. From Philip, who was called shortly after Andrew and John, to Thomas, also known as Didymus, who is identified with Matthew, the publican. We see the inclusion of James, the son of Alphaeus, who was likely our Lord's cousin, and Lebbeus, commonly called Judas. Together, these apostles exemplify the manifold ways in which God's grace and calling are extended to individuals from various backgrounds, reminding us that all believers have a significant role to play in God's plan.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Philip was called by our Lord the second day after the visit of Andrew and John, and the day after the naming of Peter." 
2. "Bartholomew is not his own name, but a patronymic." 
3. "Thomas is identified with the Matthew of Matthew 9:9."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Bartholomew is not so properly an individual's name as a family surname."
2. "Matthew the publican... would have all to know how deep a debtor he had been to his Lord."
3. "James the son of Alphaeus... must have been our Lord's cousin."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Philip was a native of Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter."
2. "Thomas - Literally, 'a twin,' in reference to which he is also called 'Didymus.'"
3. "Lebbeus, called Thaddeus - These two words have the same signification in Hebrew."

Note: The provided commentary is quite short, so I have included all the relevant quotes.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Matthew the publican, the writer of the Gospel, who inserts his previous employment as a token of the power of grace."
2. "The view that it refers to Mary, the wife of Cleophas, identifies this James with ‘the Lord’s brother’ (Galatians 1:19); the term being taken in the wide sense of relative."
3. "One of the Lord’s ‘brethren’ was called Judas (Matthew 13:55); and has been identified with this Apostle."

### John Gill:
1. "Philip and Bartholomew,.... The first of these was called next; his name is a Greek one, which his parents, though Jews, might take from the Greeks that dwelt among them."
2. "Thomas, and Matthew the publican: by the other evangelists Matthew is mentioned first; but he being the writer of this Gospel, puts Thomas first, which is an instance of his modesty; and also calls himself the 'publican', which the other do not: this he mentions, to magnify the grace of God in his vocation."
3. "James the son of Alphaeus, and Lebbaeus, whose surname was Thaddaeus: the former of these is so called, to distinguish him from James, the son of Zebedee. This is the James, who was the brother of our Lord, Galatians 1:19 and is called 'James the less', Mark 15:40."

### John Wesley:
1. "Lebbeus, also known as Judas, is often overshadowed by his more well-known brother James. However, his inclusion in the list of apostles reminds us that even those who may not be in the spotlight can still play a significant role in God's plan."

2. "The fact that Lebbeus is referred to as 'commonly called Judas' suggests that he may have had a different name or nickname within the community. This highlights the diversity and individuality of the apostles, each bringing their unique gifts and perspectives to the ministry."

3. "Lebbeus' presence among the apostles serves as a reminder that God's kingdom is not built solely on the accomplishments or fame of individuals, but rather on the collective efforts and contributions of all believers. It is a testament to the inclusivity and grace of God's plan for salvation."
