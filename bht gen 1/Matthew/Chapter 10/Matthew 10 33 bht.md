# Matthew 10:33 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This verse warns about the grave consequences of denying Jesus before others, which results in Jesus denying that person before God. Denying Christ involves more than a simple rejection; it is a complete breach of the disciple's relationship with Him, contrary to His mind and will. It includes dropping or opposing truths about Christ's person, office, and grace, hiding them out of fear or shame. Denying Christ is a heinous crime that leads to a public and final separation, with Jesus declaring His disapproval of those who deny Him as workers of iniquity.
