# Matthew 10:34 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse in question speaks to the conflicting and divisive impact of Jesus' teachings. It challenges the perception of Jesus as a bringer of peace, emphasizing that following Him can lead to strife, opposition, and even division within families. The verse suggests that the clash between the principles of good and evil, truth and falsehood, is an ongoing battle, and that the true peace brought forth by Jesus comes through conquering wrong and resisting compromise. The result is not outward tranquility, but rather a separation between the followers of Christ and those who adhere to worldly norms.
