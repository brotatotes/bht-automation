# Matthew 10:34 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse, as described by the commentators, portrays Jesus as the bringer of both peace and conflict. His message challenges established beliefs, resulting in divisions and strife even within families. The coming of Jesus was not solely for peace, but to destroy evil and bring about true peace through the Gospel. The sword represents the Gospel, dividing believers from the world and enforcing a separation of principles and practices. Ultimately, Jesus' teachings can lead to unity and peace among believers, while challenging the false peace that the world offers.
