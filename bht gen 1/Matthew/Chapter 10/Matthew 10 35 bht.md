# Matthew 10:35 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, Jesus speaks about the radical nature of his message, which may cause divisions even within families. Loyalty to God takes precedence over earthly relationships, as following Jesus may require choosing him above one's own family. The Gospel brings not only peace but also conflict, challenging family ties and societal norms. This division affects domestic relations, even between parents and children, and emphasizes the cost of discipleship. Jesus warns his followers to expect opposition and persecution from their own family members, highlighting the clash between their commitment to Christ and the natural enmity of those who oppose him.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "This verse highlights the radical nature of Jesus' message and the potential division it can cause within families. It emphasizes that following Jesus may require choosing him over one's own family, as loyalty to God takes precedence over earthly relationships."
2. "By setting a man against his father and a daughter against her mother, Jesus is illustrating the cost of discipleship. He is calling his followers to prioritize their commitment to him above all else, even if it means facing opposition and conflict within their own families."
3. "The mention of daughter-in-law against mother-in-law further emphasizes the universal nature of this division. It shows that even the closest of family ties can be strained when it comes to following Jesus and living out his teachings."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The radical and bitter character of the division brought into households by the Gospel is shown by the fact of its affecting domestic relations in their very freshness."
2. "The word means bride, and though sometimes used in classical Greek of any married woman, it carries a notion of comparative youth."
3. "The full force is lost in this rendering. The word means bride, and though sometimes used in classical Greek of any married woman, it carries a notion of comparative youth."

### John Calvin:
1. "Wars and tumults arise, contrary to the nature of the Gospel, through the fault of wicked men." 
2. "Christ foretells that the world will come to such a state of confusion, that all the bonds of kindred will be treated with indifference, and humanity will be no longer regarded."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The conversion of individual members to Christ will cause variance. Domestic peace, the highest earthly peace, is thus disturbed by peace with God through Christ."
2. "It is supposed that the terms: a man (i.e., 'a son' in this case), a daughter, a daughter in law (or 'bride'), refer to those converted, 'because the younger members and the female members of households were commonly the first to embrace the gospel.'"
3. "A man's foes. The idea here expressed is the reverse of that stated in Matthew 10:21."

### John Gill:
1. "Here our Lord opens and explains what he means by the sword, intestine divisions, domestic broils, family differences, as well as such as appear in towns, cities, and kingdoms."
2. "The case is this, a father believing in Christ, embracing his Gospel, and submitting to his institutions, is contradicted, opposed, and persecuted by his own son."
3. "Which must be imputed, not to Christ, and the doctrines of Christ, and the natural tendency of them, embraced by the father, the mother, and mother-in-law; but to the natural enmity of the son, the daughter, and the daughter-in-law, to everything divine, spiritual, and evangelical."
