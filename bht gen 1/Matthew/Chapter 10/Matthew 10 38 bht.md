# Matthew 10:38 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
To be a disciple of Christ, we must be prepared to endure trials and burdens for His sake. The cross, a symbol of suffering and shame, is an important concept in this verse. It signifies the challenges and afflictions we face when following Christ. Just as Jesus carried His own cross to the place of execution, we too must be willing to bear our own crosses and face the difficulties that come with being His disciples. These crosses may vary for each person but are necessary to conform to His example and follow in His footsteps.
