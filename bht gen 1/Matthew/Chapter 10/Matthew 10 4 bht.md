### Henry Alford:
1. "We may therefore suppose that before his conversion he belonged to the sect of the Zealots, who after the example of Phinehas took justice into their own hands, and punished offenders against the law." 

2. "This sect eventually brought upon Jerusalem its destruction." 

3. "That the name ἴσκ cannot be a surname, as Bp. Middleton supposes, the expression Ἰούδας Σίμωνος ἰσκαριώτης, used in all the above places of John, clearly proves."

2. "Judas Iscariot's name may have been given to him to indicate his place of origin, Carioth, a small town in the tribe of Judah. This detail helps us understand his background and perhaps sheds light on his motivations and actions." 

3. "These names and their associations with specific places highlight the diverse backgrounds and perspectives of the disciples. It reminds us that Jesus called individuals from various walks of life, each bringing their unique experiences and perspectives to the group."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The Zealots were a sect of strict Jews, who afterwards became fierce fanatics. They were apt to take the law into their own hands, to punish offences against the Jewish law." 
2. "The choice of this man remains a part of the great mystery concerning God’s sovereignty and man’s free choice."

### John Gill:
1. "The Kanaites, or Zelotes, were a set of men, who, in imitation of Phinehas, who slew Zimri and Cozbi in the very act of uncleanness, when they found any persons in the act of adultery, idolatry, blasphemy, or theft, would immediately kill them without any more ado: this they did, from a pretended zeal for the honour and glory of God." 
2. "Now Simon was one of this sect before his conversion, and still retained the name afterwards."
3. "We learn from hence, that in the purest society on earth there has been an impure person; nor can it therefore be expected it should be otherwise in the best of churches, in the present state of imperfection; yea, that a man may have the highest gifts and attainments, as Judas had, ministerial gifts, and power of performing miracles, and yet be a vile person."

### John Wesley:
1. "Iscariot" refers to the birthplace of Judas, which was Iscarioth, a town in the tribe of Ephraim. This detail provides geographical context and helps us understand the background of Judas.

2. The mention of Iscariot being near the city of Samaria highlights the proximity of Judas' birthplace to a significant city. This could suggest that Judas had exposure to different cultures and influences, which may have impacted his decisions later on.

3. Understanding the meaning behind "Iscariot" helps us see that Judas' identity was not solely defined by his betrayal of Jesus. It reminds us that he had a background and a place of origin, just like any other person. This can humanize Judas and remind us of the complexity of his character.
