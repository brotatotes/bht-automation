### John Calvin:
1. "To receive a person in the name of a prophet, or in the name of a righteous man, means to do them good for the sake of honoring their doctrine, or of paying respect to piety."
2. "Shall receive a prophet's reward... I consider it simply as denoting the reward which corresponds to the rank of the person to whom kindness has been exercised; for Christ means that this will be a remarkable proof of the high estimation in which he holds his prophets, and indeed all his disciples."
3. "By way of amplification, he promises a reward to the very meanest offices of kindness, such as giving them a cup of cold water, He gives the name of little ones not only to those who occupy the lowest place, or are held in least estimation in the Church, but to all his disciples, whom the pride of the world tramples under foot."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "In the name of a prophet, i.e., ‘because he is a prophet,’ the original implying an inward impulse of love toward the object."
2. "The prophet may be unworthy, but the love and the regard arise from the relation to Christ implied in his office."

3. "Simple believers who are neither apostles, prophets, or particularly righteous, just 'learners,' 'in the name of a disciple'." (Alford)

### John Gill:
1. "By 'a prophet' is meant, not one that foretells things to come, but a preacher of the Gospel."
2. "He that regards such a person, and shows him respect, by an hospitable entertainment of him; not because he may be related to him after the flesh, or because he may be a man of good behaviour, of a singular disposition and temper, of much learning and eloquence, of great natural parts and abilities; but because he is a faithful minister of the Gospel."
3. "He that is kind and liberal to any good man, whether he is a minister of the Gospel or not, who appears to have the work of grace upon his soul, and is justified by the righteousness of Christ, and expects eternal life on that account; if he shows respect to him, purely because he has the image of Christ stamped on him, and the righteousness of Christ imputed to him, and not on any natural, worldly, or civil accounts, he shall receive a righteous man's reward."

### John Wesley:
1. "He that entertaineth a prophet...shall share in his reward." This highlights the importance of supporting and welcoming those who spread the Gospel, as their work is valuable and deserving of recognition.

2. "In the name of a prophet" emphasizes that the act of hospitality should be done with the understanding and recognition of the person's role as a preacher of the Gospel. It is not just about providing physical comfort, but also acknowledging their spiritual calling.
