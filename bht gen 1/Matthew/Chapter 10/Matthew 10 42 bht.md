# Matthew 10:42 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, Jesus speaks about the value and reward of serving and showing kindness to his disciples or "little ones." Though it may not be clear who exactly these little ones are, commentators suggest that they could be children, new converts, or anyone considered insignificant. Jesus emphasizes the importance of even the smallest acts of service, like offering a cup of cold water, as a reflection of love for his name. This verse reminds believers to care for and uplift those who are weak or marginalized, knowing that their actions towards others are seen and rewarded by Christ.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "To whom this applies is not very clear... I should rather imagine some children may have been present; for of such does our Lord generally use this term." 
2. "Though perhaps the expression may be meant of lower and less advanced converts, thus keeping up the gradation from προφήτης."
3. "His (i.e. the doer’s) reward: not, ‘the reward of one of these little ones,’ as before μισθ . προφ., μισθ . δικαίου: the article here makes the difference: and the expression is reflective."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Beautiful epithet! Originally taken from Zechariah 13:7. The reference is to their lowliness in spirit, their littleness in the eyes of an undiscerning world, while high in Heaven's esteem."
2. "a cup of cold water only—meaning, the smallest service."
3. "There is here a descending climax—'a prophet,' 'a righteous man,' 'a little one'; signifying that however low we come down in our services to those that are Christ's, all that is done for His sake, and that bears the stamp of love to His blessed name, shall be divinely appreciated and owned and rewarded."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "An allusion to their weakness in themselves as they went out on their mission."
2. "The smallest kindness."
3. "A solemn declaration that for such an act, he shall in no wise, lose his reward."

### John Gill:
1. "Whosoever takes notice but of 'one' of these, receives him into his house, and gives him a cup of cold water only, is regarded, a phrase used to express the least favor, or benefit whatever."
2. "Now whosoever takes notice of, and shows favor to the meanest of Christ's people, though it be but bestowing so small a benefit as a cup of cold water; yet, if it is done in the name of a disciple, or because that poor person is a disciple of Christ, verily, says Christ, I say unto you, he shall in no wise lose his reward."
3. "It will be observed another day by Christ, who takes what is done to the least of his brethren, as done to himself."

### John Wesley:
1. "The phrase 'one of these little ones' refers to the disciples or followers of Jesus who may be considered insignificant or of little importance in the eyes of the world. It emphasizes the value and worth that Jesus places on every individual, regardless of their social status or influence."

2. "By using the term 'little ones,' Jesus is highlighting the vulnerability and dependence of his followers, reminding us of the need to care for and protect those who are weak or marginalized in society."

3. "Jesus' statement in Mark 9:41 serves as a powerful reminder that our treatment of others, especially those who may be considered insignificant or unimportant, is of great significance to God. It challenges us to examine our attitudes and actions towards those who may be overlooked or undervalued, urging us to show love, compassion, and respect to all."
