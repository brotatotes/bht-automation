# Matthew 10:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse being described is about Jesus sending out his twelve apostles to preach the gospel. The commentators emphasize the different aspects of this mission. They mention how the apostles were sent to the Jews first, before the Gentiles and Samaritans, to awaken their hope and give them the first opportunity for salvation. The prohibition against going to the Gentiles and Samaritans was temporary and related to this specific tour. The commentators also highlight the qualifications of the apostles, their authority given by Jesus, and the future extension of the gospel to all nations.

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "The Samaritans were Gentiles by blood; but being the descendants of those whom the king of Assyria had transported from the East to supply the place of the ten tribes carried captive, they had adopted the religion of the Jews, though with admixtures of their own."
2. "As the nearest neighbors of the Jews, they occupied a place intermediate between them and the Gentiles."
3. "When this prohibition was to be taken off, on the effusion of the Spirit at Pentecost, the apostles were told that they should be Christ's witnesses first 'in Jerusalem, and in all Judea,' then 'in Samaria,' and lastly, 'unto the uttermost part of the earth'."

### John Calvin:

3. "Christ acted properly in confining the grace of God, at the outset, to the chosen people, till the time for publishing it were fully come."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The prohibition was removed after the resurrection."
2. "To have taken the way of the Gentiles at this time would have closed the way to the hearts of the Jews."
3. "The Samaritans were half-heathen, the descendants of Gentiles who had been partially instructed in the Jewish religion."

### John Gill:
1. "These had been with him a considerable time, to whom he had been gradually communicating spiritual knowledge; and by the benefit of private conference with him, and the observation they had made upon his doctrine and conduct, were greatly qualified for public usefulness."
2. "The calling of the Gentiles was not a matter, as yet, so clearly revealed and known, nor was the time of their calling come: besides it was the will of God, that the Gospel should be first preached to the Jews, to take off all excuse from them, and that their obstinacy and perverseness in rejecting Jesus as the Messiah, might manifestly appear."
3. "The Samaritans, though they boasted of their descent from Jacob, were a mongrel sort of people, partly Jews, and partly Gentiles, a mixture of both; and therefore are distinguished from both and though they had, and held the law, and five books of Moses, yet corrupted them in many places, to serve their purpose, and countenance their religion, particularly their worshipping at Mount Gerizim."

### John Wesley:
1. "These twelve Jesus sent forth — Herein exercising his supreme authority, as God over all. None but God can give men authority to preach his word."
2. "Go not — Their commission was thus confined now, because the calling of the Gentiles was deferred till after the more plentiful effusion of the Holy Ghost on the day of pentecost."
3. "Enter not — Not to preach; but they might to buy what they wanted, John 4:9."
