# Matthew 10:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus instructs his disciples to prioritize reaching out to the lost sheep of the house, a phrase that symbolizes the spiritually wandering and lost state of the Jews. These people are in need of guidance, salvation, and hope. The chosen people of God, who have long anticipated the Messiah, are seen as ready and receptive to the message of Jesus. This instruction highlights Jesus' compassion for those in need and the importance of extending the gospel to those who are spiritually lost and seeking direction.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Until Christ's death, which broke down the middle wall of partition, the Gospel commission was to the Jews only." 
2. "The Jews, though the visible people of God, were 'lost sheep,' abandoned and left to wander from the right way by faithless shepherds." 
3. "The term 'lost sheep' not only refers to all sinners, but also highlights the plight of the Jews who were in need of guidance and salvation."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Go rather to the lost sheep" - Jesus instructs his disciples to prioritize reaching out to the Jews, whom he sees as wandering and in need of guidance. This highlights the compassion and concern Jesus has for his own people.

2. "He regarded them as wandering and lost, like sheep straying without a shepherd" - The analogy of lost sheep emphasizes the spiritual condition of the Jews, lacking proper leadership and direction. Jesus recognizes their need for a shepherd to guide them back to God.

3. "They had been the chosen people of God; they had long looked for the Messiah" - This statement acknowledges the historical significance of the Jews as God's chosen people and their anticipation of the Messiah. It underscores the importance of offering the gospel to them first, as they were already familiar with God's promises.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Lost sheep" - This phrase emphasizes the state of those who are spiritually lost and in need of guidance and salvation. It highlights the compassion of Jesus towards those who are in a state of spiritual wandering and confusion.

2. "Most needy" - This phrase emphasizes the desperate condition of those who are lost. It reminds us that those who are in need of spiritual healing and restoration are often the ones who are most receptive to the message of hope and salvation.

3. "Most ready" - This phrase suggests that those who are lost and in need are more open and willing to receive the message of Jesus. It highlights the importance of reaching out to those who are in a state of spiritual emptiness and offering them the opportunity to find purpose and meaning in their lives.

### John Gill:
1. "By 'the lost sheep' of this house, are meant either all the people of the Jews in general, who were wandering, and were lost in error and sin, and to whom the external ministry of the Gospel came."
2. "These are called 'sheep', because they were chosen of God, and given to Christ to be redeemed, looked up, sought out, and saved by him."
3. "This character is the rather given of them, partly to reflect upon the characters of the shepherds of Israel: and partly to magnify the grace of God, in having regard to such ruined and miserable creatures; and also to excite the compassion and diligence of the apostles, to preach the Gospel to them."
