# Matthew 10:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When Jesus sent out His disciples on a mission, He instructed them not to make any preparations or take anything unnecessary for their journey. They were to fully depend on God's provision and trust Him for their needs. Gold, silver, and even copper were forbidden, as well as carrying money in their belts. This prohibition was temporary and served as a lesson for the disciples to rely on God in all circumstances and not to place their confidence in earthly possessions.
