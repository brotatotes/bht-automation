# Matthew 11:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
After Jesus finished instructing his twelve disciples, he departed from the place where he was. This did not mark the end of his ministry, as he continued to teach, perform miracles, and spread his message in different cities. Despite the opposition and trials the disciples would face, they were entrusted with a specific charge and were expected to carry out their mission with courage and dedication. Jesus' teachings emphasized the importance of enduring persecution, loving beyond familial ties, and prioritizing a relationship with God over all else.
