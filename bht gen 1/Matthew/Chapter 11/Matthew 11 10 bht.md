## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Our Lord here changes the person of the original prophecy, which is μου. And that He does so, making that which is said by Jehovah of Himself, to be addressed to the Messiah, is, if such were needed, no mean indication of His own eternal and co-equal Godhead."
2. "It is worthy of remark that all three Evangelists quote this prophecy similarly changed, although St. Mark has it in an entirely different place."
3. "The high dignity and honour which our Lord here predicates of the Baptist has a further reference: He was thus great above all others, because he was the forerunner of Christ."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "For this is he ..." - The passage of Scripture here quoted is found in Malachi 3:1. The substance of it is contained also in Isaiah 40:3.
2. Prepare thy way - That is, to prepare "the people;" to make them ready, by proper instructions, to receive the Messiah.
3. To prepare the way of the Lord is to remove every obstacle, to make the path straight and plain, and to remove everything that would hinder his coming to the soul.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "His office as forerunner of Christ made him greater than them all."
2. "The latter part of the verse contains a direct reference to the Messiah."
3. "Here, and in Mark 1:2, Luke 7:27, it is changed into a promise of God to Christ Our Lord on His own authority."

### John Gill:
1. "That these words belong to the world to come, or the times of the Messiah, that is, the Gospel dispensation, the Jews themselves own."
2. "He was an 'angel', not by nature, but by office; a 'messenger' sent by God, 'before the face' of the Messiah."
3. "All which proves him to be, what Christ says he was, 'more than a prophet'."

### John Wesley:
1. "The verse speaks of a messenger who will prepare the way for the Lord's coming. This messenger is traditionally understood to be John the Baptist, who came before Jesus to announce his arrival. It reminds us that God always sends messengers to prepare the hearts of people before significant events or encounters with Him."

2. "The phrase 'the Lord, whom you seek, will suddenly come to his temple' emphasizes the unexpected nature of God's arrival. It reminds us that God's timing is not always predictable or according to our own plans. We must be ready and open to His presence, even if it comes in ways we do not anticipate."

3. "The verse also highlights the importance of purification and refinement. The messenger will 'purify the sons of Levi' and 'refine them like gold and silver.' This suggests that before encountering the Lord, we must undergo a process of purification and transformation. It reminds us that God desires to work in us, refining our character and making us more like Him."
