2. "It is worthy of remark that all three Evangelists quote this prophecy similarly changed, although St. Mark has it in an entirely different place."
3. "The high dignity and honour which our Lord here predicates of the Baptist has a further reference: He was thus great above all others, because he was the forerunner of Christ."

1. "His office as forerunner of Christ made him greater than them all."
2. "The latter part of the verse contains a direct reference to the Messiah."
