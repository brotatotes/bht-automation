# Matthew 11:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we learn that there is a measure of greatness based on one's relation to Christ. Commentators highlight that even though John the Baptist was considered the greatest prophet before Jesus, those born of the Spirit are even greater. This is because they have the opportunity to preach about Christ's suffering, death, and redemption, while being baptized into the death of Christ. Thus, those in the kingdom of heaven, even the least, are considered greater than those who have only the righteousness of the law.
