# Matthew 11:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this passage, we encounter a description of a generation, specifically the people living in Judea at that time. These individuals were stubborn, perverse, and constantly found fault with any ministry they encountered, including that of John the Baptist and Jesus. They resembled idle children in a public market, behaving morosely and calling for others to join in their unhappiness. No matter what efforts were made to please them, they remained unsatisfied.
