# Matthew 11:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the commentator highlights the stubbornness and closed-mindedness of the people of that time. They were like children playing games, inviting others to join, but refusing to participate themselves. The preacher and the eternal Word trying to convey the message of the Gospel were seen as children interacting with other children. The men of that age were arbitrary, childish, and were not willing to receive or understand the sayings of God. Their behavior resembled that of froward children, complaining and refusing to be pleased.
