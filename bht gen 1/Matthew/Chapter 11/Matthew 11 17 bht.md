# Matthew 11:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we witness a scene where individuals mourn and play games, painted vividly by different commentators. There is a sense of deep sorrow, a manifestation of grief that seeks an outlet through physical action. We are reminded of the intense ministry of Christ, depicted as clear and joyful music, contrasting with the austere preaching of John, whose life and message were characterized by severity. This scene serves as both a metaphor for the different responses to the Gospel and a reflection of those who remain discontent and quarrelsome regardless of the message they receive.

1. "The character and ministry of Christ and his disciples, by 'piping'; by which is meant, the clear, comfortable, and joyful ministry of the Gospel; which is delightful music to a sensible sinner; and may be compared to it, for distinction of sounds, harmony, and agreement, being charming and delightful."
2. "The character and ministry of John, is signified by 'mourning': his life was a very austere one; he and his disciples fasted oft; he appeared in a very coarse habit; his speech was rough, his voice thundering: his doctrine was the doctrine of repentance, and he used very severe threatenings, in case of impenitence."
3. "They were a true picture and emblem of many persons, who like neither law nor Gospel, but are morose, sullen, and quarrelsome, let them hear what they will."
