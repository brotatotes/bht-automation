# Matthew 11:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Behold, the teacher of righteousness, thoroughly human and sociable, came into the world eating and drinking, conversing in a free and familiar way. Those who objected to his lifestyle and criticized his appearance failed to understand that the judgments of the world are childish, while the wisdom of God's method and the Gospel are justified by the lives and conversations of the children of God. No matter the disposition or deportment of ministers, there will always be those who oppose and criticize, but in the end, they will be proven wrong and the wisdom of God will prevail.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Philip Schaff:
1. "Behold. Those who cried out against austerity objected also to a teacher of righteousness, who showed himself thoroughly human in social life."
2. "Thoroughly worldly people seek to parry the claims of spiritual truth by assailing its teachers, in childish petulance, with such contradictory accusations, extending their criticisms to dress, food, expression of countenance, cut of the beard and parting of the hair."
3. "The judgments of the world are childish, those of the children of wisdom are childlike, in humility and faith, and their 'works' correspond. The result in their case has justified the wisdom of God's method."

### John Gill:
1. "The son of man came eating and drinking,.... Meaning himself, who ate and drank as men usually do, lived in the common way of life, was free and sociable, went to feasts, entertainments, and weddings, when he was invited; and was affable, courteous, and friendly in his deportment, to all men."
2. "But wisdom is justified of her children; either the wisdom of God, in making use of ministers of a different disposition and deportment, whereby some are gained, and others left inexcusable: or the Gospel, in which there is such a display of divine wisdom, which is vindicated from the charge of licentiousness, by the agreeable lives and conversations of the children of God."
3. "We may learn from hence, that no sort of preachers and preaching will please some men; that the best of Gospel ministers may be reproached as libertines, or madmen; and that they will be sooner, or later, justified and cleared from all such aspersions."

### John Wesley:
1. "The Son of man came eating and drinking - Conversing in a free, familiar way."
2. "Wisdom is justified by her children - That is, my wisdom herein is acknowledged by those who are truly wise."
