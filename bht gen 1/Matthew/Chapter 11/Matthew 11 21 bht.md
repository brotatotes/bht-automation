# Matthew 11:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In a region favored with the Redeemer's presence and works, two cities stand out as symbols of prosperity corrupted by luxury and moral degeneracy. The impending destruction of these places had been foretold and fulfilled by victorious enemies as a symbol of mourning and repentance. Although their actions were less criminal than other regions, the misery they brought upon themselves would be greater than that of infamous cities like Sodom and Tyre. This solemn declaration warns of the consequences that awaited these cities for their rejection of the teachings and presence of the Redeemer.
