# Matthew 11:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
These three verses paint a vivid picture of the towns of Chorazin, Bethsaida, Tyre, and Sidon. They were places where Jesus performed miracles and taught, yet they did not repent and change their ways. The commentators describe these cities as wealthy, but marred by moral degeneracy and idolatry. As Jesus pronounces woes upon them, it becomes clear that their level of wickedness surpasses that of even the notoriously sinful cities of Sodom and Gomorrah. The description highlights the missed opportunities for repentance and the impending severity of their judgment.
