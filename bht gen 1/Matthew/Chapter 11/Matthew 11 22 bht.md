# Matthew 11:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This verse reveals the severity of judgment for those who reject Jesus, even more so than the notoriously wicked cities of Tyre and Sidon. It serves as a warning to respond to Jesus' teachings and accept him as the Messiah. The principle of accountability is shown, with greater knowledge and rejection leading to a harsher judgment. Chorazin and Bethsaida's lack of repentance incurs a woe, but their punishment may be more tolerable than those who reject the Gospel revelation. The justice of God requires varying degrees of punishment for different sins.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "This verse highlights the severity of the judgment that awaits those who reject the message of Jesus. It emphasizes that even the notoriously wicked cities of Tyre and Sidon will find more mercy on the day of judgment than those who have heard the teachings of Jesus and yet refuse to believe." 

2. "The comparison with Tyre and Sidon serves as a warning to the people of Jesus' time, reminding them that their rejection of him and his message will have dire consequences. It emphasizes the importance of responding to the call of Jesus and accepting him as the Messiah."

3. "Jesus' words here also reveal the principle of accountability. The more knowledge and understanding one has, the greater the responsibility to respond accordingly. Those who have been exposed to the truth and yet reject it will face a harsher judgment than those who have not had the same opportunity."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Chorazin and Bethsaida did not repent; therefore a woe lies against them." 
2. "They shall be more excusable than you who have been seen the mighty works which were not done among them." 
3. "Nevertheless, they shall be more excusable than you."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "An authoritative judgment as to the measure of human responsibility."
2. "The final decision in the day of judgment would be His also."
3. "It shall be more tolerable."

### John Gill:
1. "Their punishment in another world will be more mild and moderate; they will not have such severe stings of conscience, nor have reason to make such bitter reflections on themselves, as those will who have had the advantages of a Gospel revelation."
2. "All sins are not alike, nor will the punishment of them be the same; there will be degrees of torments in hell, and which the justice of God requires."
3. "These words suppose, that the men of Tyre and Sidon will be punished for their many abominable sins, committed against the law and light of nature; but that the inhabitants of Chorazin and Bethsaida, having rejected the Messiah, and the doctrines of the Gospel, against all the evidence of miracles, and convictions of their own minds, and probably sinned the sin against the Holy Ghost; as their sins are aggravated, their condemnation will be the greater, and their punishment the more intolerable."
