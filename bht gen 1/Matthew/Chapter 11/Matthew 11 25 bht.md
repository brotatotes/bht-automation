# Matthew 11:25 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, the wisdom and prudence of the world are contrasted with the humility and faith of those considered "babes" by society. The commentators highlight the difficulty for the wise and prudent to comprehend the truths of Christianity, emphasizing that it is the pride of their own hearts that blinds them. However, for those who can acknowledge and joyfully adore the justice of God's dispensations, the glory of the truth becomes even more apparent. The verse urges us to humbly rely on God's revelation and not our own wisdom and understanding.
