# Matthew 11:25 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, the speaker expresses their gratitude and recognition of God's wisdom in concealing certain truths from the wise and revealing them to those who are considered simple or ignorant by the world. They acknowledge the justice and sovereignty of God as their Father and the Lord of heaven and earth. This humble and contemplative address to God reflects a deep connection and communion with the Father, similar to what is seen in the later chapters of the book of John.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Even in those who have rejected the message of eternal life, it is the pride of their own hearts only which has blinded them, and the glory of the truth does but the more appear in their inability to receive it."
2. "The idea of 'full' or 'cordial' concurrence is conveyed by the preposition. The thing expressed is adoring acquiescence, holy satisfaction with that law of the divine procedure about to be mentioned."
3. "To bring our own 'wisdom and prudence' to such questions is impertinent and presumptuous; and if the truth regarding them, or the glory of it, be 'hid' from us, it is but a fitting retribution, to which all the right-minded will set their seal along with Jesus."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "I confess. I recognize the justice and wisdom of thy doings." 
2. "To praise, with an undercurrent of acknowledgment; to confess only in later Greek, and with an accusative of the object." 
3. "Understanding; Wyc., wary. From the verb sunihmi, to bring together, and denoting that peculiarity of mind which brings the simple features of an object into a whole."

### John Calvin:
1. "It was on their behalf, no doubt, and for their sake, that he gave thanks to the Father, that they might not be displeased with the low and mean aspect of his Church."
2. "In choosing little children rather than the wise, he has a regard to his glory; for the flesh is too apt to rise, and if able and learned men had led the way, it would soon have come to be the general conviction, that men obtain faith by their skill, or industry, or learning."
3. "Though the sagacity of the prudent does not stand in their way, they may notwithstanding be deprived of the light of the Gospel. Since the condition of all is the same or alike, why may not God take this or that person according to his pleasure?"

### Philip Schaff:
1. "I thank thee, ‘I fully confess, thankfully acknowledge the justice of thy doings.’"
2. "Those most learned and sagacious in all earthly things often cannot understand the simplest truths of Christianity."
3. "Those despised by the world, because often ignorant of what it values, or considered ‘babes,’ because they believe like little children what their Heavenly Father reveals to them."

1. "It is usual to call this golden utterance a prayer, but it is at once prayer, praise, and self-communing in a devout spirit" (Bruce).

### John Gill:
1. "This address is made to God as a 'Father', as his Father, his own Father; for he was the only begotten of him, and dearly beloved by him: this epithet he makes use of, to show the near relation he stood in to him, and the freedom he could use with him."
2. "He also addresses him as 'the Lord of heaven and earth'; he being the maker, upholder, and governor of both, and which he fills with his presence; the one is his throne, and the other is his footstool. This he mentions to show the sovereignty of his Father, in the conversion of men."
3. "The things he expresses his thankfulness for, follow; because thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent. The 'things' he means are the doctrines of the Gospel; such as respect himself, his person, as God, and the Son of God; his office, as Messiah, Redeemer, and Saviour; and the blessings of grace, righteousness, and salvation by him."

### John Wesley:
1. "Jesus answering — This word does not always imply, that something had been spoken, to which an answer is now made. It often means no more than the speaking in reference to some action or circumstance preceding."
2. "I thank thee - That is, I acknowledge and joyfully adore the justice and mercy of thy dispensations."
3. "Because thou hast hid - That is, because thou hast suffered these things to be hid from men, who are in other respects wise and prudent, while thou hast discovered them to those of the weakest understanding, to them who are only wise to Godward."
