## BHT:
The verse, rich with Gospel themes, serves as a link between the synoptic Gospels and John, pointing to the vast discourses of the Lord. Its expression conveys the depths of the mystery of the Son, known only to the Father, and the limitless love and grace of the Father, revealed by the Son.

This verse emphasizes the pivotal role of divine revelation in understanding the authority and power of Jesus.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The spirit of this verse, and its form of expression, are quite those of the Gospel of John; and it serves to form a link of union between the three synoptic Gospels and the fourth, and to point to the vast and weighty mass of discourses of the Lord which are not related except by John."

2. "None but the Almighty Father has full entire possession of the mystery of the Person and Office of the Son: it is a depth hidden from all being but His, Whose Purposes are evolved in and by it."
