It speaks to the universal wretchedness of humanity, depicting both the active and passive forms of suffering.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest" - Incomparable, ravishing sounds these - if ever such were heard in this weary, groaning world!
2. "What gentleness, what sweetness is there in the very style of the invitation - 'Hither to Me'"
3. "In the words, 'All ye that toil and are burdened,' the universal wretchedness of man is depicted, on both its sides - the active and the passive forms of it."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Christ now shows first of all His willingness in this invitation."
2. "A figurative description of men seeking to become holy by external acts of righteousness."
3. "'I' is emphatic; other teachers lay burdens on you, I am able, as well as willing, to end your useless labor and remove the crushing burden."

### John Gill:
1. "Christ having signified, that the knowledge of God, and the mysteries of grace, are only to be come at through him; and that he has all things relating to the peace, comfort, happiness, and salvation of men in his hands, kindly invites and encourages souls to come unto him for the same."
2. "Believing in Christ, and coming to him, are terms synonymous."
3. "The persons invited, are not 'all' the individuals of mankind, but with a restriction, all ye that labour, and are heavy laden; meaning, not these who are labouring in the service of sin and Satan, are laden with iniquity, and insensible of it: these are not weary of sin, nor burdened with it; not do they want or desire any rest for their souls; but such who groan, being burdened with the guilt of sin upon their consciences, and are pressed down with the unsupportable yoke of the law, and the load of human traditions."

### John Wesley:
1. "Come to me - Here he shows to whom he is pleased to reveal these things to the weary and heavy laden." 
2. "I alone (for none else can) will freely give you (what ye cannot purchase) rest from the guilt of sin by justification."
3. "I will give you rest - I alone (for none else can) will freely give you (what ye cannot purchase) rest from the guilt of sin by justification, and from the power of sin by sanctification."
