1.

3. "The word for the Christian virtue of humility [ταπεινοφροσυνη], was not used before the Christian era, and is distinctly an outgrowth of the Gospel. This virtue is based upon a correct estimate of our actual littleness, and is linked with a sense of sinfulness. True greatness is holiness."

### John Calvin:
1. "He does not, he tells us, absolve men from their sins in such a manner, that, restored to the favor of God, they may sin with greater freedom, but that, raised up by his grace, they may also take his yoke upon them, and that, being free in spirit, they may restrain the licentiousness of their flesh."

2. "Jesus has made a virtue of this vice. He has glorified this attitude so that Paul urges it (Philippians 2:3), 'in lowliness of mind each counting other better than himself.'"

"A man must first make a profession of his faith in the God of Israel, and then live conformably to his law: agreeably to this, Christ exhorts such persons who come to him for rest and happiness, to profess their faith in him, to embrace the doctrines of the Gospel, to submit to his ordinances, and to walk according to those laws, commands, and orders, which he, as king of saints, has made, and requires obedience to."
2.

3. "There never was such an instance of humility, and lowliness of mind, as Christ; nor is there any example so worthy of our imitation as his."
