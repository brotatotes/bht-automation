## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "ἐν ἐκείνῃ τῇ ὥρᾳ ἐθεράπευσεν πολλοὺς ἀπὸ νόσων καὶ μαστίγων καὶ πνευμάτων πονηρῶν" - In that hour, he healed many from diseases, plagues, and evil spirits. 

2. "καὶ τυφλοῖς πολλοῖς ἐχαρίσατο βλέπειν" - And he granted sight to many blind people. 

3. "From καὶ ἀποκριθεὶς … ἐν ἐμοί, is nearly verbatim in the two Gospels." - The response of Jesus, "Go and tell John what you have seen and heard: the blind receive their sight, the lame walk, lepers are cleansed, and the deaf hear, the dead are raised up, the poor have good news preached to them," is almost identical in both Gospels.

### John Calvin:
1. "He gives an indirect reply, and for two reasons: first, because it was better that the thing should speak for itself; and, secondly, because he thus afforded to his herald a larger subject of instruction."
2. "Christ shows from the very nature of the Gospel, since it was designed only for the poor and despised."
3. "As Christ here guards his Gospel against contempt, he likewise reminds us who they are that are qualified to appreciate the grace of salvation which it offers to them; and in this manner, kindly inviting wretched sinners to the hope of salvation, raises them to full confidence."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Go and tell John" - Jesus instructs his disciples to deliver a message to John the Baptist, highlighting the importance of communication and sharing the truth with others.
2. "Our Lord sends a message to John" - This act demonstrates Jesus' care and concern for John, even though he is imprisoned. It shows the power of reaching out to those who are suffering or in need of encouragement.
3. "Does not instruct his disciples" - Jesus trusts his disciples to deliver the message faithfully, allowing them to take on responsibility and participate in the work of spreading the good news. This highlights the importance of discipleship and empowering others to carry out God's work.

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "The things which ye do hear and see" - This phrase refers to the signs and miracles that Jesus performed, which were meant to be seen and heard by the people. It emphasizes the tangible evidence of Jesus' power and divinity.

2. "This symbolical message was for John to interpret" - John, as the one who would later write the Gospel of John, was given the task of interpreting the deeper meaning behind the signs and miracles. He was to understand and communicate the spiritual significance of what the people were witnessing.

3. "Not for them" - The message of the signs and miracles was not meant to be understood by the people at that moment. It was a foreshadowing of the greater truths that would be revealed later through John's Gospel. The people were witnesses to the physical manifestations of Jesus' power, but the full understanding would come later through the teachings of John.
