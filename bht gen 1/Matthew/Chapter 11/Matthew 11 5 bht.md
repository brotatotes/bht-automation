"Now these, as they had the Gospel preached to them more fully and clearly, with more power and authority, and so as it never was before or since, so they 'received' it, as Tremellius from the Syriac reads the text, readily and willingly, joyfully and gladly, with faith and love; and were, as it may be also rendered, 'evangelized' by it, or thrown into a gospel mould and frame."
