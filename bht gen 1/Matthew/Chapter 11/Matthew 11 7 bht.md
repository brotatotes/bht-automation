# Matthew 11:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, the commentator highlights the character of John, whose message may have been undervalued. John's influence was significant, as demonstrated by the mixed crowd that Jesus appeals to. Though John faced popularity due to curiosity, his preaching remained steadfast and unwavering. Christ confirms his own Messiahship by emphasizing John's character and office. The expression of a reed shaken by the wind is proverbial and symbolizes instability, which John did not possess in his preaching.
