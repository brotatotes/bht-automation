# Matthew 11:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse being described showcases a contrast between the individual described and the wilderness setting. This person is depicted as someone accustomed to a life of comfort and luxury, possibly even a courtier, being dressed in soft clothing and accustomed to living in kings' houses. In contrast, the wilderness is seen as a place that is unexpected and unsuitable for someone of this nature. The description emphasizes the unique character of this individual and the stark contrast between their world of opulence and the desolate wilderness.

2. "Behold. This is equivalent to, 'oh no, such are not found in the wilderness.'"
3. "In kings' houses; not in kings' prisons. An allusion to the courtiers about Herod Antipas. John was not a flatterer nor had he drawn back from his testimony to Jesus to escape from prison or from any selfish motive."

### John Gill:
1. "John's raiment was of camel's hair, undressed, and he had a leathern girdle about his loins; and as for his diet, it was locusts and wild honey."

### John Wesley:
1. "A man clothed in soft, delicate raiment" - This suggests that the individual being described is someone who is used to a life of luxury and comfort, possibly a courtier or someone accustomed to the finer things in life.

2. "An effeminate courtier, accustomed to fawning and flattery?" - This implies that the man in question is not only used to a life of luxury but also someone who is more concerned with appearances and receiving praise rather than engaging in the hardships of the wilderness.

3. "You may expect to find persons of such a character in palaces; not in a wilderness." - This statement highlights the contrast between the expected location of someone dressed in luxurious clothing (a palace) and the unexpected location of the wilderness. It suggests that the presence of such an individual in the wilderness is unusual and out of place.
