# Matthew 12:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
On a Sabbath day, Jesus and his disciples were walking through fields of ripe corn, possibly on their way to a place of worship. Feeling hungry in the morning before their first meal, the disciples proceeded to pluck the ears of corn and rub them in their hands to eat. This action of necessity was defended by Jesus, who reminded the Pharisees that it was permitted by the Mosaic law. The disciples' actions were interrupted by the objection of the Pharisees, highlighting the tense atmosphere of the situation.
