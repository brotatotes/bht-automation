# Matthew 12:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this passage, Jesus defends his disciples who pluck and eat corn-ears on the Sabbath, pleading necessity. He shows compassion and understanding of human needs, emphasizing that the true essence of the Sabbath is meeting people's needs, not rigid adherence to rules. The incident occurs during the time of the Passover and the second Sabbath after it, as Jesus and his hungry disciples pass through fields of ripe grain. Their action of plucking and eating the ears of corn is done out of hunger and necessity, and they content themselves with this simple sustenance.
