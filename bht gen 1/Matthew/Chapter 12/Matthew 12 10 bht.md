# Matthew 12:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we see the Pharisees watching closely as Jesus performs a healing on the Sabbath. Their motives are questioned, as they seek to accuse Jesus and find fault with his actions. Jesus, aware of their intentions, looks at them with anger and grieves over their hardened hearts. The miracle itself is extraordinary, as a man with a withered hand is healed by Jesus' touch or word, demonstrating his divine power and freedom to act beyond human limitations.
