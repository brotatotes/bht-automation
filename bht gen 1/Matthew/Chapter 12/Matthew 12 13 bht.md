## BHT:
In this Bible verse, Jesus performs a miraculous healing without uttering a command, demonstrating His divine power. The man's hand, though visibly withered, still had strength in his arm, showcasing the irony of the situation and underscoring how our perception of limitations can be greater than reality. This healing act both challenged his enemies and gloriously put them to shame, as Jesus disregarded their legal grounds against Him. It showcases the transformative, comprehensive, and defiant nature of Jesus' healing touch, defying criticism while restoring both physical and spiritual well-being.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Our Lord does no outward act: the healing is performed without even a word of command."
2. "The stretching forth the hand was to prove its soundness, which the divine power wrought in the act of stretching it forth."
3. "Thus his enemies were disappointed, having no legal ground against Him."

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "The power to obey going forth with the word of command." 
2. "The poor man, having faith in this wonderful Healer." 
3. "Disregarded the proud and venomous Pharisees, and thus gloriously put them to shame."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Stretch forth thy hand": This command from Jesus to the man with the withered hand is a call to action, an invitation to step out in faith and trust in God's power to heal and restore. It challenges us to overcome our limitations and reach out for the miraculous.

2. "The arm was not withered": This statement highlights the irony of the situation. The man's hand may have been visibly withered, but his arm was still intact and capable of movement. It serves as a reminder that sometimes our perception of our limitations is greater than the reality, and that God can work through even the smallest remnants of strength and ability.

3. "The arm was not withered": This phrase also emphasizes the power of Jesus' healing touch. By restoring the man's hand, Jesus not only healed the visible physical ailment but also renewed his entire arm. It demonstrates the transformative and comprehensive nature of God's healing, going beyond what we can see and reaching deep into our being.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The manner in which the healing took place gave no legal ground for a charge on account of His actions."
2. "The act of stretching forth was both the effect and the evidence of Divine power."
3. "His act was a defiance of them, and yet it was not a forbidden act, so that they could not accuse either the Healer or the healed."

### John Gill:
1. "Being grieved for the hardness of their hearts, i.e. their unmercifulness to their fellow creatures, and the stupidity and blindness of their minds, being ignorant of the Scriptures, and of the sabbath, the nature, use, and Lord of it."
2. "Then, in a commanding authoritative way, almighty power going along with his word, he says to the man who stood forth before him, and the Pharisees, stretch forth thine hand."
3. "This was an instance of Christ's power; a proof of the lawfulness of healing on the sabbath day; and a rebuke to the Pharisees for their cruelty and uncharitableness."
