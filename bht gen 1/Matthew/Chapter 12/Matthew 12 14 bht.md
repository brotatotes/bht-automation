# Matthew 12:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, the Pharisees and Herodians, despite their differences, unite in their opposition to Jesus, driven by their fear and hatred of Him. Their decision to conspire against Jesus reveals their malicious intent and determination to eliminate Him as a threat to their power and influence. This escalating conflict foreshadows the events that would eventually lead to Jesus' crucifixion. The Pharisees, once entrusted with the government of the Church, now combine forces against Christ, driven by an obstinate rage and an irrational, fanatical hatred, culminating in a plot to take away His life.
