# Matthew 12:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, Jesus gives a charge to his followers to keep quiet about the miracles they have witnessed. This instruction is not due to a delay in his public manifestation, but rather to prevent the rapid and inflammatory spread of news that might overshadow his true mission of preaching and bringing salvation. By maintaining control over the situation, Jesus ensures that people focus on the message rather than becoming fixated on the miracles themselves. This charge also serves to avoid conflicts with his enemies and protects him from falling into their hands prematurely.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "The charge to keep silence was not because the time for His public manifestation had not yet come, but because the more widely and rapidly the report of His miracles spread, the more it would inflame the popular mind, and the more difficult it would become for Him to pursue His proper work."
2. "The Lord Jesus did not desire to be known merely as a wonder-worker or a miracle-worker. His primary mission was to preach the good news of the kingdom of God and to bring salvation to all who would believe in Him."
3. "By keeping His miracles quiet, Jesus was able to maintain a level of control over the situation and prevent the people from becoming too focused on the miracles themselves rather than on the message He came to proclaim."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "And charged them, etc. Mark tells of the similar command given to 'evil spirits.' This more general prohibition was probably given to prevent a rupture between His carnal followers and the Pharisees, so early in His ministry."
2. "Make him known, as the Messiah."

### John Gill:
1. "This charge was given... that when they returned to the respective places from whence they came, they would not make it known to his enemies where he was, and what he had done to them."
2. "Being neither desirous of popular applause and glory, nor willing to provoke them more, nor to fall into their hands as yet."
3. "This charge was a very severe one; for the word signifies a charge with threatenings, should they not observe his orders."
