# Matthew 12:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, Jesus exercises his authority and command over those he healed, instructing them not to make known the miracles he performed. This action reveals Jesus's humility, as he did not seek fame but desired the focus to be on the healing itself. The charge given to them also served to prevent conflict with the Pharisees and protect Jesus from falling into their hands. Despite the efforts of others to extinguish the glory of God, their rebellious designs only serve to redirect and magnify His power.
