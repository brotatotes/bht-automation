## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Neither it nor ὅπως πλ . must be understood ‘ and thus was fulfilled,’ as Webster and Wilkinson: both are used only of the purpose, not of the result, here or any where."
2. "It is strange that any should be found, at this period of the progress of exegesis, to go back to a view which is both superficial and ungrammatical."
3. "The prophecy is partly from the LXX, partly an original translation. The LXX have Ἰακὼβ ὁ παῖς μου … Ἰσραὴλ ὁ ἐκλεκτός μου …, but the Rabbis generally understood it of the Messiah."

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "This verse highlights the importance of prophecy in the fulfillment of God's plan. It shows that the events surrounding Jesus' life were not mere coincidences, but rather the fulfillment of ancient prophecies spoken by the prophet Isaiah."
2. "By referencing the words of Isaiah, Jesus establishes a connection between his own ministry and the prophetic tradition of the Old Testament. This demonstrates the continuity of God's plan throughout history and reinforces Jesus' authority as the Messiah."

"A very free reproduction of the Hebrew with occasional side glances at the Septuagint" - This comment suggests that Matthew's quotation of Isaiah 42:1-4 is not a word-for-word translation but a creative adaptation.

"What was now done by Christ, by his private departure from the Pharisees, being unwilling to irritate them more; by his preaching to the Idumeans, Tyrians, and Sidonians; by healing their diseases, and shunning all ostentation and popular applause; and prohibiting to tell who and where he was, was a fulfilling of this prophecy."
