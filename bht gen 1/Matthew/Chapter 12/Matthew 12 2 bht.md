# Matthew 12:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The disciples' act of plucking grain on the Sabbath was considered a violation by the Pharisees due to their strict interpretation of the law. Although it was permitted on any other day, the Pharisees saw it as a sinful act on the holy Sabbath day. They deemed it as a form of harvesting, threshing, and even a breaking of God's law. According to the Rabbinic statutes, these actions were seen as servile work, forbidden on the Sabbath.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The act itself was expressly permitted (Deuteronomy 23:25)."
2. "But as being 'servile work,' which was prohibited on the sabbath day, it was regarded as sinful."
3. "The Pharisees saw it as a violation of their strict interpretation of the law."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The Pharisees, doubtless desirous of finding fault with Christ, said that in plucking the grain on the 'Sabbath day' they had violated the commandment."
2. "Moses had commanded the Hebrews to abstain from all servile work on the Sabbath."
3. "On any other day this would have been clearly lawful, for it was permitted."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "On any ordinary day this would have been lawful; but on the Sabbath it involved, according to the Rabbinic statutes, at least two sins, viz., plucking the ears, which was reaping, and rubbing them in their hands (Luke 6:1), which was sifting, grinding, or fanning."
2. "The Talmud says: 'In case a woman rolls wheat to remove the husks, it is considered as sifting; if she rubs the heads of wheat, it is regarded as threshing; if she cleans off the side-adherencies, it is sifting out fruit; if she bruises the ears, it is grinding; if she throws them up in her hand, it is winnowing.'"
3. "This commentary sheds light on the strict interpretation of the Sabbath laws during Jesus' time, where even seemingly innocent actions like plucking ears of grain were considered violations."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "They were lying in wait for something as a ground of opposition."
2. "Plucking grain on the Sabbath was construed by the Rabbins into a kind of harvesting."
3. "This departure from their formal legalism was magnified by the Pharisees into a breaking of Godâ€™s law."

2. "The disciples were plucking the heads of wheat which to the Pharisees was reaping."

### John Gill:
1. "What offended the Pharisees was, that it was done on a sabbath day, it being, as they interpret it, a servile work, and all one as reaping; though, in the law just mentioned, it is manifestly distinguished from it."
2. "Their rule is 'he that reaps (on the sabbath day) ever so little, is guilty (of stoning), and 'plucking of ears of corn is a derivative of reaping'; and is all one as its primitive, and punishable with the same kind of death, if done presumptuously."
3. "It may be what might make this offence of the disciples the more heinous was, that they plucked these ears, and ate them, and so broke their fast before morning prayer."

Note: The commentary is quite lengthy, so I have selected three quotes that provide a concise understanding of the Pharisees' objection to the disciples' actions on the Sabbath day.
