# Matthew 12:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we see the disciples of Jesus plucking grain on the Sabbath day, which was perceived by the Pharisees as a violation of their strict Sabbath rules. According to the commentators, even this seemingly innocent act was seen as reaping and threshing, work that was forbidden on the Sabbath. The Pharisees' legalistic mindset led them to criticize the disciples' actions, highlighting their focus on adhering to man-made rules rather than understanding the spirit behind God's commandments.
