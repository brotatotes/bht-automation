# Matthew 12:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we see a depiction of Jesus' compassionate and gentle nature towards sinners. He does not crush the contrite heart or extinguish even the slightest spark of repentance. Instead, he binds up their broken hearts, heals their wounds, and restores comfort to them. Jesus cares for the weakest and smallest aspects of our lives, like a bruised reed or a smoking flax, nurturing and refining the tiniest flicker of grace. Through his Gospel and mighty power, he brings light, understanding, sanctification, and victory over all enemies of righteousness.
