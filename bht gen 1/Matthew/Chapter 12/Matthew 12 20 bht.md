# Matthew 12:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the face of great struggles and opposition, the Messiah achieves victories with astonishing noiselessness. With matchless tenderness and love, he lifts up the meek, strengthens the weak, and comforts those who mourn. His lamp, though humble, burns brightly and his reed, though frail, cannot be broken. In the midst of battles, victories are achieved, as righteousness triumphs over all its enemies. This is the powerful and compassionate nature of the verse.
