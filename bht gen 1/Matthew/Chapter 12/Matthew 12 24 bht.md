# Matthew 12:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we witness a confrontation between Jesus and the scribes from Jerusalem who accuse Him of being under the influence of Beelzebul, the prince of demons. This accusation reveals their deep-seated fear and resistance towards Jesus' authority and power. Jesus, in response, exposes the illogicality of their claim and highlights their hypocrisy. This clash demonstrates the conflict between the kingdom of God and the kingdom of darkness, with Jesus' authority and power challenging the established religious order.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "A rigid monotheistic religion like the Jewish, left but one way of escape from the authority of miracles, which once were acknowledged to be indeed such, and not mere collusions and sleights of hand."
2. "There remained nothing to say but that which we find in the N.T. the adversaries of our Lord continually did say, namely, that these works were works of hell."
3. "The adversaries of our Lord continually did say, namely, that these works were works of hell."

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "This had been a hostile party of the ecclesiastics, who had come all the way from Jerusalem to collect materials for a charge against Him."
2. "Two things are here impliedâ€”first, that the bitterest enemies of our Lord were unable to deny the reality of His miracles; and next, that they believed in an organized infernal kingdom of evil, under one chief."
3. "Stung by the unsophisticated testimony of 'all the people,' they had no way of holding out against His claims but by the desperate shift of ascribing His miracles to Satan."

### John Calvin:
1. "The scribes cannot withhold the acknowledgment of a fact so open and manifest, and yet they maliciously carp at what Christ did by Divine power."
2. "Not only do they obscure the praise of the miracle, but endeavor to turn it into a reproach, as if it were performed by magical enchantment."
3. "The opinion expressed by the scribes, that there is a prince among wicked spirits, did not arise from a mistake of the common people, or from supposition, but from a conviction entertained among the godly, that the reprobate have a head, in the same manner as Christ is the Head of the Church."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "A public declaration of war against our Lord on the part of the Pharisees." 
2. "The Pharisees admit the miracles, but explain them in another way as the work of Satan."
3. "The sense: lord of the habitation, referring to rule over the possessed, agrees well with the phrase here added: 'the prince of demons.'"

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "The Pharisees feel that the excited condition of the crowds and the manifest disposition to believe that Jesus is the Messiah (the Son of David) demand strenuous action on their part."
2. "They cannot deny the fact of the miracles for the blind and dumb men both saw and spoke."
3. "So in desperation they suggest that Jesus works by the power of Beelzebub the prince of the demons."

### John Gill:
1. "They could not deny the miracle, or that it was one; but to deprive him of the glory of it, and even reproach him for it, and to bring him into contempt with the people, they not only speak of him in a scornful manner, 'this' sorry man, 'this' vile fellow; but ascribe the miracle he wrought to familiarity with the devil, to diabolical influence and skill in magic art."
2. "They pretended he was in confederacy with Satan, and was carrying on his interest: and therefore, that he might gain credit and reputation, the prince of devils suffered the inferior ones to remove at his word."
3. "Concerning Beelzebub, it being a prevailing notion among the Jews, that there is one devil who is the head of all the rest, and who is by them sometimes called Asmodeus... and sometimes Samael, who is styled Samael the prince, 'the king of devils'; and the angel Samael, the wicked, 'the head of all the Satans', or devils."

### John Wesley:
1. "The scribes who came down from Jerusalem accused Jesus of being possessed by Beelzebul, the prince of demons. This accusation reveals their deep-seated fear and resistance to Jesus' authority and power." 

2. "Jesus responds to their accusation by explaining the absurdity of Satan casting out Satan. He highlights the illogicality of their claim and exposes their hypocrisy in attributing his miraculous works to demonic forces." 

3. "In this verse, we see the clash between the kingdom of God and the kingdom of darkness. Jesus' authority and power threaten the established religious order, and the scribes' response is an attempt to discredit him and protect their own influence."
