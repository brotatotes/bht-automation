# Matthew 12:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In a hostile encounter with ecclesiastics who traveled from Jerusalem to challenge Him, Jesus faced a public declaration of war from the Pharisees.

Jesus exposed the inconsistency in their argument, demonstrating his authority over evil. This verse serves as a reminder that despite opposition, Jesus remains steadfast in his divine mission, displaying his power and authority.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "This had been a hostile party of the ecclesiastics, who had come all the way from Jerusalem to collect materials for a charge against Him."
2. "Two things are here implied - first, that the bitterest enemies of our Lord were unable to deny the reality of His miracles; and next, that they believed in an organized infernal kingdom of evil, under one chief."
3. "Stung by the unsophisticated testimony of 'all the people,' they had no way of holding out against His claims but by the desperate shift of ascribing His miracles to Satan."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "A public declaration of war against our Lord on the part of the Pharisees, and an answer to the question of the people."
2. "The Pharisees admit the miracles, but explain them in another way as the work of Satan. Consistency required this explanation."
3. "The word 'devil,' is applied to but one person in the Scriptures, namely, Satan."

### John Wesley:
1. "The scribes accused Jesus of being possessed by Beelzebul, the prince of demons. This accusation reveals their hardened hearts and their refusal to acknowledge Jesus as the Son of God." 

2. "Jesus responds to their accusation by pointing out the illogicality of Satan casting out Satan. He exposes the inconsistency in their argument and highlights the power and authority he possesses over the forces of evil."
