# Matthew 12:27 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse under consideration has caused much debate among commentators. Some have argued that the casting out of devils by the scholars or disciples of the Pharisees was real, while others believe it was merely a pretense. This discrepancy reveals the Pharisees' unjust and biased judgment, condemning in Christ what they praised in their own children. Nevertheless, regardless of the reality of these exorcisms, the existence of demoniacs in those times serves as a reminder that supernatural power alone is not a true test of truth.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The difficulty has arisen mainly from forgetting that miracles, as such, are no test of truth, but have been permitted to, and prophesied of, false religions and teachers."
2. "It is highly necessary to institute this enquiry as to the reality of their exorcisms: for it would leave an unworthy impression on the reader, and one very open to the cavils of unbelief, were we to sanction the idea that our Lord would have solemnly compared with his own miracles, and drawn inferences from, a system of imposture."
3. "The interpretation of this verse has been much disputed; viz. as to whether the casting out by the scholars, disciples; were real or pretended exorcisms."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "By whom do your children—"your sons," meaning here the "disciples" or pupils of the Pharisees, who were so termed after the familiar language of the Old Testament in speaking of the sons of the prophets." 
2. "Our Lord here seems to admit that such works were wrought by them in which case the Pharisees stood self-condemned."
3. "Therefore shall they be your judges."

### John Calvin:
1. "This inequality shows, that their prevailing motive was not a regard to what is just and right, but blind love or hatred; and that it was even an evidence of wicked self-love ( φιλαυτίας) and envy, to condemn in Christ what they praised in their own children."
2. "There is reason to believe, that no greater kindness would be exercised in judging of the disciples of Christ than of their Master; and to apply these words to the dead is a forced construction, when they manifestly denote a comparison of the present time."
3. "But if any one prefer to understand them differently, as reproaching them with the grace of God, which was sometimes exhibited through the Exorcists, I do not greatly object to that view."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "If casting out devils is an evidence of a league with Satan, then this holds good against your scholars who profess to do it also."
2. "Therefore they shall be your judges. They shall convict you of partiality."
3. "The existence of 'demoniacs' in those days is proof that supernatural power, of itself, is no test of truth."

### John Gill:
1. "Christ asks them, by whom they cast out devils? Whether by the Spirit of God, or by Beelzebub? They would doubtless say by the former, and not the latter, which would show their great partiality."
2. "Their children cast out devils, or pretended to do so, and it was by the help of Satan; and yet they ascribed it to a divine power, even though they made use of the name of Satan, under that of Beelzebub, or Asmodeus."
3. "Therefore they shall be your judges; who will rise up against you, and condemn you one day, for this unequal judgment you now pass; and which was just the reverse of the true state of the case."

### John Wesley:
1. "Ask them, if Satan will cast out Satan: let even them be judges in this matter."
2. "And they shall convict you of obstinacy and partiality, who impute that in me to Beelzebub, which in them you impute to God."
3. "The kingdom of God is come upon you - Unawares; before you expected: so the word implies."
