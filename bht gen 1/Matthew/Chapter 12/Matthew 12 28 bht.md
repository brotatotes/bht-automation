## Choicest Commentary Quotes:

2. "It does not seem to occur in this latter sense in the N.T."
3. "But Fritzsche’s dictum, ad Rom. 2:356, 'Alexandrinis scriptoribus φθάνειν nihil nisi venire, pervenire, pertinere valet,' certainly is not right; for we have it indisputably in the sense of to anticipate, prevent, 1 Thessalonians 4:15."
