# Matthew 12:29 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, Jesus is depicted as the stronger man who has come to bind and overcome Satan, the strong man. He enters into the world, which is perceived as Satan's house, and spoils his goods, representing the possessions of those held captive by the enemy. By doing so, Jesus demonstrates his power and authority over the forces of evil, setting humanity free from the bondage of sin and darkness. It is through his victory over Satan that Christ rescues and redeems humanity, leading them out of the dominion of the enemy and into the kingdom of God.
