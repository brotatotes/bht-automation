# Matthew 12:3 Commentary Help Text

In this verse, Jesus refers to the story of David to defend his disciples against the accusation of breaking the law. By highlighting David's hunger and the necessity of his actions, Jesus emphasizes that there are situations where fulfilling basic needs takes precedence over adhering strictly to the law. Furthermore, the mention of David's actions being recorded in Scripture implies that his example should have been known and understood by the Pharisees. This verse raises the question of balancing adherence to the law with compassion and mercy in specific circumstances.
