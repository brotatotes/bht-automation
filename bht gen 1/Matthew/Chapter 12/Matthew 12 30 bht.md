# Matthew 12:30 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, it is emphasized that there is no neutrality when it comes to following Jesus. The opposition between His kingdom and the kingdom of Satan is absolute, leaving no room for fence-sitters. One must actively gather souls to God, as not doing so is equivalent to scattering them away. Sentimental admiration without action is seen as inconsistent enmity. This verse speaks to the original enmity between the seed of the woman and the serpent, highlighting the contrasting roles of Christ as the good shepherd who gathers His sheep to Himself, and those who work against His mission.
