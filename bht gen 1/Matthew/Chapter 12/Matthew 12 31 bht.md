# Matthew 12:31 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we learn that all sins can find forgiveness from God, as no sin is considered unpardonable. Despite this, there is one exception - the blasphemy against the Holy Spirit. This particular sin involves attributing the works of the Holy Spirit to the devil, maliciously dishonoring God and opposing His glory. It is a sin of wilful and obstinate malice, denying the operation and doctrines of the Spirit with the purpose of gratifying one's own desires. This sin, unlike others, is deemed unforgivable both in the present age and the age to come.
