# Matthew 12:31 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, all sin, regardless of its severity, is assured forgiveness by God. No sin is seen as unpardonable. The only exception is the blasphemy against the Holy Spirit, which involves attributing the works of the Holy Spirit to the devil. This particular sin is without excuse and does not receive forgiveness. It is important to understand that the blasphemy against the Holy Spirit refers to a deliberate and malicious denying of the Spirit's work, opposing it out of malice and to gratify one's own desires.

2. "The sense is, that all kind of sin, whether committed more immediately against God, or man, the first or second table of the law, or against any of the divine precepts; be they sins small or great, secret or open, sins of heart, lip, or life, or attended with whatsoever aggravating circumstances; and all kind of blasphemy, or evil speaking of men, or of angels, or of the name of God, but what is hereafter excepted, there is forgiveness of in the grace of God, through the blood of Christ, even for all sorts of men and sinners whatever."
3. "But this is not excepted by Christ, only what follows, but the blasphemy against the Holy Ghost, shall not be forgiven unto men: by which is meant, not every ignorant denial of, and opposition to his deity and personality; nor all resistance of him in the external ministry of the word; nor every sin that is knowingly and wilfully committed; but it is a despiteful usage of the Spirit of grace, an opposing, contradicting, and denying the operations wrought, or doctrines revealed by him, against a man's own light and conscience, out of wilful and obstinate malice, on purpose to lessen the glory of God, and gratify his own lusts."
