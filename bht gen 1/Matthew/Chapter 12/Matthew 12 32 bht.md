## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Its unpardonableness cannot arise from anything in the nature of sin itself; for that would be a naked contradiction to the emphatic declaration of Mark 3:30, that all manner of sin is pardonable."
2. "It is a contrast between slandering 'the Son of man' in His veiled condition and unfinished work... and slandering the same blessed Person after the blaze of glory which the Holy Ghost was soon to throw around His claims."
3. "To blaspheme Christ in the former condition... left them still open to conviction on fuller light: but to blaspheme Him in the latter condition would be to hate the light the clearer it became, and resolutely to shut it out which, of course, precludes salvation."
