## BHT:
This verse describes the seriousness of blasphemy against the Holy Spirit. Commentators note that this sin is not forgivable, neither in this life nor in the afterlife. Blaspheming against the Son of Man, Jesus, may be pardoned if one truly repents, but speaking against the Holy Spirit carries severe consequences. It is a sin that hinders the possibility of salvation and subjects the offender to divine punishment both now and in the future.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Its unpardonableness cannot arise from anything in the nature of sin itself; for that would be a naked contradiction to the emphatic declaration that all manner of sin is pardonable."
2. "It is a contrast between slandering 'the Son of man' in His veiled condition and unfinished work... and slandering the same blessed Person after the blaze of glory which the Holy Ghost was soon to throw around His claims."
3. "To blaspheme Christ in the former condition left them still open to conviction on fuller light: but to blaspheme Him in the latter condition would be to hate the light the clearer it became, and resolutely to shut it out which, of course, precludes salvation."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The Holy Spirit" - This phrase emphasizes the divine nature of the Spirit, highlighting the sacredness and purity associated with Him.

2. "The Spirit - the holy" - This description further emphasizes the Spirit's holiness, underscoring the importance of revering and respecting Him.

3. "These words define more clearly the blasphemy against the Spirit" - This commentary suggests that understanding the holiness of the Spirit helps to clarify the severity of blaspheming against Him, indicating the gravity of this sin.

### John Calvin:
1. "There is no reason to expect that those who shall have blasphemed against the Spirit will obtain pardon in this life, or will be acquitted in the last judgment."
2. "The meaning therefore is: â€” 'There is no reason to expect that those who shall have blasphemed against the Spirit will obtain pardon in this life, or will be acquitted in the last judgment.'"
3. "To the dead, therefore, there remains no forgiveness, except as regards punishment; and surely they will not venture to deny that the subject of this discourse is guilt."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Whosoever speaketh a word, i.e., in passing, not as the result of a determined state of hostility, against the Son of man, against Christ in the form of a servant, through ignorance of His real glory, it shall be forgiven him. Even this great sin can be pardoned."
2. "But whosoever speaketh. The form indicates determined speaking, in the presence of light."
3. "Against the Holy Ghost. Not the Divine nature of Christ, but the third Person of the Trinity, as the Agent working in the hearts of men, without whom neither forgiveness nor holiness is possible."

### John Gill:
1. "By whom is meant, not any man, as Grotius thought, but the Lord Jesus Christ, so often called 'the son of man', on account of his human nature, in which he appeared in great meanness and obscurity."
2. "The sin against the Holy Ghost is such, as is not forgiven, neither before, nor at, nor after death, nor by it: all sins that are forgiven, are forgiven in this world, and that perfectly and at once."
3. "In short, the sense is, that the sin against the Holy Ghost never has forgiveness; it is not pardoned now, and consequently there will be no declaration of the pardon of it hereafter."

### John Wesley:
1. "Whosoever speaketh against the Son of man... It shall be forgiven him." - This quote highlights the possibility of forgiveness for those who speak against Jesus, as long as they truly repent.
2. "Whosoever speaketh thus against the Holy Ghost, it shall not be forgiven." - This quote emphasizes the severity of speaking against the Holy Spirit, as it is an unforgivable sin.
3. "He shall not escape the punishment of it, either in this world, or in the world to come." - This quote underscores the certainty that those who speak against the Holy Spirit will face divine judgment, both in this life and in the afterlife.
