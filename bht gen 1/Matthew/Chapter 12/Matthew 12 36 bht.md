# Matthew 12:36 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In a day of judgment, words will not be treated lightly, as they reveal the true character of individuals. These words, whether idle or morally useless, are not without consequences. Moreover, even light conversation and vain discourse, though seemingly harmless, will be taken into account. God pays heed to every word spoken and will hold individuals accountable for all discourses that do not bring glory to Him.
