# Matthew 12:36 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, Jesus reveals the significance and accountability of our words. Commentators describe "idle words" as morally useless, ineffectual, and lacking in purpose or edification. These words, even though they may seem harmless, will be taken into account in the day of judgment. Jesus emphasizes that our words reveal the true thoughts of our hearts and form a just basis for the interpretation of character. Therefore, we should be cautious and serious in our speech, ensuring that our words align with the glory of God.
