# Matthew 12:37 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the power and significance of our words are emphasized. Commentators highlight that our words have the ability to justify or condemn us, revealing our true character and faith. The verse challenges us to examine whether our words, spoken from the heart, confess or deny our belief in Christ. Ultimately, our words will be used as evidence to determine our righteousness and whether we will be acquitted or condemned on the day of judgment.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "For by thy words thou shalt be justified, declared righteous, acquitted, not made righteous."
2. "The index of character will be the words, not hypocritical ones, although even these speedily reveal their true character, but those coming from the heart."
3. "This general principle, far exceeding 'the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees,' concludes this discourse. Its awful statements challenge every one: Are you with Christ or against Him; do your words, coming from the heart, confess or deny Him."

### John Wesley:
1. "Your words as well as actions shall he produced in evidence for or against you, to prove whether you was a true believer or not."
2. "By thy words, as well as thy tempers and works, thou shalt then be either acquitted or condemned."
