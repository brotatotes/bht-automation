# Matthew 12:37 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the commentators emphasize the significance of our words as indications of our true character and beliefs. Our words reflect what is within our hearts and serve as evidence for or against us in the day of judgment. Pure and righteous speech demonstrates a heart that is right with God, while wicked and false speech reveals a heart that is wrong. Our words, along with our actions, will be used to determine whether we will be justified or condemned. It is our words that will ultimately be brought forth as evidence in the great day of judgment.
