# Matthew 12:38 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The commentators shed light on a scene where scribes and Pharisees confront Jesus, demanding a sign from heaven to prove his validity. Their audacious request stems from a lack of faith and a desire for tangible proof. Jesus, however, exposes their misconception, emphasizing that true faith is not built on external signs but on trust in God's word. The demand for a sign reveals a misunderstanding of miracles, which are meant to confirm the message of God's kingdom, not as proofs of God's existence.
