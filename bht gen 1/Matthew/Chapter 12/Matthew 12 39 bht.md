# Matthew 12:39 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The relationship between Jesus and the covenant-people is compared to that of a treacherous wife departing from her husband, highlighting the unfaithfulness of the people. Seeking a sign is seen as a reflection of the prevailing unbelief and apostasy of the generation, who are likened to adulterers. Jesus, instead, offers the sign of the prophet Jonah as a reminder of the upcoming death and resurrection, calling for repentance and a focus on the message rather than signs.
