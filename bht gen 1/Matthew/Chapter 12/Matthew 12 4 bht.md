# Matthew 12:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we see a unique situation where someone not ordained as a priest, namely David and his men, partakes of the showbread that is typically reserved for the priests. The commentator notes that David's actions served as a precedent, indicating that it was not criminal for someone in distress to obtain necessary provisions, even if they were not priests. The showbread itself symbolized the communion between God and humanity, represented by the twelve loaves that represented the twelve tribes of Israel. This event occurred in the tabernacle before the construction of the temple.
