# Matthew 12:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, we see that a man, considered to be after God's own heart, asks and receives provisions from the high priest, even though it was against the law. This incident occurred during the time of Abiathar the high priest. The shew-bread, symbolizing the communion of God with men, was placed on a table in the holy place. David's visit to the house of God, the tabernacle, most likely happened on the Sabbath when the old loaves were being replaced. The twelve loaves represented the twelve tribes of Israel and were to be eaten by the priests.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "No example could be more apposite than this. The man after God's own heart, of whom the Jews ever boasted, when suffering in God's cause and straitened for provisions, asked and obtained from the high priest what, according to the law, it was illegal for anyone save the priests to touch."
2. "Yet there is not a little confusion in what is said of these priests in different parts of the Old Testament. Thus he is called both the son of the father of Ahimelech (1 Samuel 22:20; 2 Samuel 8:17); and Ahimelech is called Ahiah (1 Samuel 14:3), and Abimelech (1 Chronicles 18:16)."
3. "Mark (Mark 2:26) says this occurred 'in the days of Abiathar the high priest.' But this means not during his high priesthood—for it was under that of his father Ahimelech—but simply, in his time."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The shew-bread. Twelve loaves were placed in rows upon a table in the holy place, as a symbol of the communion of God with men." 
2. "David probably came on the day the old loaves were taken away, i.e., on the Sabbath; which makes the case very appropriate."
3. "Principle: Works of necessity have always been permitted on the Sabbath."

### John Wesley:
1. "He entered into the house of God - Into the tabernacle. The temple was not yet built." 
2. "The show bread - So they called the bread which the priest, who served that week, put every Sabbath day on the golden table that was in the holy place, before the Lord." 
3. "The loaves were twelve in number, and represented the twelve tribes of Israel: when the new were brought, the stale were taken away, but were to be eaten by the priests only."
