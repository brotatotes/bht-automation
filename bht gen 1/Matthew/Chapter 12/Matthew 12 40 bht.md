# Matthew 12:40 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This verse depicts a remarkable event that parallels Jonah's experience with being swallowed by a sea monster and spending three days and nights in its belly. Similar to Jonah, Jesus becomes a sign to his generation, and his resurrection after three days is a powerful indication of his divine mission. The mention of a sea monster underscores the immense size and power of the creature involved. The phrase "after three days and three nights" is a Jewish expression for three natural days, with any part of a day being counted as a whole.
