# Matthew 12:41 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, there is a reference to a sign, a way in which He should be a sign to this generation. The preaching of the Son of Man by His Spirit will be a sign, just as Jonas preached to the Ninevites. The Ninevites, though heathens, repented at a man's preaching, while God's covenant-people did not repent at the preaching of the Son of God. The men of Nineveh will rise as witnesses and their repentance will condemn this generation who did not repent even when a greater person than Jonas was in their midst.
