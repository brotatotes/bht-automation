# Matthew 12:41 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse describes a powerful sign given to a generation, where the preaching of the Son of Man, through His Apostles, is compared to the preaching of Jonah to the Ninevites. It highlights the contrast between the repentance of the Ninevites, who were heathens, and the lack of repentance among God's covenant-people. This comparison underscores the supreme dignity of the Son of God, whose preaching should have brought forth repentance from His chosen people. The verse also suggests a future judgment, where the Ninevites will stand as witnesses against the current generation, further emphasizing the significance of their repentance.

### John Calvin:
1. "Ungodly men, who never had heard a word of the true God, repented at the voice of an unknown and foreign person who came to them; while this country, which is the sanctuary of heavenly doctrine, hears not the Son of God, and the promised Redeemer."
2. "If they had beheld Christ with pure eyes, they must have acknowledged, not only that he was a teacher sent from heaven, but that he was the Messiah, and the promised Author of Salvation."
