# Matthew 12:42 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
A woman of great curiosity and devotion, the Queen of Sheba embarked on an epic journey from a far-off land, crossing the sea to seek the wisdom of King Solomon. Her arrival, from a remote and exotic kingdom, left her in awe of the king's wisdom and inspired her to offer him abundant riches. It is a poignant contrast that, while this foreign queen recognized the greatness of Solomon's wisdom, an even greater Teacher, Jesus, was rejected by his own people, leaving them condemned in the judgment.
