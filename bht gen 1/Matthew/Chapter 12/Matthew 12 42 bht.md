# Matthew 12:42 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the Bible verse being described, a queen from a remote country journeyed a great distance, crossing the sea to meet Solomon, a wise and gifted man. Her arrival from the uttermost parts of the earth astounded her, yet ironically, a generation in the presence of someone greater than Solomon rejected and despised him. In the future judgment, this queen will serve as a witness, condemning the generation for their missed opportunity to seek wisdom from the Messiah, surpassing even Solomon in greatness.
