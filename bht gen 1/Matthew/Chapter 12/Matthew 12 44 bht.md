# Matthew 12:44 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
After being delivered from the demonic influence, the person finds themselves in a state of emptiness, devoid of God's presence, and lacking virtues like love and humility. Their spiritual condition is described as garnished with levity and false security, which stands in stark contrast to the true peace and fulfillment that can only be found in a relationship with God. The verse highlights the danger of departing from God and the potential for one's state to become even worse than before.
