# Matthew 12:45 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This verse describes the consequences of falling from grace and rejecting Christ. It warns that if we turn away, we subject ourselves to the cruelty of Satan, with our state becoming worse than before. The verse emphasizes the importance of genuine and steadfast faith, as without it, we become susceptible to the influence of the enemy. Apostates who forsake God and return to a life of sin rarely find redemption, resulting in eternal damnation. The verse uses the imagery of seven spirits, symbolizing a large number or a state of perfection, to illustrate the severity of the situation.

### John Calvin:
1. "By these words Christ shows that if we fall from his grace, our subjection to Satan is doubled, so that he treats us with greater cruelty than before, and that this is the just punishment of our slothfulness." (149)
2. "Let us not then suppose that the devil has been vanquished by a single combat, because he has once gone out of us. On the contrary, let us remember that, as his lodgment within us was of old standing, ever since we were born, he has knowledge and experience of all the approaches by which he may reach us." (150)
3. "We must, therefore, endeavor that Christ, holding his reign within us, may block up all the entrances of his adversary. Whatever may be the fierceness or violence of Satan’s attacks, they ought not to intimidate the sons of God, whom the invincible power of the Holy Spirit preserves in safety."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The last state of that man is worse than the first." - This verse is applied directly to the Jews, highlighting their rejection of Christ and the terrible and infatuated condition they were left in.

### John Gill:
1. "This is said in allusion to, and in imitation of the seven spirits before the throne; or may denote a large number of devils, seven being a number of perfection."
