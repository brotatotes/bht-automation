# Matthew 12:45 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, we see a warning about the dangers of external religious reform without true spiritual transformation. The commentators emphasize the deteriorating effect of this empty religious practice, leading to a state worse than before. They speak of the tempting influence of evil on the Jewish people, who exchange idolatry for a seemingly reformed but empty state. The consequences of such apostasy are dire, as the wickedness becomes more pernicious and the end result is eternal damnation. This verse exposes the need for genuine and lasting spiritual change, not just superficial appearances.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Philip Schaff:
1. "The first possession, the early idolatrous tendency of the Jews; the going out, the result of the captivity in Babylon; the emptying, sweeping, and garnishing at their return (Pharisaism, a seeming reformation, but really an invitation to evil influences); the last state, the terrible and infatuated condition of the Jews after they had rejected Christ." 
2. "A process of deterioration, with occasional vicissitudes and fluctuations, but resulting in a state far worse than any that had gone before it."
3. "The Reformation, the casting out of the first evil spirit of idolatry, permitted by Rome, the house 'empty, swept, and garnished: swept and garnished by the decencies of civilization and discoveries of secular knowledge, but empty of living and earnest faith'; the repossession, the final development of the man of sin."
4. "External reformation without permanent spiritual results, leading to a 'worse state.'"

### John Gill:
1. "More wicked than himself, as these are more pernicious to man, than the devil himself."
2. "Leaving their seeming religion and holiness, they return like the dog to the vomit, and the swine to the wallowing in the mire."
3. "Such apostates generally are more extravagant in sinning, and are seldom or ever recovered by repentance, and their last end is eternal damnation."

### John Wesley:
1. "Seven other spirits - That is, a great many; a certain number being put for an uncertain: More wicked than himself." 
2. "Whence it appears, that there are degrees of wickedness among the devils themselves." 
3. "They enter in and dwell - For ever in him who is forsaken of God."
