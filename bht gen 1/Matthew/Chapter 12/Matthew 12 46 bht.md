# Matthew 12:46 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we see Jesus surrounded by a multitude who sat around Him, while His mother and brethren stood outside. Some commentators suggest that His brethren were actually His kinsmen, the sons of Mary, his mother's sister. The incident reveals the tension and misunderstanding Jesus faced, as some thought He was beside Himself. Despite this, Jesus remained focused on His mission, not being deterred by the Pharisees' false accusations and the concerns of His family.
