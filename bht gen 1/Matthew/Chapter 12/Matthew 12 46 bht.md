# Matthew 12:46 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, we see Jesus being passionately dedicated to His mission, seemingly unaffected by worldly concerns like food and rest. The people around Him viewed His behavior as peculiar and even questioned His state of mind. The crowd gathered around Him, while His own family, including His brethren, stood outside, seeking to take hold of Him. This incident reveals the tension and misinterpretation that existed between Jesus and His own family, as they struggled to understand His purpose and actions.
