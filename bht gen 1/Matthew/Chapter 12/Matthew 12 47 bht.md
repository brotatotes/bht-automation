# Matthew 12:47 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the midst of His powerful teachings, Jesus faces an interruption from his family. The commentators suggest that this interruption may have been an attempt to distract Jesus or test his loyalty to his mission. However, Jesus seizes this opportunity to convey a profound lesson, demonstrating his unwavering commitment and spiritual purpose. The verse, though debated in terms of its authenticity, can also be found in other Gospels, further augmenting our understanding of the incident. It serves as a reminder that even those closest to Jesus may not fully comprehend his divine mission.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Absorbed in the awful warnings He was pouring forth, He felt this to be an unseasonable interruption, fitted to dissipate the impression made upon the large audience." 
2. "Such an interruption as duty to the nearest relatives did not require Him to give way to." 
3. "But instead of a direct rebuke, He seizes on the incident to convey a sublime lesson, expressed in a style of inimitable condescension."

### Philip Schaff:

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "This verse is omitted by several ancient manuscripts and scholars, suggesting that it may have been added later in Matthew's Gospel." 
2. "The presence of this verse in Mark and Luke suggests that it was likely copied into Matthew from one of these Gospels." 
3. "While its authenticity may be questioned, this verse can still be found in Mark 3:32 and Luke 8:20, providing additional context and understanding."

### John Gill:
1. "Whether this message was carried at the request of the mother and brethren of Christ, and delivered in a simple manner, and with an honest intention; or whether it was officiously done, and with a design to interrupt him, and to try him, whether he would prefer his natural relations, and their society and conversation, to the spiritual work in which he was engaged, in doing good to the souls of men, is not certain."

2. "The latter seems probable, from the following words, and conduct of Christ."

3. "Some copies read, 'desiring to see thee'."
