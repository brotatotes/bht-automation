# Matthew 12:48 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this passage, Jesus teaches us that our relationship with Him transcends earthly ties. He places His disciples and believers in the position of His mother and brethren, emphasizing the spiritual bond that surpasses mere flesh and blood. By disclaiming His natural relatives who oppose His heavenly Father's will and acknowledging His spiritual relations who obey it, Jesus shows the highest severity and goodness. He invites us to behold Him through the eyes of faith and to realize that in Him, we find the closest union and oneness.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### John Calvin:
1. "At the same time, by disparaging the relationship of flesh and blood, our Lord teaches a very useful doctrine; for he admits all his disciples and all believers to the same honorable rank, as if they were his nearest relatives, or rather he places them in the room of his mother and brethren."
2. "He tells us also, that there is no tie of relationship more sacred than spiritual relationship, because we ought not to think of him according to the flesh, but according to the power of his Spirit which he has received from the Father to renew men."
3. "To sum up the whole, this passage, first, teaches us to behold Christ with the eyes of faith; and, secondly, it informs us, that every one who is regenerated by the Spirit, and gives himself up entirely to God for true justification, is thus admitted to the closest union with Christ, and becomes one with him."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Implying, not contempt nor carelessness, but that the family relation in His case was peculiar." 
2. "He was more than man, or was not justified in thus speaking." 
3. "The question 'Who is my mother?' is not meant to diminish the importance of family, but to emphasize the spiritual bond that Jesus shares with His followers."

### John Gill:
1. "These questions are put, not as if he himself was ignorant who were his mother or his brethren; or as suggesting as if he had none; or as denying that these were in such a relation to him; or as casting any slight upon them; or as intending to teach men disrespect to parents and kindred, according to the flesh."

2. "But as displeased with the man, or men, for interrupting him in his work; and to let them know, that the business of his heavenly Father was preferred by him to any his natural relations could have with him."

3. "And that he might have an opportunity of pointing out who were his relations in a spiritual sense."

### John Wesley:
1. "See the highest severity, and the highest goodness!"
2. "Severity to his natural, goodness to his spiritual relations!"
3. "In a manner disclaiming the former, who opposed the will of his heavenly Father, and owning the latter, who obeyed it."
