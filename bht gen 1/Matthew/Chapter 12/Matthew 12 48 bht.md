# Matthew 12:48 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This Bible verse, rich with commentary from Philip Schaff, John Gill, and John Wesley, delves into Jesus' unique family relation and his divine identity. The questions Jesus poses, "Who is my mother? and who are my brethren?", are not meant to demean his earthly family but to prioritize his heavenly Father's work. Jesus, in his words, showcases both severity and goodness, disclaiming those who opposed God's will and embracing those who obeyed it. Through these questions, Jesus reveals his profound understanding of his divine mission and spiritual relations.
