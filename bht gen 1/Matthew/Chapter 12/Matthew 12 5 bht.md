# Matthew 12:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we see a potential contradiction between the actions of the priests in the temple and the strict observance of the Sabbath. The priests are tasked with important duties and offerings on the Sabbath, which raises questions about whether their actions can be considered Sabbath-breaking. Furthermore, the verse highlights the authority of Jesus, implying that if even the temple could supersede the Sabbath, then surely Jesus himself holds even greater authority over it.
