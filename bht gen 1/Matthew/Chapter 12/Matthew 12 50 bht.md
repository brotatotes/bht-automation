# Matthew 12:50 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we see the importance of submitting to the will of God and becoming part of the family of Christ. It goes beyond a mere profession and requires obedience to the heavenly Father. Being a disciple means having a close and loving relationship with Jesus, even if we have not seen him on earth. This relationship transcends earthly connections and is based on faith and the good news of the Gospel. Christ's followers are bound together in a union that mirrors the natural relations we experience, but on a deeper and more spiritual level.
