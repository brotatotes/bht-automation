# Matthew 12:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In a certain place, a figure exists that surpasses the grandeur and significance of the temple. This figure is none other than Christ Himself, the Lord and rightful owner of the temple. His authority and importance exceed that of the physical structure. Just as the temple and its service excused the priests from blame for Sabbath violations, so too does the presence of Jesus and His disciples justify their actions. Moreover, their act of satisfying hunger is deemed more important than the service of the priests, underscoring their higher purpose and mission.

"If the priests in the temple and for the temple’s sake, for its service and ritual, profane the Sabbath, as ye account profanation, and are blameless, how much more these disciples who have grown hungry in their appointed following of Him who is greater than the temple, the true Temple of God on earth, the Son of Man!"
3. "It seems to me, as above, to bear a more general and sublime sense than the masculine."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "One greater [μειζων]. The correct reading makes the adjective neuter, so that the right rendering is something greater (Rev., in margin)."
2. "The reference is, of course, to Christ himself (compare vv. 41, 42, where the neuter pleion, more (so Rev., in margin), is used in the same way)."
3. "The indefiniteness of the neuter gives a more solemn and impressive sense."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "That which is greater, not some one greater; the comparison with the temple occasions this form, although the reference is undoubtedly to Christ Himself."
