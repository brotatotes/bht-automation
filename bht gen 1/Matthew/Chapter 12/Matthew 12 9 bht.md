# Matthew 12:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this passage, Jesus challenges the religious leaders' strict interpretation of the Sabbath law and asserts his authority over it. By healing the man with the withered hand, Jesus demonstrates that acts of mercy and compassion should never be hindered by legalistic rules. This miracle not only physically restores the man, but also highlights Jesus' concern for the marginalized and his desire to restore wholeness. It serves as a reminder that true worship and obedience come from a heart open to God's love and compassion, rather than simply following external rituals.

1. "He had now, no doubt, arrived in Galilee; but this, it would appear, did not occur at Capernaum, for after it was over, He 'withdrew Himself,' it is said 'to the sea' (Mark 3:7), whereas Capernaum was at the sea."

3. "They were now come to the length of dogging His steps, to collect materials for a charge of impiety against Him. It is probable that it was to their thoughts rather than their words that Jesus addressed Himself in what follows."
