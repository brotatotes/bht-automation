# Matthew 13:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
By the seaside, Jesus finds a place of peace and tranquility, away from the noise of daily life. He actively goes out to engage with people, teaching us the importance of meeting others where they are. This transition in Jesus' ministry sets the stage for delivering important teachings and parables. Shortly after casting out a demon, Jesus seeks both refreshment and an opportunity to preach near the Lake of Galilee, addressing the blasphemy of the religious leaders.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Jesus often sought solitude by the seaside, away from the crowds and the noise of daily life. This act of going to the seaside can be seen as a metaphor for finding a place of peace and tranquility in our own lives." 

2. "By sitting by the seaside, Jesus demonstrates his willingness to meet people where they are. He doesn't wait for them to come to him, but actively goes out to engage with them. This teaches us the importance of reaching out to others and meeting them in their own contexts." 

3. "The seaside is a place of transition, where the land meets the water. In a similar way, Jesus' presence by the seaside signifies a transition in his ministry, as he prepares to deliver important teachings and parables to the people gathered there."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "On that day. Probably, but not certainly, the same day. The interval was brief in any case." 
2. "Out of the house. If a particular house is meant, that in which 'his mother and brethren' sought Him." 
3. "The sea-side, the shore of the Lake of Galilee."

### John Gill:
1. "The reason of his going out of the house was, either to converse with his mother and brethren, as they desired; or to withdraw himself from company, and take some refreshment by the sea side; or because it would not hold the people, and therefore he quitted it for a more convenient place."
2. "The time he went out of it, was the same day he had cast the devil out of the man blind and dumb, and had delivered himself so freely concerning the Scribes and Pharisees, who had blasphemously ascribed that miracle to the assistance of Satan."
3. "And sat by the sea side; either as weary, and for his refreshment, or in order to preach to the people."
