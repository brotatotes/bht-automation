# Matthew 13:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse being described speaks of the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, which are divine revelations and gospel truths revealed to those advanced in faith. These truths are both revealed and concealed through parables, captivating those who appreciate spiritual things while providing temporary entertainment to those who are indifferent. This knowledge is a gift from God, given to some and withheld from others. Understanding the mysteries of the kingdom requires the grace of God and is not acquired through human effort.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "The word 'mysteries' in Scripture is not used in its classical sense - of religious secrets, nor yet of things incomprehensible, or in their own nature difficult to be understood - but in the sense of things of purely divine revelation."
2. "'The mysteries of the kingdom of heaven,' then, mean those glorious Gospel truths which at that time only the more advanced disciples could appreciate, and they but partially."
3. "Parables serve the double purpose of revealing and concealing; presenting 'the mysteries of the kingdom' to those who know and relish them, though in never so small a degree, in a new and attractive light; but to those who are insensible to spiritual things yielding only, as so many tales, some temporary entertainment."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "A gift of God, is here said to be bestowed on one class of hearers (you), and not bestowed on another (them)."
2. "Without this gift there could not be proper knowledge of the truth to be conveyed by the parable."
3. "The mysteriousness arises mainly from the sinful state of man; yet God for wise purposes often withholds the revelation without which these things remain 'mysteries.'"

### John Gill:
1. "Christ was always ready to give an answer to his inquiring disciples, concerning his ministry, and his conduct in it; which shows great respect to them, and condescension in him."
2. "To know and understand the great truths of the Gospel, spiritually, savingly, and experimentally, is not from nature, or to be acquired by men's industry, but is the gift of God's grace, flowing from his sovereign will and pleasure."
3. "Our Lord, who was privy to the secret and sovereign dispensation of God, who, of his own will and pleasure, had determined to give a spiritual and saving knowledge of divine things to some, and deny it to others, made this the rule of his conduct in his ministry."

### John Wesley:
1. "To you, who have, it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven." 
2. "The deep things which flesh and blood cannot reveal, pertaining to the inward, present kingdom of heaven."
3. "Therefore speak I in parables, that ye may understand, while they do not understand."
