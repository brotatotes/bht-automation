# Matthew 13:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, Jesus speaks in parables to reveal the truth and mysteries of His Kingdom, allowing those who understand with their hearts to receive even more knowledge. The purpose of these parables is to hide the meaning from the hard-hearted and sensual. By valuing and cherishing the grace and knowledge of God, we are rewarded with an abundance, while those who do not appreciate or use it will have even what they possess taken away. The growth of our spiritual understanding is a continuous process, fueled by God's desire to bring us to perfection.

### Henry Alford:
1. "By it, he who hath, he who not only hears with the ear, but understands with the heart, has more given to him; and it is for this main purpose undoubtedly that the Lord spoke parables: to be to His Church revelations of the truth and mysteries of His Kingdom."
2. "But His present purpose in speaking them, as further explained below, was the quality possessed by them, and declared in the latter part of this verse, of hiding their meaning from the hard-hearted and sensual."
3. "No practical comment on the latter part of this saying can be more striking, than that which is furnished to our day by the study of the German rationalistic (and, I may add, some of our English harmonistic) Commentators; while at the same time we may rejoice to see the approximate fulfilment of the former in such commentaries as those of Olshausen, Neander, Stier, and Trench."

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
