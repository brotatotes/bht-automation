# Matthew 13:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, Jesus speaks in parables to a people who have the capability to see, hear, and understand, but fail to utilize these faculties effectively. He refrains from imparting further knowledge because they have not made use of what they already possess. The people are unable to truly see, hear, or understand anything, demonstrating a lack of engagement and comprehension. Jesus employs parables to convey his message to this audience, who are seers but not seers, hearers but not hearers in a true sense.
