# Matthew 13:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this particular Bible verse, the commentators shed light on the reason why Jesus speaks to the people in parables. They point out that the paradoxical form of the parables serves to reveal the true state of the people, who have the ability to see and hear but fail to truly perceive and understand. Jesus speaks in this abstruse and figurative manner to emphasize the contrast between those who are "seers and not seers" and "hearers and not hearers," highlighting the importance of utilizing the knowledge and understanding that one already possesses.
