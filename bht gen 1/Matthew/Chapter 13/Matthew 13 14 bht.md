2. "Let it be held as a fixed principle, that God enlightens to salvation, and that by a peculiar gift, those whom He has freely chosen; and that all the reprobate are deprived of the light of life, whether God withholds his word from them, or keeps their eyes and ears closed, that they do not hear or see."

2. "Your spiritual senses are shut up; yea, you have closed your eyes against the light; as being unwilling to understand the things of God."
