# Matthew 13:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse being described speaks of a people whose ears are heavy, sealing up their eyes as a punishment. It portrays their state of being deaf and blind, expressing a judgment of God and a consequence of their own willfulness. Their hearts have become dull and their understanding lost, resulting in a profound blindness and hardness. This punishment, intended to bring about repentance, reflects a persistent course of action by the people and reveals God's plan to hold them accountable for their contemptuous rejection.
