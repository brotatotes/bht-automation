# Matthew 13:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse described here highlights the consequences of a stubborn refusal to acknowledge the truth. It underscores the idea that this persistent course of action results in closed eyes and a limited understanding. The verse also suggests that those who choose not to act in accordance with what they know eventually find themselves unable to do so. The use of parables in this context signifies the existence of a state of affairs that serves both as a consequence and a punishment for this behavior.
