# Matthew 13:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, we learn that the disciples were extremely blessed and favored, greater than any in the old times, as they were granted knowledge and insight into the mysteries of grace that even the most righteous men of the past longed for. The verse speaks of the mixed character of the kingdom in its present state, where true believers and false professors coexist until the final judgment. It emphasizes that the disciples' privilege exceeded even the desire of those who came before them, as they had a clearer, more personal, and profound experience of Christ's teachings and miracles.

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Not only were the disciples blessed above the blinded just spoken of, but favored above the most honored and the best that lived under the old economy, who had but glimpses of the things of the new kingdom, just sufficient to kindle in them desires not to be fulfilled to any in their day."
2. "The subject of both these parables—which teach the same truth, with a slight diversity of aspect—is: THE MIXED CHARACTER OF THE KINGDOM IN ITS PRESENT STATE, AND THE FINAL ABSOLUTE SEPARATION OF THE TWO CLASSES."
3. "The parable of the wheat and the tares illustrates the mixed character of the kingdom in its present state, where true believers and false professors coexist until the final judgment."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "They were permitted to see and know what had been denied even to inspired and good men who longed for such knowledge."
2. "Righteous men, not merely according to the law, but who longed for something higher, with the anticipative faith here implied."
3. "The privilege of the disciples exceeded not only the privilege but even the desire of these good men of former times. Hence all was of grace."

### John Gill:
1. "To see Christ in the flesh, and have a clearer insight into the knowledge of the mysteries of grace, were things very desirable to men of the highest class in church and state."
2. "These indeed had a sight of Christ, but a very distant one; they saw him afar off in the promises and prophecies of him; and not very clearly, but through dark types and cloudy sacrifices."
3. "The disciples saw him in person, heard him preach, took in the evidence of his miracles, and felt the power of his doctrines, and spiritually and savingly understood them."
