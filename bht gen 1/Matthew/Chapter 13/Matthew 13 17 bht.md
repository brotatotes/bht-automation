# Matthew 13:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we are shown the mixed nature of the kingdom of God, where good and evil coexist until the final judgment. The disciples are privileged to have a deeper understanding of the things of the new kingdom, surpassing even the knowledge and desire of righteous men from the past. This highlights the importance of discernment and patience in navigating the complexities of the present state of the kingdom. We see that the disciples' privileged insight is an act of grace.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Not only were the disciples blessed above the blinded just spoken of, but favored above the most honored and the best that lived under the old economy, who had but glimpses of the things of the new kingdom, just sufficient to kindle in them desires not to be fulfilled to any in their day."
2. "The subject of both these parables—which teach the same truth, with a slight diversity of aspect—is: THE MIXED CHARACTER OF THE KINGDOM IN ITS PRESENT STATE, AND THE FINAL ABSOLUTE SEPARATION OF THE TWO CLASSES."
3. "The parable of the Wheat and the Tares emphasizes the coexistence of good and evil in the kingdom of God until the final judgment, highlighting the importance of discernment and patience in dealing with the mixed character of the present state of the kingdom."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "They were permitted to see and know what had been denied even to inspired and good men who longed for such knowledge."
2. "Righteous men, not merely according to the law, but who longed for something higher, with the anticipative faith here implied."
3. "The privilege of the disciples exceeded not only the privilege but even the desire of these good men of former times. Hence all was of grace."
