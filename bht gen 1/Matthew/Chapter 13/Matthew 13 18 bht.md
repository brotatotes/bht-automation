# Matthew 13:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Hear, in your hearts, ye who are so highly favored, the true meaning of these parables. Our Lord's explanation is to guide us in the interpretation of other parables. He does not say: it teaches this general principle, nor does He give a significance to all the objects and actions which may be linked with sowing in a grain-field. Hear ye therefore the parable of the sower. Know ye not this parable? Do ye not understand the meaning of it, so easy to be taken in? How then will ye know all parables?
