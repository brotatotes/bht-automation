# Matthew 13:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Bible verse being described is a parable of the sower, in which the grace of God and the receptivity of man work together to bring forth fruit. The success or failure of the seed is dependent on its reception, and the outcome varies depending on the condition of the soil. It is a warning that the doctrine of the Gospel is not always fruitful in every heart, and that personal knowledge and understanding of these spiritual truths are crucial for disciples to comprehend and interpret other parables.
