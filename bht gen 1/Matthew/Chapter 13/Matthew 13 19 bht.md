# Matthew 13:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this parable, the spoken word takes center stage, emphasizing its significance during the Apostolic age. The seed represents the Gospel, specifically the word of the kingdom, which introduces beliefs about the Messiah and his kingdom. The impact of this word varies. Some listeners are careless and inattentive, letting it pass away without affecting their hearts or minds. Others, influenced by the wicked one, have their focus shifted, hindering their ability to consider and truly understand the word. This parable highlights the importance of active engagement and careful consideration of the word to bear fruit in one's faith.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Philip Schaff:
1. "The spoken word is made most prominent, as this was almost the only means used in the Apostolic age, to which this parable primarily refers."
2. "Active, personal apprehension is involved."
3. "Almost during the act of hearing. This is done through 'birds,' passing thoughts and desires; the purpose being 'lest they should believe and be saved'."

### John Gill:
1. "By the 'seed' in the parable is meant the Gospel, called the 'word of the kingdom': because it treats of the king Messiah, of his person, office, and grace; and of his kingdom, and the administration of it by him, under the present dispensation." 

2. "He is one that is careless and inattentive, negligent and forgetful; has some slight notions of things as he hears, but these pass away as they come; his affections are not at all touched, nor his judgment informed by them, but remains as stupid, and as unconcerned as ever."

3. "This evil spirit, as soon as ever he observes one hearing the word, especially that has not been used to attend, comes immediately, and, as he is hearing, catcheth away that which is sown in his heart: not the grace of God, which being once implanted in the heart, can never be taken away by Satan; but the word which was sown, not in his understanding, in a spiritual sense, nor even in his affections, so as to love it, delight, and take pleasure in it; much less in his heart, so as to become the engrafted word able to save, or so as to believe in it, and in Christ revealed by it."

### John Wesley:
1. "When any one heareth the word, and considereth it not — The first and most general cause of unfruitfulness."
2. "The wicked one cometh — Either inwardly; filling the mind with thoughts of other things; or by his agent."
3. "Such are all they that introduce other subjects, when men should be considering what they have heard."
