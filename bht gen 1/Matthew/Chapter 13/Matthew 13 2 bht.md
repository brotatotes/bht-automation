# Matthew 13:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we see a vibrant scene unfold as a multitude of people gather on the shore, eager to listen to Jesus' teachings. Standing on the beach, their anticipation and readiness are apparent. Meanwhile, Jesus, aware of the overwhelming crowd, seeks refuge in a boat, creating a physical barrier that allows him to speak clearly and comfortably. The boat becomes a platform from which he imparts his wisdom, while the people on the shore demonstrate their commitment to learning and their eagerness to receive his teachings.
