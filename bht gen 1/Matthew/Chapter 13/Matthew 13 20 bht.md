# Matthew 13:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse being described talks about someone who initially receives the word of God with joy and excitement, perhaps even being captivated by its beauty and truth. However, there is a lack of depth in their response, as they lack true spiritual transformation and have a hidden hardness of heart. Although there may be signs of growth, it is only temporary because their heart remains unchanged and they are ultimately hindered in their spiritual journey.

### John Gill:
1. "Such a hearer, who is like to the stony ground on which the seed fell, is one that is not an accidental hearer of the word, as the former, but a settled constant hearer of it."
2. "He is one that not only constantly attends upon it, but he receives it; he gives an assent to it, he believes in it historically, makes a profession of his faith in it, and holds it for a while, being under some convictions of the truth of it."
3. "But has no heart work, and so is like to the rock in stony ground; the natural hardness of his heart continues, it remains unbroken by the word, without any true sense of sin, and repentance for it, and destitute of spiritual life, and of true faith, love, and joy."

### John Wesley:
1. "The seed sown on stony places, therefore sprang up soon, because it did not sink deep." - This quote highlights the reason for the quick growth of the seed on stony ground, emphasizing the lack of depth for the roots to take hold.
