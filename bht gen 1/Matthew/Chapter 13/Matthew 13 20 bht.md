# Matthew 13:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse in question speaks of a hearer who initially receives the word with joy, drawn by the beauty and truth it offers. However, this response may be rooted in a superficial level, lacking the depth and true transformation necessary for endurance. This hearer's reception of the word is described as being like a seed sown on stony ground, sprouting quickly but lacking deep roots. It emphasizes the need for genuine heart work and the sustaining grace of God.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### John Calvin:
1. "Temporary faith, being a sort of vegetation of the seed, promises at first some fruit; but their hearts are not so properly and thoroughly subdued, as to have the softness necessary for their continued nourishment."
2. "We see too many of this class in our own day, who eagerly embrace the Gospel, and shortly afterwards fall off; for they have not the lively affection that is necessary to give them firmness and perseverance."
3. "Let every one then examine himself thoroughly, that the alacrity which gives out a bright flame may not quickly go out, as the saying is, like a fire of tow; for if the word does not fully penetrate the whole heart, and strike its roots deep, faith will want the supply of moisture that is necessary for perseverance."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Forthwith receiveth it with joy." - The initial response to the message is one of joy and excitement, indicating a positive reception of the word.
2. "The effect is immediate and apparently good." - The immediate impact of the message seems positive, giving the impression of a fruitful response.
3. "Great joy without deep spiritual conviction or conflict." - This quote highlights the potential shallowness of the initial joy, suggesting that it may not be rooted in a genuine spiritual transformation or a willingness to endure challenges.

### John Gill:
1. "Such a hearer, who is like to the stony ground on which the seed fell, is one that is not an accidental hearer of the word, as the former, but a settled constant hearer of it."
2. "He is one that not only constantly attends upon it, but he receives it; he gives an assent to it, he believes in it historically, makes a profession of his faith in it, and holds it for a while, being under some convictions of the truth of it."
3. "Having some speculative notions of it, and light in his understanding and judgment in it, he has some flashes of natural affection for it, and delivers some outward expressions of pleasure and delight in it, like Herod, and the hearers of John the Baptist; but has no heart work."

### John Wesley:
1. "The seed sown on stony places... sprang up soon, because it did not sink deep." - Matthew 13:5
2. "He receiveth it with joy... struck with the beauty of truth." - Matthew 13:5
3. "Drawn by the preventing grace of God." - Matthew 13:5
