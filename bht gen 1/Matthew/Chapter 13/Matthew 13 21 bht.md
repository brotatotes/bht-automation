2. "Tribulation is perhaps as accurate a rendering as is possible, being derived from tribulum, the threshing-roller of the Romans."

### John Calvin:

2. "Those persons who take delight in the word of God, and cherish some reverence for it, do in some manner believe; for they are widely different from unbelievers, who give no credit to God when he speaks, or who reject his word."
3. "Let us learn that none are partakers of true faith, except those who are sealed with the Spirit of adoption, and who sincerely call on God as their Father; and as that Spirit is never extinguished, so it is impossible that the faith, which he has once engraved on the hearts of the godly, shall pass away or be destroyed."

### Philip Schaff:

### John Gill:
1. "The word is not rooted in him, nor has he the root of the matter, or the truth of grace in him."
