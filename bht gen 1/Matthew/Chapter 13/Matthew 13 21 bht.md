# Matthew 13:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, the apparent Christian's faith is built on temporary excitement and external circumstances. The word of God is not rooted in their heart, lacking the truth of grace and a deep work of transformation. Though they may face tribulations and persecution for the sake of the Gospel, their lack of conviction results in withering desires and a tendency to find excuses to abandon the narrow path.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Philip Schaff:
1. "His apparent Christian life is rooted only in the temporary excitement about him."
2. "The expression implies also: 'is the creature of circumstances.'"
3. "Tribulation, afflictions; persecution, a special form of affliction; all arising because of the word, and intended to strengthen, as the sunshine the plant; but the plant without root is withered."

### John Gill:
1. "The word is not rooted in him, nor has he the root of the matter, or the truth of grace in him." 
2. "Tribulation may intend some lesser and lighter troubles for the sake of Christ, and his Gospel; such as the revilings and reproaches of men, loss of character, and trade."
3. "Persecution may design something more public and vehement such as confiscation of goods, imprisonment, and danger of life, the most exquisite tortures, and death in the most cruel form and shape."

### John Wesley:
1. "No deep work of grace: no change in the ground of his heart."
2. "He has no deep conviction; and without this, good desires soon wither away."
3. "He finds a thousand plausible pretences for leaving so narrow and rugged a way."
