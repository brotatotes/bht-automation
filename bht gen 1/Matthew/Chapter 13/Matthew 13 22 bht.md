# Matthew 13:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, the word of God is likened to seeds sown among thorns. The commentators highlight the suffocating and obstructing force of worldly desires, anxieties, and the deceitfulness of riches, which can hinder the growth and impact of the word. Even those who initially receive the word with conviction and inward change can be gradually choked by these worldly influences, rendering them unfruitful and diminishing their connection to God. The verse cautions against the allure of worldly concerns, urging believers to guard their hearts and remain steadfast amidst tribulations and temptations.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### John Calvin:
1. "Christ compares to thorns the pleasures of this life, or wicked desires, and covetousness, and the other anxieties of the flesh."
2. "As corn, which otherwise might have been productive, no sooner rises into the stalk than it is choked by thorns and other matters injurious to its growth; so the sinful affections of the flesh prevail over the hearts of men, and overcome faith, and thus destroy the force of the heavenly doctrine, before it has reached maturity."
3. "Each of us ought to endeavor to tear the thorns out of his heart, if we do not choose that the word of God should be choked; for there is not one of us whose heart is not filled with a vast quantity, and, as I may say, a thick forest, of thorns."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The third class hold out longer, but are unfruitful, from a divided heart, in which evil triumphs; the thorns being hardier than the wheat."
2. "The care of the world, not pure worldliness, which belongs to the first class, but anxieties about worldly things distracting persons of serious mind."
3. "The deceitfulness of riches. Whether in the pursuit or possession of wealth. A false expectation or a false confidence in regard to wealth will choke the word."

### John Wesley:
1. "He that received the seed among the thorns, is he that heareth the word and considereth it — In spite of Satan and his agents: yea, hath root in himself is deeply convinced, and in a great measure inwardly changed; so that he will not draw back, even when tribulation or persecution ariseth."

2. "And yet even in him, together with the good seed, the thorns spring up, Matthew 13:7. (perhaps unperceived at first) till they gradually choke it, destroy all its life and power, and it becometh unfruitful."

3. "The deceitfulness of riches — Deceitful indeed! for they smile, and betray: kiss, and smite into hell. They put out the eyes, harden the heart, steal away all the life of God; fill the soul with pride, anger, love of the world; make men enemies to the whole cross of Christ!"
