# Matthew 13:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, there is a portrayal of different types of hearers who receive the word of God. The first group initially seems to have a genuine work of grace within them, but they are hindered by the cares of the world, which attract and consume their thoughts. Another group is ensnared by the deceitfulness of riches, which promise satisfaction but lead them astray from the faith. Lastly, there are those who receive the word among thorns, being deeply convinced and changed, but eventually, the thorns choke out the life and power of the word, rendering them unfruitful.

2. "As corn, which otherwise might have been productive, no sooner rises into the stalk than it is choked by thorns and other matters injurious to its growth; so the sinful affections of the flesh prevail over the hearts of men, and overcome faith, and thus destroy the force of the heavenly doctrine, before it has reached maturity."
3. "Each of us ought to endeavor to tear the thorns out of his heart, if we do not choose that the word of God should be choked; for there is not one of us whose heart is not filled with a vast quantity, and, as I may say, a thick forest, of thorns."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The third class hold out longer, but are unfruitful, from a divided heart, in which evil triumphs; the thorns being hardier than the wheat."
2. "The care of the world, not pure worldliness, which belongs to the first class, but anxieties about worldly things distracting persons of serious mind."

### John Wesley:
1. "He that received the seed among the thorns, is he that heareth the word and considereth it — In spite of Satan and his agents: yea, hath root in himself is deeply convinced, and in a great measure inwardly changed; so that he will not draw back, even when tribulation or persecution ariseth."
2. "And yet even in him, together with the good seed, the thorns spring up, Matthew 13:7. (perhaps unperceived at first) till they gradually choke it, destroy all its life and power, and it becometh unfruitful."
3. "The deceitfulness of riches — Deceitful indeed! for they smile, and betray: kiss, and smite into hell. They put out the eyes, harden the heart, steal away all the life of God; fill the soul with pride, anger, love of the world; make men enemies to the whole cross of Christ!"
