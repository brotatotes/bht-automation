2. "The good seed are the children of the kingdom." Here, the commentary explains that the good seed represents the true believers, those who have received the message of the kingdom and have become part of it.

3. "The tares are the children of the wicked one." This quote clarifies that the tares, or weeds, represent those who have rejected the message of the kingdom and have aligned themselves with the evil one.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The kingdom of heaven. The subject in all seven parables. Christ's reign in the new economy of salvation."
2. "The speedy establishment of the kingdom is implied; hence this parable is referred to the first stage of Christianity."
3. "His field. The 'world' (Matthew 13:38) is 'His' though 'the devil' works in it."

### John Gill:
1. "The kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man which sowed good seed in his field." This parable illustrates the difference between the members of the church, some being good seed and others being tares. It represents the Gospel visible church state on earth, where Christ is the king and the saints are subject to him.

2. "The subjects of it are, or should be, heaven born souls; the word, laws, and ordinances of it are from heaven." The kingdom of heaven consists of those who are born again and have a genuine relationship with God. The principles and teachings of the church are derived from heaven itself.

3. "There is some resemblance between a Gospel church state and heaven, and it is very near unto it, and is even the suburbs of it." The church, although not the ultimate glory of heaven, bears some resemblance to it. It is a foretaste of the heavenly kingdom and is closely connected to it.

4. "He that soweth the good seed is the son of man." Jesus, referred to as the Son of Man, is the sower of the good seed. He preached the Gospel during his earthly ministry and through the ministry of his apostles, spreading the word throughout the world and bringing forth a good work of grace in many souls.

5. "By his field is meant the world... or the church, the visible Gospel church state throughout the world." The field represents both the world, where good and bad men coexist, and the visible Gospel church state. It is a field that belongs to Christ, both by creation and by his redemptive work, and is cultivated and cared for by him.

### John Wesley:
1. "The kingdom of heaven (as has been observed before) sometimes signifies eternal glory: sometimes the way to it, inward religion; sometimes, as here, the Gospel dispensation."
2. "The phrase is likewise used for a person or thing relating to any one of those: so in this place it means, Christ preaching the Gospel, who is like a man sowing good seed."
3. "God sowed nothing but good in his whole creation. Christ sowed only the good seed of truth in his Church."
