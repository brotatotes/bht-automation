# Matthew 13:25 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In a world where good and evil coexist, evil infiltrates even the church. God's patient and merciful judgment allows evil to grow alongside the good until the harvest. The parable calls believers to be discerning and vigilant, actively resisting the presence and influence of evil. The tares, resembling wheat but bearing harmful fruit, are like the children of the wicked one sown among the wheat, exposing the church to danger. Nonetheless, the Lord of the field never sleeps, reminding us to remain watchful in the face of malice and deception.
