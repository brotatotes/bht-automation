# Matthew 13:26 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When the good seed is sown, there is a parallel growth of both wheat and tares, revealing the coexistence of good and evil in the world. The appearance of the tares during the growth of the wheat serves as a reminder that evil will always attempt to infiltrate and corrupt what is good. The true nature of the tares becomes apparent at the time of harvest, exposing their unfruitfulness and harmful principles.
