# Matthew 13:27 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we find Christ's servants and people perplexed and concerned by the discovery of false brethren within the Church. The question they pose highlights the mystery of how evil can coexist with goodness, even within the household of faith. Christ, the master of the Church, responds to their concerns, assuring them that the presence of false brethren is not from Him, but permitted as a test. This verse reminds believers that evil is not a decree from God, but a reality we must face while holding onto the truth.
