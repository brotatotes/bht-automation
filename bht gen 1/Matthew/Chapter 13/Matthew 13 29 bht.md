# Matthew 13:29 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this passage, commentators highlight the difficulty of distinguishing between wheat and weeds, emphasizing the intertwined roots and the danger of uprooting the wheat alongside the weeds. The use of the word "ἅμα" in the context provides further clarification. The parable conveys the message that a pure and perfect church cannot be expected, cautioning against hasty removal of suspected nominal professors without causing harm to true believers. The need for patience and a wise approach to dealing with differing individuals within the church is emphasized, until the time appointed by Christ for separation and judgment.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Inter triticum et zizania quod nos appellamus lolium, quamdiu herba est, et nondum culmus venit ad spicam, grandis similitudo est, et in discernendo nulla aut perdifficilis distantia." (Jerome in loc.) - Jerome highlights the striking similarity between wheat and weeds (zizania), making it difficult to distinguish between the two until the wheat matures and the weed develops its own distinct characteristics.

2. "ἅμα is not a prep. governing αὐτοῖς, but merely an adv. used for elucidation." - The use of ἅμα in this context is not a preposition governing αὐτοῖς, but rather an adverb used to provide further clarification or explanation.

3. "Still the construction here would hardly bear its omission." - However, the construction of the sentence would not make sense if ἅμα were omitted, indicating its importance in conveying the intended meaning.

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Ye root up the wheat with them (εκριζωσητε αμα αυτοις τον σιτον). Literally, 'root out.' Easy to do with the roots of wheat and darnel intermingled in the field."

2. "So συλλεγοντες is not 'gather up,' but 'gather together,' here and verses Matthew 13:28 and Matthew 13:30."

3. "Note other compound verbs here, 'grow together' (συναυξανεσθα), 'burn up' (κατακαυσα, burn down or completely), 'bring together' (συναγετε)."

### John Gill:
1. "Not everyone suspected to be a tare, or a nominal professor, is to be removed from the communion of the church, because there is often danger in so doing."
2. "There may be such in churches, not altogether agreeable in principle and practice, whose character and situation may be such, that there is no removing them without offending some truly gracious, useful persons."
3. "The scope of the parable...is to show that a pure and perfect church cannot be expected in the present state of things; and that saints should not be immoderately uneasy, but patiently bear such exercises, until Christ's time is come to relieve them."
