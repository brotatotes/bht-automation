## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The parable of the sower teaches us that the success of the seed depends on the condition of the soil. It reminds us that the Word of God can be received differently by different people, and it is up to us to cultivate our hearts to be good soil for the seed of God's Word to take root and bear fruit." 

2. "The sower in this parable represents anyone who shares the message of God's Word. It is a reminder that as followers of Christ, we have a responsibility to sow the seeds of the Gospel in the lives of others, regardless of the response we may receive."

3. "The parable also highlights the importance of perseverance in our faith. Just as the seed that falls on rocky ground or among thorns may initially struggle, we too may face challenges and obstacles in our spiritual journey. But if we remain steadfast and continue to nurture our relationship with God, we can overcome these difficulties and bear fruit in our lives."

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "These parables are SEVEN in number and it is not a little remarkable that while this is the sacred number, the first FOUR of them were spoken to the mixed multitude, while the remaining THREE were spoken to the Twelve in private." 

2. "Another thing remarkable in the structure of these parables is, that while the first of the Seven—that of the Sower—is of the nature of an Introduction to the whole, the remaining Six consist of three pairs—the Second and Seventh, the Third and Fourth, and the Fifth and Sixth, corresponding to each other; each pair setting forth the same general truths, but with a certain diversity of aspect."

3. "This parable may be entitled, THE EFFECT OF THE WORD DEPENDENT ON THE STATE OF THE HEART."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "A parable is a form of teaching in which one thing is thrown beside another. Hence its radical idea is comparison."
2. "The unspiritual do not link these facts of the natural life with those of the supernatural, which are not discerned by them, and therefore they need an interpreter of the relation between the two."
3. "The parable differs from the allegory in that there is in the latter 'an interpenetration of the thing signified and the thing signifying; the qualities and properties of the first being attributed to the last,' and the two being this blended instead of being kept distinct and parallel."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Out of the 'many,' Matthew selects these parables; for this selection we seek a reason." 
2. "Behold, calling attention to what follows, not to some object in sight, which would have distracted attention from the parable." 
3. "The sower, standing for the class; went forth, i.e., as usual, pointing rather to a supposed case, than to something occurring before their eyes."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "The parables of Jesus hold the mirror up to nature and, as all illustrations should do, throw light on the truth presented."
2. "The parable may not be actual fact, but it could be so. It is in harmony with the nature of the case."
3. "To understand the parables of Jesus, one must see them, with the eyes of Jesus if he can. Christ drew his parables from familiar objects."

### John Gill:
1. "This way of speaking by parables was much in use among the eastern nations, and particularly the Jews."
2. "The design of which is to set forth the nature of the word of God, the work and business of the ministers of it, the different success of the preaching of it, and the fruitfulness of it."
3. "By 'sowing', is meant preaching; which, as sowing, requires knowledge and skill, and an open and liberal hand; keeping back nothing that is profitable, a declaring the same doctrine in one place as another; and designs a constant ministration of it, notwithstanding all discouragements, and a patient waiting for success."

### John Wesley:
1. "This way of speaking, extremely common in the eastern countries, drew and fixed the attention of many, and occasioned the truths delivered to sink the deeper into humble and serious hearers."
2. "By an awful mixture of justice and mercy, it hid them from the proud and careless."
3. "In this parable our Lord answers a very obvious and a very important question. The same sower, Christ, and the same preachers sent by him, always sow the same seed: why has it not always the same effect?"
