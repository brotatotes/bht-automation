# Matthew 13:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In a collection of parables, seven in total, the first four were spoken to a larger audience, while the remaining three were shared exclusively with the select few. Each parable reveals different aspects of truth, some overlapping with others, creating a cohesive whole. The effect of the Word depends on the state of the heart, drawing deep attention from humble and serious hearers while remaining hidden to the proud and careless. This introductory parable sets the stage for the rest, answering a significant question surrounding the nature and purpose of these teachings.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "These parables are SEVEN in number and it is not a little remarkable that while this is the sacred number, the first FOUR of them were spoken to the mixed multitude, while the remaining THREE were spoken to the Twelve in private." 

2. "Another thing remarkable in the structure of these parables is, that while the first of the Seven—that of the Sower—is of the nature of an Introduction to the whole, the remaining Six consist of three pairs—the Second and Seventh, the Third and Fourth, and the Fifth and Sixth, corresponding to each other; each pair setting forth the same general truths, but with a certain diversity of aspect."

3. "This parable may be entitled, THE EFFECT OF THE WORD DEPENDENT ON THE STATE OF THE HEART."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Out of the 'many,' Matthew selects these parables; for this selection we seek a reason." 
2. "Behold, calling attention to what follows, not to some object in sight, which would have distracted attention from the parable." 
3. "The sower, standing for the class; went forth, i.e., as usual, pointing rather to a supposed case, than to something occurring before their eyes."

### John Wesley:
1. "This way of speaking, extremely common in the eastern countries, drew and fixed the attention of many, and occasioned the truths delivered to sink the deeper into humble and serious hearers."
2. "At the same time, by an awful mixture of justice and mercy, it hid them from the proud and careless."
3. "How exquisitely proper is this parable to be an introduction to all the rest! In this our Lord answers a very obvious and a very important question."
