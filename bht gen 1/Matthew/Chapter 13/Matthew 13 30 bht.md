# Matthew 13:30 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, we are reminded that in the visible Church, both the wheat (true believers) and the tares (those destined for destruction) will coexist until the end of the world. The wheat will continue to grow in grace and spiritual knowledge due to divine grace, the sun of righteousness, and the work of the Holy Spirit through the Word and ordinances. At the end, the tares will be separated and consequentially destroyed, while the wheat will be gathered into heaven, completing their ultimate happiness.
