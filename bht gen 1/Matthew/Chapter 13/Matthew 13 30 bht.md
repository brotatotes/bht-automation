# Matthew 13:30 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the end of the world is likened to a harvest, where the time is fixed and certain. The "wheat" represents true believers who grow in exercising grace, while the "tares" symbolize nominal believers who may flourish in worldly possessions and knowledge. When the harvest time comes, the angels will gather the tares, the formal professors and hypocrites, removing them from the kingdom of God. This verse emphasizes the importance of distinguishing between genuine faith and superficial belief, as well as the significance of storing up treasures in heaven rather than earthly possessions.
