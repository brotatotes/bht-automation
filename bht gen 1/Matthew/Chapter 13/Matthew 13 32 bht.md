# Matthew 13:32 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this parable, the smallest of all seeds, the mustard seed, represents something exceedingly small yet with great potential. It signifies the small beginnings of divine grace, a passing word or thought that can eventually fill and transform the heart. As this grace takes root and grows, it becomes like a tree that provides shelter and blessedness to the nations of the world. The parable emphasizes the rapid growth from something tiny, illustrating the amplitude and abundance of God's kingdom. Through this growth, the Christian doctrine spreads in the world, and the life of Christ flourishes in the soul.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The mustard seed was a well-known Jewish type for anything exceedingly small."
2. "This parable... has a double reference: general and individual."
3. "The individual application of the parable points to the small beginnings of divine grace; a word, a thought, a passing sentence, may prove to be the little seed which eventually fills and shadows the whole heart and being."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "If ye had faith as a grain of mustard seed, that is, 'never so little faith.'" 
2. "This is added, no doubt, to express the amplitude of the tree." 
3. "Is it straining the parable to suppose that, besides the wonderful growth of His kingdom, our Lord selected this seed to illustrate further the shelter, repose, and blessedness it is destined to afford to the nations of the world?"

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Less than all seeds, i.e., those sown by the Jews."
2. "The main point is the rapid growth from a diminutive seed."
3. "The birds of the heaven represent the external adherents of the kingdom, nations nominally Christian; oftentimes ‘outward church form,’ since the kingdom itself is not the Church organization."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Not in nature, but in size" (Bruce).
2. "An excusable exaggeration in popular discourse."

### John Gill:
1. "The Gospel, and the ministry of it were like a grain of mustard seed, little, mean, and contemptible; the author of it, Christ, was so to the Jews, in his birth, parentage, education, and outward appearance."
2. "The grace of God, which under the ministry of the word is implanted in the hearts of the Lord's people, is at first very small, like a grain of mustard seed; it is a day of small things; faith in Christ is very weak and low, spiritual strength small, comfort little, experience of the love of God not large, light and knowledge in the doctrines of grace but very obscure and glimmering."
3. "The Gospel, and the ministry of it, as to its large spread in the world; which at first was confined to the Jews, but was afterwards published to the Gentiles, and carried through the whole world; and, in ages since, has made a considerable progress, particularly at the Reformation; and will make a much greater one, towards the end of time."

### John Wesley:
1. "The least — That is, one of the least: a way of speaking extremely common among the Jews."
2. "It becometh a tree — In those countries it grows exceeding large and high."
3. "So will the Christian doctrine spread in the world, and the life of Christ in the soul."
