# Matthew 13:32 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
From the commentators, we learn that the Bible verse describes the power of faith, even if it is as small as a mustard seed. This seed, though small, has a strong and fiery vigor, attracting both shelter and food for birds. The verse also alludes to the rapid growth and expansion of the Christian kingdom, providing shelter, repose, and blessedness to nations. By using the imagery of a tree, the verse signifies the immense potential for the spread of Christian doctrine and the transformative impact it can have on individuals.
