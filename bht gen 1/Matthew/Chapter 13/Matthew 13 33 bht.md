# Matthew 13:33 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, commentators describe a parable that uses the metaphor of leaven, typically associated with negative influences, to represent both evil and gracious forces. The gradual and internal nature of leaven's impact is emphasized, suggesting that it is not dependent on external factors but rather on personal agency and example. The verse also suggests the potential for the Gospel to permeate and transform the world. Ultimately, this verse speaks to the all-penetrating and assimilating quality of the Gospel, as well as the need for vigilance in guarding against negative influences.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "This parable... holds forth... the inward growth of the kingdom."
2. "It being a woman's work to knead, it seems a refinement to say that 'the woman' here represents the Church, as the instrument of depositing the leaven."
3. "It yields more real satisfaction to see in this brief parable just the all-penetrating and assimilating quality of the Gospel, by virtue of which it will yet mould all institutions and tribes of men."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Leaven, derived from the Latin levare, signifies the power to raise or elevate. In the context of this verse, it represents the corrupting influence of sin and false teachings that can permeate and affect the entire community."

2. "The process of fermentation, symbolized by leaven, involves a gradual transformation and expansion. Similarly, the spread of false teachings can start small but eventually have a significant impact on the beliefs and practices of a group."

3. "Just as sour dough affects the entire batch of dough, the presence of sin and false teachings can infiltrate and contaminate the entire community, leading to spiritual decay and moral compromise."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The figure is generally applied to evil influences, but here probably to gracious ones."
2. "The parable indicates that the influence is internal and noiseless, not dependent upon external organization so much as upon quiet personal agency and example."
3. "The last clause is not to be interpreted absolutely, since an evil development is set forth in the second and seventh parables, and hinted at in the third."

### John Wesley:
1. "Three measures - This was the quantity which they usually baked at once." 
2. "Till the whole was leavened - Thus will the Gospel leaven the world." 
3. "Grace the Christian."
