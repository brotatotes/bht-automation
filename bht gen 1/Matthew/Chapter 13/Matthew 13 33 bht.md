# Matthew 13:33 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The parable of the leaven describes the transformative power of the Gospel in the Kingdom of Heaven. It illustrates how the Gospel, like leaven, silently and gradually influences and assimilates individuals and society as a whole. The leaven represents gracious and inward influences that penetrate every aspect of the soul, permeating cultures and institutions until all are affected. This growth is not dependent on external means but is achieved through personal agency and example. Ultimately, the Gospel will shape and unite all nations under the rule of Christ.
