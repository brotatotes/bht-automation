# Matthew 13:34 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse being described is one where Jesus primarily spoke to the multitude in parables. By using metaphorical stories, he engaged the imagination, challenged his listeners to think critically, and presented profound truths in a relatable and understandable way. Jesus employed parables not only to captivate, but also to awaken and prepare his hearers for the full brightness and publication of the Gospel. This teaching method separated those genuinely seeking understanding from those merely seeking signs and wonders.
