# Matthew 13:37 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, wickedness and believers coexist, a result of the devil's influence, not chance. God bears no responsibility for this evil but uses it to display His mercy and grace. Christ, represented by those who proclaim Him, readily imparts spiritual knowledge with great condescension and affection. He, the Son of Man, sows good seed, referring to Himself and his apostles, spreading the Gospel and working for the good of souls.

### John Calvin:
1. "When many wicked men are mingled with believers, this is no accidental or natural occurrence, as if they were the same seed, but that we must learn to charge the blame of this evil on the devil."
2. "Not that, by condemning him, men are acquitted of guilt; but, in the first place, that no blame whatever may be laid on God on account of this fault which arose from the agency of another."
3. "Let us, therefore, remember, that the Gospel is preached, not only by Christ's command, but by his authority and direction; in short, that we are only his hand, and that He alone is the Author of the work."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The Son of man. Christ Himself."
2. "Our Lord uses the present tense, but this does not forbid an application to later events."
3. "Christ is represented by those who preach Him."

### John Gill:
1. "Being very ready to answer their request, and willing to communicate spiritual knowledge to them; thereby showing great condescension, and humility in himself, and great affection to them."
2. "He that is signified by the man that sowed good seed in his field, is 'the son of man'; by whom he means himself, the seed of the woman; and the son of David."
3. "Though this may be understood of him, as including his apostles and ministers, whom he makes use of as instruments for the good of souls, by preaching the Gospel."
