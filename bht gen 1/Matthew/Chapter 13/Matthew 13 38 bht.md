## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "The tares are the children of the wicked one" - This phrase highlights that the tares, or weeds, represent those who are aligned with evil. It emphasizes the presence of evil in the world and the distinction between the children of God and the children of the wicked one.

2. "No blame seems intended, and certainly none is charged upon 'the servants'" - This statement clarifies that the parable does not assign blame to the servants for the presence of the tares. It suggests that the sowing of the tares while men slept was simply a part of the parable's narrative and not meant to criticize the actions of the servants.

3. "It is probably just the dress of the parable" - This phrase suggests that the inclusion of the detail about the servants' sleep is likely a literary device to enhance the storytelling aspect of the parable. It implies that the focus should be on the deeper meaning of the parable rather than the literal interpretation of the servants' actions.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The field is the world." - This phrase indicates that the parable of the wheat and the tares extends beyond just the Church. It signifies that the gospel is meant to be spread throughout the entire world, and both believers and non-believers exist in this world.

2. "The intertwining of the roots suggests that the tares are in the Church also." - This observation highlights the presence of false believers or hypocrites within the Church. Just as the roots of the wheat and the tares intertwine, there are individuals who may outwardly appear to be part of the Church but do not truly belong to Christ.

3. "In the world, and in the Church... there exist side by side two such classes." - This statement emphasizes the coexistence of two opposing groups within both the world and the Church. It acknowledges that there are those who are heirs of Christ's kingdom and those who align themselves with the evil one, and this duality exists in both spheres.

### John Gill:
1. "That which is represented by 'the field', in which the good seed is sown, is not only the land of Judea, but the whole world."
2. "The good seed are the children of the kingdom, who are possessed of the kingdom of grace here, and are heirs of the kingdom of glory."
3. "The tares are the children of the wicked one, who resemble and imitate him, and do his works, declaring that they were never born of God."

These quotes highlight the expansive nature of the field, the distinction between the good seed and the tares, and the characteristics of each group.

### John Wesley:
1. "The good seed represents the children of the kingdom, symbolizing those who belong to God and live according to His righteousness."
2. "These children of God are like seeds that are sown in the world, spreading the message of the kingdom and bearing fruit in their actions and lives."
3. "Just as seeds grow and produce a harvest, the children of the kingdom are called to grow in their faith and produce the fruits of the Spirit, such as love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control."
