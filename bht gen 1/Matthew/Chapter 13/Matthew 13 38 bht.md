## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The field is the world; if understood of the Church, then the Church only as commensurate with the world." 
2. "The parable sets forth to us the universal sowing of GOOD SEED by the Gospel: it sows no bad seed: all this is done by the enemy." 
3. "It is not the office, however much it may be the desire, of the servants of the householder, the labourers in His field, to collect or root up these tares, to put them out of the world literally, or of the Church spiritually...this is reserved for another time and for other hands, for the harvest, the end; for the reapers, the angels."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

2. "No blame seems intended, and certainly none is charged upon 'the servants'" - This statement clarifies that the parable is not meant to assign blame to the servants for the presence of the tares. It suggests that the focus of the parable is not on human responsibility, but on the reality of evil coexisting with good.

3. "It is probably just the dress of the parable" - This phrase suggests that the details of the parable, such as the sowing of the tares while men slept, may not have a specific symbolic meaning.
