# Matthew 13:39 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, the wickedness sown within the visible Church is attributed to the devil himself, revealing his relentless opposition to Christ. The presence of the wicked among believers is a call for patience and the exercise of caution, as zealous believers strive to purify both the Church and the world. While the final separation of the righteous and the wicked will occur at Christ's second coming, the angels will play a crucial role as they execute divine judgment upon the false believers, allowing the righteous to enter the heavenly kingdom.
