# Matthew 13:39 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we see a vivid depiction of the battle between good and evil within the Church, with the tares representing the wicked and the wheat symbolizing the righteous. The commentators highlight how the devil works insidiously to sow deception and impurity among believers, emphasizing the need for vigilance and careful discernment. Ultimately, the verse points to the end times, when Christ will return and judge all, separating the righteous from the wicked. The harvest becomes a powerful metaphor for the final reckoning and the reapers, the agents of God's divine justice.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "The tares are the children of the wicked one"; and by their being sown "among the wheat" is meant their being deposited within the territory of the visible Church.
2. "The enemy, after sowing his 'tares,' 'went his way'—his dark work soon done, but taking time to develop its true character."
3. "The harvest is the end of the world—the period of Christ's second coming, and of the judicial separation of the righteous and the wicked."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The devil is here represented as the author of evil in the world (and in the Church as affected by the world)."
2. "The parable assumes that earnest Christians will be zealous to remove impurities and offences (from the Church and the world as well) by forcible means."
3. "The whole drift of the parable enjoins caution and charity. Brute force, persecution, whether civil or ecclesiastical, finds little warrant here, and has generally resulted in actually tearing up the wheat."

### John Gill:
1. "His getting of hypocrites and heretics into churches is no small proof of his implacable enmity to Christ and his interest."
2. "The day of judgment, the great and last day, when the heavens and the earth, and all that is therein, shall be burnt up."
3. "The reapers...shall be the executors of God's wrath upon wicked professors of religion, and who shall be the means of introducing the saints into the heavenly kingdom."
