# Matthew 13:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this description of the Bible verse, we explore the parable of the sower and the different types of soil. The commentators emphasize the close proximity of the sower's path to the undulating cornfield, where the seed falls on various types of soils. The commentators mention the dangers that threaten the growth of the seed, such as birds devouring it, scorching in the sun, and being choked by thorns. Despite these challenges, the commentators highlight the importance of being receptive and avoiding one's own perverseness to bear fruit unto perfection.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Marvin Vincent:
1. "A slight recess in the hillside, close upon the plain, disclosed at once, in detail and with a conjunction which I remember nowhere else in Palestine, every feature of the great parable."
2. "There was the undulating cornfield descending to the water's edge. There was the trodden pathway running through the midst of it, with no fence or hedge to prevent the seed from falling here and there on either side of it or upon it; itself hard with the constant tramp of horse and mule and human feet."
3. "There was the 'good' rich soil which distinguishes the whole of that plain and its neighborhood from the bare hills elsewhere descending into the lake, and which, where there is no interruption, produces one vast mass of corn."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The paths or roads pass close to the edge of the ploughed ground in unenclosed fields; or the reference may be to the path across the field on which the sower walked as he sowed." 

2. "In any case, the seed was exposed, and quickly picked up by the birds."

3. "This verse highlights the importance of being receptive and open to receiving the word of God, as the seed that falls by the wayside is easily snatched away."

### John Wesley:
1. "The first danger is, that the birds will devour the seed."
2. "If it escape this, there is then another danger, namely, lest it be scorched, and wither away."
3. "Many of them who receive it in a better soil, yet suffer the thorns to grow up, and choke it: so that few even of these endure to the end, and bear fruit unto perfection: yet in all these cases, it is not the will of God that hinders, but their own voluntary perverseness."
