# Matthew 13:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In a familiar scene, the sower ventured onto a path through a field, his footsteps marking the trodden pathway. Along the wayside, the seed was exposed, vulnerable to the opportunistic birds. Like distractions and temptations, they swiftly snatched away the seed, hindering its growth in the receptive hearts. Careless hearers, walking by the common road, hardly grasping the word, met the same fate. Those who heeded the warning would find that it was their own perverseness, not the will of God, that hindered them.

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "A slight recess in the hillside, close upon the plain, disclosed at once, in detail and with a conjunction which I remember nowhere else in Palestine, every feature of the great parable."
2. "There was the undulating cornfield descending to the water's edge. There was the trodden pathway running through the midst of it, with no fence or hedge to prevent the seed from falling here and there on either side of it or upon it; itself hard with the constant tramp of horse and mule and human feet."
3. "There was the 'good' rich soil which distinguishes the whole of that plain and its neighborhood from the bare hills elsewhere descending into the lake, and which, where there is no interruption, produces one vast mass of corn."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The paths or roads pass close to the edge of the ploughed ground in unenclosed fields; or the reference may be to the path across the field on which the sower walked as he sowed." 
2. "In any case, the seed was exposed, and quickly picked up by the birds." 
3. "The image of the seed being snatched away by birds serves as a metaphor for the distractions and temptations of the world that prevent the word of God from taking root in a person's heart."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "As he sowed (εν τω σπειρειν αυτον). Literally, 'in the sowing as to him,' a neat Greek idiom unlike our English temporal conjunction." 
2. "By the wayside (παρα την οδον). People will make paths along the edge of a ploughed field or even across it where the seed lies upon the beaten track."

### John Gill:
1. "By the wayside; by the common road, or private paths, which led through corn fields, in which Christ and his disciples walked...and designs such hearers as are careless, negligent, and inattentive, who hear without understanding, judgment, and affection."
2. "The fowls came and devoured them; the other evangelists say, 'the fowls of the air'; and mean the devils...because of their ravenous and devouring nature, their swiftness to do mischief, and their flocking in multitudes, where the word is preached, to hinder its usefulness, as fowls do, where seed is sowing."
3. "Satan, and his principalities, and powers, rove about in the air, come down on earth, and seek whom they may devour, and often mix themselves in religious assemblies, to do what mischief they can."

### John Wesley:
1. "The first danger is, that the birds will devour the seed."
2. "A vast majority of those who hear the word of God, receive the seed as by the highway side."
3. "Yet in all these cases, it is not the will of God that hinders, but their own voluntary perverseness."
