# Matthew 13:42 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, the vivid imagery and strong language convey a sense of righteous indignation and contempt towards evildoers. The punishment awaiting them is described as a fierce torment, a metaphorical "furnace of fire" that signifies its incomprehensibility. The despair of the reprobate is expressed through the graphic imagery of "gnashing of teeth." This punishment is not simply a consequence of their circumstances but a result of their character, and it is undeniably a positive and punitive reality, accompanied by weeping.
