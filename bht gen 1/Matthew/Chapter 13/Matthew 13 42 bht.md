# Matthew 13:42 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the Bible uses powerful and vivid language to depict the consequences that await the wicked. Commentators describe this as a metaphorical expression of God's indignation and fierce torment. It is a punishment characterized by unbearable suffering, the gnashing of teeth, and the weeping of the reprobate. The verse conveys the incomprehensibility of both the glorious reward for the righteous and the punitive nature of the punishment for the wicked. It emphasizes the intensity of divine wrath and the despair, remorse, and inexpressible pain that the wicked shall endure for eternity.
