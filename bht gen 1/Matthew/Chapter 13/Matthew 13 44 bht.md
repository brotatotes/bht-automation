# Matthew 13:44 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Parable depicts a man stumbling upon a hidden treasure, unexpectedly and without seeking it. Overjoyed, he secures the field containing the treasure at any cost. This treasure is likened to the kingdom of heaven, a valuable and unsearchable Gospel containing rich truths, promises, and blessings. Those who find and understand this treasure become possessors of the means of grace and are willing to sacrifice all else for its immeasurable worth. It is a treasure that surpasses worldly allurements and can only be obtained through earnestness and devotion.
