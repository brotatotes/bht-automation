# Matthew 13:46 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we find a powerful description of God's love. It is a love that is not earned or deserved, but freely given to all of humanity. This love is so valuable and precious that it requires us to let go of everything else in our pursuit of it. Through Jesus' sacrificial death on the cross, God's love is fully expressed, offering us the opportunity for eternal life and reconciliation with Him. It is a love that knows no boundaries and is willing to give up everything for our sake.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The one pearl of great price, instead of being found by accident, as in the former case, is found by one whose business it is to seek for such, and who finds it just in the way of searching for such treasures."
2. "But in both cases the surpassing value of the treasure is alike recognized, and in both all is parted with for it."
3. "The object of this brief parable is the same as that of the Tares and Wheat. But as its details are fewer, so its teaching is less rich and varied."

### John Calvin:
1. "By the word buy Christ does not mean, that men bring any price, with which they may purchase for themselves the heavenly life; for we know on what condition the Lord invites believers in the book of Isaiah, (Isaiah 55:1,) Come and buy wine and milk without money and without price."

2. "But though the heavenly life, and every thing that belongs to it, is the free gift of God, yet we are said to buy it, when we cheerfully relinquish the desires of the flesh, that nothing may prevent us from obtaining it."

3. "As Paul says, that he reckoned all things to be loss and dung, that he might gain Christ, (Philippians 3:8)."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "One pearl of great price. Christ Himself, not religion; when this pearl becomes ours, we have true religion."
2. "True science seeks goodly pearls, and leads to the discovery of the one pearl of great price."
3. "We may hope for a purer Christianity as the result of intense and earnest investigation; yet the whole discourse shows that side by side with this we must expect an intense and earnest search in the interest of Satan’s kingdom."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "He went and sold... The present perfect indicative, the dramatic perfect of vivid picture." 
2. "Rather eagerly and vividly told thus, 'He has gone off and sold.'"
3. "Εμπορω is a merchant, one who goes in and out, travels like a drummer."

### John Gill:
1. "This verse reminds us that God's love is not based on our own merit or worthiness, but on His own character and nature. It is a love that is unconditional and unchanging, regardless of our actions or circumstances."

2. "The phrase 'the world' in this verse refers to all of humanity, not just a select few. God's love extends to every person, regardless of their background, beliefs, or behavior. It is a love that is all-encompassing and inclusive."

3. "The sacrificial death of Jesus on the cross is the ultimate expression of God's love for us. It is through this act of love that we are reconciled to God and offered the gift of eternal life. It is a love that is willing to give up everything for our sake."
