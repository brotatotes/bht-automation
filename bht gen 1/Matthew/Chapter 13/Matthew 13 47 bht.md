# Matthew 13:47 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Gospel, compared to a large drag-net, draws everything after it, gathering souls of every variety of character from the nations of the world. The Church, a mixture of the good and bad, exists amidst stains and pollutions. The preaching of the Gospel, though confusing in the present state of the Church, serves as a means of gathering sinners to Christ and His churches, fulfilling the purpose of the missionary effort of the Church. This parable emphasizes the far-reaching efficacy of the Gospel, encompassing all nations and all kinds of people.
