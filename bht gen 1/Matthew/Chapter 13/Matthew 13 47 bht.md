# Matthew 13:47 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This parable depicts the ultimate separation of the holy and unholy within the Church, illustrating the selection of the righteous for the master's use. The Gospel is compared to a net, symbolizing its far-reaching efficacy and ability to gather souls of every kind, representing a variety of characters. The Church, existing in a world of mixture, is like a drag-net, extending its ends and drawing together every fish from the sea of nations. The preaching of the Gospel ensures the gathering of diverse souls into the church, encompassing people of all backgrounds, ranks, and conditions.

3. "It is plain that the comparison must not be strained beyond its limits, as our Lord shows us that the earthly here gives but a faint outline of the heavenly."

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The parable resembles that of the tares; that, however, represented the two developments of good and evil, side by side in the world (and in the church); this one is applicable rather to the missionary effort of the Church."
2. "'The sea' is a Scriptural figure for 'the nations' (Revelation 17:15; Isaiah 8:7; Psalms 65:7)."
3. "Gathered of every kind. This predicted result of Christian effort is sufficiently evident at all times."

### John Gill:
1. "By which also is meant, the Gospel, and the ministry of it. This may be compared to a net, for its meanness in the esteem of men; being despicable, and of no account in the eyes of the world."
2. "It is designed, and purposely contrived, for the gathering in of sinners to Christ, and to his churches, though by accident, it has other uses; such as troubling of the world, as the net does the waters of the sea, and drawing out the corruptions of the men of it."
3. "The preaching of the Gospel is the means of gathering souls to Christ, and into his churches; and those that are gathered into a visible Gospel church state, are of every kind, of all nations in the world; Jews and Gentiles: of all ranks and degrees of men, high and low, rich and poor, bond and free; of all sorts of sinners, and of men good and bad."
