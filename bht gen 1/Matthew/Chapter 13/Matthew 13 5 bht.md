# Matthew 13:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we encounter the image of "stony places" which are characterized by a shallow layer of soil covering rock. These areas symbolize the challenges and obstacles we face in our spiritual journey, as well as the superficiality of growth that occurs without a solid foundation. The seeds that sprout quickly represent the hasty reception of the word without deep consideration, lacking the necessary depth for sustained growth. Without a true sense of sin and repentance, these hearers remain unchanged and unaffected by the transformative power of the word.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The stony places mentioned in this verse refer to areas where the native rock is just barely covered with a thin layer of earth. These places are abundant in Palestine and are characterized by their ability to quickly heat up due to the radiation from the rock's surface. This rapid heating of the shallow soil allows the seeds to sprout quickly." 

2. "The image of stony places helps us understand the temporary nature of the growth that occurs in these areas. While the seeds may sprout quickly, they lack the necessary depth of soil to sustain long-term growth. This reminds us of the importance of having a solid foundation in our faith, as shallow roots can easily be uprooted." 

3. "The stony places serve as a metaphor for the challenges and obstacles that we may encounter in our spiritual journey. Just as the seeds struggle to find a foothold in the shallow soil, we too may face difficulties in our faith. However, it is through perseverance and a deep-rooted trust in God that we can overcome these obstacles and continue to grow."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Stony places" refers to a surface that is not conducive to growth, as it lacks the necessary depth of soil for plants to take root and flourish.

2. The presence of a thin layer of soil over the rocky surface highlights the superficiality of the growth that occurs in these stony places.

3. This verse reminds us that true growth and transformation require a solid foundation, just as plants need deep soil to thrive.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Upon the rocky places. Not full of stones, but thin soil over rocks."
2. "Forthwith they sprung up, because, etc. The greater heat of the shallow soil would cause a rapid growth upwards."
3. "The greater heat of the shallow soil would cause a rapid growth upwards."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "The rocky places (τα πετρωδη). In that limestone country ledges of rock often jut out with thin layers of soil upon the layers of rock."
2. "Straightway they sprang up (ευθεως εξανετειλεν). 'Shot up at once' (Moffatt)."
3. "Double compound (εξ, out of the ground, ανα, up). Ingressive aorist of εξανατελλω."

### John Gill:
1. "Such were those places and spots of ground, that some of these seeds fell upon; and design such hearers, in whom the natural hardness of their hearts continues, and who remain unbroken by the word, and are without any true sense of sin, and repentance for it."
2. "Which may not only denote the immediate reception of the word by these hearers, and their quick assent to it; but their sudden and hasty profession of it, without taking due time to consider the nature and importance thereof."
3. "The word had no place in them, and made no real impression on them; they remained dead in trespasses and sins; the word was not the savour of life unto life unto them, or the Spirit that giveth life."
