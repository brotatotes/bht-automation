# Matthew 13:51 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse in question is a conversation between Jesus and his disciples. Jesus speaks directly to the Twelve, reserving certain teachings for them alone after a larger audience has departed. He poses a question to test their progress in understanding, acknowledging both the importance and difficulty of the teachings. The disciples respond correctly, yet it becomes clear that their understanding is not yet complete. Jesus wants them to assess their own comprehension and invites further discussion. Their genuine and attentive response demonstrates their dedication to truly understanding and internalizing his teachings.
