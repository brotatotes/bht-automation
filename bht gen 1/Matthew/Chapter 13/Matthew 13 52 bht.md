## BHT:
The Bible verse can be described as a call for Christian teachers, or scribes, to bring forth the treasures of divine knowledge from their personal collection. These treasures contain a mixture of old truths and new revelations, presented in fresh and relevant ways. Gospel ministers, as disciples of the kingdom, are entrusted with the responsibility of diligently exercising their gifts and freely communicating their knowledge to others. They should bring forth a variety of Gospel provisions, catering to the different needs of those under their care.
