## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "These particulars of our Lord's human history constitute the most valuable testimony, first, to His true and real humanity."
2. "Secondly, to the divine character of His mission—for these Nazarenes proclaim both the unparalleled character of His teaching and the reality and glory of His miracles, as transcending human ability."
3. "And thirdly, to His wonderful humility and self-denial—in that when He was such as they now saw Him to be, He yet never gave any indications of it for thirty years, because 'His hour was not yet come.'"

### John Calvin:
1. "Most improperly and unjustly, therefore, were the inhabitants of Nazareth offended on this account; for they ought rather to have received him with reverence, as one who had suddenly come down from heaven."
2. "They see God working in Christ, and intentionally turn away their eyes from this sight, to behold Joseph, and Mary, and all his relatives; thus interposing a veil to shut out the clearest light."
3. "The word brothers, we have formerly mentioned, is employed, agreeably to the Hebrew idiom, to denote any relatives whatever; and, accordingly, Helvidius displayed excessive ignorance in concluding that Mary must have had many sons, because Christ's brothers are sometimes mentioned."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The word rendered 'carpenter' is sometimes applied to artisans in general, but it means strictly a worker in wood." 
2. "The question, though not contemptuous, implies: He is one of us, no better than we are, etc."
3. "They knew His family, and mention the name of His mother and brothers, speaking also of His sisters, who possibly still resided in Nazareth."
