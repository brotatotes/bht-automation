# Matthew 13:55 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Bible verse being described is the account of Jesus' visit to his hometown of Nazareth. Commentators note that Jesus, referred to as "the carpenter's son," comes from a humble background and is skilled in the trade of carpentry. The mention of Jesus' "brethren" and specifically James as "the Lord's brother" emphasizes the familial relationship between Jesus and his relatives in Nazareth. This visit elicits surprise from the people of Nazareth, who struggle to reconcile Jesus' common upbringing with his teachings and miracles, ultimately missing the divine mission at work in him.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "That there were four persons known as οἱ ἀδ . αὐτοῦ or τ . κυρίου, NOT OF THE NUMBER OF THE TWELVE."
2. "That not a word is any where dropped to prevent us from inferring that the ἀδελφοί and ἀδελφαὶ αὐτοῦ were His relations in the same literal sense as we know ἡ μήτηρ αὐτοῦ to have been; but that His own saying, where He distinguishes His relations according to the flesh from His disciples, seems to sanction that inference."
3. "The fact is, that the two matters, the miraculous conception of the Lord Jesus by the Holy Ghost, and the subsequent virginity of His Mother, are ESSENTIALLY AND ENTIRELY DISTINCT."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "These particulars of our Lord's human history constitute the most valuable testimony, first, to His true and real humanity—for they prove that during all His first thirty years His townsmen had discovered nothing about Him different from other men."
2. "Secondly, to the divine character of His mission—for these Nazarenes proclaim both the unparalleled character of His teaching and the reality and glory of His miracles, as transcending human ability."
3. "And thirdly, to His wonderful humility and self-denial—in that when He was such as they now saw Him to be, He yet never gave any indications of it for thirty years, because 'His hour was not yet come.'"

### John Calvin:
1. "Most improperly and unjustly, therefore, were the inhabitants of Nazareth offended on this account; for they ought rather to have received him with reverence, as one who had suddenly come down from heaven."
2. "They see God working in Christ, and intentionally turn away their eyes from this sight, to behold Joseph, and Mary, and all his relatives; thus interposing a veil to shut out the clearest light."
3. "The word brothers, we have formerly mentioned, is employed, agreeably to the Hebrew idiom, to denote any relatives whatever; and, accordingly, Helvidius displayed excessive ignorance in concluding that Mary must have had many sons, because Christ’s brothers are sometimes mentioned."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The word rendered 'carpenter' is sometimes applied to artisans in general, but it means strictly a worker in wood." 
2. "The question, though not contemptuous, implies: He is one of us, no better than we are, etc." 
3. "They knew His family, and mention the name of His mother and brothers, speaking also of His sisters, who possibly still resided in Nazareth."

### John Gill:
1. "The generally received notion of the ancient Christians is, that he was a carpenter, and that Jesus was brought up to the same business, which lay in making ploughs and yokes."
2. "Is not his mother called Mary? Plain Mary, without any other title, or civil respect; a poor spinstress, that got her bread by her hand labour."
3. "The Jews ought not to have made these remarks, since many of their great doctors were of mean parentage; as R. Zachariah was a butcher's son, and R. Jochanan a blacksmith's son."

### John Wesley:
1. "The carpenter's son" - This phrase suggests that Jesus was skilled in a trade and highlights his humble background as a working-class individual.
2. "His brethren" - This term refers to Jesus' close relatives, specifically his cousins who were the sons of Mary, the sister of the Virgin Mary.
3. "James" - This name is used to identify one of Jesus' brothers, who is also referred to as "the Lord's brother" by St. Paul. This highlights the familial relationship between Jesus and his siblings.
