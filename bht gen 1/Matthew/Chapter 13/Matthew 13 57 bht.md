### John Calvin:
1. "Those who are distinguished by eminent gifts are nowhere held in less estimation than in their own country; and this manifests the ingratitude of men, who, in proportion to the greater familiarity with which God exhibits himself to them, are the more bold to reject him in the influences of his Spirit."
2. "Nowhere did he receive less honor than on his native soil. There were good grounds for the charge which he brings against them, that, instead of being the first to accept the grace offered to them, as they ought to have been, they drive him to a distance from them."
3. "It is truly extraordinary that a prophet of God, whom others warmly receive as a newly-arrived stranger, should be despised in the place where he was born."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "They were offended in him, made to stumble. They were led into error and sin with regard to Him." - This quote highlights how the rejection of Jesus by the people was not just a matter of disagreement or disbelief, but it led them to stumble and fall into error and sin.

2. "A prophet is not without honor, etc. The rejection is accounted for by a proverbial expression, verified by human experience." - This quote explains that the rejection of Jesus as a prophet was not an isolated incident, but rather a common occurrence throughout history. It shows that the lack of honor given to prophets is a well-known pattern.

3. "‘Familiarity breeds contempt,’ ‘Distance lends enchantment to the view,’ are still more general expressions of the same principle." - This quote suggests that the people's familiarity with Jesus, growing up in the same community, led them to overlook his true identity and despise him. It emphasizes the idea that sometimes, being too close to someone can hinder our ability to recognize their worth.

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "They stumbled at him," "They were repelled by him" - The people were offended by Jesus because he did not conform to their expectations and was not like them. This highlights the challenge of accepting someone who is different and challenges our preconceived notions.

2. "They turned against him" - The people's offense towards Jesus led them to turn against him. This emphasizes the power of offense to create division and hostility, even towards someone who is ultimately trying to bring about positive change.

### John Gill:
1. "It was a stumbling to them, how he came by his wisdom and power; since he had not these things from men of learning, and could not have them from his relatives."
2. "If without the advantage of an education without human literature, and the instructions of men, he was able to expound the Scriptures, preach such doctrine, and deliver such words of wisdom, and confirm all this by miracles, and mighty works, they ought to have considered him as a divine person."
3. "A prophet, or any teacher, or preacher, generally speaking, is more esteemed among strangers, who have no personal pique, nor prejudices against him, and who judge of him, not by what he has been, but by his present abilities, doctrine, and conduct, than among his countrymen."

### John Wesley:
1. "They were offended at him" - The people's offense at Jesus reveals their prejudice and lack of understanding of his true identity and purpose. It highlights the human tendency to judge based on outward appearances rather than recognizing the divine presence within. 

2. "They looked on him as a mean, ignoble man" - This commentary emphasizes the misconception and underestimation of Jesus by those who failed to recognize his true greatness. It reminds us of the danger of making hasty judgments based on superficial qualities, rather than seeking to understand the deeper truth and significance of a person or situation. 

3. "Not worthy to be regarded" - This phrase underscores the dismissive attitude of the people towards Jesus. It serves as a reminder that true worth and value cannot be determined by societal standards or popular opinion. It challenges us to reevaluate our own biases and prejudices, and to recognize the inherent worth and dignity of every individual, regardless of how they may be perceived by others.
