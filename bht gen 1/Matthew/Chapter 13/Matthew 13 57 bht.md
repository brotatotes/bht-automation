# Matthew 13:57 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse described here portrays the rejection and offense faced by Jesus from those who were familiar with him. Despite his wisdom, power, and divine teachings, they stumbled, turned against him, and looked down upon him as unworthy. This rejection highlights a recurring pattern where prophets and teachers are often esteemed more by strangers than by their own countrymen. Their familiarity bred contempt, leading to a lack of honor and disrespect. However, Jesus, being inherently honorable, possessed a dignity that remained intact despite the opinions of others.
