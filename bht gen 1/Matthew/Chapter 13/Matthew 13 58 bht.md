# Matthew 13:58 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In a particular passage, Jesus visits his own country where his preaching was met with unbelief, causing a limitation in the miracles he performed. The lack of faith among the townspeople hindered the full expression of Jesus' power, resulting in only a few healings. Despite his ministry and miracles among them, their continued disbelief surprised him. This highlights the connection between faith and the manifestation of miracles, demonstrating that unbelief can restrict the full demonstration of God's power.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He laid his hands upon a few sick folk and healed them." - Mark 6:5
2. "They were so 'prejudiced,' so set against him, that they were not in a condition to 'judge of evidence' and to be convinced." 
3. "He did, therefore, only those things which were the proper work of benevolence, and which could not easily be charged on the devil."

### John Calvin:
1. "It was the impiety of Christ’s countrymen that closed the door against the performance of a greater number of miracles among them."
2. "When the Lord perceives that his power is not accepted by us, he at length withdraws it; and yet we complain that we are deprived of his aid, which our unbelief rejects and drives far from us."
3. "We have experience of the same thing daily with respect to God; for, though he justly and reluctantly restrains his power, because the entrance to us is shut against him, yet we see that he opens up a path for himself where none exists, and ceases not to bestow favors upon us."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Jesus does not force His love or blessings on us, and His miracles were not mere displays of Almighty Power. Where there was no faith, no moral condition to justify such displays, there our Lord ‘could do no mighty works’." 

2. "The first view [that the brothers of Jesus were the children of Joseph and Mary] is the most natural one. Objections: (a.) It denies the perpetual virginity of Mary. But this is nowhere asserted, while Matthew 1:25 and Luke 2:7, suggest the contrary." 

3. "The view that Mary had other children furnishes an argument in favor of the historical character of the Gospels. Had the story of the miraculous conception been a fiction, the Evangelists, to give consistency to the tale, would have denied that our Lord had any brothers, instead of speaking of them without reserve."

### John Wesley:
1. "He wrought not many mighty works, because of their unbelief." This quote highlights the connection between the lack of faith and the limited manifestation of miracles. It suggests that the power of God to perform miracles is hindered by the disbelief of the people.

2. "The reason why many mighty works are not wrought now is not that the faith is not everywhere planted." This quote emphasizes that the issue is not the absence of faith, but rather the prevalence of unbelief. It suggests that faith exists but is overshadowed by doubt and skepticism.

3. "Unbelief everywhere prevails." This quote succinctly captures the pervasive nature of unbelief. It implies that unbelief is a widespread problem that hinders the manifestation of God's power and miracles in various contexts.
