# Matthew 13:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Amidst the fertile soil, the seeds find their way into an unsuspecting bed, beneath the surface, ready to sprout. The thorns, already present, grow up swiftly, overpowering the fragile seeds striving for life. Like greedy fowl snatching scattered seeds, the thorns, weeds with stubborn roots, and thistle torment the ripening grain, choking it as fierce winds and baleful stars ravage the harvest. The struggle against thorns, both literal and metaphorical, parallels the challenges faced in this hidden verse.
