# Matthew 13:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, the seed falls among thorns, not just on the surface but within the ground, symbolizing the hearts of some hearers who outwardly appear contrite but are inwardly filled with sinful desires. The thorns quickly overtake the seed, choking its growth and preventing a fruitful harvest. This speaks to the curse of sin and the danger of allowing worldly cares and lusts to prevail, leading to ultimate rejection and condemnation.
