## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Luke's account of this parable focuses on the idea of multiplication, emphasizing that the seed sown by the sower produced a hundredfold increase." 

2. "Mark's addition of the phrase 'going up and growing' suggests a gradual and continuous growth of the seed, highlighting the process of development and progress." 

3. "The use of the word 'giving' in Luke's version of the parable implies that the growth and multiplication of the seed is a result of divine action, emphasizing God's role in the abundance of the harvest."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "A hundred-fold. Mentioned as something extraordinary."
2. "Herodotus (i. 93) says of Babylonia, 'In grain it is so fruitful as to yield commonly two-hundred-fold; and when the production is the greatest, even three-hundred-fold.'"

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Yielded fruit (εδιδου καρπον). Change to imperfect tense of διδωμ, to give, for it was continuous fruit-bearing." 

2. "Some a hundredfold (ο μεν εκατον). Variety, but fruit. This is the only kind that is worth while."

### John Gill:
1. "Not beaten and trodden by the feet of men, nor stony, nor thorny, but well broke up, manured, and tilled; which designs good, honest-hearted hearers who become so by the Spirit and grace of God."
2. "The different degrees of fruitfulness in gracious souls... Some believers are grown to a greater maturity than others; some are but little children, some are young men, some are fathers."
