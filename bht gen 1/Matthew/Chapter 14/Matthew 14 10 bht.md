# Matthew 14:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In a mysterious act of providence, a feast was held either at Machærus or nearby, possibly in a royal palace at Livias, where John the Baptist was beheaded by Herod. The executioner carried out this intentional act of brutality, demonstrating the ruler's authority over life and death. John's unjust execution serves as a reminder of the cost brave individuals may pay for speaking out against injustice and standing up for the truth. The Almighty, however, promises to reward His faithful servants in the next life for any suffering endured in this one.

3. "And as this word is often used by them for an executioner, so "specula" is often made mention of by them as a sort of punishment by death: and such an officer was sent by Herod, to inflict this punishment upon John; who accordingly executed it, and beheaded John in the prison."
