# Matthew 14:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, Jesus retreats to a deserted place, both for his own safety and to provide rest for his disciples. His journey by boat, contrasting with the multitude's journey on foot, emphasizes the physicality of their travels. This withdrawal, prompted by the death of John the Baptist, highlights Jesus' compassionate nature in seeking respite amidst turmoil and his disciples' unwavering dedication to be with him.

2. "The words, they came together to him, I look upon as meaning that ever afterwards they were his constant attendants; as if the Evangelist had said, that they did not leave their Master so as to be individually and constantly employed in the ordinary office of teaching, but that, having discharged a temporary commission, they went back to school to make greater advances in learning."
