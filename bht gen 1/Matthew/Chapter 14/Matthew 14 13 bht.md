## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### John Calvin:
1. "Certainly, as it was formerly related that, when John was imprisoned, Christ removed from Herod's territory, in order to avoid his fury for the time, so we may now infer that Christ, in order to keep his trembling disciples at a distance from the flame, withdrew into a desert place."
2. "The words, they came together to him, I look upon as meaning that ever afterwards they were his constant attendants; as if the Evangelist had said, that they did not leave their Master so as to be individually and constantly employed in the ordinary office of teaching, but that, having discharged a temporary commission, they went back to school to make greater advances in learning."
3. "The vast crowd that had assembled shows how widely his fame was spread in every direction: and this left the Jews without excuse in depriving themselves, by their own carelessness, of the salvation which was offered to them."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "This was not the only cause of the retirement...The Twelve had returned and the multitudes gave Him and them no rest."
2. "Not a 'desert' in the modern sense, but a thinly inhabited district...Our Lord would avoid Herod as well as seek rest for His disciples."
3. "The popularity of our Lord continued...They followed him."
