# Matthew 14:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, Jesus is depicted as deliberately stepping out from his place of solitude, choosing to engage with the world with a willingness to go beyond his comfort zone and reach out to others. His compassion is evident as he sees famishing souls in need of healing and instruction, and he is moved by their physical and spiritual infirmities. Jesus' actions demonstrate his genuine concern for the well-being of both their bodies and souls, as he not only heals them but also teaches them the truths of the Gospel.
