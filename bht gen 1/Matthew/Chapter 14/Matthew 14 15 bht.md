# Matthew 14:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Amidst Jesus' teaching, the disciples grew concerned for the physical needs of the multitude and suggested sending them away to find food in nearby villages. Their request reflected a limited perspective, anchored in conventional meal times, and a lack of faith in Jesus' ability to provide. Yet, Jesus purposely delayed performing the miraculous feeding, allowing His disciples to glean important lessons from it and affirming His constant care for His people.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### John Calvin:
1. "The disciples had now lost their object, and they see that Christ is again absorbed in teaching, while the multitudes are so eager to receive instruction that they do not think of retiring."
2. "They therefore advise that for the sake of attending to their bodily wants, Christ should send them away into the neighboring villages."
3. "He had purposely delayed till now the miracle which he intended to perform; first, that his disciples might consider it more attentively, and might thus derive from it greater advantage; and next, that the very circumstance of the time might convince them that, though he does not prevent, and even does not immediately supply, the wants of his people, yet he never ceases to care for them, but has always at hand the assistance which he affords at the very time when it is required."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The disciples probably interrupted His discourse with this suggestion."
2. "Our Lord had continued His work of teaching and healing, until He had an opportunity to show how He could supply other wants."
3. "Those who wait on Him shall be fed!"

### John Gill:
1. "The Jews, as Grotius rightly observes, had two evenings; the one began when the sun declined at noon, and the other at sun setting: now it was the former of these, and not the latter, that was now come."
2. "The disciples reason for the dismission of the multitude, that might go into the neighbouring villages, and buy provisions, shows that it could not be the last, but the first of these evenings, that is here meant."
3. "The disciples move that he would break off his discourse, and dismiss them; in the synagogue the manner of dismissing the people was, by reading the הפטרה, or 'dismission', which was some passage out of the prophetic writings."

### John Wesley:
1. "The time is now past" - This phrase indicates that the disciples were aware of the practical limitations of providing food for the large crowd. It highlights their concern for the physical needs of the people and their recognition of the time constraints they were facing.

2. "The usual meal time" - This phrase suggests that the disciples were thinking in terms of conventional meal times and expected the people to have their own provisions. It reveals their limited perspective and lack of faith in Jesus' ability to provide for the multitude.

3. "Mark 6:35; Luke 9:12" - These references indicate that the commentary is based on the accounts of the feeding of the five thousand found in the Gospels of Mark and Luke. It establishes the context for the discussion and emphasizes the significance of the disciples' response to the situation.
