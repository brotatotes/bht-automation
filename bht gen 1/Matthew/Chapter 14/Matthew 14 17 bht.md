# Matthew 14:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this passage, the disciples are faced with the daunting task of feeding a multitude of people. They are filled with doubt and perplexity, trying to find a solution despite their own limitations. Their lack of faith and trust in Jesus' power is evident as they question the meager supply of food, failing to recognize the limitless potential of Christ to provide for the crowd. This serves as a reminder for us to overcome our doubts and excuses, and wholeheartedly embrace the work that God has called us to do.
