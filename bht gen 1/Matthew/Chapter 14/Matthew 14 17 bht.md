# Matthew 14:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, the disciples are faced with the daunting task of feeding a multitude of people. Despite their doubts and excuses, they obeyed Jesus and gathered meager resources like barley loaves and small fishes. However, they failed to recognize the power of Christ, who was able to multiply these provisions to be sufficient for everyone present. This story reminds us of our tendency to doubt our own abilities and make excuses when faced with challenging tasks, but it also teaches us that Jesus equips us with the necessary resources to accomplish the seemingly impossible.
