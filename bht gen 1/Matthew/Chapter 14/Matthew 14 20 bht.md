# Matthew 14:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, we witness a truly remarkable miracle. The initial amount of food given to the multitude was far less than what was finally left over. This surplus, as highlighted by John Calvin, added to the splendor of the miracle. As Philip Schaff points out, the pieces distributed were not scraps, but substantial portions. By illustrating the abundance and carefulness of this miracle, these commentators emphasize the divine blessing and Christ's miraculous provision for the people's needs.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### John Calvin:
1. "The fragments that remained after satisfying so vast a multitude of men were more than twelve times larger in quantity than what was at first put into their hands, and this contributed not a little to the splendor of the miracle."
2. "Christ intended that, after the miracle had been wrought, a striking proof of it should still remain, which, after being refreshed by food, they might contemplate at leisure."
3. "If we do not perceive that it is the blessing of God which multiplies the corn, that we may have a sufficiency of food, the only obstacle is, our own indolence and ingratitude."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Philip had said that 200 pennyworth of bread would only give each a little, but now all had received enough."
2. "The pieces they distributed, pieces, not the refuse."
3. "What was gathered exceeded what was first given out Christ was no waster; He enjoined carefulness and economy at the close of His most abundant bestowment."
