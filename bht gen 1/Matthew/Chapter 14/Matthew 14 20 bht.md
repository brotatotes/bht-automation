# Matthew 14:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we see a miraculous feeding of a multitude. The people were provided for with baskets filled with food, as it was customary for the Jews to carry their own meals to avoid contamination from other cultures. The fragments left over after everyone had eaten were more than what was initially given, emphasizing the abundance of the miracle. This display of God's blessing and multiplication of food serves as a reminder for us to be grateful for His provision and to practice both generosity towards the needy and careful stewardship of resources.
