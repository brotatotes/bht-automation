# Matthew 14:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This Bible verse describes a miraculous feeding of a large crowd, composed of 5000 men, who were not the only ones present but were mentioned separately from the women and children. The commentator, Henry Alford, points out that this distinction is unique to the Gospel of Matthew. Philip Schaff adds that the women and children were probably fed separately. Archibald T Robertson emphasizes that the mention of women and children serves to highlight the magnitude of the miracle. John Gill notes the extraordinariness of such a large number being fed with only five loaves and two fishes.
