### John Calvin:

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Some understand by Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Philip, supposed to be on the western side of the lake; Capernaum being the ultimate point to be reached; it was in ‘the land of Gennesaret’ (Matthew 14:34). But in that case they would have inquired how He could join them, since there was then no other boat there (John 6:22), and the circuit by land was a long one." 

2. "We therefore infer that He sent them to eastern Bethsaida, which was not far off (Luke 9:10), directing them to await Him there, so that they would cross together to the opposite shore, which they actually did, after the miracle."

3. "Till he sent the multitudes away. They were in an excited condition; hence great prudence, perhaps an exercise of some constraining power was necessary."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The explanation for this strong word in Mark 6:45 and Matthew 14:22 is given in John 6:15. It is the excited purpose of the crowd to take Jesus by force and to make him national king."
2. "The disciples were evidently swept off their feet by the mob psychology for they still shared the Pharisaic hope of a political kingdom."
3. "With the disciples out of the way Jesus could handle the crowd more easily, till he should send the multitudes away."

1. "As soon as ever he had wrought the above miracle, and perceived that the people were so convinced by it, of his being the Messiah, that they were determined, whether he would or not, to set him up for a temporal king, to deliver them from the Roman yoke."
2. "Christ was forced to use his power and authority; and order them directly to get into a ship; very likely, the same they came over in; and to go before him unto the other side of the lake of Tiberias or sea of Galilee, over against Bethsaida, to Capernaum, or the land of Gennesaret."
3. "He sends away his disciples before him, the better to disperse them, and prevent their designs."
