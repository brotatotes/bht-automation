# Matthew 14:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, a man, though having all things at his disposal, shows sincerity and human affection by praying. He seeks solitude in the mountains to have more leisure for prayer, away from noise, and this choice influences his prayer, making him more guarded, pouring his heart into God's bosom, and diligent in self-examination. The attempt to make him a king becomes a temptation, which he faces by relying on prayer. Being alone with his Father, prayer both precedes and follows his labors for humanity.
