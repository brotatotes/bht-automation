# Matthew 14:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this passage, Jesus demonstrates his sincere and human affection towards us by going up into a mountain to pray. He seeks solitude to pour out his heart into his Father's bosom and be diligent in self-examination. Despite the traditions of the Jews, he chooses a place that is private and retired, where he can freely pray and seek his Father's help. This moment of prayer before and after his labors for humanity reflects the importance he attributes to seeking God's guidance and strength.
