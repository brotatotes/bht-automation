# Matthew 14:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the midst of a distressing situation, the disciples found themselves on a ship, representing the church of Christ in this troubled world. Tossed by tempests in the sea, they were about four miles from the shore, in the middle of the Sea of Tiberias. As the wind blew against them, their faith wavered, but Jesus, understanding their distress, came to their aid, calming the storm and providing much-needed comfort and support.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Albert Barnes:
1. "John says they had sailed about 25 or 30 furlongs." 
2. "About 7 1/2 Jewish furlongs made a mile; so that the distance they had sailed was not more than about 4 miles." 
3. "At no place is the Sea of Tiberias much more than 10 miles in breadth, so that they were literally in the midst of the sea."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The word 'tossed' in this verse can be better understood as 'distressed.' It implies a state of being greatly troubled or agitated, highlighting the intensity of the situation." 

2. "This word choice reminds us that even in the midst of our trials and tribulations, we can find solace in knowing that God understands our distress and is there to provide comfort and support." 

3. "Just as Jesus calmed the stormy sea, He can also calm the storms in our lives. This verse serves as a reminder that we can turn to Him in times of distress and find peace in His presence."

### John Calvin:
1. "When Christ permitted his disciples to be tossed about in a perilous condition, for a time, by an opposing storm, it was to fix their attention more powerfully on the assistance which he brought to them."
2. "Their arms were not more fatigued by rowing than their faith was shaken by grievous terrors."
3. "It is, no doubt, true, that their blameworthy slowness of apprehension was the reason why they were astonished; for they had not profited, as they ought to have done, by other and preceding miracles."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "When Jesus came to them; they were 'about twenty-five or thirty furlongs' from shore (John 6:19), i.e. about the middle of the lake."
2. "Distressed, or 'vexed,' by the waves. The storm had arisen after they started (John 6:18)."
3. "For the wind was contrary. It is most probable that they put out into the lake, and steering for (eastern) Bethsaida, were driven out into the middle of the lake by an easterly wind."

### John Gill:
1. "The ship in which the disciples were, was an emblem of the church of Christ, and of its state and condition in this world."
2. "The church of Christ is like a ship in this troublesome sea; where the true disciples and followers of Christ are selected together."
