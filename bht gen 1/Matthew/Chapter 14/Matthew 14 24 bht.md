# Matthew 14:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the midst of a stormy sea, where the disciples' faith was shaken and their arms fatigued from rowing, Jesus came to them. As the boat was tossed about on the waves, the disciples found themselves distressed and tested, tormented by the tempest. Yet, in the midst of their turmoil, Jesus was there to provide comfort and guidance. This scene reminds us that even in the midst of our trials, we can find peace and rest in Jesus, who has the power to calm the storms in our lives.
