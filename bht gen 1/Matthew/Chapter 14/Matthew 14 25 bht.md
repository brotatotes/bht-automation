# Matthew 14:25 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the early morning hours, between three and six, Jesus appeared to his disciples who had spent the night at sea, tossed by waves and in great danger. Having spent the majority of the night on the mountain in prayer, Jesus came to them, walking on the sea as if on dry land, defying the laws of nature. When the disciples saw him, they were initially unsure, but Peter, without doubt, left the safety of the ship to join Jesus on the water.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The Jews anciently divided the night into three parts of four hours each, usually called watches."
2. "It is probable that the term watch was given to each of these divisions from the practice of placing sentinels around the camp in time of war, or in cities, to watch or guard the camp or city."
3. "It was in the last of these watches, or between three and six in the morning, that Jesus appeared to the disciples, so that he had spent most of the night alone on the mountain in prayer."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Deliverance is often long delayed, but while the Master prayed, the disciples could not be lost."
2. "He came unto them... to try them."
