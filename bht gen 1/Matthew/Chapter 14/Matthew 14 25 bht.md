# Matthew 14:25 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the early morning hours, when the night was divided into four watches, Jesus appeared to his disciples walking on the sea. His miraculous act demonstrated his authority over nature. As Peter discerned it was truly Jesus, he mustered the faith to step out of the boat and walk on water towards him. However, when he shifted his focus from Jesus to the wind, doubts arose, and he began to sink. Nevertheless, this episode unveiled the disciples' recognition of Jesus as the divine Lord.

1. "Walking upon the sea" - This phrase refers to a nature miracle performed by Jesus. Some scholars try to explain it as Jesus walking along the beach, but Matthew's account suggests otherwise. (Quote 1)

2. "An impossible theory unless Matthew's account is legendary" - The theory that Jesus was simply walking along the beach is implausible unless we consider Matthew's account to be a legend. This highlights the miraculous nature of Jesus walking on water. (Quote 2)

3. "Matthew uses the accusative with επ in verse Matthew 14:25 and the genitive in Matthew 14:26" - The different cases used by Matthew in describing Jesus walking on water indicate a specific and intentional action. This emphasizes the unique and extraordinary nature of the event. (Quote 3)

2. "Jesus went unto them; from the mountain where he had been praying, the greatest part of the night, to the sea side, and so upon the waters to them; for it follows, walking upon the sea; as on dry land."
3. "By which action he showed himself to be the Lord of the sea, and to be truly and properly God; whose character is, that he 'treadeth upon the waves of the sea'."
