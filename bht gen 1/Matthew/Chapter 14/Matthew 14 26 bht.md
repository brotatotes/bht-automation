# Matthew 14:26 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the darkness of night, amidst raging waves, the disciples were troubled and filled with fear as they witnessed a remarkable sight - the form of a man walking on the sea. Their initial perception was that of an unreal apparition or spirit, causing them to cry out in fear and confusion. The disciples' terror intensified due to superstitions surrounding such uncanny appearances and an innate fear of spirits. Though they couldn't discern who or what it was, their instinctual fear was akin to encountering a powerful and potentially harmful entity.
