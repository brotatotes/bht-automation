# Matthew 14:28 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this remarkable narrative, Matthew sheds light on Peter's bold faith and impulsive character. Peter's request to walk on water displays his unwavering trust in Jesus, acknowledging that only through the Lord's invitation and authority can he accomplish the impossible. However, as John Calvin explains, Peter's hasty wish combined with his small and weak faith resulted in a valuable lesson for believers to approach God's will with caution. Despite the risks, Peter's willingness to come to Jesus amidst storms and tempests exemplifies his great love and affection for Christ, a poignant demonstration of the power of faith over earthly limitations.
