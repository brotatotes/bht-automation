## BHT:
This Bible verse captures the moment when Peter, with great faith and trust in Jesus, defies the laws of nature by walking on water. It serves as a reminder that when we step out in faith, God can work through us in miraculous ways. However, it also emphasizes that relying on our own strength limits what God can do in and through us. Peter's experience highlights the importance of keeping our focus on Jesus amidst the challenges and distractions that life brings. Through faith in Christ's power, we can rise above the storms of life and walk in the supernatural.
