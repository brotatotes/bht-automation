# Matthew 14:29 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When Peter stepped out of the boat to walk on water towards Jesus, it was an act of faith and trust in Jesus' miraculous power. By defying the limitations of human understanding and embracing the supernatural power of God, Peter demonstrated his willingness to take risks. Even when Peter's faith faltered and he started to sink, Jesus was there to rescue him. This experience reminds us that when we step out in faith, we can rely on Jesus to lift us up and never leave us alone in our struggles.
