# Matthew 14:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we encounter the imprisonment of John the Baptist, who was held captive in the fortress of Machaerus. From the high windows, John could see a panoramic view of the Dead Sea, the Jordan River, and Jerusalem. His imprisonment was a result of Herodias's anger and influence over Herod, as she was both his niece and sister-in-law. This scandalous affair between Herod and Herodias, which violated both moral and legal bounds, adds to the complexity and tragedy of John's situation.
