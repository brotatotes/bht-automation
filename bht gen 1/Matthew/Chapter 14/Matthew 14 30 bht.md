# Matthew 14:30 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the midst of a tumultuous storm, a person becomes overwhelmed by fear and starts to sink, despite being a skilled swimmer. However, they immediately cry out to the Lord for salvation, acknowledging their dependence on Him. This demonstrates the frailty of human faith and the need to fix our gaze on Jesus amidst life's trials. Such a scene serves as a reminder that when we trust in the Lord and call upon Him, He is always there to save us, even in our most desperate moments.
