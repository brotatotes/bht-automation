# Matthew 14:36 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we see the power and completeness of Christ's healing at work. Through the touch of the hem of his garment, individuals experienced complete restoration and cure of their diseases. The crowd, not superstitious but filled with strong faith, sought this connection with Christ, not only to witness miracles but to signify their unworthiness. These events, grouped together without strict chronological order, demonstrate the profound impact of Christ's ministry on those who believed in his power and approached him with faith.
