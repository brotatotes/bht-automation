# Matthew 14:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we see the complex dynamics surrounding Herod's initial desire and subsequent reluctance to put John the Baptist to death. Despite political pressure and personal animosity towards John, Herod's reverence for the holy man and fear of the consequences prevented him from carrying out his initial intentions. Additionally, the esteem that John held among the people played a significant role in restraining Herod's actions. This passage serves as a reminder of the influence that righteousness and the fear of the Lord can have even on those in positions of power.
