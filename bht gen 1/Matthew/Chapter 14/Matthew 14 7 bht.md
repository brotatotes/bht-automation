# Matthew 14:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, a powerful ruler makes a promise to a woman, confessing his obligation to fulfill it. The promise is made with an oath, emphasizing its seriousness and certainty. There is a sense of corruption and self-indulgence as the ruler promises to give the woman whatever she desires, even up to half of his kingdom. Though made in a moment of gratification and influenced by a dance, it leads one to wonder if the request could have been something as extreme as asking for the ruler's own head.
