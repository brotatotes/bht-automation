# Matthew 15:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, Jesus rebukes and humiliates a group of individuals, leaving them feeling unworthy. He then turns his attention to the crowd, considering them more deserving. By redirecting his words towards the multitude, Jesus acknowledges their worthiness and demonstrates that they are more open to understanding the true meaning behind religious practices. This passage emphasizes the importance of understanding the real sense of the law and highlights that true pollution is not external, but concealed within a person. Ultimately, Jesus shows that the Kingdom of God is not about outward ceremonies, but about inward transformation.
