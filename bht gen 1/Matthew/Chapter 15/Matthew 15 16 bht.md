# Matthew 15:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the Savior expresses disappointment and frustration at the lack of understanding among His disciples. He is grieved by the slowness of their spiritual apprehension, even after all the instruction they have received. Jesus wonders why they, His own disciples, still lack understanding, just like the multitude. This lack of comprehension is reproved and seen as unintelligent. Despite being with Jesus for a long time and hearing numerous discourses, the disciples struggle to grasp the plain and easy teachings presented to them.
