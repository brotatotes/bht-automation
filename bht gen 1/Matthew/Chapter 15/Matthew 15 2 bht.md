# Matthew 15:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we see a contrast between the emphasis on tradition and external rituals upheld by the religious leaders, and Jesus' focus on the true condition of the heart. The Jews regarded the tradition of handwashing as paramount, even equating its breach with serious offenses. However, Jesus challenges this mindset, highlighting the importance of inner purity and righteousness over outward displays of religious observance. He challenges their authority and emphasizes the need for a genuine relationship with God, rather than just adhering to external traditions.

### Henry Alford:
1. "The Jews attached more importance to the traditionary exposition than to the Scripture text itself."
2. "So rigidly did the Jews observe it, that Rabbi Akiba, being imprisoned, and having water scarcely sufficient to sustain life given him, preferred dying of thirst to eating without washing his hands."
3. "πρεσβύτεροι are not the elders, but the ancients."

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "The tradition of the elders" refers to the religious customs and practices that were passed down from generation to generation. It was considered a serious offense for the disciples to not wash their hands before eating, as it was seen as a violation of these traditions.

2. The emphasis on handwashing was not merely about hygiene, but rather about the outward display of purity and adherence to religious rituals. It was a way for the Pharisees to maintain their sense of superiority and control over others.

3. Jesus challenges the Pharisees' focus on external rituals and traditions, pointing out that true defilement comes from within, from the thoughts and intentions of the heart. He emphasizes the importance of inner purity and righteousness over outward displays of religious observance.

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Washing before meals was along regarded as a commandment; washing after meals only as a duty."
2. "The distinctive designation for washing after meals was the lifting of the hands; while for washing before meat a term was used which meant, literally, to rub."
3. "The water was poured on both hands, which must be free of anything covering them, such as gravel, mortar, etc. The hands were lifted up so as to make the water run to the wrist, in order to insure that the whole hand was washed, and that the water polluted by the hand did not again run down the fingers."

### John Calvin:
1. "But as there are various kinds of human traditions, we must make some distinction among them. Some are manifestly wicked, for they inculcate acts of worship which are wicked and diametrically opposed to the word of God."
2. "The fault lay in this, that they did not think that God could be properly worshipped in any other way."
3. "For they wash not their hands. The ground of offense is explained more fully by Mark; but the substance of his explanation is, that many things were practiced by the scribes, which they had voluntarily undertaken to keep."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The Jews attached greater value to tradition than even to the written law, appealing in support of it to Deuteronomy 4:14; Deuteronomy 17:10."
2. "The washing referred to was not an act of cleanliness, but a ceremonial washing, performed with scrupulous care."
3. "Our Lord opposes, not the custom, but the principle they assumed. Notice the belittling influence of legalism."
