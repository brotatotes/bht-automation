In this verse, Jesus encounters opposition from the Pharisees, who accuse His disciples of not performing the traditional handwashing before eating. Jesus challenges their emphasis on external rituals, explaining that true defilement comes from within the heart, not unwashed hands. He emphasizes the importance of inner transformation and true repentance, calling for a deeper understanding of righteousness that goes beyond religious customs. The Pharisees prioritize tradition, but Jesus focuses on matters of the heart and the renewal of one's inner being.
