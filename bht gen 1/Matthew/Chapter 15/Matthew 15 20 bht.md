This commentary underscores the profound impact of internal impurities compared to external actions. It highlights the consequences of harboring evil within oneself, as it corrupts both body and soul, leading to guilt and eternal punishment. The commentator also emphasizes that neglecting to perform certain rituals, like washing hands before a meal, does not carry the same weight of moral defilement.
