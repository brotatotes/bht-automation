# Matthew 15:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we witness the tremendous impact of Jesus' grace on the Gentiles. Through the example of the woman from Canaan, we learn about the power of unwavering faith and humility in approaching Jesus. Despite the initial challenges and rejection, the woman's persistent faith and recognition of Jesus' authority pave the way for her miraculous encounter with His mercy and grace. This encounter serves as both a test of her faith and a reminder of the profound understanding of our own unworthiness and dependence on God's grace.
