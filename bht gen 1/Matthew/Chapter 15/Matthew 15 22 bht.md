## BHT:
In this Bible verse, we encounter a woman of Canaan, a Gentile who cries out to Jesus, recognizing Him as the Son of David, the long-awaited Messiah. Though not belonging to the Lord's flock, she displays a taste of piety and forms her faith through both Jewish expressions and the law and prophets. The woman's desperate cry for mercy reveals her genuine faith in Christ's power to heal and deliver, making her daughter's plight her own.
