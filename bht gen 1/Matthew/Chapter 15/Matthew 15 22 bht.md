# Matthew 15:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
There is a story of a woman, not from the Jewish race, who approached Jesus with a desperate plea for help. She was a Canaanite, her background steeped in paganism and residing on the borders of Palestine. Despite her pagan roots, she showed an extraordinary faith in Jesus. She recognized Him as the Son of David, alluding to her knowledge of the promised Messiah. She cried out to Him from afar, fully believing in His power and authority over all things. Her earnest request showcased her unwavering faith.
