# Matthew 15:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, Jesus encounters a Canaanite woman who pleads for his help. The disciples, lacking compassion, ask Jesus to send her away. Jesus initially remains silent, testing her faith and teaching his disciples a valuable lesson. Despite the silence, Jesus eventually grants her request, showing his willingness to respond to persistent faith. This encounter challenges us to examine our own biases and reminds us to trust in God's timing even in moments of apparent silence.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The reason alleged by the disciples must be coupled with our Lord's unwillingness to be known." 
2. "She will draw the attention of all upon us." 
3. "The word 'ἀπόλυσον' does not necessarily imply granting her request, nor the contrary; but simply dismiss her, leaving the method to our Lord Himself."

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "But he answered her not a word." This silence from Jesus may seem harsh, but it serves a purpose. It tests the woman's faith and persistence, allowing her to demonstrate her unwavering trust in Jesus despite his initial silence.
2. "Send her away; for she crieth after us." The disciples' request to send the woman away reveals their lack of compassion and understanding. They view her as a nuisance, but Jesus sees an opportunity for her to experience a profound encounter with his grace and power.
3. "This encounter challenges us to examine our own attitudes towards those who are different from us." The story of the Canaanite woman reminds us to confront our biases and prejudices. Jesus' eventual response to her shows that he values every person, regardless of their background, and encourages us to do the same.

### Marvin Vincent:

### Philip Schaff:
1. "By this unwonted silence our Lord would try her faith; and prove it to His disciples."
2. "They were Jews, and must learn to intercede for a heathen woman, before they could carry the gospel to the Gentiles."
3. "Their language was not selfish, but a recognition of the woman's importunate earnestness, perhaps of her faith."

### John Gill:
1. "Not that he did not hear her, or that he despised either her person or petition, or that he was not moved with it; but to continue her importunity, and try her faith, and make it manifest."
2. "This giving her no answer, either that he would, or would not help her, carried in it a tacit repulse of her, and a denial of assistance to her."
3. "Her case was so moving, was delivered in such an affecting manner, and her cries were piercing, that they could not bear them; and therefore entreat him, that he would relieve, and dismiss her."

### John Wesley:
1. "He answered her not a word" - This silence from Jesus can be seen as a test of faith, as he sometimes challenges us to trust in him even when it seems like he is not responding to our prayers or pleas.

2. "He sometimes tries our faith in like manner" - Jesus may intentionally put us through moments of silence or unanswered prayers to strengthen our faith and deepen our reliance on him.

3. "He answered her not a word" - This lack of response from Jesus can also serve as a reminder that God's timing is not always our own, and that we must patiently wait for his perfect plan to unfold.
