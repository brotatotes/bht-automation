## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The reason alleged by the disciples must be coupled with our Lord’s unwillingness to be known, stated by Mark."
2. "She will draw the attention of all upon us."
3. "The word ἀπόλυσον does not necessarily imply granting her request, nor the contrary; but simply dismiss her, leaving the method to our Lord Himself."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "But he answered her not a word." This silence from Jesus may seem harsh, but it serves as a test of the woman's faith and persistence. It reveals that sometimes God's apparent silence is an invitation for us to press in and seek Him even more earnestly.

2. "Send her away; for she crieth after us." The disciples' response to the woman's pleas reflects a common human tendency to dismiss those who are in need or inconvenient to us. It reminds us to examine our own hearts and attitudes towards others, and to be willing to extend compassion and help even when it may be inconvenient for us.

3. "His disciples came and besought him." The disciples' intercession on behalf of the woman demonstrates the importance of intercessory prayer. It reminds us of our role as believers to stand in the gap for others, bringing their needs before God and seeking His mercy and intervention on their behalf.

### John Calvin:
1. "Here they bring before us her unshaken constancy; for the silence of Christ was a sort of refusal, and there is reason to wonder that she was not cast down by this trial, but her continuance in prayer was a proof of her perseverance."
2. "But as Christ has two ways of speaking and of being silent, it must be observed, that though he withheld at that time the words of his mouth, yet he spoke within to the mind of the woman, and so this secret inspiration was a substitute for the outward preaching."
3. "We see then that the design of Christ’s silence was not to extinguish the woman’s faith, but rather to whet her zeal and inflame her ardor."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "By this unwonted silence our Lord would try her faith; and prove it to His disciples."
2. "They were Jews, and must learn to intercede for a heathen woman, before they could carry the gospel to the Gentiles."

1. "The disciples greatly disliked this form of public attention, a strange woman crying after them."
2. "They disliked a sensation."
3. "Did they wish the woman sent away with her daughter healed or unhealed?"

### John Gill:
1. "Not that he did not hear her, or that he despised either her person or petition, or that he was not moved with it; but to continue her importunity, and try her faith, and make it manifest."
2. "This giving her no answer, either that he would, or would not help her, carried in it a tacit repulse of her, and a denial of assistance to her."
3. "Her case was so moving, was delivered in such an affecting manner, and her cries were piercing, that they could not bear them; and therefore entreat him, that he would relieve, and dismiss her."

### John Wesley:
1. "He answered her not a word" - This silence from Jesus can be seen as a test of faith, as he sometimes allows us to experience moments of silence to strengthen our trust in him.

2. "He sometimes tries our faith in like manner" - Jesus may intentionally withhold an immediate response to our prayers or pleas, not because he is indifferent, but to test and refine our faith in him.

3. "This silence from Jesus can be seen as a test of faith" - The lack of an immediate answer should not discourage us, but rather serve as an opportunity to deepen our reliance on God and grow in our faith.
