# Matthew 15:26 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we see a gentle response that is neither harsh nor a refusal. It is an invitation for the woman to demonstrate her faith and also serves to convince the disciples of the acceptability of blessing someone outside their own community. The blessings referred to in the verse were originally intended for the Jews, but the woman skillfully draws a parallel using the imagery of household dogs, thus cleverly highlighting her worthiness to receive them.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Philip Schaff:
1. "The reply is not harsh, nor is it a refusal... It calls forth the woman's faith, and convinces the disciples that it is 'proper' to bless this heathen woman."
2. "All present understood this as referring to the blessings provided for the Jews."
3. "A reference to the large savage dogs so common in the East, would be very contemptuous; household dogs are meant; a sense the woman skillfully used."
