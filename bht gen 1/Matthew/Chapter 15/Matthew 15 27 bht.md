# Matthew 15:27 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, a woman responds to Jesus with remarkable understanding and humility. She accepts His word and uses it to make her case, displaying both quickness of mind and true wisdom. Although Jesus initially refers to her as "one of the children," she humbly recognizes her place as a humble dependent, content with receiving even the smallest blessings, like crumbs. Her persevering faith allows her to see the mind of Christ beyond outward appearances, revealing a deep understanding of His true character.
