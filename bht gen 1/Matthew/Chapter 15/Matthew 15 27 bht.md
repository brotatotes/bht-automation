# Matthew 15:27 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, a woman humbly accepts the label given to her by Jesus and uses it as the basis of her plea, recognizing her unworthiness but still longing for His mercy. With quick wit, she turns the term "dogs" to her advantage, acknowledging the distinction between the children and the Gentiles, yet appealing to their common Lord. She desires only a small crumb of mercy for her daughter, understanding that it is a small favor compared to the multitude of blessings given to the children.
