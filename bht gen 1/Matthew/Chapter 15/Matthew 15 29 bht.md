# Matthew 15:29 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In a mountainous and solitary district near the eastern shore of the Sea of Galilee, Jesus sat down, assuming the posture of a teacher. He chose this specific location, known for its scenic beauty and proximity to the sea, in order to teach and minister to the crowds that gathered around him. Though he may have sought rest and solitude, his dedication to imparting wisdom and healing prevailed, making him even more public in those parts. Known by different names, this large lake was a familiar backdrop for Jesus' teachings.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Departed thence. (Mark 8:31 is fuller.) He probably made a circuit, passing southeastward, through the northern part of the Decapolis at the foot of the Lebanon range, reaching the mountainous (and solitary) district on the eastern shore of the Sea of Galilee." 

2. "To obtain here the rest He had sought in 'the parts of Tyre and Sidon.'"

3. "And sat there. To sit down was the attitude of a teacher, and the people, conscious of their need, came to Him to be taught."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "And sat there" - The act of sitting indicates a position of authority and teaching. Jesus, in his wisdom and compassion, chose to sit and teach the people gathered around him, inviting them to listen and learn from his words.

2. "On the mountain side near the sea of Galilee" - Jesus intentionally chose a location that provided a picturesque backdrop for his teaching. This setting not only allowed the people to appreciate the beauty of creation but also served as a reminder of God's power and presence.

3. "Possibly to rest and to enjoy the view or more likely to teach" - While Jesus may have sought a moment of rest and solitude, his primary purpose was to impart spiritual wisdom and guidance to the people. His willingness to prioritize teaching over personal comfort demonstrates his dedication to fulfilling his mission and ministering to those in need.

### John Gill:
1. "Jesus departed...being discovered, and knowing that the fame of this last miracle would make him more public in those parts, he removed."
