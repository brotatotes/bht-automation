# Matthew 15:29 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
On the coast of the sea, Jesus arrived at a mountainous area, possibly for rest and teaching. His deliberate choice to engage with the crowd and his posture of authority while sitting indicate his compassion and desire to guide and teach. The fame of his miracles made him more public, leading him to seek solitude and prayer on the mountain side near the sea of Galilee. This area, also known as the sea of Tiberias and the lake of Gennesareth, lay on the borders of Galilee, near the city of Tiberias.
