# Matthew 15:30 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In a secluded place, he found little rest, for the crowds brought a multitude of afflicted individuals to him. Among them were those who were unable to walk, with loss or impairment of limbs, they sought his healing touch. The spectrum of ailments extended beyond the physical, as the blind and dumb also sought solace, along with others burdened by various illnesses. With a word, a touch, or simply the divine power emanating from him, he granted immediate relief and restored their well-being.

1. "These flocked to him, having with them, in their hands, or arms, or upon their backs, or shoulders, leading some, and carrying others, in some form or another, those that were lame; either in their legs, or arms: blind; in one eye, or both, and that either from their birth, or since: dumb: the word signifies both deaf and dumb: these often meet in the same person: and if a man is born deaf, he is always dumb: maimed: having lost a limb, an arm, or a leg, or so enfeebled by some disease or another, as the palsy, that their limbs were useless to them."
