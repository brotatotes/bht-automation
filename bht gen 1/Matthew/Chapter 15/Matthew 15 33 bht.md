# Matthew 15:33 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the face of a seemingly impossible task, the disciples' doubts and concerns were highlighted by their forgetfulness of past proofs of Christ's power and grace. Their lack of faith mirrored our own tendency to be drawn away from contemplating divine benefits. However, despite their doubts, the disciples were faced with the reality that they were in a desolate place with a multitude of people to feed, making the challenge even greater.
