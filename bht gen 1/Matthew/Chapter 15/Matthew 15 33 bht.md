# Matthew 15:33 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the midst of a wilderness, the disciples struggle with disbelief, despite previously witnessing the power and grace of Christ. Their forgetfulness and unbelief, echoed in the questioning of the disciples, highlights their lack of trust in divine provision. The disciples' astonishment at the task of feeding a great multitude in a desolate place foreshadows the challenges faced in meeting their needs. The repetition of nature miracles serves as a reminder that God's assistance is not limited by past experiences, but can be expected in the future as well.
