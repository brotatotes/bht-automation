# Matthew 15:35 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, Jesus demonstrates his authority as he feeds a multitude, disregarding the smallness of provisions and consulting only with his disciples. Understanding his power to increase the food, he orders the people to sit down on the ground, symbolizing their humble position and reliance on him. The absence of grass in this desolate wilderness further emphasizes the scarcity of resources and highlights the harsh conditions of midsummer.
