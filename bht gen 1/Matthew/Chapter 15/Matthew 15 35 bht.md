# Matthew 15:35 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the multitude sits down on the ground, as observed in the occasion of feeding the five thousand when they sat on the grass. However, on this present occasion, the grass would be parched and gone. The absence of grass highlights the harshness of the environment, emphasizing the disciples' presence in a barren and desolate place. Jesus, in his authority, orders them to sit down upon the ground in rows, showing his power to increase the small provisions and his determination to feed the multitude before dismissing them.
