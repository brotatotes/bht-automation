# Matthew 15:37 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we witness a scene of abundance and provision that left no one overlooked or neglected, as every person received a satisfying portion. The disciples, displaying careful stewardship, not only distributed to each individual but also gathered the leftover fragments, collecting an astonishing amount of provisions in seven baskets. This act of collecting the fragments served as a fulfilling reminder of the generous returns yielded from their initial offering of loaves and fishes.
