# Matthew 15:39 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, the exact location is unclear. It is referred to as Magadan or Magdala, and there is some ambiguity as to whether these are the same place or distinct locations. The verse conveys that Jesus and his disciples departed to the outskirts or boundaries of Magadan, a region in Galilee near the Sea of Galilee. After dismissing the people, Jesus and his disciples went into a ship, possibly seeking solitude and rest in the mountains of Magdala or a nearby area.
