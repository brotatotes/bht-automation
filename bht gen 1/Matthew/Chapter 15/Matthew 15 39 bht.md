# Matthew 15:39 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In an obscure location, sandwiched between two known places, our Lord sought refuge in Magdala (or Magadan). Scholars are divided on its exact location; however, most agree that it was situated on the western shore of the lake, in close proximity to Tiberias. It is said to be north of Tiberias and directly east of Cana. Fleeting and veiled, Magdala was a sanctuary for Jesus during a time of increasing hostility.
