# Matthew 15:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, it is portrayed that individuals were using the phrase "Corban" or "gift" to evade their responsibility of supporting their parents, under the guise of dedicating their resources to religious purposes. The commentators argue that this tradition went against the commandment to honor one's father and mother, and that it nullified the command of God. The act of giving is depicted as a selfless sacrifice, redirecting resources that could have benefited the individual, ultimately showing the importance of fulfilling one's duty to care for their parents.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The expression cited by our Lord did not always bind the utterer to consecrate his property to religious uses, but was by its mere utterance sufficient to absolve him from the duty of caring for his parents."
2. "Such an one will certainly not honour his father or his mother."
3. "The future ind. after οὐ μή makes the certainty more apparent: so καὶ τοῦτο γὰρ εὖ εἰδέναι χρὴ ὅτι οὐ μὴ δυνήσεται Κῦρος εὑρεῖν."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Whosoever shall say to his father or his mother, 'It is a gift' - or simply, 'A gift!' In Mark (Mark 7:11), it is, 'Corban!' that is, 'An oblation!' meaning, any unbloody offering or gift dedicated to sacred uses." 

2. "This was a practice among the Jews, by which they evaded the duty of supporting their parents, under the pretense that what they should have given to them was devoted to religious uses." 

3. "The Jews had a tradition that if a person devoted his property to religious uses, he was free from obligation to support his parents. This was a direct violation of the law of God."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The picture is that of a churlish son evading the duty of assisting his needy parents by uttering the formula, Corban, it is a gift to God."

3. "By a quibble it was regarded as something like Corban, as if it were laid on the altar and put entirely out of reach."

### John Calvin:
1. "The scribes were altogether wrong in acquitting those persons who fail to perform their duties to their parents, provided that this deficiency be supplied, on their part, by a voluntary sacrifice, which might have been omitted without offending God."
2. "For we must not understand Christ’s words to bear that the scribes had forbidden men to render all proper obedience; but they were so eager to pursue their own gain, that children were allowed, in the meantime, to neglect their duties to their parents."
3. "The meaning is, that the scribes were altogether wrong in acquitting those persons who fail to perform their duties to their parents, provided that this deficiency be supplied, on their part, by a voluntary sacrifice, which might have been omitted without offending God."

### Philip Schaff:

1. "They dodged this command of God about the penalty for dishonouring one's father or mother by the use 'Corban' (κορβαν) as Mark calls it (Mark 7:11)."
2. "All one had to do to evade one's duty to father or mother was to say 'Corban' or 'Gift' (Δωρον) with the idea of using the money for God."
3. "By an angry oath of refusal to help one's parents, the oath or vow was binding. By this magic word one set himself free (ου μη τιμησε, he shall not honour) from obedience to the fifth commandment."

### John Gill:
1. "The plain and evident sense of the tradition before us is this: that when, upon application being made to a man by his parents for support and sustenance, he makes a vow in such form as this, 'Corban, whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me,' that is, whatsoever profit or advantage thou mightest have, or expect to have from me, let it be as 'Corban,' as a gift devoted to God, that can never be revoked and converted to another use."
2. "So that our Lord might justly observe upon it as he does; thus have ye made the commandment of God of none effect, by your tradition: for if such a vow was valid, and a man was obliged to abide by it, according to the tradition of the elders, and not honour his father and mother, as the law of God requires; it is a plain case, that the command of God was made void by this tradition."
3. "And even, according to this determination, the vow stood firm till dissolved by one of their doctors: so that notwithstanding, Christ's argument is good, and the instance full to prove that for which he brought it."

### John Wesley:
1. "It is a gift by whatsoever thou mightest have been profited by me" - This quote highlights the act of giving as a selfless act, where the commentator suggests that the speaker is willingly giving up something that could have benefited them personally.

2. "I have given...what you might otherwise have had from me" - This quote emphasizes the intention behind the act of giving, suggesting that the speaker is intentionally redirecting their resources to the temple treasury instead of keeping it for themselves.

3. "I have given...what you might otherwise have had from me" - This quote also implies that the act of giving is a sacrifice, as the speaker is willingly foregoing something that they could have personally benefited from.
