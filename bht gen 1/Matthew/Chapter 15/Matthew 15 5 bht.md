# Matthew 15:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this particular Bible verse, commentators highlight the concept of using the phrase "it is a gift" or "Corban" as a way to avoid responsibility or neglect one's duty towards their parents. By dedicating their resources to God and using the term "gift" or "Corban," individuals were essentially absolving themselves from the duty of caring for their parents and contributing to their support. The commentators emphasize the conflict between God's commandments and the individual's self-imposed authority, highlighting the tension between tradition and personal responsibility towards family.
