# Matthew 15:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This verse emphasizes the significance of honoring one's parents, not only by providing for their physical well-being, but also by offering them financial support. It serves as a reminder that our obligation towards our parents surpasses meeting their mere necessities. The Pharisees are rebuked for using their religious traditions as an excuse to neglect their parents, as Jesus highlights that this behavior directly defies God's commandment. His response prompts introspection into our own attitudes towards honoring our parents, urging us to recognize that genuine worship extends beyond rituals and encompasses how we cherish and care for those closest to us.
