## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "The term 'hypocrites' is a scathing indictment of the religious leaders, exposing their outward show of piety while their hearts were far from God." 
2. "Jesus is quoting from the prophet Isaiah to highlight the irony of the religious leaders' behavior. They claim to honor God with their lips, but their hearts are far from Him."

1. "The word 'well' in this context carries the connotation of admiration and approval. It signifies that the action being described is praiseworthy and commendable."

2. "The use of the word 'well' suggests that the action being commended is not just good, but excellent. It implies that the person has gone above and beyond what is expected, demonstrating exceptional character and virtue."

3. "By using the word 'well,' the author emphasizes the moral and ethical significance of the action. It highlights the importance of living a righteous and upright life, and encourages others to follow the example set by the individual being praised."
