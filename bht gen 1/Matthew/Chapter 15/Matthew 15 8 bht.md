# Matthew 15:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The commentators collectively shed light on a Bible verse that emphasizes the importance of genuine worship and sincere devotion to God. They argue that merely going through the motions of religious practices or adhering to traditions is not sufficient. The verse implies that God desires a close, intimate relationship with His people, one that is characterized by a heartfelt connection and a desire to honor and glorify Him. Any spiritual distance or lack of genuine love for God is seen as a hindrance to true worship.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "By putting the commandments of men on a level with the divine requirements, their whole worship was rendered vain." 
2. "The drivelling nature of their multitudinous observances is here pointedly exposed, in contrast with the manly observance of 'the commandment of God'." 
3. "It is implied that He had but given a specimen of the hideous treatment which the divine law received, and the grasping disposition which, under the mask of piety, was manifested by the ecclesiastics of that day."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The phrase 'holds off from me' suggests a sense of distance or separation, indicating that the subject is not in close proximity or connection with the speaker."
2. "This verse implies a longing or desire for closeness, as the subject is described as being 'far' from the speaker. It highlights the yearning for a deeper connection or relationship."
3. "The word 'far' can also be understood metaphorically, representing a spiritual or emotional distance. It speaks to the idea of feeling distant from God or lacking a sense of intimacy with Him."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "This people, etc. The briefer form is now the established reading. Early copyists inserted the full form."
2. "Their heart is far from me. In the Hebrew: 'Their heart they have removed far from me.'"
3. "Applicable first to the contemporaries of Isaiah, but descriptive of the unbelieving Jews in all ages, and, as our Lord declares, peculiarly 'apt' at that time."

### John Gill:
1. "They approached the ordinances of God, and drew nigh to him, and attended him in outward worship; they prayed unto him publicly, and constantly, in the streets, in the synagogues, and temple, and with much seeming devotion and sanctity."
2. "They owned him to be their creator and preserver; they made their boast of him, and of their knowledge of him, as the one only living, and true God, and as the God of Israel; they brought their sacrifices of praise and thanksgiving, even the fruit of their lips, unto him, for their many peculiar mercies, privileges, and favours, as a nation, church, and people, and with much seeming sincerity and affection."
3. "They had no true love to God, nor faith in him, nor fear of him; they were not at all concerned for his presence with them, or for communion with him, or for his honour and glory; their hearts were in the world, and after their covetousness."

### John Wesley:
1. "Without a genuine heart connection to God, all outward acts of worship are empty and meaningless."
2. "True worship requires a close and intimate relationship with God, where our hearts are fully devoted to Him."
3. "God desires our hearts to be near to Him, not just our lips and actions."
