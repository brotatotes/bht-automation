## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The portion of Isaiah from which this citation is made sets forth, in alternate threatenings and promises, the punishment of the mere nominal Israel, and the salvation of the true Israel of God."
2. "Its threats and promises are for all times of the Church; the particular event then foretold being but one fulfillment of those deeper and more general declarations of God."
3. "The prophecy is nearly according to the LXX, which compare."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "By putting the commandments of men on a level with the divine requirements, their whole worship was rendered vain—a principle of deep moment in the service of God."
2. "The drivelling nature of their multitudinous observances is here pointedly exposed, in contrast with the manly observance of 'the commandment of God'."
3. "It is implied that He had but given a specimen of the hideous treatment which the divine law received, and the grasping disposition which, under the mask of piety, was manifested by the ecclesiastics of that day."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The phrase 'holds off from me' suggests a sense of distance or separation between the speaker and the subject. It implies that there is a gap or barrier that prevents the two from being close or connected."

2. "The word 'far' conveys a sense of distance, both physically and metaphorically. It implies that the subject is not within reach or easily accessible to the speaker. This distance can be interpreted as a symbol of the speaker's longing or desire for the subject."

3. "The use of the word 'holds off' implies that there is a deliberate action or choice involved in maintaining the distance. It suggests that the subject is intentionally keeping their distance from the speaker, perhaps due to personal reasons or circumstances."

4. "The phrase 'holds off from me' also implies a sense of longing or yearning on the part of the speaker. It suggests that the speaker desires to bridge the gap and establish a closer connection with the subject, but is unable to do so due to the subject's choice to maintain their distance."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "This people, etc. The briefer form is now the established reading. Early copyists inserted the full form."
2. "Their heart is far from me. In the Hebrew: ‘Their heart they have removed far from me.’"
3. "Applicable first to the contemporaries of Isaiah, but descriptive of the unbelieving Jews in all ages, and, as our Lord declares, peculiarly ‘apt ‘at that time."

### John Gill:
1. "They approached the ordinances of God, and drew nigh to him, and attended him in outward worship; they prayed unto him publicly, and constantly, in the streets, in the synagogues, and temple, and with much seeming devotion and sanctity."
2. "They owned him to be their creator and preserver; they made their boast of him, and of their knowledge of him, as the one only living, and true God, and as the God of Israel; they brought their sacrifices of praise and thanksgiving, even the fruit of their lips, unto him, for their many peculiar mercies, privileges, and favours, as a nation, church, and people, and with much seeming sincerity and affection."
3. "They had no true love to God, nor faith in him, nor fear of him; they were not at all concerned for his presence with them, or for communion with him, or for his honour and glory; their hearts were in the world, and after their covetousness."

### John Wesley:
1. "Without a sincere and genuine heart connection to God, all external acts of worship are empty and meaningless."
2. "True worship involves not just outward actions, but also a deep and intimate relationship with God."
3. "God desires a heartfelt devotion and genuine love from His people, not just empty rituals or religious performances."
