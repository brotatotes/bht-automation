# Matthew 16:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The adversaries of Jesus, the Galilean Sadducees and Pharisees, united in their hatred towards him, demanding a heavenly sign to challenge his miracles. But Jesus consistently responded with the sign of Jonas, baffling his enemies and capturing the attention of his disciples. Their obstinacy stemmed from their disbelief and formalism, disregarding signs that only the true God could give. Their increasing hostility and attempts to entrap Jesus reflected their deep-rooted animosity, refusing to yield to the truth. Their demands for grand signs were fueled by their expectation of a Messiah who would perform extraordinary miracles.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "What can be more natural than that the adversaries of our Lord should have met His miracles again and again with this demand of a sign from heaven?"
2. "For in the Jewish superstition it was held that d√¶mons and false gods could give signs on earth, but only the true God signs from heaven."
3. "And what more natural likewise, than that our Lord should have uniformly met the demand by the same answer, the sign of Jonas, one so calculated to baffle his enemies and hereafter to fix the attention of His disciples?"

### John Calvin:
1. "Obstinate men, whenever they are reduced to extremities, to avoid being compelled to yield to the truth, are accustomed to introduce something which is foreign to the subject." 
2. "Signs, by which Christ made himself familiarly known, are despised by them; and how much less will they derive advantage from a distant and obscure sign?" 
3. "In like manner, though ungodly men quarrel among themselves, their internal broils never prevent them from conspiring against God, and entering into a compact for joining their hands in persecuting the truth."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Opposition to the truth overbears other antagonisms."
2. "He never responded to doubt and disbelief; only to faith."
3. "Formalism and self-righteousness tend to superstition."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "The Pharisees and Sadducees...hated Jesus more than they did each other." 
2. "Their hostility has not decreased during the absence of Jesus, but rather increased."
3. "The devil had suggested that Jesus let the people see him drop down from the pinnacle of the temple and the people expected the Messiah to come from an unknown source who would do great signs."

### John Gill:
1. "These were Galilean Sadducees and Pharisees, of whom mention is made in the Misna...though these two sects could not agree in this, and in many other things, yet they could unite against Christ, to whom they bore an implacable hatred."
2. "They came with no sincere view to be taught by him, or learn anything from him; but if they could, to ensnare him, and get an opportunity of exposing him to the people."
3. "They wanted some such sign, as the standing still of the sun and moon, in the times of Joshua; and as raining manna, in the times of Moses; or some such appearances of thunder and lightning, as at the giving of the law."
