# Matthew 16:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the pure and uncorrupted word of God is contrasted with the inventions and teachings of men, as highlighted by John Calvin. This contrast is further explained by Philip Schaff, who emphasizes that the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees symbolizes hypocrisy. While the Pharisees represent hypocritical formalism and the Sadducees exemplify hypocritical liberalism, both cases ultimately point to the danger of straying from the true teachings of God. Thus, this verse serves as a warning against mixing personal beliefs with divine truth.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### John Calvin:
1. "The word leaven is very evidently used by Christ as contrasted with the pure and uncorrupted word of God."
2. "The naked truth of God, and the inventions which men contrive out of their own brain, are unquestionably the two things that are contrasted."
3. "All who mingle their own inventions with the word of God, or who advance anything that does not belong to it, must be rejected, how honorable soever may be their rank, or whatever proud titles they may wear."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The leaven of the Pharisees is 'hypocrisy.' But the Sadducees, the 'liberal Jews' of that age, went to the other extreme. The reference is, therefore, not to what they taught in common, but to the mode and spirit of their teaching."
2. "In both cases, hypocrisy; in the Pharisees hypocritical formalism, in the Sadducees hypocritical liberalism."
3. "Without Him strict morality ('Pharisees') and free inquiry ('Sadducees') inevitably become hypocritical."
