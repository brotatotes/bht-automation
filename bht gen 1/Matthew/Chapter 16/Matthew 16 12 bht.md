# Matthew 16:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, Jesus uses the metaphor of leaven to warn against the corrupting influence of false teachings. His statement is a contrast between the pure and uncorrupted word of God and the teachings of the Pharisees and Sadducees. The disciples initially misunderstood, thinking it had to do with physical leaven in bread. However, they eventually grasped the deeper meaning, understanding that Jesus was cautioning them about the doctrine and beliefs of these religious leaders. This revelation helped them discern the need to reject any teachings that were not in line with the word of God.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### John Calvin:
1. "The word leaven is very evidently used by Christ as contrasted with the pure and uncorrupted word of God."
2. "The sophist must not hope to escape by saying that this ought not to be understood as applicable to every kind of doctrine; for it will be impossible to find any doctrine but what has come from God that deserves the name of pure and unleavened."
3. "All who mingle their own inventions with the word of God, or who advance anything that does not belong to it, must be rejected, how honorable soever may be their rank, or whatever proud titles they may wear."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The leaven of the Pharisees is 'hypocrisy.' But the Sadducees, the 'liberal Jews' of that age, went to the other extreme. The reference is, therefore, not to what they taught in common, but to the mode and spirit of their teaching."
2. "In both cases, hypocrisy; in the Pharisees hypocritical formalism, in the Sadducees hypocritical liberalism. These two apparently antagonistic tendencies have been practically united ever since in opposing Christ."
3. "Without Him strict morality ('Pharisees') and free inquiry ('Sadducees') inevitably become hypocritical."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "They saw the point after this elaborate rebuke and explanation that by 'leaven' Jesus meant 'teaching.'" 
2. "The disciples finally grasped the deeper meaning behind Jesus' use of the term 'leaven'." 
3. "This revelation helped them understand that Jesus was warning them about the influence of false teachings."

### John Gill:
1. "They first took him in; imagining, because the Pharisees were very particular and precise what sort of leaven they made use of, that Christ forbad them buying bread that was made with leaven according to their directions."
2. "Now they perceived that he did not speak of this, but of the doctrine of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees."
3. "Our Lord calls their doctrine so, because it proceeded from thence, and was agreeable thereunto; and uses the phrase on purpose to expose it, and bring it into neglect and contempt."
