# Matthew 16:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In a quiet and distant retreat, Jesus sought solace and shared with His disciples the sad news of His approaching death. He questioned His disciples as they journeyed together, seeking their insight into what men in general believed about Him. This conversation took place in a secluded spot, where Jesus had been praying. The location where this conversation occurred was once known as Paneas and later beautified by Philip the Tetrarch into the city called Cesarea.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "This quiet and distant retreat Jesus appears to have sought with the view of talking over with the Twelve the fruit of His past labors, and breaking to them for the first time the sad intelligence of His approaching death."
2. "He had now closed the first great stage of His ministry, and was just entering on the last dark one. His spirit, burdened, sought relief in retirement, not only from the multitude, but even for a season from the Twelve."
3. "On rejoining His disciples, and as they were pursuing their quiet journey, He asked them this question."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The city was situated at the foot of Mount Hermon, and formerly bore the name Paneas." 
2. "Philip the Tetrarch beautified it, and called it Cesarea; his name (Philippi) being commonly added to distinguish it from Cesarea on the sea-coast." 
3. "He asked his disciples...from some retired spot, where He had been praying."

### John Gill:
1. "He calls himself 'the son of man', because he was truly and really man; and because of his low estate, and the infirmities of human nature, with which he was encompassed."
2. "The question is, not what sort of man he was, whether a holy, good man, or not, or whether the Messiah, or not; but the question is, what men in general, whether high or low, rich or poor, learned or unlearned, under the notion they had of him as a mere man, said of him."
3. "This question Christ put to his disciples, they being more conversant with the people than he, and heard the different opinions men had of him, and who were more free to speak their minds of him to them, than to himself."

### John Wesley:
1. "There was a large interval of time between what has been related, and what follows."
2. "The passages that follow were but a short time before our Lord suffered."
3. "Mark 8:27; Luke 9:18."
