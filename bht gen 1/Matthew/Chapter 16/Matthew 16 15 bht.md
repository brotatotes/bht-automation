# Matthew 16:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In a critical moment of Jesus' ministry, he asks his disciples, "But whom say ye that I am?" This question demands a personal and intimate confession of faith. Jesus seeks a decided expression of who he truly is, not just a general opinion or popular belief. Each individual is called to take ownership of their faith and openly declare their knowledge and belief in Jesus as the Messiah. It is not enough to simply believe in him; a true disciple is one who confidently knows and confesses Jesus as the Son of God.
