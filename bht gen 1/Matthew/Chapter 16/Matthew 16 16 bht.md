In a moment of divine revelation and boldness, a disciple proclaims a profound confession, acknowledging Jesus as the Son of the living God. This confession is not a mere acknowledgment but an expression of adoration and worship, recognizing the essential and eternal life within Jesus. It surpasses any doubts or perplexities, as it reveals a deep understanding of the divine nature of Christ, bringing forth a unified confession among the disciples. This confession precedes heavenly attestation and serves as a pivotal turning point in their understanding of Jesus' identity.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Feeling the light of his Master's glory shining in his soul, he breaks forth—not in a tame, prosaic acknowledgment, 'I believe that Thou art,' c.—but in the language of adoration—such as one uses in worship, 'THOU ART THE CHRIST, THE SON OF THE LIVING GOD!'"
2. "He first owns Him the promised Messiah, then he rises higher, echoing the voice from heaven—'This is My beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased'; and in the important addition—'Son of the LIVING GOD'—he recognizes the essential and eternal life of God as in this His Son."
3. "He does not say, 'Scribes and Pharisees, rulers and people, are all perplexed; and shall we, unlettered fishermen, presume to decide?' But feeling the light of his Master's glory shining in his soul, he breaks forth—not in a tame, prosaic acknowledgment, 'I believe that Thou art,' c.—but in the language of adoration."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Peter's reply is a decided, solemn, profound confession, that Jesus Christ is the Son of the living God in a specific sense."
2. "The doctrine of Christ's Person is not the result of human speculation, but a truth revealed by the Father of our Lord respecting His only Begotten Son."
3. "As at the beginning of His ministry our Lord received an attestation from man (John the Baptist) preceding the attestation of His Son-ship from heaven, so at this turning-point a confession from man precedes the renewed attestation from heaven on the mount of Transfiguration."

### John Gill:
1. "Thou art Christ, the Son of the living God: a short, but a very full confession of faith, containing the following articles: as that there is a God, that there is but one God; that he is the living God, has life in himself, is the fountain of life to others, and by this is distinguishable from the idols of the Gentiles."

2. "This confession, as it is uniform, and all of a piece, and consistent with itself, and is what all the disciples of Christ agreed in, so it greatly exceeds the most that can be made of the different sentiments of the people put together."

3. "They took him, one and all, to be but a mere man; their most exalted thoughts of him rose no higher: but in this he is acknowledged to be the Son of God, a phrase expressive of his divine nature, and distinct personality."
