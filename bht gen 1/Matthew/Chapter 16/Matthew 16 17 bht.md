## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "μακάριος, as in ch. Matthew 5:4, &c., is a solemn expression of blessing, an inclusion of him to whom it is addressed in the kingdom of heaven, not a mere word of praise."
2. "The reason of it is, the fact that the Father had revealed the Son to him."
3. "The name Simon Bar Jonas is doubtless used as indicating his fleshly state and extraction, and forming the greater contrast to his spiritual state, name, and blessing, which follow."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Peter, in this noble testimony to Christ, only expressed the conviction of all the Twelve."
2. "He alone seems to have had clear enough apprehensions to put that conviction in proper and suitable words."
3. "This is not the fruit of human teaching."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The word 'blessed' in this verse comes from the Greek word 'μακαριος' which means to be happy, fortunate, or well-off. It implies a state of deep contentment and satisfaction that goes beyond temporary circumstances."

2. "Being blessed is not about material wealth or worldly success, but about having a close relationship with God and experiencing His favor and grace in our lives."

3. "This verse reminds us that true happiness and fulfillment can only be found in God. It is a reminder to seek Him above all else and to trust in His provision and guidance."

### John Calvin:
1. "Christ justly pronounces him to be blessed who has honestly made such a confession."
2. "That every one may approach him with greater courage, we must first learn that all are by nature miserable and accursed, till they find a remedy in Christ."
3. "Whoever has obtained Christ wants nothing that is necessary to perfect happiness, since we have no right to desire anything better than the eternal glory of God, of which Christ puts us in possession."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Simon confesses his belief in the higher title of Christ; our Lord refers to Simon’s higher name, Peter."
2. "The knowledge was not from any human source."
3. "The real knowledge of Jesus as the Messiah, the Son of the living God, is and must be a matter of Divine revelation."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Jesus accepts the confession as true. Thereby Jesus on this solemn occasion solemnly claims to be the Messiah, the Son of the living God, his deity in other words."
2. "The disciples express positive conviction in the Messiahship or Christhood of Jesus as opposed to the divided opinions of the populace."
3. "The terms in which Jesus speaks of Peter are characteristic--warm, generous, unstinted. The style is not that of an ecclesiastical editor laying the foundation for church power, and prelatic pretentions, but of a noble-minded Master eulogizing in impassioned terms a loyal disciple."

### John Gill:
1. "Bar Jona signifies 'the son of a dove', and Bar Joanna signifies 'the son of one that is gracious'. Our Lord, by this appellation, puts Peter in mind of his birth and parentage, but does not pronounce him blessed on that account: no true blessedness comes by natural descent." 
2. "He was a blessed man, not by his first, but by his second birth; and the reason why our Lord makes mention of his father, is to observe to him, that he was the son of a mean man, and had had, but a mean education, and therefore his blessedness in general was not of nature, but of grace."
3. "The Gospel is a revelation, it consists of revealed truths; and which are to be received and believed upon the testimony and credit of the revealer, without entering into carnal reasonings, and disputes about them; and it is the highest reason, and the most noble use of reason, to embrace it at once, as coming from God."

### John Wesley:
1. "Flesh and blood" refers to one's own reason or natural power, highlighting the limitations of human understanding and ability.
2. This phrase emphasizes the need for divine revelation and guidance beyond human capabilities.
3. It suggests that relying solely on human wisdom and strength can hinder one's understanding of spiritual truths.
