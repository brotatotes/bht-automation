# Matthew 16:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Upon Peter's confession of faith, Jesus declares that he will build his Church, signifying the role of Peter as the first among equals, and the foundation of the Apostles. The term "rock" alludes to Peter's name, representing the faith which he has professed. This confession becomes the foundation upon which the Church is established, and the gates of hell, signifying the power and influence of Satan, will not prevail against it. Throughout the ages, a faithful remnant has remained, affirming the durability of the Church universal.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "That thou art Peter—At his first calling, this new name was announced to him as an honor afterwards to be conferred on him. Now he gets it, with an explanation of what it was meant to convey."
2. "Even in the Greek it is imperfectly represented. In French, as WEBSTER and WILKINSON remark, it is perfect, Pierre—pierre."
3. "My Church," says our Lord, calling the Church HIS OWN; a magnificent expression regarding Himself, remarks BENGEL—nowhere else occurring in the Gospels."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Thou art Peter ('petros'), and upon this rock ('petra') I will build my church." - The name Peter is given to Simon as a confessor, representing the other Apostles. This signifies his role as the first among equals and the one who represented the Apostles in their confession of faith.

2. "The Romanist view: Peter is referred to, but as the official head of the Twelve; as such the Bishop of Rome is his successor." - This view is inconsistent with the true nature of the architectural figure, as the foundation of a building is one and abiding, not constantly renewed and changed. It also involves an injustice to the other Apostles who are expressly called the foundation of the Church.

3. "Christ means His own Person. So Augustine and many excellent commentators." - This view claims that Peter is a living stone from Christ the true rock, and anyone who wants to become a living stone must make a true confession of Christ as the Rock on whom the Church will be built.

4. "My Church. This word occurs only twice in the Gospels... It refers to a congregation distinct from the Jewish, the first intimation of such a separation." - The term "My Church" signifies a congregation separate from the Jewish community, indicating the formation of a new dispensation of grace. The Church is an organized and visible congregation of the faithful, manifesting and extending the kingdom of heaven.

### John Wesley:
1. "On this rock - Alluding to his name, which signifies a rock, namely, the faith which thou hast now professed; I will build my Church." 
2. "And it is certain, that as he is spoken of in Scripture, as the only foundation of the Church, so this is that which the apostles and evangelists laid in their preaching."
3. "The gates of hell - As gates and walls were the strength of cities, and as courts of judicature were held in their gates, this phrase properly signifies the power and policy of Satan and his instruments."
4. "Shall not prevail against it - Not against the Church universal, so as to destroy it. And they never did. There hath been a small remnant in all ages."
