# Matthew 16:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, Jesus bestows upon Simon the name Peter, emphasizing his role as a foundation stone for the Church. Jesus declares that upon this rock, referring to Peter's confession and his role as a confessor, He will build His Church. The phrase "gates of Hades" symbolizes the formidable power of Satan and his kingdom that will not prevail against the Church. Through this play on words and rich metaphors, Jesus reveals his delight in Peter's confession and the eternal significance of the Church as a spiritual building founded on the faith in Christ, the true Rock.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "He was the first of those foundation-stones on which the living temple of God was built."
2. "Nothing can be further from any legitimate interpretation of this promise, than the idea of a perpetual primacy in the successors of Peter."
3. "The meaning of the promise is, that over the Church so built upon him who was by the strength of that confession the Rock, no adverse power should ever prevail to extinguish it."

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "That thou art Peter—At his first calling, this new name was announced to him as an honor afterwards to be conferred on him. Now he gets it, with an explanation of what it was meant to convey."
2. "Even in the Greek it is imperfectly represented. In French, as WEBSTER and WILKINSON remark, it is perfect, Pierre—pierre."
3. "My Church," says our Lord, calling the Church HIS OWN; a magnificent expression regarding Himself, remarks BENGEL—nowhere else occurring in the Gospels."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Thou art Peter." - The name Peter is bestowed on Simon as a proper name, but without losing its meaning as a common noun. It means a piece of rock, emphasizing Peter's role as a foundation stone for the church.

2. "On this rock will I build." - The word "rock" refers to Peter himself, in a sense defined by his previous confession and as enlightened by the "Father in Heaven." The reference to Peter as the rock is natural and strengthens the metaphor of Christ as the architect of the church.

3. "Gates of Hades." - The expression "Gates of Hades" is an orientalism for the court, throne, power, and dignity of the infernal kingdom. It represents the formidable and frowning portals of Hades, which confront and assault the church that Christ will build upon the rock.

### John Calvin:
1. "By these words Christ declares how highly he is delighted with the confession of Peter, since he bestows upon it so large a reward."
2. "Peter receives a twofold honor, the former part of which relates to his personal advantage, and the latter to his office as an Apostle."
3. "Hence it is evident how the name Peter comes to be applied both to Simon individually, and to other believers. It is because they are founded on the faith of Christ, and joined together, by a holy consent, into a spiritual building, that God may dwell in the midst of them."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The phrase refers to Peter, but as a confessor, as in Christ, representing the other Apostles. This explains both the resemblance and the difference of the words: 'Petros' and 'petra;' it is on the whole preferable."
2. "The Romanist view: Peter is referred to, but as the official head of the Twelve; as such the Bishop of Rome is his successor. Were this correct, Mark and Luke would not have failed to record the saying in their accounts of this interview."
3. "Christ means His own Person. So Augustine (in later years) and many excellent commentators. This view claims that petros means a stone and petra a rock, so that Peter is a living stone from Christ the true rock, and whosoever would become a living stone, a 'petros,' must make this true confession of Christ, the Rock, on whom as God and man the Church will be built."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "The emphasis is not on 'Thou art Peter' over against 'Thou art the Christ,' but on Καγω: 'The Father hath revealed to thee one truth, and I also tell you another."
2. "What did Jesus mean by this word-play?"
3. "It is a great spiritual house, Christ's Israel, not the Jewish nation, which he describes."
4. "The perpetuity of this church general is guaranteed."
5. "The gates of Hades or bars of Sheol will not close down on it. Christ will rise and will keep his church alive."

### John Gill:
1. "By the church, is meant, not an edifice of wood, stones, c. but an assembly, and congregation of men and that not of any sort; not a disorderly, tumultuous assembly, in which sense this word is sometimes taken; nor does it design the faithful of a family, which is sometimes the import of it; nor a particular congregated church, but the elect of God, the general assembly and church of the first born, whose names are written in heaven."
2. "These materials are of different sorts, and have a different place, and have a different usefulness in this building; some are only as common stones, and timber; others are as pillars, beams, and rafters; and all are useful and serviceable; and being put, and knit together, grow up as an holy temple to the Lord."
3. "Christ is a rock that is higher than they, where they find safety in times of distress, and the shadow of which is refreshing to them; and therefore betake themselves to him for shelter, and where they are secure from the wrath of God, and rage of men."

### John Wesley:
1. "On this rock - Alluding to his name, which signifies a rock, namely, the faith which thou hast now professed; I will build my Church." 
2. "And it is certain, that as he is spoken of in Scripture, as the only foundation of the Church, so this is that which the apostles and evangelists laid in their preaching."
3. "The gates of hell - As gates and walls were the strength of cities, and as courts of judicature were held in their gates, this phrase properly signifies the power and policy of Satan and his instruments."
