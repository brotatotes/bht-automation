# Matthew 16:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse describes a significant event in the early Church where Peter, as an apostle, played a pivotal role. He opened the Church to both Jews and Gentiles, exercising his authority to admit and exclude. This authority was not exclusive to Peter alone, but extended to all disciples of Jesus throughout history. The power of binding and loosing, which included acts of discipline, was given to Peter and the other apostles, with divine confirmation. This verse highlights the foundational work and special responsibilities of the apostles in establishing the Church.
