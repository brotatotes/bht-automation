# Matthew 16:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, Jesus gives Peter the power to open the gates of salvation to both Jews and Gentiles, using the metaphorical "keys of the kingdom of heaven." This authority is not exclusive to Peter, but extends to all disciples of Jesus. Through preaching the Gospel, ministers and teachers fulfill the role of stewards, opening the treasury of God's word to others. The power to bind and loose encompasses the apostles' exercise of authority in matters of discipline, which God confirms in heaven.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Another personal promise to Peter, remarkably fulfilled in his being the first to admit both Jews and Gentiles into the Church; thus using the power of the keys to open the door of salvation."
2. "Those who deny the reference of Mat 16:18 to St. Peter, will find it very difficult to persuade any unbiassed Greek scholar, that the καὶ δώσω σοί, with σοι thus lying unemphatically behind the verb, is not a continuation of a previous address, but a change of address altogether."
3. "But strictly considered, the binding and loosing belong to the power of legislation in the Church committed to the Apostles, in accordance with the Jewish way of using the words אסר and התיר for prohibuit and licitum fecit."

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Whatever this mean, it was soon expressly extended to all the apostles...the claim of supreme authority in the Church, made for Peter by the Church of Rome, and then arrogated to themselves by the popes as the legitimate successors of St. Peter, is baseless and impudent."
2. "As first in confessing Christ, Peter got this commission before the rest; and with these 'keys,' on the day of Pentecost, he first 'opened the door of faith' to the Jews, and then, in the person of Cornelius, he was honored to do the same to the Gentiles."
3. "One thing is clear, that not in all the New Testament is there the vestige of any authority either claimed or exercised by Peter, or conceded to him, above the rest of the apostles—a thing conclusive against the Romish claims in behalf of that apostle."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Even as he had been the first to utter the confession of the church, so was he also privileged to be the first to open its hitherto closed gates to the Gentiles." 
2. "No other terms were in more constant use in Rabbinic canon-law than those of binding and loosing. They represented the legislative and judicial powers of the Rabbinic office." 
3. "This legislative authority conferred upon Peter can only wear an offensive aspect when it is conceived of as possessing an arbitrary character, and as being in no way determined by the ethical influences of the Holy Spirit."

### John Calvin:
1. "We know that there is no other way in which the gate of life is opened to us than by the word of God; and hence it follows that the key is placed, as it were, in the hands of the ministers of the word."
2. "The doctrine of the Gospel is, therefore, declared to be appointed for loosing our bonds, that, being loosed on earth by the voice and testimony of men, we may be actually loosed in heaven."
3. "The reason why the ungodly become so daring and presumptuous is, that they imagine they have to deal with men. Christ therefore declares that, by the preaching of the Gospel, is revealed on the earth what will be the heavenly judgment of God, and that the certainty of life or death is not to be obtained from any other source."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The keys of the kingdom of heaven. Power to open and shut Peter first admitted Jews (on the day of Pentecost) and Gentiles (Cornelius) to the Church; and first excluded (Ananias and Sapphira; Simon Magus)."
2. "This promise in its full sense does not extend beyond the Apostles, who needed special power for their foundation work; for the keys are not the keys of the Church but ‘of the kingdom of heaven.’"
3. "The power seems to be judicial also (comp. chap. Matthew 18:17-18). This promise also is, in its full sense, applicable only to the Apostles."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "The same power here given to Peter belongs to every disciple of Jesus in all the ages."
2. "Peter held the keys precisely as every preacher and teacher does."
3. "Every preacher uses the keys of the kingdom when he proclaims the terms of salvation in Christ."

### John Gill:
1. "By the kingdom of heaven is meant the Gospel, which comes from heaven, declares the king Messiah to be come, speaks of things concerning his kingdom, is the means of setting it up, and enlarging it, displays the riches of his grace, and gives an account of the kingdom of heaven, and of persons' right unto it, and meetness for it."
2. "Keys are the ensigns of treasurers, and of stewards, and such the ministers of the Gospel are; they have the rich treasure of the word under their care, put into their earthen vessels to open and lay before others; and they are stewards of the mysteries and manifold grace of God, and of these things they have the keys."
3. "The sense of the words is this, that Peter, and so the rest of the apostles, should be empowered with authority from him, and so directed by his Holy Spirit, that whatever they bound, that is, declared to be forbidden, and unlawful, should be so: and that whatever they loosed, that is, declared to be lawful, and free of use, should be so."

### John Wesley:
1. "He first, after our Lord's resurrection, exercised the apostleship, Acts 1:15."
2. "And he first by preaching opened the kingdom of heaven, both to the Jews, Acts 2:14 etc., and to the Gentiles, Acts 10:34 etc."
3. "Under the term of binding and loosing are contained all those acts of discipline which Peter and his brethren performed as apostles: and undoubtedly what they thus performed on earth, God confirmed in heaven."
