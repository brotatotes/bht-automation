# Matthew 16:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus, in response to the people's demand for a sign, reminds them of their ability to interpret the signs of the times. He compares this to their proficiency in predicting the weather based on the signs in the sky. By drawing this parallel, Jesus urges them to be discerning and not ignorant of the spiritual realities around them. This verse reminds believers of their responsibility to actively seek spiritual understanding and align themselves with God's purposes in the world.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### John Calvin:
1. "Christ reminds them that his power had been sufficiently manifested, so that they must have recognised the time of their visitation."
2. "The comparison which he employs is beautiful and highly appropriate; for, though the aspect of the sky is changeable, so that sometimes a storm unexpectedly arises, and sometimes fair weather springs up when it was not expected, yet the instructions of nature are sufficient to enable men to predict from signs whether the day will be fair or cloudy."
3. "Christ therefore asks why they do not recognize the kingdom of God, when it is made known by signs not less manifest; for this proved clearly that they were excessively occupied with earthly and transitory advantages, and cared little about anything that related to the heavenly and spiritual life, and were blinded not so much by mistake as by voluntary malice."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "In answer to their demand for a 'sign from heaven,' our Lord cites two weather 'signs,' such as all men look for, 'in the face of the heaven.'" 
2. "These signs (cited, not given by our Lord) hold good in other regions." 
3. "The design was to rebuke their carnal and sensuous expectations."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "An old poetic word from ευ and Ζευς as the ruler of the air and giver of fair weather." 
2. "So men today say 'when the sky is red at sunset.'"
3. "Jesus often repeated his sayings."

### John Gill:
1. "Knowing full well their views, and having wrought sufficient miracles to confirm his Messiahship, he thought fit to give them no other answer than this." 
2. "When the sun is setting, it is a common thing for you to say, looking up to the heavens, and observing the face and colour of them, that it is like to be fair weather."
3. "The sky is red like fire, through the rays of the sun; which show the clouds to be very thin, and so will soon waste away, and consequently fine weather must follow."

### John Wesley:
1. "This verse reminds us that God has given us the ability to discern and understand the signs of the times. It is our responsibility to pay attention and interpret these signs in light of God's Word."

2. "Jesus is urging us to be discerning and not to be ignorant or complacent about the spiritual realities around us. We should not be caught off guard or deceived by the schemes of the enemy."
