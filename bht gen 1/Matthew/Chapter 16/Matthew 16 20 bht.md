# Matthew 16:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, Jesus instructs his disciples not to reveal his true identity as the Messiah, emphasizing the distinction between their Christian acknowledgment and the worldly expectations of the Jews. He wanted to avoid provoking his enemies and premature attempts on his life. Instead, Jesus intended for people to recognize his Messianic role through his teachings and miraculous deeds. The disciples were to patiently wait for the appropriate time to openly declare Jesus as the Christ, namely after his resurrection, when it would carry the greatest weight and impact.
