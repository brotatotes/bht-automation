# Matthew 16:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
From the moment Peter made his confession, Jesus began to openly reveal the necessity of his suffering and death to his disciples. This prophecy was not given after the event, but rather, it was carefully and precisely spoken by Jesus himself. It was crucial for the disciples to understand that Jesus must go to Jerusalem to suffer at the hands of the Jewish authorities. This revelation prepared them for the ultimate sacrifice that Jesus would make for the redemption and salvation of mankind.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Certainly enough was known of such a prophecy to make the Jews set a watch over the grave, which of itself answers the objection." 
2. "Meyer in loc. reasons about the state of the disciples after the crucifixion just as if they had not suffered any remarkable overthrow of their hopes and reliances, and maintains that they must have remembered this precise prophecy if it had been given by the Lord."
3. "It is in the highest degree improbable that the precision should have been given to this prophecy after the event, as Meyer supposes: both from the character of the Gospel History in general and because of the carefulness and precision in the words added by Mark."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

### Marvin Vincent:

### John Gill:
1. "From the time that Peter made the confession concerning Jesus, he began to teach them more expressly, and to point out to them more clearly, and plainly, his sufferings and death, than he had done before." 
2. "This also furnishes out some reasons why Jesus would not have his disciples, for the present, declare him to be the Messiah, that his death might not, by any means, be prevented, which was so necessary."
3. "The word 'must', not only belongs to his going to Jerusalem, but to his sufferings, death, and resurrection; all which must be because of the immutable decree of God, the council, and covenant of grace, and peace, the prophecies of the Old Testament, and the redemption and salvation of God's elect."

### John Wesley:
