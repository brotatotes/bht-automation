# Matthew 16:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
From that time forth, Jesus began to show his disciples more openly that he must go to Jerusalem and suffer greatly. This revelation of his impending suffering was necessary and a key part of his ministry. His rejection by the religious leaders would not be as before, but through formal actions. His suffering and death were part of God's unchangeable plan for redemption and must come to pass, regardless of human expectations.
