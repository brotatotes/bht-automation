# Matthew 16:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the disciples are taken aback by Jesus' announcement, leading Peter to impetuously reprimand Him. Peter's words display his lack of understanding and his own desires for Jesus to avoid suffering. However, Peter's rebuke is driven by concern and respect, rather than ill will. Despite his good intentions, Peter's statement reflects his own limited perspective and opposition to God's ultimate plan.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Presuming on the distinction just conferred on him; showing how unexpected and distasteful to them all was the announcement."
2. "Affectionately, yet with a certain generous indignation, to chide Him."
3. "The same spirit that prompted him in the garden to draw the sword in His behalf."

### John Calvin:
1. "Still, it was highly presumptuous in Peter to advise our Lord to spare himself, as if he had been deficient in prudence or self-command." 
2. "But so completely are men hurried on and driven headlong by inconsiderate zeal, that they do not hesitate to pass judgment on God himself, according to their own fancy."
3. "And here we learn what estimation in the sight of God belongs to what are called good intentions. So deeply is pride rooted in the hearts of men, that they think wrong is done them, and complain, if God does not comply with everything that they consider to be right."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Peter took him... and began to rebuke him." - Peter's actions and words reveal his impulsive nature and lack of understanding of God's plan.
2. "Be it far from thee, Lord." - Peter's plea for Jesus to spare himself shows his human desire to avoid suffering and sacrifice.

### John Gill:
1. "He took him aside, by himself; and... began to rebuke him: reprove and chide him, forgetting himself and his distance; though he did it not out of passion and ill will, but out of tenderness and respect."
2. "The phrase... stands in the Syriac version here... Some think the word 'God' is to be understood, and the words to be considered, either as a wish, 'God be propitious to thee': or 'spare thee', that no such thing may ever befall thee; or as an affirmation, 'God is propitious to thee', he is not angry and displeased with thee, as ever to suffer any such thing to be done to thee."
3. "This shall not be done unto thee: expressing his full assurance of it, and his resolution to do all that in him lay to hinder it: he could not see how such an innocent person could be so used by the chief men of the nation; and that the Messiah, from whom so much happiness was expected, could be treated in such a manner, and especially that the Son of the living God should be killed."
