# Matthew 16:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, we see Peter's swift transition from faith to weakness, as Henry Alford explains, "the expression of spiritual faith may, and frequently does, precede the betraying of carnal weakness." While Peter's intentions may have been well-meaning, as Philip Schaff notes, he lacked understanding and acceptance of God's plan for Jesus' suffering and sacrifice. However, Archibald T. Robertson acknowledges that Peter's actions were not driven by ill intent but rather by tenderness and respect. Despite this, John Gill highlights Peter's bold proclamation that he would do everything in his power to prevent the fulfillment of God's plan.

3. "I cannot think with Winer (§ 56. 3) that this means, ‘absit, ne accidat;’ it is an authoritative declaration, as it were, on Peter’s part, This shall not happen to Thee, implying that he knew better, and could ensure his Divine Master against such an event."
