# Matthew 16:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, there is a satanic lure, a whisper from hell, trying to distract Jesus from His purpose to suffer. Peter, the mouthpiece of hell in a moment of forgetfulness, receives a sharp reproof from Jesus. The influence of Satan is at work, hindering the redemption of mankind and giving deadly advice. This stumbling-block, reminiscent of Peter's name, acts the very part of Satan himself, trying to divert Jesus from the path to the Cross.

2. "Thou art acting the very part of Satan" - Thou art my enemy, while thou fanciest thyself most my friend; but also, Thou art acting the very part of Satan, both by endeavoring to hinder the redemption of mankind, and by giving me the most deadly advice that can ever spring from the pit of hell.
