# Matthew 16:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse describes a confrontation between Jesus and one of His disciples, referred to as a stumbling stone. The disciple, whose lack of unity with the divine will makes him an adversary, tries to dissuade Jesus from fulfilling His purpose to suffer. Jesus firmly rebukes him, recognizing the satanic influence at work, urging him to align his desires with those of God, and reminding him that true wisdom comes from embracing the Lord's approval rather than clinging to human views.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Get thee behind me, ‘avaunt,’ ‘begone.’ Comp. chap. Matthew 4:10, where the same words are addressed to Satan himself."
