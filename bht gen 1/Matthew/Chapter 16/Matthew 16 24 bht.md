# Matthew 16:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This verse is a solemn sequel to our Lord's announcement respecting Himself and the rebuke of Peter, teaching that not only He, but also His followers, must suffer and self-deny. Unlike worldly leaders, Christ declares the darker side of His service, asking for willing followers who are willing to take up their cross and face their own destinies. It is through self-denial and bearing the cross of Christ that His disciples can truly embrace God's will at the expense of their own.
