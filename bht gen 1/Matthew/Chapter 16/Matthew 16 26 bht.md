# Matthew 16:26 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, commentators reflect on the tremendous value of the soul and the grave consequences of prioritizing worldly pursuits over eternal salvation. They warn that the pursuit of material gain and earthly affairs can lead to the loss of one's own soul, which was meant for greater purposes and immortality in heaven. The commentators emphasize the need to prioritize the worth of the soul, as gaining the world at its expense is a superficial gain that ultimately results in irrevocable loss.
