# Matthew 16:28 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This verse depicts the anticipation of a powerful and glorious manifestation of the kingdom of God. It serves as a pledge of both the imminent establishment and eventual victory of this new dispensation. While some may witness the destruction of the old dispensation in the form of the temple and the city, others will experience the growth of the Church and the reign of the Messiah in his mediatorial kingdom. Within the hearts of men, the kingdom of God already thrives, but climactic and consummative moments are still to come.
