# Matthew 16:28 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, Jesus assures his disciples that some of them will witness the establishment and triumph of his kingdom before they taste death.

These events serve as a confirmation of the certainty of Jesus' final victory and the transformative power of his kingdom, which brings heavenly glory and newness of life.
