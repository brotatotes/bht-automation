### John Calvin:
1. "He calls them hypocrites, because they pretend to ask that which, if it were exhibited to them, they are resolved not to observe."
2. "How comes it then that we feel no concern about the signs by which God invites us to himself? Is it not because every man gives himself up to willing indifference, and extinguishes the light which is offered to him?"
3. "They go farther, and believe that it is a mark of prudence purposely to avoid all inquiry into the truth; as if it were not an instance of shameful sloth that, while they are so eagerly solicitous about the objects of the flesh and of the earth, they neglect the eternal salvation of their souls."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The red at even of the Old Testament betokened fair weather at hand. Similarly, the red sky at the commencement of the New Testament, indicated the storm about to descend upon Israel. But they were incapable of understanding either one or other of these signs." (Lange’s Comm.)
2. "Ye can not. Not a question, but an assertion."
3. "The signs of the times, i.e., the fulfilment of prophecy; the miracles performed before them, showing that the Messiah had come. The Jews, with the promise of the Messiah, ought to have been as quick in discerning the signs of His coming, as those of the weather."

1. "When you rise in the morning, and take a survey of the heavens, it is a very usual thing with you to say, it is like to be windy or rainy weather today, for the sky is red and lowring; which shows, that the clouds are so thick that the sun cannot pierce through them, and its face is not seen; so that it may be reasonably concluded they will issue in rain, or wind, or both."
2. "Ye can discern the face of the sky; very distinctly, and make some very probable guesses, if not certain conclusions, what will follow, good weather or bad: but can ye not discern the signs of the times?"
3. "If they had not been blind, they might easily have discerned, that the signs of the time of the Messiah's coming were upon them, and that Jesus was the Messiah; as the departure of the sceptre from Judah, the ending of Daniel's weeks, the various miracles wrought by Christ, the wickedness of the age in which they lived, the ministry of John the Baptist, and of Christ, the great flockings of the people, both to one and to the other, with divers other things which were easy to be observed by them."
