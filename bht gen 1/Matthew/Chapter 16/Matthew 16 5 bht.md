# Matthew 16:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the conversation takes place after a voyage, with provisions being forgotten and neglected upon landing. The disciples' forgetfulness may have been caused by their preoccupation with Jesus' conversation or the suddenness of His departure. Their failure to understand Jesus' warning about the leaven of the Pharisees reveals their spiritual blindness and lack of discernment. Jesus uses this metaphor to caution against the subtle influence of false teachings, emphasizing the need for believers to be vigilant and guard against corruption in their faith.
