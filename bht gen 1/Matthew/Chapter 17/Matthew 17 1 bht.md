# Matthew 17:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, after about a week, Jesus took Peter, James, and John to a secluded place, possibly at night. The transfiguration took place during this time, with Peter acknowledging Jesus as the eternal Son of God. This moment of divine revelation shows Jesus in all His glory and serves as a testimony to the truth of His identity. Despite Peter's earlier offense, Jesus forgives him and continues to love him. The transfiguration itself is seen as a remarkable event, better observed at night than during the day.
