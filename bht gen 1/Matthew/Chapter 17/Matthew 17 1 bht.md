# Matthew 17:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In a moment of solitude and seclusion, Jesus intentionally selects three disciples - the inner group of Peter, James, and John - to accompany him up the Mount of Transfiguration. It is likely that this profound event took place at night, allowing for a more prominent display of the glorification and divine power of Jesus. Within this exclusive setting, Jesus unveils his glory, revealing himself as the obedient sacrifice and the victorious Son of God. This transformative experience serves as a preparation for the disciples, imparting deeper understanding and further confirming the truth of Jesus' identity.
