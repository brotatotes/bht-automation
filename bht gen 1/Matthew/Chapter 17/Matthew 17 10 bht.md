# Matthew 17:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The fulfillment of the prophecy regarding Elijah's coming before the Messiah reveals the limited understanding of the scribes. They fail to recognize that John the Baptist has already fulfilled this role in preparing the way for Jesus. The secrecy surrounding Elijah's arrival underscores the divine timing and fulfillment of prophecy, reminding us that God's plans are not bound by human expectations. By acknowledging John the Baptist as the fulfillment of the Elijah prophecy, Jesus affirms the continuity between the Old Testament prophecies and his own ministry, highlighting the seamless connection between the old and the new covenant.
