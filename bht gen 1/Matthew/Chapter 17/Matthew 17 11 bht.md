# Matthew 17:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse being described is about the coming of Elijah and the subsequent restoration and preparation for the Messiah. Elijah's arrival precedes the coming of the Messiah and serves as a point of Jewish chronology. The restoration referred to here is the work of the Messiah, for which Elijah's coming prepares the way. The phrase "regulating all things" emphasizes the importance of order and aligning our lives with the teachings of the Bible in anticipation of Christ's return. It is an invitation to surrender to God's guidance and live in alignment with His will.
