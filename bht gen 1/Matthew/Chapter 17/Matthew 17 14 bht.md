### John Wesley:
1. "The disciples' inability to cast out the demon in Mark 9:14 reveals their lack of faith and understanding of the power of Jesus. It serves as a reminder that our own faith and trust in Jesus is essential for us to overcome the challenges and obstacles in our lives."

2. "In Luke 11:37, Jesus criticizes the Pharisees for their obsession with external cleanliness while neglecting the state of their hearts. This teaches us that true righteousness is not found in outward appearances or religious rituals, but in the transformation of our inner selves through a genuine relationship with God."

3. "Both passages highlight the importance of humility in our approach to God. The disciples' failure to cast out the demon reminds us that we must rely on God's power and not our own abilities. Similarly, Jesus' rebuke of the Pharisees reminds us that true worship and righteousness come from a humble and contrite heart."
