# Matthew 17:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, a desperate father seeks divine intervention for his afflicted son. The boy's condition is described as being possessed by a demon, causing loss of speech and physical torment. The commentators highlight the boy's sufferings - being lunatic, sorely vexed, having epileptic fits, and wasting away. The term "epileptic" captures the true nature of the disease, while "lunatic" conveys the idea of the condition being affected by the changes of the moon. This combination of possession and epilepsy presents a unique and dire situation, requiring the compassion and mercy of the Divine to bring healing.
