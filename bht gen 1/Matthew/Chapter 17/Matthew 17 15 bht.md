# Matthew 17:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, a desperate father pleads for Jesus' help for his deeply afflicted son. The boy is not only unable to speak due to a demonic influence but is also constantly plagued by epilepsy, making his condition especially severe. The father's desperate request for mercy and compassion highlights the weight of his son's misery, seeking help for a child who is his own. The connection between the changes of the moon and the boy's condition, influenced by the evil spirit, adds a preternatural element to his affliction.
