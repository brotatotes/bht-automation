## Choicest Commentary Quotes:

3. "The connection between faith and the ability to perform miracles is emphasized in this verse, suggesting that faith is a crucial element in the exercise of spiritual power."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Perverse means that which is twisted or turned from the proper direction... Applied to a generation or race of people, it means that they hold opinions turned or perverted from the truth, and that they were wicked in their conduct."
2. "How long shall I suffer you?... This was not so much an expression of impatience or complaint as a reproof for their being so slow to believe that he was the Messiah, notwithstanding his miracles."
3. "If thou canst believe, all things are possible to him that believeth... implying that the difficulty in the case was not that he could not heal him, but that he had not the proper kind and degree of faith with which to come to him."

### John Calvin:
1. "Though Christ appears to direct his discourse to the father of the lunatic, yet there can be no doubt that he refers to the scribes, as I have lately explained; for it is certain that the reproof is directed, not against ignorant and weak persons, but against those who, through inveterate malice, obstinately resist God."
2. "This is the reason why Christ declares that they are no longer worthy to be endured, and threatens that ere long he will separate from them."
3. "We must also observe here, that we ought to treat men in various ways, each according to his natural disposition. For, while our Lord attracts to him the teachable by the utmost mildness, supports the weak, and gently arouses even the sluggish, he does not spare those crooked serpents, on whom he perceives that no remedies can effect a cure."

### Philip Schaff:
