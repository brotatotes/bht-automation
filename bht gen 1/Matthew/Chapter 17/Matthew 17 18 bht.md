# Matthew 17:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, Jesus showcases His authority over evil spirits, commanding a demon to leave a young boy. The boy, who had been afflicted with a severe epileptic condition caused by Satan, lay motionless after the spirit's departure. The crowd, amazed by the miracle, struggled to fully believe in Jesus' power. This passage also clarifies that it was neither the father's nor the boy's personal sins that led to the possession, but rather an extraordinary occurrence in the times of Christ.

### John Gill:
1. "It was not the father of the child Christ rebuked for his unbelief; this he had done already; nor the lunatic himself, as some have thought, either for his unbelief, or because he was possessed by the devil, for some sins of his own; which is not likely, since he was so from a child, and perhaps not now in his right mind, and capable of any rebuke."
2. "For though it was a natural disease which attended this child, yet he was afflicted with it in a preternatural way, by the means of Satan; who, by divine permission, had a power of inflicting bodily diseases."
3. "And it is usual with the Jews, to ascribe diseases to evil spirits; and perhaps this uncommon dispensation in the times of Christ, may give rise to such a notion; particularly, they ascribe this very same disease of the 'epileptic', or 'falling sickness', to the same cause."
