## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The mention of the house in Mark 9:28 suggests that Jesus was intentionally seeking a private and intimate setting for this particular teaching and miracle. It highlights the personal nature of his relationship with his disciples and the importance of their faith in understanding and participating in the work of God." 

2. "The house can also symbolize the spiritual dwelling place of God's presence. In this context, it signifies the need for believers to invite Jesus into the innermost parts of their lives, allowing him to transform and work miracles in their hearts and minds." 

3. "The house serves as a reminder that Jesus is not distant or aloof, but rather intimately involved in the lives of his followers. It emphasizes the accessibility of God's power and the willingness of Jesus to meet us where we are, regardless of our circumstances or limitations."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It was because of their unbelief that they had not been able to cast him out."
2. "They were appalled by the difficulty of the case and the obstinacy of the disease."
3. "Their faith would not have made it more easy for God to work this miracle, but such was his will - such the way in which he worked miracles, that he required faith in those who were the instruments."

### John Calvin:
1. "Christ therefore attributes this want of ability to their unbelief, and repeats and illustrates more largely the statement which he had previously made, that nothing is impossible to faith."
2. "He does not mean that God will give us every thing that we may mention, or that may strike our minds at random. On the contrary, as nothing is more at variance with faith than the foolish and irregular desires of our flesh, it follows that those in whom faith reigns do not desire every thing without discrimination, but only that which the Lord promises to give."
3. "Let us therefore maintain such moderation as to desire nothing beyond what he has promised to us, and to confine our prayers within that rule which he has laid down."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "To Jesus apart" - This phrase highlights the importance of seeking personal, intimate moments with Jesus. It reminds us that in the midst of our busy lives, we need to intentionally set aside time to be alone with Him, to seek His guidance and wisdom.
2. "In a 'house'" - This detail adds a sense of privacy and seclusion to the scene. It suggests that Jesus desired a quiet and intimate setting for this conversation, away from the distractions and crowds. It teaches us the value of finding a quiet place to commune with God, where we can fully focus on His presence.
3. "Mark 9:28" - This reference to another Gospel account shows the interconnectedness of the Scriptures. It encourages us to study and compare different passages to gain a deeper understanding of the message. It reminds us that the Bible is a unified whole, with each verse and passage contributing to the overall narrative of God's redemptive plan.

### John Gill:
1. "Then came the disciples to Jesus apart, privately, and when alone."
2. "They were concerned, fearing they had lost the power which Christ had bestowed on them."
3. "They wanted to know what they had done, which had deprived them of it; and what should be the cause of their late unsuccessful attempt."

These quotes highlight the disciples' desire to understand why they were unable to cast out the demon and heal the lunatic. They approached Jesus privately, expressing their concern about losing the power He had given them. They sought answers to their unsuccessful attempt, showing their eagerness to learn and grow in their faith.
