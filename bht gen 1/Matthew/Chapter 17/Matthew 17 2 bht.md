# Matthew 17:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we witness a powerful and awe-inspiring transformation, as the radiance of the divine bursts forth from Jesus. His transfiguration grants his disciples a glimpse of his boundless glory and hints at his true form and character. The change is not just in appearance, but a revelation of deity breaking through, with his face shining brilliantly like the sun and his garments glowing as bright as the light. This supernatural event leaves no room for doubt, as Christ's divine essence emanates through his earthly existence, illuminating the extraordinary nature of his being.
