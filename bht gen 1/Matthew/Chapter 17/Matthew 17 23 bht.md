# Matthew 17:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The disciples, filled with sorrow and dashed false hopes, were slow to understand the meaning of Christ's death and resurrection. In the midst of their sorrow, Christ revealed to them the prophecy of his crucifixion and resurrection on the third day, a truth that they seemed to have overlooked. Their incorrect views and lack of understanding hindered them from finding comfort and relief in the promise of Christ's resurrection.
