# Matthew 17:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In a very remarkable scene, Jesus is asked about the payment of a peculiar tribute in Capernaum, his usual residence. This distinction in the payment seems to imply that it was voluntary but expected. The value of a shekel, estimated to be around 50 to 70 cents, sheds light on the nature of this tribute. While it was a custom, the payment of this temple tax was obligatory, as shown in Exodus 30:13 and 2 Chronicles 24:5-6. The disciples waited for Jesus to arrive so that they could pose this question to him.
