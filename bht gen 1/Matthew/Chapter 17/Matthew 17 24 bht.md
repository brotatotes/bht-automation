# Matthew 17:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, the scene is set in Capernaum, where Jesus resided. Every year, the Jews were expected to pay a tribute towards the temple in Jerusalem, consisting of a half-shekel or didrachma per person. The payment was voluntary but widely practiced. Jesus, by voluntarily paying the tribute, demonstrated his subjection and servanthood. His act of paying the tribute and his miracle of overturning the tables of the money-changers showcased his voluntary submission and authority over earthly matters.

### Henry Alford:
1. "The tribute, hardly properly so called, was a sum paid annually by the Jews towards the temple in Jerusalem."
2. "Many Commentators... have entirely missed the meaning of this miracle, by interpreting the payment as a civil one, which it certainly was not."
3. "Οἱ τ. δ. λαμβ. are not the publicans, but they who received the didrachma, i.e. one for each person."

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "The whole teaching of this very remarkable scene depends upon this distinction."
2. "This explains several things in the narrative."
3. "The question seems to imply that the payment of this tax was voluntary, but expected."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Every male Israelite of age, including proselytes and manumitted Jews, was expected to pay annually for the temple-service a half-shekel or didrachm, about thirty-five cents."
2. "The money-changers, therefore, were in demand to change the current into the temple coin, which they did at a rate of discount fixed by law, between four and five cents on every half-shekel."
3. "Jesus attacked a very powerful interest when he overthrew the tables of the money-changers."

### John Calvin:

2. "He showed, both by words and by the miracle, that it was not by obligation or necessity, but by a free and voluntary submission, that he had reduced himself so low."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Capernaum. His usual residence, hence the place where the temple tax would be collected from Him."
2. "The temple tax was obligatory; see Exodus 30:13 ff. (comp. 2 Chronicles 24:5-6). Josephus implies the same obligation."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "The tax was like a voluntary church-rate; no one could be compelled to pay" (Plummer).

3. "Evidently Jesus had been in the habit of paying it (Peter's)."

### John Gill:
1. "The original of this custom was an order of the Lord to Moses, upon numbering the people; that everyone that was twenty years of age and upwards, should give half a shekel as atonement money, or as a ransom for his soul; which was to be disposed of for the service of the tabernacle."
2. "In the time of Joash king of Judah, a collection was set on foot for the repair of the temple; and the collection of Moses in the wilderness, was urged as an argument, and by way of example; nor is any mention made of the half shekel, nor was any sum of money fixed they should pay; but, according to the account, it was entirely free and voluntary."
3. "The value of the half shekel was about 'fifteen pence' of our money."

### John Wesley:
1. "When they were come to Capernaum — Where our Lord now dwelt."
2. "This was the reason why they stayed till he came thither, to ask him for the tribute."
3. "It seems to have been a voluntary thing, which custom rather than any law had established."
