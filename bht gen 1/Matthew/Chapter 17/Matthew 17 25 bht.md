# Matthew 17:25 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, Jesus demonstrates His profound knowledge and insight by preemptively addressing a question before it is even asked. With great faith in Jesus, a question about paying taxes is met with a response that not only dismisses any doubt of His compliance but highlights the idea of subjects versus foreigners. By probing the actions of earthly kings in raising taxes from their own household or strangers, Jesus subtly emphasizes His divine authority as the ultimate sovereign.
