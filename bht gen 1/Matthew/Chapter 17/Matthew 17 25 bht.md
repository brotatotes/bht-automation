# Matthew 17:25 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, the commentator remarks on the anticipation and divine knowledge of Jesus, who knew Peter's thoughts and intentions before he expressed them. The verse highlights the act of Jesus paying the tax, affirming his willingness to forgo his right to exemption by voluntarily submitting to the tribute. It also draws a parallel between earthly kings and Jesus, asserting that kings do not tax their own family members but rather impose taxes on subjects who are not part of their family.
