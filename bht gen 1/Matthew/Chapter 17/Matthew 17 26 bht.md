## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "By 'the children' our Lord cannot here mean Himself and the Twelve together, in some loose sense of their near relationship to God as their common Father."
2. "He can refer here, then, only to Himself; using the word 'children' evidently in order to express the general principle observed by sovereigns, who do not draw taxes from their own children."
3. "As His Son, then, that tax is not due by Me—I AM FREE."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Surely then the sons are free." - This quote highlights the freedom that comes from being a child of God, emphasizing that believers are not bound by the same obligations as those who do not recognize Jesus as the Son of God.
2. "The real Temple need not pay tribute to that which foreshadowed it." - This quote emphasizes the superiority of Jesus as the true Temple, suggesting that He is not obligated to pay the temple-tax because He is the fulfillment of what the temple symbolized.
3. "Christians are free, not from the duties of citizens, but from the yoke of legality the priesthood would put upon them." - This quote clarifies that the freedom mentioned in the verse does not exempt Christians from their responsibilities as citizens, but rather liberates them from the burdensome legalistic requirements imposed by religious authorities.

### John Gill:
1. "Jesus saith unto him, then are the children free; from paying custom, tribute, and taxes." This quote highlights Jesus' response to Peter's question about whether they should pay taxes. It emphasizes the freedom of the children, implying that as the Son of God, Jesus is exempt from such obligations.

2. "supposing it was a civil tax, that since he was the son of David, king of Israel, was of his house and family, and heir apparent to his throne and kingdom." This quote provides a possible interpretation of Peter's question, suggesting that Jesus could claim exemption from civil taxes due to his royal lineage and future kingship.

3. "taking it to have respect to the half shekel, paid on a religious account, for the service of the temple worship; that since he was the Son of the King of kings, for the support of whose worship and service that money was collected; and was also the Lord and proprietor of the temple, and greater than that, he might well be excused the payment of it." This quote presents another interpretation, suggesting that Jesus could be excused from paying the religious tax because he is the Son of God and the ultimate authority over the temple.

### John Wesley:
1. "This is paid for the use of the house of God."
2. "But I am the Son of God."
3. "Therefore I am free from any obligation of paying this to my own Father."
