# Matthew 17:27 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, Jesus demonstrates His authority and compassion by performing a miraculous act. Despite being exempt from paying the Temple tax, He instructs Peter to go fishing and find a coin in the mouth of the first fish he catches. By paying the tax, Jesus shows His respect for the Temple and avoids causing offense. This incident showcases His omniscience and omnipotence, as He not only foreknows the event but also orchestrates it for a specific purpose. The verse highlights both Christ's divine nature and His example of humility and love.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Our Lord’s words amount to this: 'that, notwithstanding this immunity, we (graciously including the Apostle in the earthly payment, and omitting the distinction between them, which was not now to be told to any), that we may not offend them, will pay what is required and shall find it furnished by God’s special providence for us.'"
2. "The natural interpretation (of Paulus and Storr), that the fish was to be sold for the money (and a wonderful price it would be for a fish caught with a hook), is refuted by the terms of the narrative."
3. "The stater = four drachmæ, the exact payment required."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Notwithstanding, lest we should offend—stumble. them—all ignorant as they are of My relation to the Lord of the Temple, and should misconstrue a claim to exemption into indifference to His honor who dwells in it."
2. "Go thou to the sea—and cast an hook, and take up the fish that first cometh up; and when thou hast opened his mouth, thou shall find a piece of money—a stater."
3. "That take, and give unto them for me and thee—literally, 'instead of Me and thee'; perhaps because the payment was a redemption of the person paid for (Exodus 30:12) —in which view Jesus certainly was 'free'."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The only mention in the New Testament of fishing with a hook."
2. "Christ names a definite sum, the stater, which is a literal transcription of the Greek word."
3. "Represents two didrachmas, or a shekel."

### John Calvin:
1. "He did so in order to prove by a miracle, that he had a more extensive dominion than all earthly kings, since he had even fishes for his tributaries."
2. "One proof was enough for his whole life."
3. "The stater, which weighed two didrachma, or four drachms, was worth about two shillings and sixpence of our money."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The time was not ripe for asserting this freedom; our Lord was still 'under the law' for us."
2. "Our Lord here exhibits miraculous power, in drawing by the force of His will this fish to that place at that time, as well as foreknowledge of the event."
3. "The fisherman must resume his old occupation to discharge the debt he had so readily acknowledged. Our Lord’s position, not his poverty, called for this provision."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "He does not wish to create the impression that he and the disciples despise the temple and its worship."
2. "The only example in the N.T. of fishing with a hook."

### John Gill:
1. "This is following the example of Christ, who therefore said to Peter, go thou to the sea; of Tiberias, which was near this city, and cast an hook; a fisher's hook into it: and take up the fish that first cometh up, and when thou hast opened his mouth, thou shalt find a piece of money." 
2. "This was a wonderful instance of the omniscience of Christ, who knew there was in such a fish, such a piece of money, as exactly answered the present exigence, and that that would come first to Peter's hook; and of his omnipotence, if not in forming this piece of money immediately in the fish's mouth, as is thought by some, yet in causing this fish to come to Peter's hook first, and as soon as cast in."
3. "But why did not Christ pay for the other disciples, as well as for himself and Peter? It may be replied, that this money would pay for no more than two: but this is not a full answer; Christ could have ordered more money in the same way he did this: it may then be further said, that only he and Peter were looked upon as inhabitants of this place; and so the rest were not called upon here, but in their respective cities, where they might pay also, and, besides, were not now present."

### John Wesley:
1. "Do not contest it with them, but rather yield to their demand, than violate peace or love."
2. "O what would not one of a loving spirit do for peace!"
3. "How illustrious a degree of knowledge and power did our Lord here discover!"
