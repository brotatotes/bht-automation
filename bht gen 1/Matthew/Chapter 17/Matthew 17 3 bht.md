# Matthew 17:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, the scene unfolds with prominent figures from the Old Testament: Moses and Elijah. They are not merely visions, but actually present, signifying their strong connection to the Messiah. The presence of these Old Testament saints on the mount of transfiguration emphasizes the significance of Jesus' mission, with the cross in the foreground. This event serves to affirm the faith of those witnessing it, as God Himself speaks from heaven, providing full confirmation of Jesus' identity and mission as the embodiment of both the law and prophecy.
