# Matthew 17:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In a remarkable event, witnessed by the disciples, Moses and Elijah appeared alongside Jesus. This divine gathering emphasized the connection between the Old Testament and Jesus' ministry. Moses, the lawgiver, and Elijah, the zealous prophet, affirmed Jesus as the fulfillment of the law and the prophets. As they conversed about Jesus' upcoming crucifixion, this encounter served both as a confirmation of faith for the disciples and a revelation of the profound significance of Jesus' sacrificial death.
