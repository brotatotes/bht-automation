# Matthew 17:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this particular Bible verse, we see the disciples experiencing a moment of awe and confusion as they witness a heavenly encounter. As the commentators describe, Peter is captivated by the vision, wanting to prolong the experience and build shelters for the heavenly visitors. However, the commentators also criticize Peter's shortsightedness and lack of understanding, as he fails to comprehend the true purpose of the divine manifestation. Despite their sincere desire to be in the presence of their Master, their limited view prevents them from fully comprehending the significance of the event.
