# Matthew 17:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this transformative moment, a bright cloud descends, revealing the divine presence and authority of God. Standing alongside Jesus are Moses and Elijah, representing the continuity of God's revelation throughout history, while the cloud's disappearance symbolizes that God's communication now comes through Jesus, the ultimate and final Word of God. The cloud serves as a reminder to approach the glory of God with reverence, guiding the disciples to recognize Jesus as the beloved Son and urging them to listen to him above all others. His authority surpasses even that of Moses and the prophets, as foretold in the Old Testament.
