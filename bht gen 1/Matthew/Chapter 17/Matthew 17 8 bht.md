# Matthew 17:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, it is revealed that the Law and the Prophets had a temporary purpose, their glory fading to make way for Christ's surpassing presence, as John Calvin explains. These ancient figures, including Moses, were but servants leading us to Christ, as Calvin further comments. The sufficiency of Christ's authority is emphasized, as pointed out by Philip Schaff, declaring that He is the sole Mediator, Savior, Priest, and King. This distinction becomes clear in the moment when a heavenly voice singles out Christ amidst the disciples' confusion, as John Gill elaborates.
