# Matthew 17:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The disciples were privileged to witness a glorious vision of Christ's divinity, signifying his upcoming resurrection. This revelation was to be kept secret until after the resurrection, as John Calvin explains, so that the disciples would have an even more striking proof of Christ's glory. John Gill adds that the disciples were not yet ready to understand or accept the resurrection, and it was necessary for them to wait until the Son of man had risen in order for the vision to be made credible.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### John Calvin:
1. "The disciples would not have believed it, if Christ had not given a more striking proof of his glory in his resurrection."
2. "That temporary exhibition of his glory began to be admitted, so as to make it fully evident that, even during the time that he emptied himself, he continued to retain his divinity entire."
3. "There are good reasons, therefore, why he enjoins his disciples to keep silence, till he be risen from the dead."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "As they were coming down. This would require some time."
2. "Tell the vision to no one. 'Vision' does not imply that the occurrence was a kind of dream, or like the visions seen by the prophets."
3. "Until the Son of man be risen from the dead. It was too soon to tell of it; even the three understood very little."

### John Gill:
1. "These Christ strictly ordered Peter, James, and John, to speak of to no man whatever; no, not their fellow disciples; who either would be apt to disbelieve them, on account of the greatness of them, as Thomas did the resurrection of Christ afterwards; or lest they should be troubled and displeased, that they were not admitted to the same sight."
2. "This order of Christ was strictly observed by the disciples; for Luke, says, 'they kept it close'; to themselves, in their own breasts; it lay concealed between these three; 'and told no man in those days, any of those things which they had seen'."
3. "For they were not yet reconciled to the Messiah's dying, which was contrary to their expectation of a temporal kingdom; and therefore could not tell what to make of his rising again, whether this had not some secret, mystical meaning; for of his resurrection from the dead, in a literal sense, they had no notion; though it was foretold in the writings of the Old Testament, and had been so lately affirmed by Christ himself."

### John Wesley:
1. "Tell the vision to no man" - Not to the rest of the disciples, lest they should be grieved and discouraged because they were not admitted to the sight.
2. "Nor to any other persons" - Lest it should enrage some the more, and his approaching sufferings shall make others disbelieve it.
3. "Till the Son of man be risen again" - Till the resurrection should make it credible, and confirm their testimony about it.
