# Matthew 17:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, a supernatural vision is revealed to three disciples: Peter, James, and John. The vision is not a random occurrence but has a clear purpose - to confirm that Jesus is the Messiah, the Son of God. This vision serves as a means of communication between God and His people. While the disciples are instructed to keep the vision a secret for the time being, it is intended to prepare them for Jesus' upcoming death and resurrection, which would ultimately solidify the truth of the vision.

### Henry Alford:
1. "No unreality is implied in the word ὅραμα, for it = ἃ εἶδον in Mark, and.… ὧν ἑωράκασιν in Luke."
2. "St. Luke, without mentioning the condition of time imposed on them, remarkably confirms it by saying, οὐδενὶ ἀπήγγειλαν ἐν ἐκείναις ταῖς ἡμέραις οὐδὲν."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "This vision was designed particularly to confirm them in the truth that he was the Messiah."
2. "The sole design of this transfiguration was to convince them that he was the Christ; that he was greater than the greatest of the prophets; that he was the Son of God."
3. "The Pharisees believed that the dead would rise, and there is no doubt that the disciples believed it; but their views were not clear, and, in particular, they did not understand what he meant by his rising from the dead."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Vision [οραμα] refers to a supernatural sight or revelation that goes beyond the physical realm. It is a glimpse into the spiritual realm, allowing the recipient to see and understand things that are not visible to the natural eye."

2. "The word vision implies that there is a purpose behind what is being revealed. It is not just a random image or experience, but a divine message or insight that is meant to convey a specific meaning or instruction."

3. "Visions often serve as a means of communication between God and His people. They are a way for God to reveal His plans, give guidance, or convey His messages to individuals or even entire communities."

### John Calvin:
1. "The disciples would not have believed it, if Christ had not given a more striking proof of his glory in his resurrection."
2. "That temporary exhibition of his glory began to be admitted, so as to make it fully evident that, even during the time that he emptied himself, he continued to retain his divinity entire."

### John Gill:
1. "These Christ strictly ordered Peter, James, and John, to speak of to no man whatever; no, not their fellow disciples; who either would be apt to disbelieve them, on account of the greatness of them, as Thomas did the resurrection of Christ afterwards; or lest they should be troubled and displeased, that they were not admitted to the same sight."
2. "This order of Christ was strictly observed by the disciples; for Luke, says, 'they kept it close'; to themselves, in their own breasts; it lay concealed between these three."
3. "For they were not yet reconciled to the Messiah's dying, which was contrary to their expectation of a temporal kingdom; and therefore could not tell what to make of his rising again, whether this had not some secret, mystical meaning."

### John Wesley:
1. "Tell the vision to no man — Not to the rest of the disciples, lest they should be grieved and discouraged because they were not admitted to the sight."
2. "Nor to any other persons, lest it should enrage some the more, and his approaching sufferings shall make others disbelieve it."
3. "Till the Son of man be risen again - Till the resurrection should make it credible, and confirm their testimony about it."
