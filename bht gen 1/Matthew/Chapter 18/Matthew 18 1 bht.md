# Matthew 18:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the midst of their journey to Capernaum, the disciples engaged in a discussion about the Kingdom of God, which had been mentioned earlier. With various thoughts and motives, they vied for a position of importance and authority within this kingdom. Jesus, aware of their conversation, prompted them to share what they had been discussing, revealing their desire for power and recognition. This incident reveals both the imperfect understanding of the disciples and the need for humility and selflessness in their pursuit of greatness.
