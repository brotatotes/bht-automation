# Matthew 18:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, various commentators offer insights into the cautionary warning against despising and disregarding believers, particularly those who may be considered insignificant or of little importance. The commentators emphasize that these "little ones" include children, humble individuals, and the weakest believers, who should not be treated with contempt or offence. God, in His care and love, entrusts the guardianship of these individuals to angels. Hence, the verse reminds us of the divine protection and significance of every believer, regardless of their status or prominence within the church.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The warning against contempt of these little ones must not be taken as only implying ‘maxima debetur puero reverentia’ (Juv [147] xiv. 47), nor indeed as relating exclusively, or even principally, to children."
2. "The little children in the outward status of the Church are in fact the only disciples who are sure to be that in reality, which their Baptism has put upon them, and so exactly answer to the wider meaning here conveyed by the term."
3. "On the reason assigned in the latter part of this verse (λέγω γὰρ κ.τ.λ.), there have been many opinions; some of which... have been broached merely to evade the plain sense of the words, which is that to individuals certain angels are allotted as their especial attendants and guardians."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Among men, those who nurse and rear the royal children, however humble in themselves, are allowed free entrance with their charge, and a degree of familiarity which even the highest state ministers dare not assume."
2. "Probably our Lord means that, in virtue of their charge over His disciples, the angels have errands to the throne, a welcome there, and a dear familiarity in dealing with 'His Father which is in heaven,' which on their own matters they could not assume."
3. "A difficult verse; but perhaps the following may be more than an illustration."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "That reason is drawn from the care which God exercises over them."
2. "The angels were, in general, the guards of his followers, and aided them and watched over them."
3. "We should not despise the obscurest Christian, for he is ministered to by the highest and noblest of beings."

### John Calvin:
1. "Beware of despising one of these little ones...no man who has a proper care for his brethren will ever allow himself, on light grounds, to give them offense."
2. "God embraces with wonderful love the little ones...It would be strange indeed that a mortal man should despise, or treat as of no account, those whom God holds in such high esteem."
3. "We ought therefore to beware of despising their salvation, which even angels have been commissioned to advance...the care of the whole Church is committed to angels, to assist each member as his necessities shall require."

### John Gill:
1. "Take heed that ye despise not one of these little ones,.... That is, one of those little ones that believed in Christ; for he is not speaking of infants in age, but of those who might be compared to such, for their humility and modesty."
2. "Christ cautions them against such a spirit, and bids them beware of despising their fellow disciples, as little, and below them; especially since so much notice and care were taken of them, both in heaven, and in earth."
3. "If such excellent creatures as the angels in heaven, who are continually favoured with being in the presence of Christ's heavenly father, honoured with so high a station, as always to stand before him, as ministers of his; if these are the guardians of these little ones, if they are committed to their care, and they have the oversight of them, then they ought not to be despised."

### John Wesley:
1. "Be careful to receive and not to offend, the very weakest believer in Christ."
2. "For as inconsiderable as some of these may appear to thee, the very angels of God have a peculiar charge over them."
