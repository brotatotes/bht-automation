# Matthew 18:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When faced with a situation where brotherly love is challenged, the first step is to address the issue privately, seeking reconciliation and covering the sin. If the offender refuses to listen, then the next course of action is to take one or two witnesses, individuals of reputation, to confirm the matter at hand. These witnesses serve to provide further support and act as a means of confirming the truth, highlighting the significance of verbal testimony. It is important to approach the situation personally, with a sense of responsibility, and in accordance with established customs and rules.
