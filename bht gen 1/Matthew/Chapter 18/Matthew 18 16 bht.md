# Matthew 18:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When faced with a situation where someone refuses to listen or be reasoned with, it becomes necessary to seek the assistance of others, as suggested by Albert Barnes. Taking along one or two individuals helps establish the truth of the matter and provides additional accountability. The credibility and reliability of a statement or claim depend on the source from which it comes, as highlighted by Marvin Vincent. Philip Schaff advises that this more public step is taken in order to prevent further unnecessary attention, and it should only be pursued if the offense is deemed serious enough to warrant it.
