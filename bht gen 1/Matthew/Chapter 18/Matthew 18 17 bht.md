# Matthew 18:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When a Christian brother persists in unrepentant sin, the process begins privately and gradually progresses to involve the entire church. This involves reproving and appealing to the offender, with the aim of restoration. If all efforts fail, the offender is to be regarded as an outsider, no longer recognized as a brother and treated as one outside the faith. The decision to sever ties is not made lightly, but is a necessary step in maintaining the integrity of the church.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "a stronger word than μὴ ἀκ ., implying something of obduracy."
2. "the congregation of Christians; i.e. in early times, such as in Acts 4:32, the one congregation, in after times, that congregation of which thou and he are members."
3. "‘let him no longer be accounted as a brother, but as one of those without,’ as the Jews accounted Gentiles and Publicans."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The church may here mean the whole assembly of believers, or it may mean those who are authorized to try such cases - the representatives of the church, or these who act for the church."
2. "It was to be brought to the church in order that he might be admonished, entreated, and, if possible, reformed. This was, and is always to be, the first business in disciplining an offending brother."
3. "The meaning of this is, cease to have religious contact with him, or to acknowledge him as a Christian brother. It does not mean that we should cease to show kindness to him and aid him in affliction or trial, for that is required toward all people; but it means that we should disown him as a Christian brother, and treat him as we do other people not connected with the church."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The public step follows: Tell it unto the church, i.e., the particular Christian congregation."
2. "The admonition and entreaty of the Church is to be used as a means of regaining the brother."
3. "A man of high spirituality would be won by the first step, a lukewarm Christian by the second or third; when all fail, it is not distinctly commanded that the Church should pronounce him no Christian."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Refuse to hear (παρακουση). Like Isaiah 65:12. Many papyri examples for ignoring, disregarding, hearing without heeding, hearing aside (παρα-), hearing amiss, overhearing (Mark 5:36)."

2. "The church (τη εκκλησια). The local body, not the general as in Matthew 16:18 which see for discussion."

3. "The problem here is whether Jesus has in mind an actual body of believers already in existence or is speaking prophetically of the local churches that would be organized later (as in Acts)."

### John Gill:
1. "The reproof should be first private, and if it did not succeed, to be made before one or two more; and if that did not do, the whole body was to be acquainted with it; and which rules hold good, and are to be observed by all Christian men and churches, in all ages."
2. "After he has come under the cognizance, reproof, and censure of the church, he is to look upon him as the Jews did one that disregarded both private reproof by a man's self, and that which was in the presence of one or two more, 'a worthless friend', or neighbour; as a Gentile, with whom the Jews had neither religious nor civil conversation; and a 'publican', or as Munster's Hebrew Gospel reads it, 'a notorious sinner', as a publican was accounted."
3. "Hence such are often joined together, and with whom the Jews might not eat, nor keep any friendly and familiar acquaintance: and so such that have been privately admonished and publicly rebuked, without success, their company is to be shunned, and intimate friendship with them to be avoided."
