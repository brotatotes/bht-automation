# Matthew 18:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the commentator Philip Schaff emphasizes the importance of addressing issues within the Christian community. He suggests that the first step is to share the concern with the entire congregation, seeking their insight and guidance. However, if the issue persists, Schaff suggests treating the individual as someone outside of the Christian fellowship, with a spirit of exclusion, akin to how the heathen and publicans were regarded. The focus here is on the process of addressing conflicts within the community and the potential consequences that follow.
