### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "The power of agreement is not just about saying the same words or having the same opinion, but it is about aligning our hearts and minds with God's will." 
2. "When we come together in unity and agreement, we tap into the supernatural realm and invite God's intervention and provision in our lives." 
3. "This verse reminds us that prayer is not just an individual activity, but it is a communal experience that is meant to be shared and practiced together."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The care of the church - the power of admitting or excluding members - of organizing and establishing it - is committed to you, the apostles."
2. "Yet there is not need of the whole to give validity to the transaction. When two of you agree, or have the same mind, feelings, and opinion, about the arrangement of affairs in the church, or about things desired for its welfare, and shall ask of God, it shall be done for them."
3. "The promise here has respect to the apostles in organizing the church. It cannot with any propriety be applied to the ordinary prayers of believers."

2. "This agreement could only be wrought by the Holy Spirit, selfish ends being excluded from the nature of the case."
3. "An encouragement to united prayer."

### John Gill:
1. "As the words in the former verse seem to regard the whole body of the disciples, whose decisions in cases brought before them, declaring them just or unjust, are determinate and unalterable; these seem to respect the one or two, that should join the offended person in the reproof of the offender, and are spoken for their encouragement." 

2. "Both in the case before mentioned, and in any other thing: whether it be for themselves or others; to assist them in the ministry of the word, and give success to it, for the conversion of sinners; and in the performance of any miracle, for the confirmation of the Gospel; in the administration of ordinances, for the comfort of saints; and in laying on of censures, for the reclaiming of backsliders; or be it what it will that may be done, consistent with the glory of God, the purposes of his mind, and the declarations of his will, and the good of men, provided they agree in their requests."

3. "A great encouragement this to social prayer, though ever so few are engaged in it."
