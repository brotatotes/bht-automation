# Matthew 18:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, Jesus calls a little child to him, symbolizing humility, love, and the value of caring for the weak and vulnerable. The mention of Ignatius, a martyr, highlights the contrast between the world's perception of greatness and Jesus' definition of greatness in selflessness. The reference to Emperor Trajan condemning Ignatius reminds us of the courage required to follow Jesus, even in the face of persecution and injustice. Together, these elements teach us important lessons about humility, compassion, and the cost of discipleship.
