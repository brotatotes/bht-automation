# Matthew 18:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In discussing the Bible verse, commentators explore Peter's question about forgiveness. Peter, who had likely faced envy, wanted to know how many times forgiveness should be given. The commentators emphasize that forgiveness is not a one-time act but a continuous process that requires grace and mercy. They explain that Peter's question stemmed from the previous discourse and that the Jewish rule was to forgive three times. Yet, Jesus' response challenges this limited view, urging us to forgive without limits and mirroring the goodness of our heavenly Father.
