# Matthew 18:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
A disciple named Peter, feeling the weight of his responsibility and being conscious of his own faults, sought clarification on the extent of forgiveness. Wondering if there was a limit to the needed forbearance, he asked how many times he should forgive his brother who offends him. Peter, familiar with the Jewish practice of forgiving three times, increased the number to seven, considering it a generous offer. However, his question revealed a lack of understanding regarding the true depth and continual attitude of forgiveness.
