# Matthew 18:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This verse unveils the insurmountable burden of sin that humanity carries, symbolized by an enormous debt. The immense debt, exceeding any private man's power to repay, emphasizes the desperate state of the debtor unable to discharge such an enormous sum. This debt represents an incalculable amount, illustrating the impossibility of repaying it individually and underscoring the need for God's grace and mercy. It reminds us that God's forgiveness is freely given to those who humbly seek it, as no one can earn or repay their way out of sin's debt.
