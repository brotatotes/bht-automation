### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "This verse highlights the severity of the debt owed by the servant, as his lord commands him to be sold along with his family and possessions. It serves as a reminder of the consequences of failing to repay debts, as seen in other biblical references such as 2 Kings 4:1, Nehemiah 5:8, and Leviticus 25:39." 

2. "The act of being sold into slavery was a common practice in ancient times to settle debts. This verse demonstrates the harshness of the consequences faced by those who could not repay what they owed. It emphasizes the importance of financial responsibility and the potential loss of freedom and security that can result from debt." 

3. "The lord's command to sell the servant and his family serves as a powerful metaphor for the consequences of sin and the debt we owe to God. It reminds us of the gravity of our own spiritual debts and the need for forgiveness and redemption. Just as the servant's debt was too great for him to pay, so too are our sins too great for us to atone for on our own."

### Albert Barnes:

### John Calvin:
1. "God does not always display severity at first, till, constrained to pray, we implore pardon, but rather meets us with undeserved goodness."
2. "Christ only shows what will become of us, if God shall treat us with the utmost severity; and again, if He shall choose to demand from us what we owe, how necessary it is for us to betake ourselves to prayer, because this is the only refuge that remains for transgressors."
3. "We must also attend to the wide difference of the sums; for, since one talent is worth more than a hundred pence, what proportion will a hundred pence bear to ten thousand talents?"
