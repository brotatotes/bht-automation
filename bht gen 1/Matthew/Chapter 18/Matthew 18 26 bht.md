# Matthew 18:26 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
A servant humbly falls down before his master to seek mercy and acknowledges the master's authority. Recognizing his own debt, he pleads for patience and promises to repay all. His words reveal his understanding of the gravity of his wrongdoing, his hope for forgiveness, and his desire to rectify his mistake. In his fear and terror, he foolishly hopes to compensate for his sins through his own actions, unaware that only God's patience and grace can lead to true salvation.
