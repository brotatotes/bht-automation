# Matthew 18:27 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
A master, moved by compassion, forgives a debtor's hopeless payment, liberates him from prison, and cancels the debt. The forgiveness is not based on anything the debtor said or did, but on the pure mercy and free grace of God. When God forgives sin, He forgives all sin, past, present, and future. It is grace in God that provided His Son as a sacrifice for sin and accepted the satisfaction made on behalf of sinners. This verse emphasizes the greatness, fulness, and freeness of God's mercy and forgiveness.
