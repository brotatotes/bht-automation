# Matthew 18:28 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, we see the theme of forgiveness and the difference between the sins committed against us by others and the sins we commit against God. The commentators emphasize the insignificance of the sum owed by the debtor compared to the larger debt he had been forgiven. They highlight the unforgiving spirit and merciless tone expressed by the debtor, despite the small amount owed. The verse reminds us of the need to show mercy and forgiveness towards others, as God has shown towards us.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Forgiveness of sin does not imply a change of heart or principle in the sinner."
2. "The insignificance of the sum is to show us how trifling any offense against one another is in comparison to the vastness of our sin against God."
3. "The expression 'if you owe anything' is a haughty expression of one ashamed to meet the mention of the paltry sum really owing, and by this very expression generalizing his unforgiving treatment to all who owed him aught."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Mark the difference here. The first case is that of master and servant; in this case, both are on a footing of equality."
2. "If Jewish money is intended, this debt was to the other less than one to a million."
3. "Mark the mercilessness even of the tone."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "A hundred pence. Less than a millionth part of his own debt."
2. "Took him by the throat. Lit., throttled. Wyc., strangled."
3. "The if is simply the expression of a pitiless logic. If thou owest anything (as thou dost) pay!"

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The transgressions of our fellowmen against us are trifling in comparison to our sin against God."
2. "An unforgiving spirit is quick to apply the harshest legal measures."
3. "Only when near Him are we like Him."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The hundred denarii here were equal to some 'fifty shillings' (Bruce), 'about 4 pounds' (McNeile), 'twenty pounds' (Moffatt), 'twenty dollars' (Goodspeed), '100 shillings' (Weymouth). These are various efforts to represent in modern language the small amount of this debt compared with the big one."
2. "Took him by the throat (επνιγεν). 'Held him by the throat' (Allen). It is imperfect, probably inchoative, 'began to choke or throttle him.' The Roman law allowed this indignity."
3. "What thou owest (ε τ οφειλεις). Literally, 'if thou owest anything,' however little. He did not even know how much it was, only that he owed him something. 'The 'if' is simply the expression of a pitiless logic' (Meyer)."

### John Gill:
1. "For so sins committed against men, against fellow creatures, or fellow Christians; are but small, when compared with those which are committed against God."
2. "All which circumstances, as that it was immediately after he had been forgiven himself; that it was a fellow servant he found: and the sum he owed him so inconsiderable, greatly aggravate his inhuman carriage."
3. "This man insisted on payment of the whole debt which expresses the rigour and severity used by some professors of religion to their fellow Christians."
