# Matthew 18:29 Commentary Help Text

In this verse, a person humbly beseeches another for patience, using the same words they had used to appeal for mercy themselves. The commentators emphasize the importance of showing compassion and forgiveness towards others, just as one would hope to receive it from God. It also draws attention to human tendencies to promise God more readily than fellow humans, and the need to approach such promises with humility and sincerity.
