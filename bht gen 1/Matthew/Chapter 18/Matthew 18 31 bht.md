# Matthew 18:31 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we learn about the consequences of withholding forgiveness and the eventual exposure of the truth. The commentators emphasize the importance of forgiving others, highlighting the duty of forgiving our brethren and the great evil of not forgiving. They also highlight the notion that the truth will eventually come to light and that there is a limit to what people will tolerate. This suggests that no matter how hidden or obscured the truth may seem, it will ultimately be revealed, and individuals have a threshold for accepting deceit before seeking the truth.
