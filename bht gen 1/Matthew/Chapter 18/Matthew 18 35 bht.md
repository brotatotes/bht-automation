# Matthew 18:35 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, Jesus teaches his disciples about the importance of forgiveness. He emphasizes that forgiveness must come from the heart and be sincere, not just a mere lip service. Jesus uses a parable of an unmerciful servant who, despite being forgiven a great debt, refuses to forgive a fellow servant of a smaller debt. This parable serves as a reminder that just as God forgives us, we must also forgive others genuinely and wholeheartedly. Failure to do so not only damages our relationships but also hinders our own spiritual growth.

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "In this verse, Jesus is teaching his disciples about the importance of forgiveness. He uses the analogy of a servant who was forgiven a great debt but refused to forgive a fellow servant of a much smaller debt. Jesus emphasizes that just as the master was angry with the unforgiving servant, so too will God be angry with those who do not forgive others from their hearts." 

2. "The phrase 'from your hearts' highlights the sincerity and genuineness of forgiveness. It is not enough to simply say the words, but forgiveness must come from a place of true compassion and understanding. This challenges us to examine our own hearts and motives when it comes to forgiving others." 

3. "This verse reminds us that forgiveness is not optional for those who follow Christ. It is a commandment that we must obey. God's forgiveness towards us should serve as a model for our own forgiveness towards others. When we withhold forgiveness, we not only harm our relationship with the person who wronged us, but we also hinder our own spiritual growth and hinder the work of God in our lives."
