2. "The phrase 'from your hearts' emphasizes the sincerity and genuineness of forgiveness. It is not enough to simply say the words, but true forgiveness comes from a place of love and compassion." 

3. "Jesus refers to 'every one' and 'his brother' to emphasize that forgiveness should be extended to all, regardless of the nature of the offense or the relationship. This challenges us to let go of grudges and extend forgiveness to everyone who has wronged us."
