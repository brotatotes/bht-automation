# Matthew 18:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse being described emphasizes the need for humility and childlike qualities. One commentator highlights the importance of willingly embracing humility, while another emphasizes that humility can be cultivated through a spiritual journey. Another commentator explains that humility is not about self-imposed humiliation, but rather a genuine state of being. Additionally, the verse is expanded into a discourse about the dignity of Christ's followers and the difficulty of humbling oneself. This passage encourages individuals to humble themselves, prioritize others, and condescend to those in lower positions, as exemplified by the child.
