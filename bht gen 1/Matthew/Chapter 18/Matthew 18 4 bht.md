# Matthew 18:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, Jesus teaches us the importance of humility by using the example of a child. Just as a child naturally embodies humility, we are called to willingly humble ourselves. True greatness in the kingdom of heaven comes from humility and a recognition of our dependence on God. The humble person sees themselves as a member of the body of Christ and seeks to bring glory to God alone, treating others with respect and equality. This selflessness and contentment with our own littleness and dependence is what truly makes one great in the kingdom of heaven.
