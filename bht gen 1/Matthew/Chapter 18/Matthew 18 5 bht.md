# Matthew 18:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse being described speaks of the honor and humility of receiving children in the name of Jesus, reflecting His teachings and values. By acting in His name, believers align themselves with His authority and power, recognizing that they are not acting on their own strength but relying on Jesus. This extends to not only physical children but also those who have a childlike spirit. It is an invitation to humble themselves, esteem one another, and embrace the Gospel preached by His disciples in the same manner as receiving Christ Himself.
