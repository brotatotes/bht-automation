# Matthew 18:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Causing others to stumble in their faith carries a heavy weight of guilt and inescapable consequences. It is a grave responsibility we have in influencing others, a reminder that our actions can either build up or tear down the faith of those around us. By pridefully leading others astray, we risk their unbelief, feeding into the weak and vulnerable. The image of a millstone symbolizes the severity of punishment and serves as a warning, burdening the offender with destruction and emphasizing the seriousness of causing others to stumble.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Marvin Vincent:
1. "A millstone turned by an ass was a large, heavy stone used for grinding grain. Jesus uses this vivid image to convey the severity of the punishment awaiting those who cause others to stumble in their faith."

2. "The mention of a millstone around one's neck symbolizes the weight of guilt and the inescapable consequences of leading others astray. It serves as a warning against the grave responsibility we have in influencing others, especially in matters of faith."

3. "By using the image of a millstone, Jesus emphasizes the seriousness of causing others to stumble. It is a powerful reminder that our actions and words have the potential to either build up or tear down the faith of those around us."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "By pride, to cause others to fall into unbelief (the opposite of 'receiving'); not a mere wounding of over sensitive feelings, or offending a morbid and incorrect sense of right."
2. "The weak, unpretending, outwardly insignificant, the children, the poor, the ignorant, and the weak-minded are all included. Only he who feeds the lambs can feed the sheep."
3. "The profit of dominating over the conscience is a burden about the neck of the offender which involves his destruction. A warning both to individual and ecclesiastical bodies."
