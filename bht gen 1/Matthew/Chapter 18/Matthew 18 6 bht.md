# Matthew 18:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This verse warns against the grave consequences of causing others to stumble in their faith. Jesus uses the imagery of a heavy millstone around the neck to convey the crushing weight and irreversible nature of the punishment. The commentators emphasize that this punishment is reserved for those who lead humble believers astray, particularly the weak, poor, and children. It is better to endure any temporal punishment than to expose oneself to everlasting destruction by causing harm to one of Christ's disciples.
