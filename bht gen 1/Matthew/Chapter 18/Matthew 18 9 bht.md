## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "μονόφθαλμος, in classical Greek, is ‘born blind of one eye;’ here it is used for ἑτερόφθαλμος." 
2. "μονόφθαλμος is a term that refers to being blind in one eye, and in this context, it is used to describe someone who is different in their perception or understanding."
3. "The use of μονόφθαλμος highlights the unique perspective or insight that this person possesses, which sets them apart from others."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The hell of fire." - This phrase emphasizes the severity and intensity of the future punishment that is being threatened. It conveys the idea of a place of torment and suffering.
2. "Certain and awful future punishment." - This highlights the certainty of the punishment that awaits those who prioritize their sins or worldly desires over their relationship with Christ. It serves as a warning of the consequences of choosing anything above Christ.
3. "Preferred to Christ." - This phrase underscores the importance of prioritizing Christ above all else. It implies that when we choose to indulge in our favorite sins or put other things before our devotion to Christ, we are rejecting Him and setting ourselves up for future punishment.
