# Matthew 19:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In a very solemn period of our Lord's public ministry, he bids farewell to Galilee, marking the end of his teachings on humility, avoiding offenses, and forgiveness. Departing from Galilee, he moves closer to Jerusalem, into the regions of Judea beyond the Jordan, seeking refuge in Perea along with the Christians of Jerusalem. This marks a significant transition in his journey, as he set forth on a path that would ultimately lead to his suffering and death, with no immediate return to Galilee until after his resurrection.
