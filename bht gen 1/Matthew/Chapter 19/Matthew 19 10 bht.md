# Matthew 19:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The commentators shed light on a verse that explores the disciples' belief that marriage could be burdensome and potentially harmful to their spiritual lives. They lack understanding about the purpose of marriage for companionship, support, and family-building. The verse focuses on the idea that the disciples' views were influenced by Jewish notions and a culture where divorce was considered a privilege. The commentators emphasize the closeness and inviolable nature of the marital bond, leading the disciples to conclude that it might be better to avoid marriage altogether.
