# Matthew 19:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the commentators emphasize the concept of voluntarily choosing celibacy for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. They explain that this choice is not for everyone, but rather for those who possess the gift of continency granted by God. It is an ideal that requires spiritual understanding and power. While marriage is lawful, the unmarried state is regarded as a higher spiritual calling, especially in times of persecution or for those dedicating themselves fully to religious work. It is a demanding path that goes against natural inclinations and requires deliberate resistance.
