# Matthew 19:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Bible verse under discussion is a call to a life of celibacy and devotion to God. Some commentators emphasize that this choice is not for everyone and is a special gift from God that not all possess. The verse is seen as an ideal that requires spiritual illumination and supernatural power to fulfill. While recognizing the severity of this demand, it is also acknowledged that this choice is not within everyone's capacity. Living a life of celibacy and dedication to God is an intentional renunciation of marriage for the sake of the kingdom of heaven.
