# Matthew 19:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This verse discusses the various types of eunuchs - those born that way, those made by others, and those who choose celibacy for the sake of serving God. It emphasizes the capacity to receive and accept a lifestyle without marriage, highlighting that it is not enough to merely live chastely, but to also abstain from marriage in order to better devote oneself to God. While some see celibacy as superior, others recognize that it is not a requirement for all, but a gift for those who are able to receive it.
