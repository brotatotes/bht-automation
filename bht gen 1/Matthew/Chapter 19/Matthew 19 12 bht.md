# Matthew 19:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, commentators explain that there are different categories of eunuchs. Some are born physically incapable of marriage, others are made eunuchs by external factors, and still others voluntarily choose a celibate life for the sake of serving God. These explanations highlight that celibacy is not superior to marriage but rather a unique calling for certain individuals who desire a closer relationship with God. The commentators also emphasize that those who are able to embrace celibacy should do so joyfully and with gratitude.
