# Matthew 19:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This verse reveals the beautiful scene of parents bringing their children to Jesus, seeking not only His devotion but also His blessings. Jesus, recognizing His power to bless, laid His hands on the children and prayed for them, just as it was customary to consecrate individuals to God through the laying on of hands. It sheds light on the misguided understanding of children and Jesus among the disciples, reminding us not to hinder the little ones from approaching the Lord.
