# Matthew 19:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
A seeker of truth, a young ruler, approaches Jesus with admiration and a desire to know how to obtain eternal life. He is earnest but misguided, hoping to earn salvation through his own works. Jesus, recognizing the man's sincerity, directs him to the path of righteousness, revealing the impossibility of merit-based salvation. This encounter is remarkable, as it reveals the contrast between the rich man's pursuit of earthly wealth and the humility of Jesus' impoverished followers.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The spirit in which he came, which does not however appear here so plainly as in the other Gospels, from the omission of ἀγαθέ , and the form of our Lord’s answer, seems to have been that of excessive admiration for Jesus as a man of eminent virtue, and of desire to know from Him by what work of exceeding merit he might win eternal life."
2. "This spirit He reproves, by replying that there is but One Good, and that the walking by His grace in the way of holiness is the path to life."
3. "This passage furnishes one of the most instructive and palpable cases of the smoothing down of apparent discrepancies by correcting the Gospels out of one another and thus reducing them to conformity."

### John Calvin:
1. "He did not come treacherously, as the scribes were wont to do, but from a desire of instruction; and, accordingly, both by words and by kneeling, he testifies his reverence for Christ as a faithful teacher."
2. "But, on the other hand, a blind confidence in his works hindered him from profiting under Christ, to whom, in other respects, he wished to be submissive."
3. "He therefore dreams of merits, on account of which he may receive eternal life as a reward due; and therefore Christ appropriately sends him to the keeping of the law, which unquestionably is the way of life."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The circumstance was remarkable in view of the opposition of the Pharisees."
2. "This young ruler...was an honest, earnest seeker after truth and life."
3. "He thought to earn eternal life. Hence the passage must not be wrested in favor of legalism."
