# Matthew 19:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, Jesus responds to a young man's question by listing specific commandments that highlight the importance of true righteousness, humility, and self-denial. His choice to emphasize moral precepts that pertain to interpersonal relationships shows his intention to address the young man's concerns and engage with him personally. The selection of these commandments over ceremonial or external practices also demonstrates the primacy of treating others with respect and refraining from harm. Jesus ultimately conveys that eternal life is not obtained solely through the performance of external actions, but by genuine love and devotion to God and others.

3. "I confess that we are nowhere commanded in the law to sell all; but as the design of the law is, to bring men to self-denial, and as it expressly condemns covetousness, we see that Christ had no other object in view than to correct the false conviction of the young man."
