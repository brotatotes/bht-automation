# Matthew 19:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This young man, though self-righteous, believed he had truly observed all of God's commandments, showing an earnestness in his pursuit of righteousness. However, he lacked a true comprehension of the spiritual depth and qualitative nature of the law, rather focusing on the quantitative aspect of his actions. Though he may have exhibited external righteousness, he failed to grasp the internal disposition required by the commandments, highlighting the paradoxical blend of complacency and despair within him.
