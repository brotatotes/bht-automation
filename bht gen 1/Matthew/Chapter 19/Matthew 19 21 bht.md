# Matthew 19:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, Jesus challenges a young man's willingness to fully follow Him. Commentators emphasize the idea that obedience to Christ goes beyond mere avoidance of harm to others. It requires a genuine love for others and a readiness to relinquish worldly possessions for Christ's sake. While Jesus' command to sell everything was specific to the young man, it serves as a reminder for us to examine our own hearts and prioritize our devotion to Christ above all else.

2. "Nevertheless of some persons, and in some cases, it has been required, that they part with all their worldly substance, for the sake of Christ and his Gospel."
3. "For to 'come' to Christ, is to believe in him, lay hold on him, receive and embrace him as a Saviour and Redeemer; and to 'follow' him, is to be obedient to his will, to be observant of his commands, to submit to his ordinances, and to imitate him in the exercise of grace, and discharge of duty."

### John Wesley:
1. "Sell what thou hast - He who reads the heart saw his bosom sin was love of the world; and knew he could not be saved from this, but by literally renouncing it."
2. "To him therefore he gave this particular direction, which he never designed for a general rule. For him that was necessary to salvation: to us it is not."
