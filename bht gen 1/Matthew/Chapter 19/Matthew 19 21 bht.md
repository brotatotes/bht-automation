# Matthew 19:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we see that complete obedience to Christ requires more than just refraining from doing harm. It demands genuine love and care for others, going above and beyond to do good to them. While selling all worldly possessions may have been necessary for some in the past, it is not a universal command. However, when material possessions hinder one's devotion to Christ, they must be relinquished. Ultimately, one must be willing to let go of anything that stands in the way of following Christ wholeheartedly, even if it comes at a high price.
