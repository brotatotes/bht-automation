# Matthew 19:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus warns of the great obstacle presented by riches, emphasizing the difficulty for a wealthy individual to enter into the realm of spiritual truth and salvation. The attachment and reliance on wealth hinder one's journey towards grace, as trust in riches swells with pride and presumption. While some exceptions exist, the number of wealthy individuals who truly embrace the Gospel and inherit the kingdom of heaven is comparatively few, as the challenge lies in putting trust and confidence in worldly possessions.
