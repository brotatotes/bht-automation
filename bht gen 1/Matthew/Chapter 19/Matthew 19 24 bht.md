# Matthew 19:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus used a vivid proverbial saying to illustrate the tremendous difficulty for a wealthy person to enter the kingdom of God. The choice of a camel, known for its hump and weight, adds to the visual imagery and emphasizes the seemingly impossible task. This imagery serves as a warning to the wealthy, urging them to recognize the obstacles that wealth can create and compelling them to humbly acknowledge their need for divine grace. It calls for a deep awareness of the impossibility of one's own efforts, directing them towards a desperate dependence on God's intervention for salvation.
