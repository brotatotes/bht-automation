# Matthew 19:27 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The disciples, in response to the teachings of Jesus, inquire about the rewards for their sacrifice and commitment, indicating their expectation for some form of compensation. However, their understanding falls short, as they fail to comprehend the significance of Jesus' presence and the magnitude of His promise. The disciples' question reveals a focus on personal gain rather than the sacrificial nature of following Christ. Yet, like the young man, they left behind worldly possessions and responsibilities to become devoted followers, imitating Jesus in their self-denial and perseverance.
