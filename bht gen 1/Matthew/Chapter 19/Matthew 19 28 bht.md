# Matthew 19:28 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, Jesus responds separately to Peter and the apostles concerning their act of following him. He speaks of a future time called "the regeneration," which commentators describe as the final renewal of all things and the spiritual renovation of the world. Jesus, as the Son of man, will sit on his throne of glory, manifesting his authority as conqueror, ruler, and judge. The disciples will also be seated on twelve thrones, signifying their exalted position among Christ's people. The exact meaning of this promise and the conditions attached to it remain unclear.
