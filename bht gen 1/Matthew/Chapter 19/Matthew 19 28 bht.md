# Matthew 19:28 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the grand finale of the spiritual restoration of the world, believers are promised a remarkable position of honor and authority. They will sit alongside the Judge, absolved and acquitted, participating in the divine judgment. While Jesus made an unconditional promise to the twelve disciples to sit on thrones, there is a condition implied, intimating that not all of them would ultimately attain that elevated status. The significance lies not only in what was left behind, but in the faith, profession, and submission to Christ that they embraced.

1. "Christ does not deny that they had forsaken all for his sake, nor does he despise it, because it was but little they left, though he does not repeat it; but only takes notice of their following him, which, including their faith in him, their profession of him, and subjection to him, was a much greater action, and of more importance that the other, and therefore is only mentioned." 

2. "Now the twelve apostles followed Christ herein: they believed, and professed him to be the Messiah; they received, what the Jews called, his new doctrine, and preached it to others; they submitted to the new ordinance of baptism, and followed Christ, and attended him wherever he went, working miracles, preaching the Gospel, and reforming the minds and manners of men."

3. "When the Son of man shall sit in the throne of his glory, or glorious throne; as he did when he ascended into heaven, and sat down at the right hand of God; and was then exalted as a prince, and made, or declared to be Lord and Christ; and was crowned in human nature, with honour, and glory, and angels, principalities, and powers, made subject to him."
