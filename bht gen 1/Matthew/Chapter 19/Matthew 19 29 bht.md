# Matthew 19:29 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Believers are given a promise that extends beyond just the apostles and applies to all. By willingly letting go of worldly possessions for the sake of Christ, believers can experience an abundance of spiritual blessings and the presence of God. This promise encompasses both the present world and the next, as believers find a new home and eternal possessions. The value received in return surpasses any earthly treasures, demonstrating the surpassing value of following Christ.
