# Matthew 19:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The question presented to Jesus by the Pharisees, as depicted by commentators, was intended to trap Him and provoke controversy. The dispute over divorce between rival schools of thought, particularly the more lenient perspective of Hillel, added to the complexity of the situation. Jesus' response to the question about divorce was anticipated to create opposition from one of the parties involved, as they sought to entangle Him in their debates and test His adherence to the law of Moses.

3.
