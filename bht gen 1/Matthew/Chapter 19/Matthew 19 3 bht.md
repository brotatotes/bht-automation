# Matthew 19:3 Commentary Help Text

The commentators shed light on a passage in which the Pharisees come to Jesus with a divisive question about divorce. They aim to trap him and discredit his teachings. The question revolves around the differing opinions of the Rabbinical schools and the allowance of divorce in the Mosaic law. Their intention is to provoke Jesus into a response that would alienate him from one faction or the other. The adversaries seek to create conflict between Jesus' teachings and those of Moses.
