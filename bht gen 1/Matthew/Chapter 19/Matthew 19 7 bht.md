# Matthew 19:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The tension between the law of Moses and Jesus' teachings regarding divorce is revealed in this passage. The Pharisees' attempt to trap Jesus in a debate about the law exposes their legalistic mindset and desire to test his authority. Jesus uses this opportunity to teach about God's original intention for marriage, emphasizing the sacredness and permanence of the marital bond. However, this teaching also shows that Moses permitted divorce due to the hardness of the people's hearts, highlighting the need for a deeper understanding of God's intentions beyond legal permission.

1. "Moses allowed such divorces" - This objection raised by the people highlights their misunderstanding of the intention behind Moses' allowance for divorce.
