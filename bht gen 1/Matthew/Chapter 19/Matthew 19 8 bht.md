# Matthew 19:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this passage, we are reminded that Moses, as a civil lawgiver, allowed for divorces due to the hardness of their hearts and the low moral state of the people. However, this permission was temporary and not meant to be perpetual. The original law of marriage, established since the beginning, intended for it to be between one man and one woman, without any allowances for divorce. The Mosaic regulations were given to accommodate their sinful nature and were not intended to supersede God's original ordinance.
