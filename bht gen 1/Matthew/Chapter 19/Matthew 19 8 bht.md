# Matthew 19:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, commentators emphasize that the Mosaic law, which allowed divorce, was a temporary and civil measure due to the people's moral state and the hardness of their hearts. They highlight that the original intent of marriage was for it to be between one man and one woman, and that divorce should only be considered in exceptional cases. The verse also points out that polygamy, which emerged after the fall, was connected with sin and murder. Consequently, this verse addresses the context and limitations of divorce and remarriage in light of the divine design for marriage.
