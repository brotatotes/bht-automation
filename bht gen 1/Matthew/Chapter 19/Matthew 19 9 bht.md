## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The phrase 'except for fornication' is not meant to provide a loophole for divorce, but rather to highlight the seriousness of sexual immorality within a marriage." 

2. "Jesus is emphasizing the permanence and sacredness of the marriage covenant, urging his followers to approach marriage with a deep commitment and understanding of its lifelong nature." 

3. "By using the phrase 'put away,' Jesus is addressing the issue of divorce and the harmful consequences it can have on individuals and families."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Emphasis should be laid here on the word 'I.' This was the opinion of Jesus - this he proclaimed to be the law of his kingdom, this the command of God ever afterward."
2. "Only one offence was to make divorce lawful. This is the law of God."
3. "Legislatures have no right to say that people may put away their wives for any other cause; and where they do, and where there is marriage afterward, by the law of God such marriages are adulterous!"

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The phrase 'not on account of fornication' emphasizes that divorce is not permissible solely on the grounds of sexual immorality. It implies that there may be other reasons for divorce, but this particular sin is not sufficient to dissolve the marriage bond."

2. "The inclusion of this clause suggests that Jesus is addressing a specific issue that was prevalent in the culture at the time. He is clarifying that sexual immorality is a serious offense, but it does not automatically warrant divorce."

3. "By highlighting the importance of fidelity within marriage, Jesus is emphasizing the sacredness of the marital covenant. This verse reminds us that marriage is a lifelong commitment that should not be easily broken, even in the face of temptation or betrayal."

### John Calvin:
1. "Though the Law does not punish divorces, which are at variance with God’s first institution, yet he is an adulterer who rejects his wife and takes another."
2. "For it is not in the power of a man to dissolve the engagement of marriage, which the Lord wishes to remain inviolate; and so the woman who occupies the bed of a lawful wife is a concubine."
3. "Those who search for other reasons ought justly to be set at nought, because they choose to be wise above the heavenly teacher."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "This one ground for divorce, mentioned as a matter of course, makes no exception to the rule laid down in Matthew 19:5-6; this offence is in direct antagonism to the idea of marriage."
2. "All sins of unchastity are sins against the marriage tie, loosening it in spirit, but this act of sin is the only ground for dissolving it in form."
3. "The elevation of women from a condition of slavery has been the result of Christ’s teaching in regard to marriage; yet some women, thus elevated, have advocated divorce ‘for any cause.’"

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Matthew represents Jesus in both places as allowing divorce for fornication as a general term (πορνεια) which is technically adultery (μοιχεια from μοιχαω ορ μοιχευω)."
2. "Here, as in Matthew 5:31, a group of scholars deny the genuineness of the exception given by Matthew alone."
3. "Jesus by implication, as in Matthew 5:31, does allow remarriage of the innocent party, but not of the guilty one."

### John Gill:
1. "Whosoever shall put away his wife, except it be for fornication, and shall marry another woman, committeth adultery." - This quote highlights the condition under which divorce and remarriage would be considered adultery, emphasizing the importance of faithfulness in marriage.

2. "This is not to be understood of fornication committed before, but of uncleanness after marriage, which destroys their being one flesh." - This quote clarifies that the exception for divorce and remarriage is not referring to premarital fornication, but rather to post-marital unfaithfulness that breaks the unity of the marriage.

3. "Whoso marrieth her which is put away, for any other cause than adultery, doth commit adultery also." - This quote emphasizes that marrying someone who has been divorced for reasons other than adultery is also considered adultery, reinforcing the seriousness of the commitment made in marriage.

3. "The phrase 'Whosoever, etc.' highlights the inclusivity of God's grace. It is not limited to a select few, but available to all who choose to follow Jesus and live in accordance with his teachings."
