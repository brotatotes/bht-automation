# Matthew 2:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse being described highlights significant events in Bethlehem. With a high hand guiding these movements and the departure of the scepter from Judah, it is a sign that the Messiah's arrival is imminent. Bethlehem, symbolically called the "House of Bread," is the birthplace of the Bread of Life. The Wise Men, priests dedicated to the secrets of nature, recognized Jesus as a king, representing the first heathen converts to Christianity. This verse brings together the rich symbolism of Bethlehem and the meaningful arrival of the Magi to honor the King.
