# Matthew 2:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In a small town called Bethlehem, known as the "house of bread," a star from heaven proclaims the birth of a king. The Magi, wise men from Persia, arrive to pay homage to the newborn, who calls himself the Bread of Life. Many theories surround the identity and purpose of these men, but they represent the first Gentile converts to Christianity and bring gifts fit for a king. Despite the mystery surrounding their visit, their journey symbolizes the harmonious meeting of heavenly signs and earthly humility.

2. "Thus was 'the sceptre departing from Judah', a sign that Messiah was now at hand."
3. "There came wise men, probably of the learned class who cultivated astrology and kindred sciences."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Bethlehem, the birthplace of Christ, was a small town about six miles south of Jerusalem. The word 'Bethlehem' denotes 'house of bread' - perhaps given to the place on account of its great fertility."
2. "Herod received his appointment from the Romans, and had reigned at the time of the birth of Jesus for 34 years. Though he was permitted to be called 'king,' yet he was, in all respects, dependent on the Roman emperor."
3. "The persons here denoted were philosophers, priests, or astronomers. They lived chiefly in Persia and Arabia. They were the learned men of the Eastern nations, devoted to astronomy, to religion, and to medicine."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Bethlehem, the birthplace of him who calls himself the Bread of Life, is identified with the history of his human ancestry through Ruth and David." 
2. "Wise men, or Magi, were a priestly caste among the Persians and Medes, who occupied themselves with the secrets of nature, astrology, and medicine." 
3. "Many absurd traditions and guesses have been made about these visitors to our Lord's cradle, but their true identity and purpose remain a mystery."

### John Calvin:
1. "A beautiful instance of real harmony, amidst apparent contradiction, is here exhibited. A star from heaven announces that he is a king, to whom a manger, intended for cattle, serves for a throne, because he is refused admittance among the lowest of the people."
2. "This history conveys profitable instruction, not only because God brought the Magi to his Son, as the first-fruits of the Gentiles, but also because he appointed the kingdom of his Son to receive their commendation, and that of the star, for the confirmation of our faith; that the wicked and malignant contempt of his nation might not render him less estimable in our eyes."
3. "It may have come from a tradition of the Fathers, but has no solid foundation. But the most ridiculous contrivance of the Papists on this subject is, that those men were kings, because they found in another passage a prediction, that the kings of Tarshish, and of the Isles, and of Sheba, would offer gifts to the Lord."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Bethlehem of Judea. A small town situated on the crest of a small hill about six miles south of Jerusalem. The name means: house of bread, probably given on account of its great fertility." 
2. "Herod the king, generally called in history Herod the Great, the son of the Edomite Antipater by an Arabian mother... A skilful ruler, fond of architectural embellishment, but extremely cruel and jealous." 
3. "Magi, sages. Originally a class of priests among the Persians and Medes, who formed the king’s privy Council, and cultivated astrology, medicine, and occult natural science... They are justly regarded as the first fruits and representatives of heathen converts to Christianity."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Matthew does not propose to give biographic details of the supernatural birth of Jesus, wonderful as it was and disbelieved as it is by some today who actually deny that Jesus was born at all or ever lived, men who talk of the Jesus Myth, the Christ Myth, etc."
2. "Jesus, who was born in this House of Bread called himself the Bread of Life (John 6:35), the true Manna from heaven."
3. "The notion that they were kings arose from an interpretation of Isaiah 60:3; Revelation 21:24. The idea that they were three in number is due to the mention of three kinds of gifts (gold, frankincense, myrrh), but that is no proof at all."

### John Gill:
1. "Bethlehem signifies 'the house of bread', and in it was born, as an ancient writer observes, the bread which comes down from heaven: and it may also signify 'the house of flesh', and to it the allusion may be in 1 Timothy 3:16 'God manifest in the flesh'." 
2. "The more generally received opinion seems to be most right, that they came from Persia, which as it lies east of Judea, so was famous for this sort of men, and besides the name, as has been seen, is of Persic original."
3. "The time of their coming was, 'when Jesus was born'; not as soon as he was born, or on the 'thirteenth' day after his birth, the sixth of January, as it stands in our Calendar; or within the forty days before Mary's Purification; since this space of time does not seem to be sufficient for so long a journey, and which must require a considerable preparation for it."
