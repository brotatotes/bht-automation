# Matthew 2:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we see Joseph absent from the scene as the Magi present their gifts to the young child. The omission reflects the truthfulness of the narrative. The gifts of gold, frankincense, and myrrh are not only symbols of homage, but they also hold significance as tokens of royalty, divinity, and the future sufferings of the Messiah. The worship of the Magi is depicted as a spiritual act, inspiring reverence and prompting generous offerings from earnest hearts.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "I would rather regard the omission here as indicating a simple matter of fact, and contributing to show the truthfulness of the narrative: that Joseph happened not to be present at the time."
2. "The general idea is, that the Purification was previous to the visit of the magi. Being persuaded of the historic reality of these narratives of Matt. and Luke, we shall find no difficulty in also believing that, were we acquainted with all the events as they happened, their reconcilement would be an easy matter."
3. "The ancient Fathers were fond of tracing in the gifts symbolical meanings: ὡς βασιλεῖ τὸν χρυσόν, ὡς δὲ τεθνηξομένῳ τὴν σμύρναν, ὡς δὲ θεῷ τὸν λιβανωτόν."

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Clearly this was no civil homage to a petty Jewish king, whom these star-guided strangers came so far, and inquired so eagerly, and rejoiced with such exceeding joy, to pay, but a lofty spiritual homage."
2. "Beyond doubt, therefore, we are to understand the presentation of these gifts by the Magi as a religious offering."
3. "That the gold was presented to the infant King in token of His royalty; the frankincense in token of His divinity, and the myrrh, of His sufferings; or that they were designed to express His divine and human natures; or that the prophetical, priestly, and kingly offices of Christ are to be seen in these gifts; or that they were the offerings of three individuals respectively, each of them kings, the very names of whom tradition has handed down—all these are, at the best, precarious suppositions."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "They presented unto him gifts - These were presented to him as King of the Jews, because they supposed he was to be a distinguished prince and conqueror."
2. "Frankincense is a white resin or gum. It is obtained from a tree by making incisions in the bark, and suffering the gum to flow out. It is highly odoriferous or fragrant when burned, and was therefore used in worship, where it was burned as a pleasant offering to God."
3. "The offerings here referred to were made because they were the most valuable which the country of the Magi or wise men produced. They were tokens of respect and homage which they paid to the new-born King of the Jews. They evinced their high regard for him, and their belief that he was to be an illustrious prince."

### John Calvin:
1. "But they are convinced that he is divinely appointed to be a King. This thought alone, deeply rooted in their minds, procures their reverence."
2. "Almost all the commentators indulge in speculations about those gifts, as denoting the kingdom, priesthood, and burial of Christ. I see no solid ground for such an opinion."
3. "Our duty is, to adore him in a spiritual manner: for the lawful and reasonable worship which he demands is, that we consecrate first ourselves, and then all that we have, to his service."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The worship was more than the usual reverence to kings, or the journey of the Magi would seem unaccountable."
2. "Offering to the Lord what we have; He knows how to put it to the very best use."
3. "These heathen show how the sight of Christ not only leads earnest hearts to worship, but willing hands to give."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Opening their treasures (ανοιξαντες τους θησαυρους αυτων). Here 'treasures' means 'caskets' from the verb (τιθημ), receptacle for valuables."
2. "Then it means the things laid up in store, treasure in heaven (Matthew 6:20), in Christ (Colossians 2:3)."
3. "In their 'caskets' the Magi had gold, frankincense, and myrrh, all found at that time in Arabia, though gold was found in Babylon and elsewhere."

### John Gill:
1. "Upon the sight of the young child, they fell down on their knees or faces to the ground, agreeably to the custom of their country, and worshipped him as a king; giving him the same civil honour and respect, as they were wont to do to their own kings and princes." 

2. "And when they had opened their treasures, that is, their purses, bags or boxes, in which they put those things they brought with them necessary for their journey; they presented, or offered to him gifts, gold, frankincense and myrrh: such things as they had."

3. "Which last passage referred to, being a prophecy of the Messiah, has been thought by some now to have had its accomplishment, together with Isaiah 60:6 where frankincense as well as gold is mentioned, 'they shall bring gold and incense' or frankincense; upon which a noted Jewish writer observes, that gold and frankincense shall be brought privately as a present to the king Messiah."

### John Wesley:
1. "It was customary to offer some present to any eminent person whom they visited."
2. "Gold, frankincense, and myrrh — Probably these were the best things their country afforded; and the presents ordinarily made to great persons."
3. "This was a most seasonable, providential assistance for a long and expensive journey into Egypt, a country where they were entirely strangers, and were to stay for a considerable time."
