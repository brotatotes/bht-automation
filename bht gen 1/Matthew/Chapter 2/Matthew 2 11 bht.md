# Matthew 2:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When wise men from a distant land saw the new-born King of the Jews, they offered him precious gifts of gold, frankincense, and myrrh. Their offerings symbolized homage, respect, and belief in his royalty and divinity. Their journey to worship and present these gifts was more than a customary act for a mere earthly king. Their actions demonstrate that the sight of Christ not only leads earnest hearts to worship, but willing hands to give, providing for his earthly needs in a season of great providential assistance.

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Clearly this was no civil homage to a petty Jewish king, whom these star-guided strangers came so far, and inquired so eagerly, and rejoiced with such exceeding joy, to pay, but a lofty spiritual homage."
2. "Beyond doubt, therefore, we are to understand the presentation of these gifts by the Magi as a religious offering."
3. "That the gold was presented to the infant King in token of His royalty; the frankincense in token of His divinity, and the myrrh, of His sufferings; or that they were designed to express His divine and human natures; or that the prophetical, priestly, and kingly offices of Christ are to be seen in these gifts; or that they were the offerings of three individuals respectively, each of them kings, the very names of whom tradition has handed down—all these are, at the best, precarious suppositions."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The offerings here referred to were made because they were the most valuable which the country of the Magi or wise men produced. They were tokens of respect and homage which they paid to the new-born King of the Jews."
