# Matthew 2:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In a surprising turn of events, the sages who were about to share their joyful tidings with the king were warned by God in a dream to take a different path. The Lord knew the tyrant Herod too well to expose them to his cruelty once more. This led them to find safety in their flight into Egypt, guided by the divine oracle and protected by God. Their journey, marked by a star, becomes a powerful symbol of human souls seeking the incarnate God.
