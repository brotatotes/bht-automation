# Matthew 2:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we witness the immediate obedience of Joseph as he seeks refuge in Egypt, a convenient and safe haven for him and the Child. The commentators emphasize the providence of God in directing Joseph's steps and preserving His Son. Egypt, once a land of bondage and groaning for the Jews, becomes a land of refuge and safety for the newborn King. This flight to Egypt manifests the divine wisdom that surpasses the understanding of the world, demonstrating God's diverse ways of protecting His people.
