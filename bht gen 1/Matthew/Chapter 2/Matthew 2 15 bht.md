## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "This citation shews the almost universal application in the N.T. of the prophetic writings to the expected Messiah, as the general antitype of all the events of the typical dispensation."
2. "It seems to have been a received axiom of interpretation (which has, by its adoption in the N.T., received the sanction of the Holy Spirit Himself, and now stands for our guidance), that the subject of all allusions, the represented in all parables and dark sayings, was He who was to come, or the circumstances attendant on His advent and reign."
3. "ἵνα must not be explained away; it never denotes the event or mere result, but always the purpose."

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Our Evangelist here quotes directly from the Hebrew, warily departing from the Septuagint, which renders the words, 'From Egypt have I recalled his children,' meaning Israel's children."
2. "The prophet is reminding his people how dear Israel was to God in the days of his youth; how Moses was bidden to say to Pharaoh, 'Thus saith the Lord, Israel is My son, My first-born.'"
3. "Viewing the words in this light, even if our Evangelist had not applied them to the recall from Egypt of God's own beloved, Only-begotten Son, the application would have been irresistibly made by all who have learnt to pierce beneath the surface to the deeper relations which Christ bears to His people, and both to God."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It is not certainly known in what year he began his reign, and hence it is impossible to determine the time that Joseph remained in Egypt."
2. "The same love which led him to deliver His people Israel from the land of Egypt, now led him also to deliver His Son from that place."
3. "Perhaps, also, the place in Hosea became a proverb, to express any great deliverance from danger; and thus it could be said to be fulfilled in Christ."

### John Calvin:
1. "The words of the prophet ought to be thus interpreted: 'When Israel was yet a child, I brought him out of that wretched bondage in which he had been plunged. He was formerly like a dead man, and Egypt served him for a grave; but I drew him out of it as from the womb, and brought him into the light of life.'" 
2. "And justly does the Lord speak in this manner; for that deliverance was a sort of birth of the nation. Then were openly produced letters of adoption, when, by the promulgation of the law, they became 'the Lord's portion,' 'a royal priesthood, and a holy nation,' when they were separated from the other nations, and when, in short, God 'set up his tabernacle' to dwell in the midst of them."
3. "The grace and power of God became more illustrious, and his wonderful purpose was more distinctly seen, when light came out of darkness, and life out of hell."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "It seems to have been a settled axiom of interpretation...that the subject of all allusions...was He who was to come, or the circumstances attendant on His advent or reign." 
2. "The place of Egypt in history should not be forgotten...God did not forsake the Gentile world, though it forsook Him."
3. "His providential care was as really present in the formation of that civilization which issued from Egypt, as in the occurrences which led Israel and Jesus thither."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "The Magi had been warned in a dream not to report to Herod and now Joseph was warned in a dream to take Mary and the child along." 
2. "Matthew quotes Hosea 11:1 to show that this was in fulfillment of God's purpose to call his Son out of Egypt." 
3. "There is a Jewish tradition in the Talmud that Jesus 'brought with him magic arts out of Egypt in an incision on his body'."

### John Gill:
1. "Jesus was not above three or four months in Egypt."
2. "This is the natural and unconstrained sense of these words, which justifies the Evangelist in his citation and application of them to Christ's going to Egypt, and his return from thence."
3. "I will bring him from thence into the land of Judea, where he shall live and 'help' my 'servant', child Israel; shall instruct him in his duty, teach him the doctrines of the Gospel, and at last, by his sufferings and death, procure for him the pardon of all his transgressions."

### John Wesley:
1. "That it might be fulfilled — That is, whereby was fulfilled. The original word frequently signifies, not the design of an action, but barely the consequence or event of it." 

2. "Which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet — on another occasion: Out of Egypt have I called my Son - which was now fulfilled as it were anew." 

3. "Christ being in a far higher sense the Son of God than Israel, of whom the words were originally spoken."
