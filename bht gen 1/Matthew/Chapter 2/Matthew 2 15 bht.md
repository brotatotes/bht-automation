## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Our Evangelist here quotes directly from the Hebrew, warily departing from the Septuagint, which renders the words, 'From Egypt have I recalled his children,' meaning Israel's children."
2. "The prophet is reminding his people how dear Israel was to God in the days of his youth; how Moses was bidden to say to Pharaoh, 'Thus saith the Lord, Israel is My son, My first-born.'"
3. "Viewing the words in this light, even if our Evangelist had not applied them to the recall from Egypt of God's own beloved, Only-begotten Son, the application would have been irresistibly made by all who have learnt to pierce beneath the surface to the deeper relations which Christ bears to His people, and both to God."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The best chronologers have supposed that he died somewhere between two and four years after the birth of Christ, but at what particular time cannot now be determined."
2. "It seems probable that he was supposed to be a year old (see Matthew 2:16), and of course the time that he remained in Egypt was not long."
3. "The same love which led him to deliver His people Israel from the land of Egypt, now led him also to deliver His Son from that place."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "It seems to have been a settled axiom of interpretation...that the subject of all allusions, the represented in all parables and dark sayings, was He who was to come, or the circumstances attendant on His advent or reign." 
2. "The place of Egypt in history should not be forgotten...God did not forsake the Gentile world, though it forsook Him."
3. "His providential care was as really present in the formation of that civilization which issued from Egypt, as in the occurrences which led Israel and Jesus thither."

### John Gill:
1. "Jesus was not above three or four months in Egypt."
2. "Not by way of accommodation of phrases to a like event; or by way of type, which has a fresh completion in the antitype; or as a proverbial sentence which might be adapted to any remarkable deliverance out of hardship, misery and destruction; but literally, properly, and in the obvious sense thereof."
3. "This is the natural and unconstrained sense of these words, which justifies the Evangelist in his citation and application of them to Christ's going to Egypt, and his return from thence."

### John Wesley:
1. "That it might be fulfilled" - The verse highlights the fulfillment of a prophecy spoken by the prophet. This emphasizes the divine plan and purpose behind the events unfolding.
2. "Out of Egypt have I called my Son" - The commentary draws attention to the connection between the Old Testament prophecy and its fulfillment in Christ. It highlights Christ's superior status as the Son of God compared to Israel.
3. "Christ being in a far higher sense the Son of God" - This quote emphasizes the unique and elevated position of Christ as the Son of God, surpassing the significance of Israel as God's chosen people. It underscores the fulfillment of the prophecy in a greater and more profound way.
