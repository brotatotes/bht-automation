## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The modern objections to this narrative may be answered best by remembering the monstrous character of this tyrant, of whom Josephus asserts, 'His black gall made him savage against all.'" 
2. "Herod had marked the way to his throne, and his reign itself, with blood; had murdered his wife and three sons (the last just about this time); and was likely enough, in blind fury, to have made no enquiries, but given the savage order at once."
3. "Besides, there might have been a reason for not making enquiry, but rather taking the course he did, which was sure, as he thought, to answer the end, without divulging the purpose."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "He that sitteth in the heavens doth laugh at thee the Lord hath thee in derision. He disappointeth the devices of the crafty, so that their hands cannot perform their enterprise." (Psalms 2:4)
2. "That blessed Babe shall die indeed, but not by thy hand... Bitter satire!" (Luke 13:32; Luke 13:33)
3. "Heaven and earth shall sooner pass away than thou shalt have that Babe into thy hands. Therefore, Herod, thou must be content to want Him: to fill up the cup of thy bitter mortifications, already full enough—until thou die not less of a broken heart than of a loathsome and excruciating disease."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He that has a wicked heart, and indulges in anger, knows not where it will end, and will commonly commit far more evil than he at first intended."
2. "This destruction of the infants of Bethlehem is not mentioned by Josephus, but for this omission three reasons may be given: 1. Josephus, a Jewish historian and a Jew, would not be likely to record anything that would appear to confirm the truth of Christianity. 2. This act of Herod was really so small, compared with his other crimes, that the historian might not think it worthy of record. 3. The order was probably given in secret, and might not have been known to Josephus."
3. "Herod was an odious and bloody tyrant, and the facts of his reign prove that he was abundantly capable of this wickedness."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The children [τους παιδας] . Male children, as is indicated by the masculine form of the article." 
2. "The use of the masculine form of the article suggests that the focus here is specifically on boys, rather than children in general." 
3. "This verse highlights the importance of recognizing the gendered nature of the term 'children' in the original language, as it helps to clarify the intended meaning of the passage."

### John Calvin:
1. "He believed that the Magi had deceived him, because they did not choose to take part in his wicked cruelty."
2. "Fear prevented him at that time from employing a traitor, in a secret manner, to make an investigation."
3. "It is certainly probable, that he revolved the crime in his mind, but delayed it till a convenient opportunity should occur."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The murderer of his own wife and two sons would easily murder other children in his anger." 
2. "The figure becomes a typical prophecy of the grief in Bethlehem. Rachel was the ancestress of the tribe of Benjamin, which was always identified in fortune with Judah." 
3. "These infant martyrs were much celebrated in the ancient church, especially on the feast of Innocents."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The flight of Joseph was justified, for Herod was violently enraged that he had been mocked by the Magi, deluded in fact."
2. "Herod did not know, of course, how old the child was, but he took no chances and included all the little boys in Bethlehem two years old and under."
3. "It was another fulfillment of the prophecy in Jeremiah 31:15, originally written of the Babylonian captivity but with a striking illustration in this case also."

### John Gill:
1. "Upon this, Herod was exceeding wroth; partly at the usage he met with from the wise men, who according to his apprehension had put a trick upon him; and chiefly because his scheme was broke, which was by them to come at the knowledge and sight of the young child, and privately dispatch him." 
2. "He slew, or ordered to be slain, 'children', infants who had done him no injury, nor were capable of doing any, and whose parents also had not disobliged him." 
3. "This cruel murder of the infants seems to be hinted at by Josephus, where he says, that 'many slaughters followed the prediction of a new king'."

### John Wesley:
1. "Herod, seeing that he was deluded by the wise men — So did his pride teach him to regard this action, as if it were intended to expose him to the derision of his subjects." 
2. "Sending forth — a party of soldiers: In all the confines thereof - In all the neighbouring places, of which Rama was one." 
3. "The cruelty of Herod, in ordering all the male children in Bethlehem to be slain, was a fit emblem of the desperate wickedness of the human heart."
