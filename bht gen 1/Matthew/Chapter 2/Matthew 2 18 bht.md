# Matthew 2:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, a poignant scene unfolds as Rachel, the mother of Joseph and Benjamin, emerges from her grave, lamenting the loss of her children. The powerful imagery of Rachel rising from the tomb signifies the sorrow of the Israelites being led captive to Babylon. Furthermore, the verse also alludes to the tragic slaughter of innocent children in Bethlehem, contrasting it with the protection bestowed upon Jesus, symbolizing God's care over His children in times of peril. It showcases God's providential ways, as He may not always eliminate the persecutors, but provides sanctuary and ensures the preservation of His people.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Rachel, the mother of Joseph and Benjamin, was buried in the neighborhood of Bethlehem, where her sepulchre is still shown. She is figuratively represented as rising from the tomb and uttering a double lament for the loss of her children—first, by a bitter captivity, and now by a bloody death."
2. "O ye mothers of Bethlehem! Methinks I hear you asking why your innocent babes should be the ram caught in the thicket, while Isaac escapes. I cannot tell you, but one thing I know, that ye shall, some of you, live to see a day when that Babe of Bethlehem shall be Himself the Ram, caught in another sort of thicket, in order that your babes may escape a worse doom than they now endure."
3. "And if these babes of yours be now in glory, through the dear might of that blessed Babe, will they not deem it their honor that the tyrant's rage was exhausted upon themselves instead of their infant Lord?"

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The passage refers primarily to the leading of the Israelites captive to Babylon."
2. "Rachel, the ancestress of Benjamin, buried near Bethlehem, is represented as issuing from the hem on the road to Jerusalem."
3. "The wail of Rachel is renewed in the Church as often as the witnesses to the truth are put to death by carnal and worldly men, who profess to be the representatives of the Church."

### John Gill:

### John Wesley:
1. "Rachel weeping for her children â€” The Benjamites, who inhabited Rama, sprung from her. She was buried near this place; and is here beautifully represented risen, as it were out of her grave, and bewailing her lost children." 
2. "The preservation of Jesus from this destruction, may be considered as a figure of God's care over his children in their greatest danger." 
3. "God does not often, as he easily could, cut off their persecutors at a stroke. But he provides a hiding place for his people, and by methods not less effectual, though less pompous, preserves them from being swept away, even when the enemy comes in like a flood."
