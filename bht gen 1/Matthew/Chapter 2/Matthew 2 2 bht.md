# Matthew 2:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Out of Judea arose a sovereign of the world, fulfilling the ancient expectation prevalent in the East. The appearance of a luminous meteor, guided by special laws and purpose, heralded a significant event. Simple strangers arrived in Jerusalem, anticipating the entire city to be aware of the birth of their new-born King. The rising of this King, the dayspring and hope of both Jews and Gentiles, evoked reverence and homage, symbolizing complete surrender and recognition of His authority and power.
