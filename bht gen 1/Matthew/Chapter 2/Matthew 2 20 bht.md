# Matthew 2:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the plural form is not simply a figure of speech or a kind way of speaking about the dead. It could be referencing a broader category or type rather than a specific number of people. The verse alludes to both Herod and his son Antipater, highlighting their cruel disposition and their shared intent to harm the young child. The divine intervention and protection are emphasized, as those who sought to harm the child are now dead. The verse draws connections to the story of Moses, further emphasizing the theme of divine deliverance from those who intend harm.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The plural here is not merely idiomatic, nor, as Wordsw., 'for lenity and forbearance, in speaking of the dead;'" - This quote suggests that the use of the plural form in the verse is not simply a figure of speech or a way of speaking kindly about the dead.

2. "perhaps a citation from Exodus 4:19, where the same words are spoken to Moses" - This quote proposes a possible connection between the verse and a passage in Exodus, implying a deeper meaning or reference.

3. "betokening, not the number, but the category" - This quote suggests that the plural form in the verse is not indicating a specific number of people, but rather a broader category or type.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "They are dead who sought..." - This commentary suggests that the phrase could be referring to either Herod alone or both Herod and his son Antipater. It highlights the possibility of using the plural form to refer to a singular person, which was not uncommon in biblical language.

2. "He was of the same cruel disposition as his father..." - The commentary points out that Antipater, the son of Herod, shared the same cruel nature as his father. This insight provides context for understanding the dynamics between the two individuals and the reasons behind their actions.

1. "For they are dead." - This statement highlights the general fact that those who sought to harm the young child are no longer alive. It emphasizes the divine protection and intervention in preserving the child's life.

2. "Only Herod had sought to kill the young child." - This quote clarifies that while Herod was the main threat to the child's life, the phrase "they are dead" refers to all those who had ill intentions towards the child. It emphasizes the singular role of Herod in the narrative.

3. "The idiom may be suggested by Exodus 4:19: 'For all are dead that sought thy life.'" - This reference to Exodus 4:19 draws a parallel between the situation in the Bible verse and the story of Moses.
