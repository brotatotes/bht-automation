# Matthew 2:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the given Bible verse, Joseph faithfully follows the command of the angel. The instruction is not to a specific location but to the land of Israel, providing Joseph with the freedom to find a safe haven within the country. The phrase "They are dead which sought the young child's life" can refer to Herod alone or include his son Antipater, underscoring the potential involvement of both in their pursuit to harm Jesus.
