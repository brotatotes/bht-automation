# Matthew 2:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the face of Archelaus' reign, regarded as king but withheld the title, and known for his cruel and tyrannical disposition, a person feared going to Judea. Instead, they turned aside into the region of Galilee, under the rule of Herod Antipas, a comparatively milder prince. This alternative path was chosen, guided by divine warnings, to ensure safety and avoid the jurisdiction of Archelaus. The accounts in Matthew and Luke, harmonious and complementary, shed light on the historical context, the fears, and the reliance on God's guidance in this journey.

1. "Archelaus succeeded to Judea, Samaria, and Idumea; but Augustus refused him the title of king till it should be seen how he conducted himself; giving him only the title of ethnarch."
