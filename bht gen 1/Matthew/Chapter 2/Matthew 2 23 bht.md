# Matthew 2:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the passage speaks of the parents of Jesus coming to a place called Nazareth, a town of insignificance and contempt. The choice for Jesus to be brought up in such a place was seen as a local humiliation and a fulfillment of various prophetic statements. The term "Nazarene" was one of contempt and a mark of public reproach, highlighting the lowly and despised nature of the Messiah's upbringing. Through this, the verse signifies the fulfillment of prophecies and the humble background from which Jesus would arise.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "If, from Luke 2:39, one would conclude that the parents of Jesus brought Him straight back to Nazareth after His presentation in the temple...one might, from our Evangelist's way of speaking here, equally conclude that the parents of our Lord had never been at Nazareth until now."
2. "The best explanation of the origin of this name appears to be that which traces it to the word netzer...The little town of Nazareth...was probably so called from its insignificance: a weak twig in contrast to a stately tree."
3. "Thus, in the providential arrangement by which our Lord was brought up at the insignificant and opprobrious town called Nazareth, there was involved, first, a local humiliation; next, an allusion to Isaiah's prediction of His lowly, twig-like upspringing from the branchless, dried-up stump of Jesse; and yet further, a standing memorial of that humiliation which 'the prophets' had attached to the Messiah."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The prophets. Note the plural, as indicating not any one prediction in particular, but a summary of the import of several prophetic statements." 

2. "A Nazarene. A term of contempt... The very name of Nazareth suggested insignificance." 

3. "There is a future then for Israel, represented by the oak. 'There shall come forth a shoot from the stock of Jesse, and a twig from his roots shall bear fruit.'"

### John Wesley:
1. "He came and dwelt in Nazareth - a place contemptible to a proverb." 
2. "So that hereby was fulfilled what has been spoken in effect by several of the prophets, He shall be called a Nazarene." 
3. "He shall be despised and rejected, shall be a mark of public contempt and reproach."
