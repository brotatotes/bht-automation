# Matthew 2:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This Bible verse narrates how Jesus settled in the humble town of Nazareth, which fulfilled various prophecies regarding the Messiah's humble background and rejection. The name "Nazarene" was used to mock Jesus and highlight his perceived low status. Through Jesus' choice to dwell in Nazareth, he embraced the prophetic symbolism of being consecrated and set apart for God, like a Nazarite. This decision also reflected the parallel between Jesus' life and the history of Israel, emphasizing his identification with the despised and rejected.
