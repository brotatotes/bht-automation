# Matthew 2:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The gathered religious elites, including the high priest, scribes, and chief men, formed a formidable council known as the Sanhedrin. With their vast knowledge and interpretation of the law, they held both civil and religious power, making them the ultimate authority. Herod sought their theological expertise to pinpoint the birthplace of the prophesied Messiah in a sinister plan. Their opposition to Jesus revealed their deep contempt and united front against his teachings, posing a significant challenge for him to confront established religious authority.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "The class of 'chief priests' included the high priest for the time being, together with all who had previously filled this office... The 'scribes' were at first merely transcribers of the law and synagogue readers; afterwards interpreters of the law, both civil and religious, and so both lawyers and divines."
2. "The first of these classes, a proportion of the second, and 'the elders'... constituted the supreme council of the nation, called the Sanhedrim, the members of which, at their full complement, numbered seventy-two."
3. "That this was the council which Herod now convened is most probable, from the solemnity of the occasion... it was all the theologians of the nation whom Herod convened, because it was a theological response that he wanted."
