# Matthew 2:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The commentators unanimously point to the fulfillment of a prophetic declaration that establishes the divine plan and purpose behind Jesus' birth in Bethlehem. The religious leaders, though unwittingly, confirm the truth of this prophecy, which is well known among them. The testimony from the highest tribunal ultimately condemns Him to die, aligning with the common belief that the Messiah was to come from Bethlehem. This definitive answer is found in the scriptures, as it stands written by the prophet.
