"Instead of Ephrata, we find 'the land of Judah,' and instead of 'too small to be among' we have 'art not the least,' which is a sort of question introducing the insignificance of the place, and implying its moral greatness as the birthplace of the Messiah." - The changes in wording emphasize the moral greatness of Bethlehem despite its small size, emphasizing its role as the birthplace of the Messiah.

### John Gill:
1. "Bethlehem Ephratah was in the land of Juda, as appears from the prophecy of Micah itself, from Ruth 1:2 and the Septuagint version of Joshua 15:60 and is described in this manner by Matthew, partly to distinguish it from another Bethlehem in the land of Zebulun,Joshua 19:15 and partly because its other name Ephratah was now disused, and so unknown to Herod, who was unacquainted with the books and prophecies of the Old Testament."
2. "It might be 'little' and yet 'not the least'; besides, it might be 'little' and 'not little', or 'not the least' in different respects, and at different times; it might be little, mean, and contemptible as to worldly splendour, riches, number of inhabitants, pompous buildings, c. and yet not be little or mean, when considered as the place of the birth of many great persons, such as Booz, Jesse, David, c. and especially Christ."
3. "Moreover, the words in Micah may be rendered, by way of interrogation, 'art thou little, or the least?' To which the answer in Matthew is, 'no, thou art not the least', c. or else the word דבר may be understood, and the text be translated thus 'it is a small thing that thou art among the thousands of Judah, for out of thee', c. a great honour shall be conferred on thee, the Messiah shall spring from thee."

### John Wesley:
1. "The apostles did not always think it necessary exactly to transcribe the passages they cited, but contented themselves with giving the general sense, though with some diversity of language."
2. "The words of Micah, which we render, Though thou be little, may be rendered, Art thou little? And then the difference which seems to be here between the prophet and the evangelist vanishes away."
3. "When this and several other quotations from the Old Testament are compared with the original, it plainly appears, the apostles did not always think it necessary exactly to transcribe the passages they cited."
