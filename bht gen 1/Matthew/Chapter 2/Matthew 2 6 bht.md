# Matthew 2:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In a prophecy recognized by ancient Jewish scholars, a ruler is foretold to come from Bethlehem, distinguishing it as a significant place. The recurring image of the shepherd throughout Scripture symbolizes God and the Messiah's care and guidance for His people. While Bethlehem may have seemed insignificant in worldly terms, it holds great importance as the birthplace of significant figures and especially Christ. The apostles, when citing Old Testament passages, often conveyed the general sense rather than transcribing them precisely.

### John Gill:
1. "Bethlehem Ephratah was in the land of Juda, as appears from the prophecy of Micah itself, from Ruth 1:2 and the Septuagint version of Joshua 15:60 and is described in this manner by Matthew, partly to distinguish it from another Bethlehem in the land of Zebulun,Joshua 19:15 and partly because its other name Ephratah was now disused, and so unknown to Herod, who was unacquainted with the books and prophecies of the Old Testament."
2. "It might be little, mean, and contemptible as to worldly splendour, riches, number of inhabitants, pompous buildings, c. and yet not be little or mean, when considered as the place of the birth of many great persons, such as Booz, Jesse, David, c. and especially Christ."
3. "Moreover, the words in Micah may be rendered, by way of interrogation, 'art thou little, or the least?' To which the answer in Matthew is, 'no, thou art not the least', c. or else the word דבר may be understood, and the text be translated thus 'it is a small thing that thou art among the thousands of Judah, for out of thee', c. a great honour shall be conferred on thee, the Messiah shall spring from thee."

### John Wesley:
1. "The apostles did not always think it necessary exactly to transcribe the passages they cited, but contented themselves with giving the general sense, though with some diversity of language."
2. "The words of Micah, which we render, Though thou be little, may be rendered, Art thou little? And then the difference which seems to be here between the prophet and the evangelist vanishes away."
3. "When this and several other quotations from the Old Testament are compared with the original, it plainly appears, the apostles did not always think it necessary exactly to transcribe the passages they cited."
