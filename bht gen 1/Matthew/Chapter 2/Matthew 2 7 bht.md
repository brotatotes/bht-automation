# Matthew 2:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we read about a ruler who, motivated by a mixture of fear and evil intent, secretly seeks information about the birth of Jesus. His desire to ascertain the precise time when the star appeared indicates a meticulous and calculated approach. Despite his efforts, God intervenes and confounds his plans, leading him on a futile and desperate pursuit of power. The passage highlights the divine protection surrounding the birth of Christ, as well as the contrasting nature of human schemes when faced with God's sovereignty.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The word 'ascertained' emphasizes the careful and precise nature of their investigation into the appearance of the star." 
2. "The use of the word 'duration' suggests that the length of time the star was visible played a role in their calculations." 
3. "The positioning of the word 'the time' between the article and its noun indicates that it refers back to the specific moment when they saw the star."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Herod has so far succeeded in his murderous design: he has tracked the spot where lies his victim, an unconscious babe."
2. "The one he had got from the Sanhedrim; the other he will have from the sages; but secretly, lest his object should be suspected and defeated."
3. "And now he thinks he is succeeding to a wish, and shall speedily clutch his victim; for at so early an age as they indicate, He would not likely have been removed from the place of His birth."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Privily - Secretly, privately. He did this to ascertain the time when Jesus was born."
2. "Diligently - Accurately, exactly. He took pains to learn the precise time when the star appeared."
3. "He did this because he naturally concluded that the star appeared just at the time of his birth, and he wished to know precisely how old the child was."

### John Calvin:
1. "Though a bad conscience made him timid, there can be no doubt that God struck his mind with an unusual fear, which for a time made him incapable of reflection, and almost deprived him of the use of reason."
2. "Let us learn, that a miracle was effected, in rescuing the Son of God from the jaws of the lion. Not less at the present day does God infatuate his enemies, so that a thousand schemes of injuring and ruining his Church do not occur to their minds, and even the opportunities which are at hand are not embraced."
3. "He was seized with a spirit of giddiness, to attack God; and, on the other hand, his manner of acting was childish: for his design was frustrated, so that he was like a 'blind man groping in darkness.'"

Note: The commentary is quite long, so I had to select the most relevant and impactful quotes that provide insight into the verse.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Privately. This indicates his evil purpose, and is quite characteristic of political suspicion."
2. "Learned of them earned. He probably drew some inference from what they told him, and took measures accordingly."
3. "What time. This implies how long it had appeared, quite as much as, when it appeared."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "He had manifestly not told members of the Sanhedrin why he was concerned about the Messiah. So he conceals his motives to the Magi."
2. "And yet he 'learned of them carefully,' 'learned exactly' or 'accurately.' He was anxious to see if the Jewish prophecy of the birthplace of the Messiah agreed with the indications of the star to the Magi."
3. "The time of the appearing star is not 'the time when the star appeared,' but the age of the star's appearance."

### John Gill:
1. "He took a good deal of pains in examining them, he sifted them, and inquired of them with much accuracy, and exactness, the precise time of the star's appearing to them..." 
2. "...that hereby he might exactly know the age of Christ, and the better execute the bloody design he had formed, should the wise men disappoint him..."
3. "...and the better detect an impostor, should another afterwards arise, and set up himself for the king of the Jews."
