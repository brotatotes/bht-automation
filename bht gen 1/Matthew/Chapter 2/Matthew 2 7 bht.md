# Matthew 2:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In secret and with great diligence, Herod determined the time of the star's appearance by questioning the wise men and scribes. He believed that the star's appearance marked the birth of the new King of the Jews and was intent on finding the child to carry out his malicious plan. Herod's fear of being deceived and his political suspicion drove him to thoroughly investigate the precise age of the child so as to eliminate any potential impostors in the future.
