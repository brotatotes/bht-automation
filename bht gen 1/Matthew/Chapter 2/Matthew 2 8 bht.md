### John Gill:
1. "It may seem strange that neither any of the Jews, nor Herod, or any of his ministers and courtiers, should go along with these men to Bethlehem; since it was but a little way off, not above five or six miles from Jerusalem; and since the birth of such a person was no trivial thing, but an affair of great concern and importance."
2. "The Jews might not care to go, lest Herod should suspect that they were going to revolt from him, and set up this new born king against him; and it might be a piece of policy in Herod and his courtiers not to accompany them, for they might imagine that the parents of the child would be jealous and afraid of them, and would therefore conceal it, when they would be in no fear of strangers."
3. "When he dismissed them he gave them this charge and these orders, go and search diligently for the young child; go to Bethlehem, the place of his birth I have told you of, and there inquire and search in every house and family, omit none till you have found him; and when you have found him bring me word again; give me a particular account of him, who are his parents, and where he dwells, that I may come and worship him also."

### John Wesley:
1. "Herod's request to the wise men to bring him word if they found the newborn king reveals his skepticism and suspicion about the prophecy. It suggests that Herod did not truly believe that the Messiah had been born, and he wanted to confirm the news for himself."
2. "The fact that Herod wanted to 'make sure work at once' by eliminating any potential threat to his rule further emphasizes his fear and insecurity. It highlights the extent to which he was willing to go to protect his power."
3. "Herod's response to the news of the birth of Jesus reflects the contrast between his worldly authority and the divine authority of the newborn king. While Herod sought to maintain his earthly kingdom, Jesus came to establish a spiritual kingdom that would surpass all earthly powers."
