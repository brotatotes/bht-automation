# Matthew 2:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As the magi followed the star, it went before them, guiding their journey with precision. This star, either a miraculous sign or a rare astronomical event, led them to the land of Judea and ultimately to the precise location of the young child. Standing directly over the house, it indicated the object of their search and signaled the fulfillment of the prophecy of the birth of the king of the Jews. Guided by divine providence and their own diligence, the magi departed and departed and brought back a detailed account to King Herod.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "ἐπάνω οὗ ἦν (elliptic for τόπου οὗ ἦν) τὸ π. may mean, ‘over that part of Bethlehem where the young child was,’ which they might have ascertained by enquiry."
2. "Or it may even mean, ‘over the whole town of Bethlehem.’"
3. "If it is to be understood as standing over the house, and thus indicating to the magi the position of the object of their search, the whole incident must be regarded as miraculous."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Yet God ordered this too, lest the news should be blabbed, and reach the tyrant's ears, before the Babe could be placed beyond his reach. Thus are the very errors and crimes and cold indifferences of men all overruled."
2. "And, lo, the star, which they saw in the east—implying apparently that it had disappeared in the interval."
3. "Went before them, and stood over where the young child was—Surely this could hardly be but by a luminous meteor, and not very high."

### John Calvin:
1. "It is truly an instance of base sluggishness, that not one of the Jews offers himself as an escort to those foreigners, to go and see the King who had been promised to their own nation."
2. "They were afraid, perhaps, of Herod’s cruelty: but it displayed wicked ingratitude that, for the sake of the salvation which had been offered to them, they were unwilling to undergo any risk."
3. "The whole nation, I have lately showed, was so degenerate, that they chose rather to be oppressed with the yoke of tyranny, than to submit to any inconvenience arising from a change."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The theory of a miraculous star easily explains the statement of this verse, and if we were told that the star stood over the house, then no other explanation will suffice."
2. "The astronomical theory thus explains the passage: The most remarkable conjunction of Jupiter and Saturn took place in May, and would be visible before sunrise (i.e., in the east), five months afterwards, a sufficient time to perform the journey."
3. "Supposing, then, the standing of the star to mean its reaching its zenith, there would be about sufficient time to reach Bethlehem, for the calculations show that the planets were at the zenith one and a half hours after sunset."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Went before them (προηγεν αυτους). Imperfect tense, kept on in front of them, not as a guide to the town since they now knew that, but to the place where the child was." 

2. "The stall where the cattle and donkeys stayed may have been beneath the inn in the side of the hill."

3. "Justin Martyr says that it was in a cave."

### John Gill:
1. "With great care and attention, what he had told them of the birth place of the young child; the strict charge he had given them to search diligently for him, and then return to him with an account of the whole affair; and his expressions of respect to the new born prince, which they took to be said in great sincerity,they departed." 

2. "When they saw it in their own country, according to their best observation, it was over the land of Judea, and they were persuaded of it, that it was a certain sign that the king of the Jews was born."

3. "This star had a motion, kept pace with them, and was a guide unto them, till it and they came to the place where Christ was; and then it stood directly over the house, so that they had no need to inquire of any person for him."
