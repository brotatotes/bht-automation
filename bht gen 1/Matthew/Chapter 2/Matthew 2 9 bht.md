# Matthew 2:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The commentators shed light on a Bible verse that speaks about the wise men seeking the newborn King in Bethlehem. They emphasize the lack of interest shown by the Jews in accompanying the foreigners to witness this momentous event. The commentators also discuss the divine intervention that orchestrated the journey of the wise men, ensuring that their news wouldn't reach Herod before they reached safety. They delve into the theory of a miraculous star, explaining how its movement and alignment with Jupiter and Saturn guided the wise men to the exact location of the baby Jesus.

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Ye could tell Herod where Christ should be born, and could hear of these strangers from the far East that the Desire of all nations had actually come; but I do not see you trooping to Bethlehem." 
2. "Yet God ordered this too, lest the news should be blabbed, and reach the tyrant's ears, before the Babe could be placed beyond his reach." 
3. "Surely this could hardly be but by a luminous meteor, and not very high."

### John Calvin:
1. "It is truly an instance of base sluggishness, that not one of the Jews offers himself as an escort to those foreigners, to go and see the King who had been promised to their own nation."
2. "The whole nation, I have lately showed, was so degenerate, that they chose rather to be oppressed with the yoke of tyranny, than to submit to any inconvenience arising from a change."
3. "But the ardor of their zeal is unabated; they set out without a guide."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The theory of a miraculous star easily explains the statement of this verse, and if we were told that the star stood over the house, then no other explanation will suffice."
2. "The astronomical theory thus explains the passage: The most remarkable conjunction of Jupiter and Saturn took place in May, and would be visible before sunrise (i.e., in the east), five months afterwards, a sufficient time to perform the journey."
3. "Supposing, then, the standing of the star to mean its reaching its zenith, there would be about sufficient time to reach Bethlehem, for the calculations show that the planets were at the zenith one and a half hours after sunset."

### John Gill:
1. "With great care and attention, what he had told them of the birth place of the young child; the strict charge he had given them to search diligently for him, and then return to him with an account of the whole affair; and his expressions of respect to the new born prince, which they took to be said in great sincerity,they departed." 

2. "When they saw it in their own country, according to their best observation, it was over the land of Judea, and they were persuaded of it, that it was a certain sign that the king of the Jews was born."

3. "This star had a motion, kept pace with them, and was a guide unto them, till it and they came to the place where Christ was; and then it stood directly over the house, so that they had no need to inquire of any person for him."
