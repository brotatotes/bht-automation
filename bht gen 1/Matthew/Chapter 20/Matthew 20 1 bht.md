# Matthew 20:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this parable, a householder represents God in the Gospel dispensation, and his vineyard symbolizes the kingdom of heaven. The laborers in the vineyard, whether they are ministers or all believers, are called to serve and labor in the church. It is through the influence of God's grace that these laborers, hired by the householder, willingly serve Him with joy and freely work in His vineyard. The parable emphasizes the equality of God's rewards for those who faithfully serve Him, whether they were called early or late in their spiritual journey.
