# Matthew 20:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, commentators highlight the sense of entitlement and expectation displayed by certain individuals. They emphasize that these individuals focused on personal gain and believed they deserved more based on their own merit, rather than recognizing the generosity and grace of the employer. The commentators also mention the mistaken perception of these individuals, who failed to understand the principles of grace and generosity and instead held onto a limited perspective of entitlement and superiority. The verse challenges the notion of entitlement and encourages a shift in focus towards recognizing and embracing God's generosity and mercy.
