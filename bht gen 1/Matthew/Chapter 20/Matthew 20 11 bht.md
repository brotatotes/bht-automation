# Matthew 20:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, commentators describe a parable that highlights human tendencies of entitlement, ingratitude, and comparison. The murmuring laborers reveal ingratitude instead of appreciating the generosity of the householder. The parable reminds us that God's grace is freely given and should not be envied or resented. It challenges us to examine our hearts and attitudes, urging contentment and gratitude for the blessings we have received rather than comparing ourselves to others.
