3. "The parable teaches us that God's ways are not our ways. His economy is one of grace and mercy, where the last will be first and the first will be last. It challenges our notions of fairness and invites us to embrace the radical generosity of God."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "A well-grounded complaint, if salvation were of works." This quote highlights the understanding that salvation is not based on works but on grace. It suggests that the workers who labored longer may have felt entitled to more reward, but in the context of salvation, it emphasizes that salvation is not earned through our own efforts.
2. "These last spent one hour." This quote points out the contrast between the workers who labored for a longer time and those who worked for a shorter period. It highlights the unexpectedness of God's grace, as it is not based on the length or amount of our works but on His generosity.
3. "If salvation were of works." This quote emphasizes the idea that salvation is not achieved through our own works or merit. It implies that if salvation were based on works alone, the complaint of the workers who labored longer would be justified. However, it reminds us that salvation is a gift of grace that cannot be earned.
