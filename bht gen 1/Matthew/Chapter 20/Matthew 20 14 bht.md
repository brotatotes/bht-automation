# Matthew 20:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This verse encourages us to assert our rights and claim what is rightfully ours, as it reflects justice and fairness. We have a responsibility to recognize and take ownership of what belongs to us, not allowing it to be unjustly taken or withheld. God's generosity knows no bounds, extending His love and mercy to all, whether they come early or late, Jew or Gentile. His grace is not limited by time or circumstance, but is freely given to all who turn to Him.
