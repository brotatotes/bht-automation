## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The last were first, as equal to the first; first, in order of payment; first, as superior to the first (no others being brought into comparison), in that their reward was more in proportion to their work, and not marred by a murmuring spirit."
2. "The first were last in these same respects."
3. "While multitudes are called into the vineyard, many, by murmuring and otherwise disgracing their calling, will nullify it, and so, although first by profession and standing, will not be of the number of the elect: although called, will not be chosen."

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Take heed lest by indulging the spirit of these murmurers at the penny given to the last hired, ye miss your own penny, though first in the vineyard; while the consciousness of having come in so late may inspire these last with such a humble frame, and such admiration of the grace that has hired and rewarded them at all, as will put them into the foremost place in the end."

2. "Many receive the invitations of the Gospel whom God has never 'chosen to salvation through sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth.' But what, it may be asked, has this to do with the subject of our parable? Probably thisâ€”to teach us that men who have wrought in Christ's service all their days may, by the spirit which they manifest at the last, make it too evident that, as between God and their own souls, they never were chosen workmen at all."

3. "The 'calling' of which the New Testament almost invariably speaks is what divines call effectual calling, carrying with it a supernatural operation on the will to secure its consent. But that cannot be the meaning of it here; the 'called' being emphatically distinguished from the 'chosen.' It can only mean here the 'invited.'"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Many that, in the order of time, are brought last into the kingdom, shall be first in the rewards."
2. "To all to whom the rewards of heaven are promised they shall be given. Nothing shall be withheld that was promised."
3. "If, amid the multitude of Christians, I choose to signalize such men as Paul, and Martyn, and Brainerd, and Spencer, and Summerfield - to appoint some of them to short labor but to wide usefulness, and raise them to signal rewards, I injure not the great multitude of others who live long lives less useful and less rewarded."

These quotes highlight the idea that in the kingdom of God, rewards are not based solely on the order of arrival or the length of service, but on the faithfulness and usefulness of individuals. God has the right to bestow special talents and rewards on certain individuals without diminishing the rewards promised to others.

### John Calvin:
1. "Christ only meant to say that every one who has been called before others ought to run with so much the greater alacrity."
2. "To exhort all men to be modest, not to give themselves the preference above others, but willingly to share with them a common prize."
3. "God is not limited to any person, but calls freely whomsoever He pleases, and bestows on those who are called whatever rewards He thinks fit."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The parable...illustrates the truth that the order in the calling of individuals and nations will in many (not all) cases be reversed in their final position in heaven."
2. "An encouragement to those called late in life; a solemn warning to those called early, urging them to be humble, and ever mindful of their unworthiness before God."
3. "The admonition was intended...for all Christians who enjoy special spiritual privileges and the great blessing of an early acquaintance with the Saviour."

### John Gill:
1. "The saying 'the last shall be first, and the first last' illustrates the reversal of fortunes that Jesus taught in Matthew 19:30." 

2. "The parable can be applied to different groups, such as Jews and Gentiles, or nominal and real Christians." 

3. "Only a few among the outwardly called are inwardly and effectually called by the powerful grace of God."

### John Wesley:
