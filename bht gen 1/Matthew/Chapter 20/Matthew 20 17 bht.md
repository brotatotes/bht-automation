# Matthew 20:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this passage, Jesus anticipates his imminent sacrifice and displays unwavering resolve, while his disciples remain unaware of the gravity of the situation. As he journeys to Jerusalem, Jesus takes the opportunity to privately remind his disciples of his forthcoming suffering and to prepare them for the same. Though they may not fully understand in the moment, Jesus' words will later serve as a confirmation of their faith in him as the true Messiah and an invitation to partake in a life of self-sacrifice and service.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### John Calvin:
1. "He sees that the day of his death is at hand; nay more, he is already in a state of readiness to offer himself to be sacrificed; and, on the other hand, he sees the disciples not only afraid, but overwhelmed by blind alarm." 
2. "He fortifies them, that they may not give way, when a calamity, which has arisen suddenly and contrary to expectation, takes them by surprise." 
3. "The circumstance of their following Christ is a proof of no ordinary respect and obedience. It would indeed have been far better to hasten cheerfully and without regret, wheresoever the Son of God chose to lead them; but commendation is due to their reverence for his person, which appears in choosing to do violence to their own feelings rather than to forsake him."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "He hastened before them, arousing their amazement and fear." 
2. "Referred, incorrectly, by some to the retirement to Ephraim." 
3. "He took the twelve disciples apart."

### John Gill:
1. "The land of Israel is said to be higher than any other land whatever; and the temple at Jerusalem, higher than any part of the land of Israel; wherefore Christ's going to Jerusalem, is expressed by going up to it." 
2. "Christ's going to Jerusalem was his last journey, and he took the twelve disciples apart in the way, into some private place, to remind them of his sufferings and death, and to prepare them for the same."

### John Wesley:
1. "Jesus knew that his journey to Jerusalem would lead to his crucifixion, yet he did not waver in his determination to fulfill God's plan for salvation."
