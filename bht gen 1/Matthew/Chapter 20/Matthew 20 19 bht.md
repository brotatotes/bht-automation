# Matthew 20:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this passage, the commentators highlight the cruel mockery and humiliation suffered by Jesus before his crucifixion. They describe how he was dressed in a scarlet robe, crowned with thorns, and hailed as the "king of the Jews" in a mocking manner. Additionally, they emphasize the significance of Jesus' crucifixion as a Roman punishment, illustrating the Jews' decision to hand him over to the Gentiles. The commentators also note the difficulty the people had in accepting the plain and literal meaning of Jesus' words, as it challenged their preconceived notions of a grand and earthly kingdom for the Messiah.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### John Gill:
1. "To mock him, as they did, by putting on him a scarlet robe, platting a crown of thorns, and placing it on his head, and a reed in his hand; and then bowed the knee to him, and cried, hail, king of the Jews!"
2. "And to crucify him: which, as it was a cruel and shameful death, such as slaves and the worst of malefactors were put to, so it was a Roman one; for which reason, the Jews choose to deliver him into the hands of the Gentiles."
3. "The words were plain, the grammatical sense of them was easy, but they could not imagine that they were to be taken literally; which was such a glaring contradiction to their received and rooted principles of the temporal kingdom of the Messiah, and the grandeur of it, that they fancied these expressions carried a mystical, secret meaning in them, which they were not masters of."
