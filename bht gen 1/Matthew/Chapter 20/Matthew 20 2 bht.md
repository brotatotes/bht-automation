# Matthew 20:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the commentators emphasize the value of a denarius, which generally represented a fair wage for a day's work during that time. The parable challenges our tendency to compare ourselves with others, reminding us that God's grace is freely given and not based on our own merit. It also highlights the notion that God's generosity and love surpass any human notions of fairness and entitlement. Ultimately, the verse teaches us that God's grace cannot be earned or deserved, but is freely bestowed upon all.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "ἐκ seems to point, as commonly in other references, at the source or foundation of the συμφωνία."
2. "The denarius a day was the pay of a Roman soldier in Tiberius’ time, a few years before this parable was uttered."
3. "This we may therefore regard as liberal pay for the day’s work."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The parable of the laborers in the vineyard teaches us that God's grace is not based on our merit or works, but on His generosity and love." 

2. "The owner of the vineyard represents God, who is just and fair in His dealings with all people, regardless of their background or abilities." 

3. "This parable challenges our human tendency to compare ourselves with others and feel entitled to more. It reminds us that God's grace is freely given and cannot be earned or deserved."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The coin here referred to was a Roman coin, equal in value, at different periods, to 15 cents or 17 cents (7 1/2 d. to 8 1/2 d.) (circa 1880’s)."
2. "The consular denarius bore on one side a head of Rome, and an X or a star, to denote the value in ases, and a chariot with either two or four horses."
3. "In England, before the discovery of the mines of gold and silver in South America, and consequently before money was plenty, the price of labor was about in proportion."

Note: The commentary does not provide any specific quotes that directly relate to the Bible verse.

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "A denarius was regarded as good pay for a day's work."
2. "In almost every case where the word occurs in the New Testament it is connected with the idea of a liberal or large amount."
3. "For a penny is, literally, out of or on the strength of a penny; the payment being that on the strength of which the agreement was made."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The general idea is of reward, but with a special reference to temporal rewards, which may be received while eternal life is lost."
2. "Eternal salvation is meant; for while the idea of reward is present, the whole drift of the parable teaches us that God’s grace is free."
3. "The mercenary spirit of the first laborers has a primary reference to the Jews and their prejudice against the Gentiles. This envious disposition is thus rebuked."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Penny" is not adequate, "shilling" Moffatt has it.
2. The εκ with the ablative represents the agreement (συνφωνησας) with the workmen (εργατων).
3. "The day" the Greek has it, an accusative of extent of time.

### John Gill:
1. "He that is hired for a day, may demand it all the night; and he that is hired for a night may demand it all the day." This rule highlights the expectation of the laborers to receive their full wages for the time they have worked, regardless of whether it is day or night.

2. "The wages of a day were usually a penny." Understanding the value of the penny in this context helps us grasp the significance of the laborers' agreement and the potential implications for their livelihood.

3. "By the penny a day agreed for with the laborers, may be meant external privileges; or the free promise made... of a sufficient supply of grace daily." This interpretation suggests that the penny represents not only earthly wages but also the spiritual blessings and provisions promised by God to believers.

Note: The commentary provides additional historical and legal context but does not significantly contribute to the understanding of the verse.

### John Wesley:
1. "The Roman penny was about seven pence halfpenny."
2. "[About thirteen and three quarter cents, American.]"
3. "This was then the usual price of a day's labour."
