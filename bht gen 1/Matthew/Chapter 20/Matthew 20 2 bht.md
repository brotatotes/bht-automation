# Matthew 20:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we see a parable that teaches the value of fairness and purpose in our lives. The master is depicted as just and fair in his dealings with the laborers, paying them a day's wage that was customary for their work. The parable also highlights the importance of agreement and mutual understanding in our relationships, as the master and the laborers reached an agreement before beginning their work. It also reminds us of God's free grace, available to all, regardless of their background or when they were called into His service.
