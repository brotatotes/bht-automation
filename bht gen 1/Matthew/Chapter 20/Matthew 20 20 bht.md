# Matthew 20:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this passage, a woman, likely the mother of James and John, approaches Jesus to make a request on behalf of her sons. It is possible that she hesitates to disclose the nature of the favor, uncertain about its appropriateness. This follows a discussion where Jesus predicts His crucifixion, which some speculate may have influenced the timing of the request. The disciples, influenced by Jesus' words about sitting on thrones, may have misunderstood them literally and desired positions of authority.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Philip Schaff:
1. "The request was suggested by her sons (comp. Mark 10:35), James and John, who were called Boanerges (Mark 3:17) and had been with Jesus on the Mount of Transfiguration (chap. Matthew 17:1)."
2. "Worshipping him, i.e., saluting Him with reverence, as was usual in asking favor of a king."
3. "Asking somewhat. She asked a favor but did not at once tell what it was, probably because doubtful of the propriety of the request."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Surely an inopportune time for such a request just after the pointed prediction of Christ's crucifixion."
2. "Perhaps their minds had been preoccupied with the words of Jesus (Matthew 19:28) about their sitting on twelve thrones taking them in a literal sense."
3. "The 'something' put forward as a small matter was simply the choice of the two chief thrones promised by Jesus (Matthew 19:28)."

### John Gill:
1. "She is not called the wife of Zebedee, who might be now dead, but the mother of his children, his two sons, as the Arabic version renders it."
2. "She came in a very submissive manner to him, either bowed unto him, or kneeled down before him, or threw herself at his feet, and signified that she had a single favour, and a very considerable one, to ask of him."
3. "These two disciples, having observed what Christ had said concerning the twelve disciples sitting on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel, and what he had just related, concerning his rising again the third day, which they might understand of some display of his glory; and concluding from all this, that the setting up of his temporal monarchy was at hand, inform their mother of it, and move to her, to use her interest with Christ, in their favour."

### John Wesley:
1. "Considering what he had been just speaking, was ever anything more unreasonable?" 

2. "Perhaps Zebedee himself was dead, or was not a follower of Christ." 

3. "Mark 10:35."
