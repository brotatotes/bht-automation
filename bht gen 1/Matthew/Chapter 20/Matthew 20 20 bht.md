# Matthew 20:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this account, a request is made to Jesus by the mother of two disciples, who are seeking positions of honor and power in His kingdom. The request is seen as ambitious and driven by worldly desires, rather than a true understanding of Christ's teachings. The timing of the request is questioned, as it comes immediately after Jesus predicts His own crucifixion. The mother's approach to Jesus is described as submissive, as she seeks to ask for a significant favor. Overall, this passage serves as a cautionary tale, highlighting the dangers of misplaced ambition and self-seeking motives.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### John Calvin:
1. "This narrative contains a bright mirror of human vanity; for it shows that proper and holy zeal is often accompanied by ambition, or some other vice of the flesh, so that they who follow Christ have a different object in view from what they ought to have."
2. "Nor is it enough that, at the commencement, we sincerely apply our minds to Christ, if we do not stead-lastly maintain the same purity; for frequently, in the midst of the course, there spring up sinful affections by which we are led astray."
3. "If this happens to two excellent disciples, with what care ought we to walk, if we do not wish to turn aside from the right path!"

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The request was suggested by her sons... James and John, who were called Boanerges and had been with Jesus on the Mount of Transfiguration."
2. "Worshipping him, i.e., saluting Him with reverence, as was usual in asking favor of a king."
3. "She asked a favor but did not at once tell what it was, probably because doubtful of the propriety of the request."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Surely an inopportune time for such a request just after the pointed prediction of Christ's crucifixion."
2. "Perhaps their minds had been preoccupied with the words of Jesus about their sitting on twelve thrones taking them in a literal sense."
3. "The 'something' put forward as a small matter was simply the choice of the two chief thrones promised by Jesus."

### John Gill:
1. "She is not called the wife of Zebedee, who might be now dead, but the mother of his children, his two sons, as the Arabic version renders it."
2. "She came in a very submissive manner to him, either bowed unto him, or kneeled down before him, or threw herself at his feet, and signified that she had a single favour, and a very considerable one, to ask of him."
3. "These two disciples, having observed what Christ had said concerning the twelve disciples sitting on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel, and what he had just related, concerning his rising again the third day, which they might understand of some display of his glory; and concluding from all this, that the setting up of his temporal monarchy was at hand, inform their mother of it, and move to her, to use her interest with Christ, in their favour."

### John Wesley:
1. "Considering what he had been just speaking, was ever anything more unreasonable?" - The commentary highlights the mother of Zebedee's children's request as unreasonable, given the context of Jesus' previous teachings.
2. "Perhaps Zebedee himself was dead, or was not a follower of Christ." - The commentary suggests that Zebedee, the father of James and John, may not have been present or a follower of Jesus, which could explain why their mother approached Jesus instead.
3. "Then came to him the mother of Zebedee's children." - This quote simply introduces the fact that the mother of James and John approached Jesus, setting the stage for the commentary's analysis.
