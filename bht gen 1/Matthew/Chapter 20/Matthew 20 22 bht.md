In this Bible verse, Jesus responds to the disciples' request for positions of power in his kingdom.

Jesus reminds them that sharing in his kingdom requires sharing in his sufferings.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The flesh ever seeks to be glorified, before it is crucified: exalted, before it is abased."
2. "The 'cup' is a frequent Scripture image for joy or sorrow... It here seems to signify more the inner and spiritual bitterness, resembling the agony of the Lord Himself."
3. "This answer of our Lord contains in it the kernel of the doctrine of the Sacraments in the Christian Church."
4. "Some explain their answer as if they understood the Lord to speak of drinking out of the royal cup and washing in the royal ewer, but the words indicating a difficulty, preclude this."

### John Calvin:
1. "Whoever is not satisfied with the free adoption of God, and desires to raise himself, such a person wanders beyond his limits, and, by unseasonably pressing himself forward beyond what was proper for him to do, is ungrateful to God."
2. "In these words, therefore, those who are desirous to obtain the prize before the proper time are enjoined by Christ to employ themselves in attending to the duties of piety."
3. "The sum of the whole is, that for none but him who has fought lawfully is the crown prepared; and especially, that none will be a partaker of the life and the kingdom of Christ who has not previously shared in his sufferings and death."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Ye know not what ye ask." - Jesus warns James and John that they do not fully understand the implications of their request. This highlights the importance of seeking wisdom and discernment before making requests or decisions.

2. "The request could scarcely have been occasioned by jealousy of Peter." - The commentary dismisses the idea that James and John's request was driven by jealousy towards Peter. This suggests that their motivation may have been different and perhaps more genuine.

3. "To drink the cup? A frequent Scriptural figure for the Providential portion assigned to any one; especially for a suffering lot." - The phrase "to drink the cup" is explained as a metaphor for accepting and enduring the suffering that God has assigned to someone. This sheds light on the depth of the disciples' commitment and willingness to face hardships for their faith.

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Ye know not what ye ask." - This quote highlights the common human tendency to ask for things without fully understanding the implications or consequences of our requests.
2. "A selfish request." - This quote emphasizes the self-centered nature of the disciples' request, indicating that they were not considering the bigger picture or the needs of others.
3. "Ambition had blinded their eyes." - This quote suggests that the disciples' desire for power and status had clouded their judgment and prevented them from seeing the true purpose and meaning of their request.

### John Gill:
1. "They were ignorant of the nature of Christ's kingdom, which is spiritual, and not of this world."
2. "It would have been much more proper and seasonable if they had put such a question to themselves."
3. "Christ suggests to these disciples that they would do well to consider what a bitter cup he had to drink of, and what a sea of sorrows and sufferings he was about to be plunged into."

Note: The commentary provided is quite long, so I had to condense it into three quotes that capture the essence of the message.

### John Wesley:
1. "All who share in my kingdom must first share in my sufferings."
2. "The cup, the baptism, are to be understood of his sufferings and death."
3. "The like expressions are common among the Jews."
