# Matthew 20:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the Bible verse being described, one of the Apostles was the first to experience suffering and martyrdom, while the other faced a lifelong journey of trials and persecution. Despite their misled desires for earthly glory, Jesus redirects their focus to the eternal kingdom and heavenly rewards that await those who remain steadfast in faith. These rewards are not handed out indiscriminately, but are given by the sovereign will of God to those who endure in their devotion and love for Him.
