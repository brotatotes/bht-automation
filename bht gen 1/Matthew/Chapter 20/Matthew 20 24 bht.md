# Matthew 20:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, we see a situation where ambition and selfishness are at play, as two brothers seek a higher position without considering the feelings of others. The commentators point out the disapproval and displeasure expressed towards these brothers, highlighting their lack of humility and truthfulness. However, it is also noted that their actions were swiftly discouraged and prevented from escalating into a quarrel through the intervention of Christ. There is a lesson here about the consequences of prioritizing personal gain over the well-being and harmony of the community.
