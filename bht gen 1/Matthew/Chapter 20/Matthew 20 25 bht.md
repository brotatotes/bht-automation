# Matthew 20:25 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, Jesus addresses his disciples' desire for positions of power and authority in his kingdom. He calls them to him, emphasizing his personal and intentional invitation, wanting a close relationship with them. Jesus challenges their understanding of leadership, contrasting it with the worldly practice of rulers exercising tyrannical power. Instead, Jesus presents a different model of leadership, one that rejects dominance and control, and instead embraces humility, service, and selflessness. His kingdom operates on principles that go against the norms of the Gentile rulers, inviting his disciples to follow a new way of leadership.
