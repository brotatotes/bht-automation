# Matthew 20:25 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, various commentators shed light on the nature of leadership and authority. They emphasize that the Jewish form of government, ordained by God, aimed to prevent tyranny. The disciples' assumption that leadership in Jesus' kingdom would mirror worldly systems is challenged, as Jesus' kingdom operates differently. Rather than exerting lordly power over others, Jesus teaches a different way, one that goes against the oppressive rule of the Gentile rulers.

2. "These claim a superiority over others, and exercise lordly power over them; and they that are their great ones, their lords, and nobles under them; these also assert a preeminence, and exercise authority on those that are below them."
3.
