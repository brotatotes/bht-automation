# Matthew 20:28 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus came into the world not seeking to be served, but to serve and minister to others. His ministry was characterized by selflessness and sacrifice. His death, described as a vicarious act, serves as a ransom to redeem the "many" from the guilt and power of sin. This act of redemption is unique and unparalleled, surpassing any other means of atonement. The depth of Jesus' love is demonstrated through his giving of his own life, an uncommon and priceless sacrifice for the benefit of those whom the Father had given him.

### John Gill:
1. "He came not to be ministered unto by others; to be attended on in pomp and state, to have a numerous retinue about him, waiting upon him, and ministering to him; as is the case of the princes, and great men of the world; though he is Lord of all, and King of kings; but to minister; in the form of a servant unto others."
2. "He came to 'give' his life, which was his own, and than which nothing is more dear and precious: besides, his life was an uncommon one, being not only so useful to men, and entirely free from sin in itself, but was the life of the man Jesus, who is in union with the Son of God."
3. "This he did 'for many'; for as many as were ordained to eternal life; for as many as the Father gave unto him; for many out of every kindred, tongue, and people, and nation; but not for every individual of human nature; for many are not all."
