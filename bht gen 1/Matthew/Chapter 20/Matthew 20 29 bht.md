# Matthew 20:29 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In a bustling city, as Jesus departed and returned, he encountered a multitude. The road to Jerusalem was treacherous, but a blooming oasis of fruitfulness awaited him in Jericho. Despite attempts to silence him, Bartimaeus's desperate cry for mercy resonated with Jesus, who lovingly acknowledged the marginalized, offering hope and restoration to those deemed unworthy by society. This serves as a poignant reminder that true faith begins with humility and a plea for God's grace, recognizing our own need for redemption.
