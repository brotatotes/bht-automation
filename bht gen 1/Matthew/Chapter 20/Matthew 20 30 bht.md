## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### John Calvin:
1. "They confer on Christ no ordinary honor, when they request him to have mercy, and relieve them; for they must have been convinced that he had in his power the assistance or remedy which they needed."
2. "Their faith is still more clearly exhibited by their acknowledgment of him as Messiah, to whom we know that the Jews gave this designation, Son of David."
3. "The cry proved the ardor of the desire; for, though they knew that what they said exposed them to the hatred of many, who were highly displeased with the honor done to Christ, their fear was overcome by the ardor of desire, so that they did not refrain, on this account, from raising their voice aloud."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Two blind men. Mark and Luke mention but one (‘blind Bartimeus, the son of Timeus’), probably a well-known person, and hence especially mentioned." 
2. "Lord, have mercy on us, thou Son of David, the better supported order."
