## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The phrase 'Jesus passed by' signifies the movement and presence of Jesus in the midst of the people. It highlights his accessibility and willingness to engage with those around him." 

2. "The cry of the crowd, 'Jesus is passing!' reflects the recognition and urgency of the people to encounter Jesus. It demonstrates their belief in his power and their desire for his presence in their lives."

### John Calvin:
1. "They confer on Christ no ordinary honor, when they request him to have mercy, and relieve them; for they must have been convinced that he had in his power the assistance or remedy which they needed."
2. "But their faith is still more clearly exhibited by their acknowledgment of him as Messiah, to whom we know that the Jews gave this designation, Son of David."
3. "The cry proved the ardor of the desire; for, though they knew that what they said exposed them to the hatred of many, who were highly displeased with the honor done to Christ, their fear was overcome by the ardor of desire, so that they did not refrain, on this account, from raising their voice aloud."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Mark and Luke mention but one (‘blind Bartimeus, the son of Timeus’), probably a well-known person, and hence especially mentioned." 
2. "Lord, have mercy on us, thou Son of David, the better supported order."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "They heard the crowd yelling that Jesus of Nazareth was passing by... It was their one opportunity, now or never."
2. "They hail him as 'the son of David' (the Messiah)."
3. "It is just one of many such incidents when Jesus stood still and opened their eyes, so many that even the multitude was impatient with the cries of these poor men that their eyes be opened."

### John Gill:
1. "A greater difficulty occurs in Luke's account; for whereas Matthew and Mark both agree, that it was when Jesus came out of Jericho, that this cure was wrought, Luke says it was 'when he came nigh unto it'; which some reconcile by observing, that that phrase may be rendered, 'while he was near Jericho'; and so only signifies his distance from it, and not motion to it."
2. "Origen thinks, he had his name from the Greek word τιμη, which signifies 'honour'; and so טימי, 'Time', with the Jews, is used for honour and profit. This man's father might have been a very honourable and useful man, though the son was fallen into poverty and distress, through blindness; for which reason he may be mentioned, as being a person well known to the Jews."
3. "In which may be observed the titles of honour they give him, which declare their faith in him; calling him Lord, expressing their sense of his deity, dominion, and power; and 'Son of David', thereby owning and professing him to be the Messiah, that being a common name of him, well known among the Jews."

### John Wesley:
1. "Behold two blind men cried out" - This verse highlights the desperation and urgency of the blind men's situation, emphasizing their need for healing and restoration.

2. "He was far the more eminent of the two" - This phrase suggests that Bartimeus stood out among the blind men, perhaps indicating his strong faith or persistence in seeking Jesus' help.

3. "Spoke for both" - This statement implies that Bartimeus not only represented himself but also advocated for his companion, demonstrating his compassion and selflessness in seeking healing for both of them.
