# Matthew 20:31 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this biblical verse, there is a surprising contradiction between the followers of Christ who should be inviting and supporting those in need, but instead, they hinder and delay them. The obstacles thrown by Satan should serve as motivation for us to persevere in prayer and faith, growing bolder and resolute. The persistent cry of those who feel their need of Christ is crucial because it intensifies their faith and desire for his compassion, leading towards a cure.
