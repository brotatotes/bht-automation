2. "The contract with the first was definite; with this one it depended on the judgment of the employer." - This quote highlights the contrast between the first worker, who had a fixed contract, and the later worker, whose payment was based on the employer's judgment.

3. "It depended on the judgment of the employer." - This quote emphasizes the role of the employer's judgment in determining the payment.
