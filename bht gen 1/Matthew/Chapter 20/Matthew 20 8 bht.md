# Matthew 20:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we see a parable involving laborers in a vineyard. The timing of the payment of wages is significant, with the day ending and the twelfth hour approaching. The vineyard represents the church, overseen by Christ as the steward of God's house. The parable emphasizes the just distribution of reward, regardless of the order of hiring. It highlights the final account and the free gift of eternal life through Christ's grace. The evening symbolism underscores the transient nature of life and the need to reflect and seize the opportunities presented to us.
