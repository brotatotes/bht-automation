## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Albert Barnes:
1. "The most of the way was a desert, or filled with caves, and rocks, and woods - a suitable place for robbers." 
2. "The Mount of Olives was so called from its producing in abundance the olive."
3. "The Mount of Olives is about a mile in length and about 700 feet in height, and overlooks Jerusalem, so that from its summit almost every part of the city can be seen."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The name Bethphage, which means 'house of figs,' is significant because figs are often associated with abundance, fertility, and prosperity in the Bible. This suggests that Jesus' entry into Jerusalem is not just a simple journey, but a symbolic act of bringing forth abundance and blessing to the city."

2. "By choosing to ride on a donkey, Jesus fulfills the prophecy of Zechariah 9:9, which speaks of a humble king coming to Jerusalem on a donkey. This signifies Jesus' humility and his mission to bring peace and salvation to the world."

3. "The fact that Jesus sends his disciples to fetch the donkey and its colt shows his authority and sovereignty. It also emphasizes the importance of obedience and submission to Jesus' commands, as the disciples faithfully carry out his instructions."

4. "The people's response to Jesus' entry, laying their cloaks and palm branches on the road, is a sign of honor and recognition of Jesus as the long-awaited Messiah. It reflects their expectation of a political deliverer who would liberate them from Roman oppression, but Jesus' mission goes beyond political liberation to bring spiritual freedom and eternal salvation."

5. "Jesus' entry into Jerusalem is a pivotal moment in his ministry, marking the beginning of the final week leading up to his crucifixion. It is a moment of triumph and anticipation, but also foreshadows the rejection and suffering that Jesus will soon face. It reminds us of the paradoxical nature of Jesus' mission, where victory comes through sacrifice and redemption is achieved through the cross."

### John Calvin:

2. "Various are the derivations and etymologies of this place: some say it signifies 'the house', or 'place of a fountain', from a fountain that was in it; as if it was a compound of 'Beth', an house, and πηγη, 'pege', a fountain."
