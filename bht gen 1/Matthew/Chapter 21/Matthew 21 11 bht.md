# Matthew 21:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the commentators describe a scene where people are questioning the identity of Jesus. The Galileans are hesitant to acknowledge Him as the Messiah, while the common people have a better understanding of who He is. The question of "who is this?" dampens enthusiasm, but those who truly seek the truth are not stumbled by the fact that Jesus is from Nazareth. Upon closer inquiry, they would discover His true origin in Bethlehem.
