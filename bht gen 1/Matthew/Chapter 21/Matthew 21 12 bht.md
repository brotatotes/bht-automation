# Matthew 21:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In a certain location, money-changers sat to exchange foreign coins into the temple currency for pilgrims to pay their annual tribute. Though they facilitated religious obligations, questions arose around the commercialization of the temple and its exploitation. Later, Jesus drove out those who sold and bought, challenging the desecration and asserting authority over the sacred space. This act of cleansing was not the first time, and it aimed to prevent the temple from becoming a marketplace.
