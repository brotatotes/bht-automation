# Matthew 21:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In a powerful act of cleansing, Jesus entered the temple to rebuke the abuses and the commercialization that had infiltrated the sacred space. The money-changers, who exchanged foreign coins for the shekel of the sanctuary, sat in the temple's court of the Gentiles, contributing to the desecration. He cast them out, putting an end to the exploitation and restoring the temple to its intended purpose. With authority and zeal, Jesus condemned this profanation, reminding us of the importance of true worship and the need to confront vices in our own lives and society.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "It is impossible to suppose that St. Matthew and St. John, or any one but moderately acquainted with the events which he undertook to relate, should have made such a gross error in chronology, as must be laid to the charge of one or other of them, if these two occurrences were the same."
2. "Both comings of Jehovah to His temple were partial fulfillments of Malachi 3:1-3, which shall not receive its final accomplishment till His great and decisive visit at the latter day."
3. "We have no traces of this market in the O.T. It appears to have first arisen after the captivity, when many would come from foreign lands to Jerusalem."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The money-changers sat in the temple, in the court of the Gentiles, to change the foreign coins of pilgrims into the shekel of the sanctuary for payment of the annual tribute." 

2. "The term 'money-changers' comes from the Greek word 'kollubov,' which refers to the rate of exchange." 

3. "Their presence in the temple court of the Gentiles highlights the commercialization and exploitation that had infiltrated the sacred space."

### John Calvin:
1. "But though disgraceful and ungodly confusion reigned throughout, and though the temple, with its sacrifices, was devoted to destruction, Christ reckoned it enough to administer twice an open reproof of the profanation of it."
2. "That zeal, indeed, by which Christ was animated to do this, ought to be held in common by all the godly; but lest any one, under the pretense of imitation, should rush forward without authority, we ought to see what our calling demands, and how far we may proceed according to the commandment of God."
3. "But let those who do not possess public authority oppose by their tongue, which they have at liberty, those vices which they cannot remedy with their hands."

### Philip Schaff:

2. "Not the less a desecration because so great a convenience." 
3. "No resistance seems to have been offered. The traffickers were doubtless awed by the superhuman authority and dignity of our Lord."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Cast out (εξεβαλεν). Drove out, assumed authority over 'the temple of God' (probably correct text with του θεου, though only example of the phrase)." 
2. "It is not impossible that he should repeat it at the close after three years with the same abuses in existence again. It is amazing how short a time the work of reformers lasts." 
3. "The traffic went on in the court of the Gentiles and to a certain extent was necessary. Here the tables of the money-changers (των κολλυβιστων, from κολλυβος, a small coin) were overturned. See on Matthew 17:24 for the need of the change for the temple tax. The doves were the poor man's offering."

### John Gill:
1. "Christ went not to the tower of David, the stronghold of Zion, the palace of his father David; for he entered not as a temporal king; but he went to the house of his heavenly Father, as the lord and proprietor of it, to preach in it, and purge it."
2. "Christ cast out all them that sold and bought in the temple, not in the holy of holies, nor in the holy place, nor in the court of the priests, nor in the court of the Israelites, but in the court of the Gentiles, and in the mountain of the house, in which were shops, where various things were sold, relating to sacrifices."

3. "The money changers — The exchangers of foreign money into current coin, which those who came from distant parts might want to offer for the service of the temple."
