# Matthew 21:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the commentator suggests that the temple had deviated from its intended purpose as a house of prayer for all people. Instead, it had become a hub of corruption and exploitation, symbolized by the metaphor of a den of thieves. The dishonest practices of the priests and temple officers had transformed the sacred space into a sanctuary for wicked individuals, who used their religious positions for personal gain. This serves as a warning against the dangers of greed and the importance of upholding the true principles of faith and worship.
