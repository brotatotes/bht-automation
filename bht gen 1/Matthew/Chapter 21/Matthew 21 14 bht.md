# Matthew 21:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In a divine act of compassion, the temple's purpose shifted from one of prayer to one of mercy, symbolizing the compassionate nature of God. The blind and lame were brought to Jesus, demonstrating the specific care he showed to those who couldn't come to him on their own. As Jesus drove out the buyers and sellers in the temple, he replaced them with those in need of healing, restoring sight to the blind and causing the lame to walk, confirming the truth of his teachings.
