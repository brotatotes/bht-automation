# Matthew 21:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
During this week of destiny, Jesus found solace and comfort in the home of Martha, Mary, and Lazarus in Bethany, which served as a stronghold of support. It was a time of crisis for all, as Jesus deliberately fulfilled prophecies and challenged the religious authorities by entering Jerusalem on a donkey, inspecting the temple, and cursing the fig tree as a metaphor for the spiritual condition of the leaders and Israel. With his actions in the temple, Jesus confronted corrupt practices, asserting his authority and calling for a return to true worship and devotion to God.
