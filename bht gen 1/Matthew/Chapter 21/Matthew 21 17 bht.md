# Matthew 21:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
These verses from the Gospel of Mark reveal the intentional actions and symbolic messages conveyed by Jesus during his time in Jerusalem. By entering on a donkey, Jesus fulfills prophecy and establishes his identity as the awaited Messiah and King. The cursing of the fig tree represents judgment on the lack of spiritual fruitfulness, while the cleansing of the temple signifies Jesus' zeal for true worship. These events invite us to reflect on our own lives and consider if we are bearing fruit, worshiping sincerely, and living out our identity as followers of Christ.

### John Wesley:
1. "Jesus' actions of entering Jerusalem on a donkey and then immediately going to the temple are significant. It shows that Jesus is intentionally fulfilling the prophecy of Zechariah 9:9, which speaks of a king coming to Jerusalem on a donkey. This highlights Jesus' identity as the long-awaited Messiah and King of Israel."

2. "The cursing of the fig tree may seem harsh and puzzling at first, but it serves as a powerful metaphor. The fig tree, which should have been bearing fruit, represents the religious leaders and the nation of Israel. By withering the fig tree, Jesus is symbolically pronouncing judgment on the spiritual barrenness and hypocrisy of the religious establishment."

3. "Jesus' actions in the temple, driving out the money changers and overturning tables, reveal his righteous anger and zeal for true worship. The temple, meant to be a house of prayer, had become a den of thieves. Jesus' actions demonstrate his authority and his desire for genuine worship and devotion to God."

4. "These events in Mark 11:11-12 serve as a powerful reminder for us today. They challenge us to examine our own lives and ask ourselves if we are bearing fruit for God, if our worship is genuine and sincere, and if we are truly living out our identity as followers of Christ."
