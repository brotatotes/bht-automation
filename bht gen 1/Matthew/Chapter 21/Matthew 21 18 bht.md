# Matthew 21:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we witness the early morning walks of Jesus from Bethany to Jerusalem, highlighting the physicality of his journey. The hunger that Jesus experienced as he purged the temple symbolizes his longing for greater spiritual fruits from his chosen people. By emphasizing his human need and limitations, the verse signifies that Jesus, although fully divine, also experienced the physical weaknesses of being human. We see Jesus rising and returning early, going to and from Jerusalem day after day, and feeling hungry, reminding us of his commitment and humanity.
