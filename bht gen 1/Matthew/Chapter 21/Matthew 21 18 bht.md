# Matthew 21:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the morning, before the full light of day, Jesus felt a hunger that arose from His physical needs. This hunger symbolized His desire for fruitful results from His chosen people and demonstrated His human nature, experiencing the limitations and desires common to humanity. Rising early, Jesus would often journey between Jerusalem and Bethany, teaching in the temple during the day and finding lodging in the evening. This incident highlights the empty show of the fig tree, serving as both a lesson and a sign of the fate of hypocrites.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### John Calvin:
1. "Certainly it was not the fury of passion that led him to curse the tree, (for that would not only have been an unjust, but even a childish and ridiculous revenge;) but as hunger was troublesome to him according to the feeling of the flesh, he determined to overcome it by an opposite affection; that is, by a desire to promote the glory of the Father."
2. "He intended, however, to present in this tree an outward sign of the end which awaits hypocrites, and at the same time to expose the emptiness and folly of their ostentation."
3. "He finds a repast in another way; that is, by promoting the glory of God."

Note: The commentary is on Matthew 21:18-21, where Jesus curses a fig tree.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "To give point to the incident, Matthew unites the two morning walks from Bethany." 
2. "Human want and Divine power are exhibited simultaneously." 
3. "This hunger may symbolize His longings for some better fruit from His chosen people."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "He hungered (επεινασεν). Ingressive aorist indicative, became hungry, felt hungry (Moffatt)."
2. "Possibly Jesus spent the night out of doors and so had no breakfast."
3. "This simple statement reminds us that Jesus, though fully divine, also experienced human physical needs and limitations."

### John Gill:
1. "In the morning, the first spring of light; so early did Christ rise, and return from Bethany to Jerusalem." 
2. "Thus Christ, day after day, went to and from Jerusalem: in the evening he went to Bethany, or to some part of the Mount of Olives, and there abode all night, and returned in the daytime to Jerusalem, and taught in the temple." 
3. "He hungered, rising so early before his friends were up, he had eaten nothing that morning, and so before he had got far from Bethany, found himself hungry; which proves the truth of his human nature, which was in all respects like to ours, excepting sin."
