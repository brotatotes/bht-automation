## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "A solitary fig-tree." 
2. "The practice to plant fig-trees by the road-side, because it was thought that the dust, by absorbing the exuding sap, was conducive to the production of the fruit."
3. "The tree simply projected over the road, or that it was planted on an elevation by the road-side, or that the road here passed through a ravine."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "A fig-tree, one single fig-tree." - This emphasizes the specificity and uniqueness of the fig-tree mentioned in the verse, highlighting its significance in the context.

2. "Presently, in popular speech, has acquired something of a future force." - This comment explains how the word "presently" can be understood as meaning not immediately, but soon, adding depth to the understanding of the verse.

3. "The rendering here was correct in the older English sense of instantly." - This clarifies that the older English usage of "presently" meant instantly, providing historical context for interpreting the verse.

### John Calvin:
1. "Let us learn from this what is the meaning of the word curse, namely, that the tree should be condemned to barrenness; as, on the other hand, God blesses, when by his voice he bestows fertility."
2. "It appears more clearly from Mark, that the fig-tree did not instantly wither, or, at least, that it was not observed by his disciples, until they saw it next day stripped of leaves."
3. "Mark attributes to Peter what Matthew attributes equally to all the disciples; but as Christ replies in the plural number, it may naturally be inferred that one put the question in the name of all."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The leaves represented the hypocritical pretensions to sanctity, the barrenness the lack of real holiness. Applicable to false professors in every age."
2. "A miracle of punishment, both a parable and prophecy in action: a 'parable,' teaching that false professors will be judged; a 'prophecy' in its particular application to the Jews."
3. "The application to the Jewish people is unmistakable. Both the actual desolation of the land and the judgment on the people are prefigured."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "The double negative ου μη with the aorist subjunctive (or future indicative) is the strongest kind of negative prediction." 
2. "The early figs start in spring before the leaves and develop after the leaves. The main fig crop was early autumn." 
3. "It was a vivid object lesson."

### John Gill:
1. "He came to it, and found nothing thereon but leaves only." This highlights the disappointment of Jesus, who expected to find fruit on the fig tree based on its promising appearance. It serves as a metaphor for the empty profession of religion and lack of true righteousness among the Jews.

2. "The time of figs was not yet." This phrase, though not present in the original text, provides a reason for the absence of fruit on the fig tree. It also suggests that Jesus was aware of the typical fig season and expected to find figs on this tree, which appeared to be of a different kind.

3. "This tree was an emblem of the Jews." The withering of the fig tree symbolizes the rejection of the Jews by Christ. Despite their outward show of religion, they lacked true faith and righteousness. This event foreshadows the eventual destruction of the Jewish temple, city, and nation.
