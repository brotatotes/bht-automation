# Matthew 21:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, a tree is cursed with barrenness, condemned to represent false professors lacking real holiness. This serves as a parable and prophecy, specifically directed towards the Jewish people, prefiguring the desolation of the land and judgment. As Jesus walked along the road, he noticed a fig tree with large and spreading leaves, being the only one at that stage of budding. This tree, emblematic of the Jews, disappointingly exhibited mere words, empty boasts, and a superficial religiosity, leading Christ to reject them.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### John Calvin:
1. "Let us learn from this what is the meaning of the word curse, namely, that the tree should be condemned to barrenness."
2. "God blesses, when by his voice he bestows fertility."
3. "It appears more clearly from Mark, that the fig-tree did not instantly wither, or, at least, that it was not observed by his disciples, until they saw it next day stripped of leaves."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The leaves represented the hypocritical pretensions to sanctity, the barrenness the lack of real holiness. Applicable to false professors in every age."
2. "A miracle of punishment, both a parable and prophecy in action: a 'parable,' teaching that false professors will be judged; a 'prophecy' in its particular application to the Jews."
3. "The application to the Jewish people is unmistakable. Both the actual desolation of the land and the judgment on the people are prefigured."

### John Gill:
1. "He must see a great many, as he went along; for a large tract of the Mount Of Olives was full of fig trees, and therefore called 'Bethphage': and notice has been taken already of the figs of Bethany: but he saw none that had such large and spreading leaves as this; for it was the time when the fig tree was just budding, and putting forth its leaves: wherefore he took notice of it." 
2. "This fig tree was 'in the way'; by the road side, and probably had no owner; was common to anybody, and so no injury was done to any person by losing it."
3. "This tree was an emblem of the Jews: Christ being hungry, and very desirous of the salvation of men, came first to them, from whom, on account of their large profession of religion, and great pretensions to holiness, and the many advantages they enjoyed, humanly speaking, much fruit of righteousness might have been expected; but, alas! he found nothing but mere words, empty boasts, an outward show of religion, an external profession, and a bare performance of trifling ceremonies, and oral traditions; wherefore Christ rejected them."
