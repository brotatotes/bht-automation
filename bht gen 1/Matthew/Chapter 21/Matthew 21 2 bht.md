# Matthew 21:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, a king-like figure spruces up an act that was usually seen in times of war or peace: riding on a horse, mule, or ass. However, this particular king chooses to ride on a young colt, signifying compassion for the mother-child bond and a desire to honor the natural order of creation. By doing so, he captures the attention of the people and subtly showcases his divine knowledge and authority. This act of surrendering to the Lord's will serves as a beautiful symbolism of obedience.
