# Matthew 21:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This verse teaches us that having unwavering faith in God is essential for receiving His blessings and performing miracles. The disciples are urged to have complete trust in God's power and promises, relying on His goodness. Jesus assures them that with this firm and undoubting confidence, they will be able to accomplish even greater things for God's glory and the benefit of humanity. This call to faith is also a reminder to believers to cultivate a fruitful and productive life, avoiding doubt and unfruitfulness in their spiritual journey.
