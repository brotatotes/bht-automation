# Matthew 21:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this passage, religious leaders are challenging Jesus' authority and the legitimacy of his actions. They question where his authority comes from and whether his actions align with divine will. The leaders are not debating the truth of Jesus' teachings or the authenticity of his miracles, but instead raising doubts about his calling and commission. Their objections stem from their own desire to hold onto power and control the narrative. Despite their questioning, Jesus continues to teach the people and exercise his authority in accordance with God's purposes.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "The question of authority is a recurring theme in the Bible, and here the religious leaders are challenging Jesus' right to act as he did. It raises the important question of where our authority comes from in life and how we exercise it." 

2. "Jesus' authority came from God, and his actions were in line with God's will. This challenges us to consider the source of our own authority and whether our actions align with God's purposes."

3. "The religious leaders were not just questioning Jesus' authority, but also the legitimacy of his actions. This reminds us that our actions should always be grounded in a solid foundation of authority, whether it be divine, moral, or legal."

### John Calvin:
1. "They do not debate with him as to the doctrine itself, whether it was true or not... but they raise a dispute as to his calling and commission." 
2. "For what could be more unreasonable than that, after seeing the hand of God openly displayed in curing the lame and blind, they should doubt if he were a private individual who had rashly assumed this authority?" 
3. "They therefore insist on this, that he is not a lawful minister of God, because he had not been chosen by their votes, as if the power had dwelt solely with them."

### John Gill:
1. "He was instructing them in the things relating to himself, and his kingdom, dispensing the mysteries of his grace, the doctrines of regeneration, justification, and salvation."
2. "They do not object to his doctrines, or dispute whether they were true or false; nor examine his miracles, whether they were of God, or of the devil: in these points they might fear he would be able to put them to silence and confusion."
3. "Should he say that God gave him the authority to do these things, they would charge him with enthusiasm and blasphemy, urging, that it was wickedness and presumption for any man to pretend to be sent immediately from God."
