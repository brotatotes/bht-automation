# Matthew 21:26 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we see individuals who are motivated by fear and the influence of the crowd. They are afraid of the people's reaction and potential violence if they speak against the popular belief that John the Baptist was a prophet sent from God. These individuals prioritize the opinions and reactions of the crowd over speaking the truth, reflecting a lack of courage and integrity. The religious leaders, in particular, were afraid of losing their control over the masses, as they feared affirming that John's authority was merely human would lead to a violent uprising against them.
