# Matthew 21:26 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The religious leaders found themselves in a predicament. On one hand, they acknowledged that John the Baptist was seen as a prophet by the people and feared the consequences of denying his authority. On the other hand, they were wary of acknowledging it themselves, as it would expose their hypocrisy and invite further reproof. Their fear of the multitude led them to engage in deceptive reasoning, unsure of how to navigate the delicate balance between maintaining their own popularity and perceived authority.
