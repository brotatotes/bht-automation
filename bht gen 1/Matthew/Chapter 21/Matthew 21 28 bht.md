The verse highlights the importance of daily laboring in the work appointed by God and emphasizes the significance of belief in Him as the foundation of one's faith. Additionally, it exposes the hypocrisy and deceit of those who prioritize outward shows of righteousness over genuine acts of faith and obedience.
