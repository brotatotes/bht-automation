# Matthew 21:29 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we witness the unapologetic defiance of sinners, as they respond disrespectfully and refuse to obey. The commentaries emphasize the deliberate rebellion and audacity of those who openly resist God, without remorse for their disobedience. However, true repentance requires a genuine change of heart and complete transformation, not just mere sorrow or regret. It is through the grace of God, and a deep spiritual understanding of the nature of sin, that one can experience true repentance.
