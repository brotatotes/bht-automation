# Matthew 21:29 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we are confronted with the audacity and lack of remorse displayed by those who resist God's commands. The disobedience is not just a careless act, but a deliberate and defiant confrontation against God himself. Genuine repentance is highlighted, calling for a complete change of heart and a sincere commitment to turn away from sin. This requires humility and a recognition of our faults, seeking forgiveness from God and others. True repentance is not merely feeling sorry, but a transformative process empowered by the grace of God.

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The New Testament writers evidently recognize a distinction [between metanoeite and metamelomai], since the noun which corresponds to the verb in this passage [metameleia] is not used at all in the New Testament, and the verb itself only five times; and, in every case except the two in this passage (see ver. 32), with a meaning quite foreign to repentance in the ordinary gospel sense."
2. "Metamelomai... implies an after-care, as contrasted with the change of mind denoted by metanoia. Not sorrow for moral obliquity and sin against God, but annoyance at the consequences of an act or course of acts, and chagrin at not having known better."
3. "Metanoia denotes the repentance which affects the whole life. Hence the latter is often found in the imperative: Repent ye (Matthew 3:2; iv.; 17; Acts 2:38; Acts 3:19); the former never."
