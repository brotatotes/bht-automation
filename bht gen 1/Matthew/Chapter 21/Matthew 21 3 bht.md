# Matthew 21:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse being described speaks of the Lord's need for animals, whether for religious purposes or the prophet's use. The commentators emphasize that "Lord" can mean "master" or "ruler," and is a name for God and Christ denoting authority and rulership. The phrase "The Lord hath need of them" shows the divine authority behind the request, implying that the animals are wanted for the Lord's present service, and will be returned after use. This highlights Christ's omniscience, as He knew the specific details regarding the ass and colt.
