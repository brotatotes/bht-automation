# Matthew 21:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This verse reveals the divine authority and knowledge of the Lord, whether understood as Jehovah or the Master. He claims the animals for both religious and prophetic purposes, demonstrating his omniscience. It is a remarkable display of Christ's lordship, as the owner's understanding aligns with the double meaning of the request. Furthermore, it illustrates how the Lord, who needs the animals for his present service, will faithfully return them afterwards.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The Lord hath need of them. The tone is still royal, whether 'the Lord' here means 'Jehovah,' or simply 'the Master.'"
2. "In the former case the animals would be claimed for religious purposes, by Divine authority; in the latter for the well-known prophet."
3. "The two meanings coincided in our Lord's intention, whatever the owner would understand."

### John Gill:
1. "The Lord hath need of them: he that is our Lord, and your Lord, and the Lord of these creatures, and of all things else, wants them for his present service." 

2. "That the Lord who had need of them, as soon as he had done with them, would send them back to their proper owners, safe and well."

3. "A very clear proof is this of the omniscience of Christ. He knew, that there were an ass, and a colt, in such a village, fastened to such a door, just at the entrance into the town."
