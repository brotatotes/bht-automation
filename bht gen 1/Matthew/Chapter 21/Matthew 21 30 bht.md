# Matthew 21:30 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, a person initially responds with zeal and willingness to obey, seemingly obedient on the surface. However, commentators point out that the response may be fueled by pride and hypocrisy. The person's words are contradicted by their lack of action, highlighting the insincerity of their heart. This serves as a reminder that true obedience to God requires not just outward profession, but a genuine commitment to follow through with actions.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "The emphatic 'I,' here, denotes the self-righteous complacency which says, 'God, I thank thee that I am not as other men'." 
2. "He did not 'afterward repent' and refuse to go; for there was here no intention to go." 
3. "It is the class that 'say and do not' - a falseness more abominable to God."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "I will go, sir." - This response reflects the initial willingness of the person to obey, but it may also indicate a sense of pride or self-assurance.

2. "An expression of pride." - The commentary suggests that the person's response carries an element of pride, possibly indicating a lack of genuine humility or submission.

### John Gill:
1. "Calling them into the Gospel dispensation, to hear the word, embrace truth, attend on ordinances, and labour in promoting the kingdom, and interest of the Messiah, whilst they had the light of the Gospel with them."
2. "So, the Scribes and Pharisees seemed pleased with the ministry of John for a while, and at first were forward to submit to his baptism, and were very inquisitive about the Messiah: yet, when he was declared in John's ministry, and by his own doctrine, and miracles, they refused to give in to the belief of him."
3. "They, were like some other persons, who promise fair, and talk much of doing good works, but do none; teach the people to do them, but do not perform them themselves, though they would seem to do them; make great pretensions to them, boast of them, and trust in them; and therefore, of all men, ought to be careful to maintain them, and yet do the least."

### John Wesley:
1. "Just so did the scribes and Pharisees: they professed the greatest readiness and zeal in the service of God: but it was bare profession, contradicted by all their actions."
2. "The response 'I go, sir' may seem obedient on the surface, but the lack of action reveals the insincerity of the heart."
3. "This verse serves as a reminder that true obedience to God requires not just words, but a genuine commitment to follow through with actions."
