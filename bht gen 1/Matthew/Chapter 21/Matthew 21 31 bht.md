# Matthew 21:31 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse describes how the publicans and the harlots were entering the kingdom of God before the ecclesiastics and Jewish theological leaders. These individuals, who had once overlooked their spiritual obligations, were now repentant and willing to follow Christ. The verse serves as a reminder that the door of mercy remained open for those who chose to change their ways and show the way to others through their example. It exposes the complacency of the Jewish leaders and emphasizes the transformative power of God's grace.
