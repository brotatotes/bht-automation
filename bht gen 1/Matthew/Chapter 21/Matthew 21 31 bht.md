# Matthew 21:31 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
"Some of those who were seen as the worst sinners and rebels are now humbly entering the path of righteousness, responding to the call of repentance and embracing the message of Christ. These individuals, once known for their disobedience, have been transformed by the grace of God to become willing workers in the Lord's vineyard. It is a testimony to the power of God's love and forgiveness that even those who were most resistant can find redemption and ultimately find glory in His kingdom."
