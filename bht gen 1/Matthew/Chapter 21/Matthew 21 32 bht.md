# Matthew 21:32 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
John the Baptist, in his ministry, called people to repentance and the way of righteousness. He preached a message that was not only about words but also reflected in his conduct. He attracted the outcasts and sinners, who believed in his message, repented, and were baptized. Despite witnessing the transformation in these individuals, the religious leaders did not follow suit and missed the opportunity to believe and repent.
