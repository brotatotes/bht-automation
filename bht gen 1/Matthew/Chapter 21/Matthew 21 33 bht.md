# Matthew 21:33 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, commentators highlight the connection to Isaiah's parable as the basis for understanding its application. The verse describes a vineyard, symbolizing the Jewish nation, with various elements such as a hedge or fence for protection, a winepress for crushing grapes, and a tower for vinedressers and watchmen. It emphasizes the privileges and unfruitfulness of the Jewish people, their mistreatment of God's messengers and Son, and the ingenuity of the spiritual guides responsible for cultivating righteousness. The verse also signifies the role of God's law and protection around His chosen people.

### John Calvin:
1. "The substance of this parable is, that it is no new thing, if the priests and the other rulers of the Church wickedly endeavor to defraud God of his right; for long ago they practiced the same kind of robbery towards the prophets, and now they are ready to slay his Son; but they will not go unpunished, for God will arise to defend his right."
2. "Christ says that the vineyard was well furnished, and in excellent condition, when the husbandmen received it from the hands of the proprietor. By this statement he presents no slight aggravation of their crime; for the more generously he had acted toward them, the more detestable was their ingratitude."
3. "And what else was this than to demand the revenue which was due to God from his vineyard? All this Christ applies justly and truly to his purpose; for the regular and permanent government of his Church was not in the hands of the prophets, but was always held by the priests; just as if lazy husbandman, while he neglected cultivation, claimed the place to which he had been once appointed, under the plea of possession."

1. "The design of it is, to set forth the many favours and privileges bestowed on the Jewish nation; their unfruitfulness, and the ingratitude of the principal men among them; and their barbarous usage of the servants of the Lord, and particularly of the Son of God himself."
2. "By this vineyard is meant, the house of Israel and the men of Judah, the nation of the Jews, as in Isaiah 5:7 from whence our Lord seems to have taken many of the ideas expressed in this parable."
3. "By this 'hedge' is designed, either the law, not the oral law, or the traditions of the elders, which the Jews call 'an hedge for the law', which was none of God's setting, but their own; but either the ceremonial law, which distinguished them from other people, was a middle wall of partition between them, and the nations of the world, and kept them from coming among them, and joining together; or the moral law, which taught them their duty to God and man, and was the means of keeping them within due bounds; or else the protection of them by the power of God, which was an hedge about them, is here intended."
