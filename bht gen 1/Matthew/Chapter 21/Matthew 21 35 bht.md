1. "And the husbandmen took his servants, and beat one." This action of the husbandmen reflects the rejection and mistreatment of the prophets throughout history, as seen in Jeremiah 37:15 and Jeremiah 38:6. It highlights the resistance to God's messengers and the unwillingness to heed their warnings.

2. "And killed another." This echoes the fate of the prophet Urijah in Jeremiah 26:20-23. It emphasizes the severity of the rejection, as the husbandmen not only beat but also killed one of the servants. It demonstrates the extreme measures taken to silence the voice of truth.

3. "And stoned another." This act of stoning is reminiscent of the killing of Zechariah in 2 Chronicles 24:21. It underscores the pattern of violence and hostility towards God's messengers, showing the repeated disregard for their message and the ultimate rejection of God's authority.

These quotes shed light on the historical context and significance of the actions described in the verse, revealing the ongoing pattern of rejection and mistreatment of God's messengers throughout the Bible.
