# Matthew 21:36 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, we see the master's patience and persistence, as he sends a second group of servants to the people, giving them another chance to respond despite the rejection of the first group. The historical context is important, as it highlights the pattern of Israel's rebellion and rejection of God's messengers throughout their history. The increasing hostility towards these messengers is evident, with references to beatings, killings, and stonings. Ultimately, this verse reminds us of God's long-suffering nature and the consequences of persistently rejecting His word.
