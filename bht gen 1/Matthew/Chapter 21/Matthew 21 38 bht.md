# Matthew 21:38 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we see the expression of the deep aim of a depraved heart, as commentators note. The verse speaks of an heir, destined to come into possession of God's inheritance. This heir, being the Son of God in human nature, is the one whom others foolishly sought to kill and seize his inheritance. It is an attempt to defy God and maintain their own authority, not realizing that he is the heir of all things for the use and benefit of his people.

1. "This is the heir—Sublime expression this of the great truth, that God's inheritance was destined for, and in due time is to come into the possession of, His own Son in our nature."
2. "Come, let us kill him, and let us seize on his inheritance—that so, from mere servants, we may become lords."
3. "This is the deep aim of the depraved heart; this is emphatically 'the root of all evil'."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "‘Heir’ in virtue of His human nature, Hebrews 1:1-2."
2. "An expression of folly (in addition to the wicked resolve), as though the death of the heir would permit them to hold the possession, while the householder lived."
3. "In the attempt to maintain their own authority, which He had challenged, by putting Him to death, they foolishly defied God."

### John Gill:
1. "They said among themselves; privately, not openly to the people, this is the heir; as indeed he is of all things, as the Son of God, and as the mediator of the new covenant."
2. "He is heir of all that his Father has, as he is his natural, essential, and only begotten Son; and as mediator, he is heir of all things, natural, spiritual, and eternal, for the use and benefit of his church and people."
3. "Here it seems to denote his being heir to the throne of Israel, the government of the Jewish nation, as he was the son of David; and the Jews confess that because it was said that Jesus of Nazareth was 'near to the kingdom', therefore they put him to death."
