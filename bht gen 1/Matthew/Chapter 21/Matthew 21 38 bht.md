# Matthew 21:38 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we see the Jewish rulers' rejection of Jesus, the Messiah, despite their deep consciousness of his true identity. They foolishly plotted to kill him and seize his inheritance, denying him his rightful place as the Son and rightful heir. Their actions were rooted in a desire to maintain their own authority and prevent any disruption to their position, failing to recognize the divine consequences of their misguided scheme.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The latent consciousness that Jesus was the Messiah, expressed in the prophecy of Caiaphas, added no doubt to the guilt of the Jewish rulers in rejecting and crucifying Him." 
2. "This the Son is in virtue of His human nature." 
3. "The very words of the LXX, ref. Gen., where Joseph’s brethren express a similar resolution: and no doubt used by the Lord in reference to that history, so deeply typical of His rejection and exaltation."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "This is the heir—Sublime expression this of the great truth, that God's inheritance was destined for, and in due time is to come into the possession of, His own Son in our nature."
2. "come, let us kill him, and let us seize on his inheritance—that so, from mere servants, we may become lords."
3. "This is the deep aim of the depraved heart; this is emphatically 'the root of all evil'."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "‘Heir’ in virtue of His human nature, Hebrews 1:1-2."
2. "An expression of folly (in addition to the wicked resolve), as though the death of the heir would permit them to hold the possession, while the householder lived."
3. "In the attempt to maintain their own authority, which He had challenged, by putting Him to death, they foolishly defied God."

### John Gill:
1. "They expected the Messiah about this time; they knew, by prophecy, it could not be long ere he appeared: when they saw Jesus of Nazareth, they knew by various circumstances, by all the characters of the Messiah meeting in him, and by his miracles, that he must be the same."
2. "He is heir of all that his Father has, as he is his natural, essential, and only begotten Son; and as mediator, he is heir of all things, natural, spiritual, and eternal, for the use and benefit of his church and people, who are also his portion and inheritance."
3. "Concluding, that could they be rid of him, their nation would be in peace, their temple would stand, and temple worship and service continue, and they remain in their office and authority undisturbed; the contrary of which they feared, should he be suffered to live."
