# Matthew 21:39 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, Jesus is symbolically cast out and rejected from the religious establishment, echoing the fate of the Old Testament prophets. He is not only excommunicated but also crucified outside the city walls, reflecting the rejection and hostility that God's messengers face. The rulers' purpose to kill Jesus is recognized, and his arrest is described as a violent and forceful act initiated by the Jewish rulers. Despite these actions, there is still an underlying message of love and warning.
