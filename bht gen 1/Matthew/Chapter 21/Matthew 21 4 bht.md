# Matthew 21:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This verse is a fulfillment of divine purpose and prophecy. The disciples were initially unaware of the significance, but later recognized that Jesus rode on a donkey to fulfill Scripture. Jesus intentionally chose this humble method of transportation to fulfill the prophecy, demonstrating that he is the awaited Messiah who brings salvation and establishes his kingdom. The fact that Jesus did not directly quote the passage himself indicates his actions were not merely coincidental, but purposeful in fulfilling the prophecy.
