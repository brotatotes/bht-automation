# Matthew 21:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this passage, the divine counsels are revealed as the disciples realize the fulfillment of prophecy after Jesus is glorified. The historical occasions are orchestrated by the Spirit of God, aligning with the prophetical word. Jesus' choice to ride on a donkey's colt during the procession is not due to fatigue or distance, but rather to fulfill the prophecy spoken by Isaiah and Zechariah. This citation of Scripture combines different parts from different writers, a common practice among the Jews. The history becomes all the more symbolic as the dignity of the procession requires the donkey's colt.
