### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

### John Calvin:
1. "The amount of it therefore is, that the kingdom of God will be founded on a stone, which the builders themselves will reject as unsuitable and useless; and the meaning is, that the Messiah, who is the foundation of the safety of the Church, will not be chosen by the ordinary suffrages of men, but that, when God shall miraculously raise him up by a secret and unknown power, the rulers, to whom has been committed the care of the building, will oppose and persecute him."

2. "It appears to be monstrous that the Author of salvation should be rejected, not by strangers, but by those who belonged to his own household, — not by the ignorant multitude, but by the rulers themselves, who hold the government of the Church. Against such strange madness of men our faith ought to be fortified, that it may not give way through the novelty of the occurrence."

3. "In short, the authority of God will prevail, that he may be the elect and precious stone, which supports the Church of God, his kingdom and temple."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The builders rejected. The rulers of the Jews (‘the husbandmen’), whose duty it was to build up the spiritual temple, now addressed in rebuke and warning."
2. "The most important foundation stone, joining two walls. A reference to the union of Jews and Gentiles in Christ (as in Ephesians 2:19-22) may be included, but the main thought is, that the Messiah, even if rejected by the ‘builders,’ should become the corner-stone of the real temple of God."
3. "This involves the important idea, that the ‘builders’ would be themselves rejected: the parable left the Son dead outside of the vineyard, this citation, representing Him as victor and avenger (Matthew 21:44), points to the resurrection."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The builders rejected... A most telling quotation." 
2. "These experts in building God's temple had rejected the corner-stone chosen by God for his own house." 
3. "But God has the last word and sets aside the building experts and puts his Son as the Head of the corner."

### John Gill:
1. "Christ is often in Scripture compared to a stone, and is called the stone of Israel...and for his strength and duration." 
2. "Christ is the sure, firm, and everlasting foundation, which God has laid in Zion, and the only one of any avail; nor can any other be laid to any purpose."
3. "Whoever build on him are safe, and on nothing else: Christ is the foundation, on which the church, and every believer, are built, and therefore will abide."

### John Wesley:
1. "The builders...Is become the head of the corner." - The scribes and priests, who were supposed to build up the Church, failed to recognize Jesus as the cornerstone. He has become the foundation of the Church, uniting both Jews and Gentiles together.

2. "He is become the foundation of the Church." - Jesus is not just a cornerstone, but the very foundation upon which the Church stands. Without Him, the Church would crumble and fall.

3. "The chief corner stone...supports and links its two sides together." - Jesus, as the chief cornerstone, not only supports the Church but also brings unity. He is the vital link that connects believers from different backgrounds and unites them in their faith.
