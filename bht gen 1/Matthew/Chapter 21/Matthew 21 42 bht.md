### Philip Schaff:
1. "The builders rejected. The rulers of the Jews (‘the husbandmen’), whose duty it was to build up the spiritual temple, now addressed in rebuke and warning."
2. "The head of the corner. The most important foundation stone, joining two walls. A reference to the union of Jews and Gentiles in Christ (as in Ephesians 2:19-22) may be included, but the main thought is, that the Messiah, even if rejected by the ‘builders,’ should become the corner-stone of the real temple of God."
3. "This head of the comer was from the Lord, etc. ‘This’ must grammatically refer either to ‘head’ or ‘comer.’ Others understand it as ‘this thing,’ this exaltation of the despised one."

1. "The builders rejected... A most telling quotation." 
2. "These experts in building God's temple had rejected the corner-stone chosen by God for his own house."

3. "And is the principal corner stone, for uniting the Gentiles to it, as the chief corner stone of a house supports and links its two sides together."
