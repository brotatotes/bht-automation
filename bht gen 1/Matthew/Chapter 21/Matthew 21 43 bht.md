# Matthew 21:43 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse described speaks of the kingdom of God, which is God's visible Kingdom or Church on earth, consisting of both Jews and Gentiles, and not limited to a specific nation. It conveys the idea that the kingdom of God is not bound to any particular group but is rooted in true godliness. The rejection of the cornerstone by the people symbolizes the refusal to accept the transformative power of the Gospel, leading to the removal of the kingdom from those who abuse their privilege.
