# Matthew 21:43 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This verse, spoken by Jesus, marks a significant shift in the narrative. The privileges and power once held by the Jewish nation are symbolically taken away, signifying the loss and removal of their political and religious dominance. The Gospel, with its message of the kingdom of God, is now given to a new community, including Gentiles, emphasizing the inclusive and expansive nature of God's kingdom. The rejection of the cornerstone, Jesus himself, ultimately leads to the transfer of God's kingdom to a broader, faithful nation.

### John Gill:
1. "The kingdom of God shall be taken from you: by which is meant, not their political estate, their civil government, which was of God, and in a short time was to depart from them, according to ancient prophecy, and which is come to pass, as the event shows; nor their legal national church state and ordinances only, or the priesthood, and the appendages of it; all which, in a little while, were shaken and removed; but the Gospel, which had been preached among them by John the Baptist, Christ, and his apostles; so called because it treats of the kingdom of God, and things pertaining to it, and shows men both their right and meetness for it."
2. "Moreover, the Gospel church state, which was set up in Judea, may be here meant; which, though it continued and flourished a while, in process of time was to be removed: and which may be done elsewhere, as it has been in Judea, by God's suffering persecution to arise, as he did against the church of Jerusalem, whereby the ministers of the Gospel are driven into corners, or scattered abroad; or by ordering his ministers to preach no more unto such a people, as the apostles were ordered to turn from the Jews to the Gentiles; or by taking away ministers and members of churches by death, and not raising up others in their room; or by withholding a blessing from the word; or by permitting the growth of errors and heresies, which, in course of time, must issue in the dissolution of the church state in such a place, and which necessarily follows upon the removing of the Gospel."
3. "Though God may take away the Gospel from a people, as he did from the Jews; yet he does not, nor will he, as yet, take it out of the world: he gives it to another 'nation'; to the Gentiles, to all the nations of the world, whither he sent his apostles to preach and where it must be preached before the end of the world comes, in order to gather his elect out of them."

### John Wesley:
1. "Because ye reject this corner stone."
2. "The kingdom of God."
3. "That is, the Gospel."
