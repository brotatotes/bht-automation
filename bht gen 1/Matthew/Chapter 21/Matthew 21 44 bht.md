# Matthew 21:44 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse being described speaks of a stone, representing the kingdom and power of the Messiah, that will either be a stumbling block for those who reject it or a foundation for those who embrace it. Commentators emphasize that rejecting Christ leads to brokenness, destruction, and severe consequences. The stone's power is compared to that of a winnowing-fan that separates the wheat from the chaff. However, there is still hope for repentance and salvation before the final judgment. Ultimately, unbelievers who fall on the rejected stone will face a dreadful end and be utterly destroyed when Christ comes in judgment.
