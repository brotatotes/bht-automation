# Matthew 21:44 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, rejected by the builders, is the keystone of the Kingdom of God, which serves as a Temple. Those who stumble upon this stone experience spiritual hurt, while those on whom it falls will face a severe punishment. The stone symbolizes Christ, who, through his rejection and subsequent destruction of Jerusalem, magnifies his own glory and stands as the Judge that brings both punishment and salvation. The verse warns unbelievers of the consequences that await them, and it encourages believers to submit wholeheartedly to the dominion of Christ.

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "The Kingdom of God is here a Temple, in the erection of which a certain stone, rejected as unsuitable by the spiritual builders, is, by the great Lord of the House, made the keystone of the whole."
2. "On that Stone the builders were now 'falling' and being 'broken'. They were sustaining great spiritual hurt."
3. "Soon that Stone should 'fall upon them' and 'grind them to powder' - in their corporate capacity, in the tremendous destruction of Jerusalem, but personally, as unbelievers, in a more awful sense still."

### Marvin Vincent:

### John Calvin:
1. "Christ confirms more fully the former statement, that he suffers no loss or diminution when he is rejected by the wicked, because, though their obstinacy were like a stone or like iron, yet by his own hardness he will break them, and therefore he will be the more highly glorified in their destruction."
2. "He perceived in the Jews an astonishing obstinacy, and therefore it was necessary that this kind of punishment should be described to them in an alarming manner, that they might not flatter themselves, while they thus dashed against him."
3. "This doctrine partly instructs us to give ourselves up gently, with a mild and tractable heart, to the dominion of Christ, and partly fortifies us against the obstinacy and furious attacks of the wicked, for whom there awaits a dreadful end."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "He that falleth on this stone...Christ Himself is the Judge, whose coming will result in a twofold punishment."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "The verb means to shatter. We are familiar with an automobile that dashes against a stone wall, a tree, or a train and the ruin that follows."

3. "This is the fate of him on whom this Rejected Stone falls."

### John Gill:
1. "And such are they who are offended at Christ's state of humiliation on earth; at the manner of his birth, the meanness of his parentage, and education; the despicable figure he made in his person, disciples, and audience; and at his sufferings and death: and these 'shall be broken'." 

2. "Just as if a millstone, or any stone of such like weight and bulk, was to fall upon an earthen vessel; or, as the stone cut out of the mountain without hands, by which the Messiah and his kingdom, are designed, brake in pieces the image in Nebuchadnezzar's dream, so that it became like the chaff of the summer threshing floor."

3. "As the former part of this verse expresses the sin of unbelievers, and the danger they are exposed unto by it, this sets forth their punishment; and has respect both to the vengeance of Christ, on the Jewish nation, at their destruction, which would fall heavy from him in his state of exaltation, for their evil treatment of him in his state of humiliation; and to his severe wrath, which will be executed at the day of judgment on all unbelievers, impenitent Christless sinners, who have both offended him, and been offended at him."

### John Wesley:
1. "Whosoever shall fall on this stone shall be broken" - Stumblers at Christ shall even then receive much hurt. He is said to fall on this stone, who hears the Gospel and does not believe.

2. "But on whomsoever it shall fall" - In vengeance, it will utterly destroy him. It will fall on every unbeliever, when Christ cometh in the clouds of heaven.

3. "He is said to fall on this stone, who hears the Gospel and does not believe" - Stumblers at Christ shall even then receive much hurt.
