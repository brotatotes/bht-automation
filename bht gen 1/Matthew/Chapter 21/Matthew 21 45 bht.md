# Matthew 21:45 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, Jesus speaks in parables that directly confront the religious leaders, exposing their hypocrisy and challenging their authority. These parables are not just moral stories, but powerful tools of rebuke, calling out the leaders for their pride, greed, and lack of genuine faith. Despite the clarity of Jesus' message, the religious leaders perceive their condemnation, realizing that their ungodliness is being exposed and their rage inflamed. The dullest among them can see that these parables are aimed directly at them, hitting their case with unmistakable meaning.
