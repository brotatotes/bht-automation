# Matthew 21:46 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, we see the religious leaders filled with fear towards Jesus and the power of the crowd, preventing them from directly confronting him. They recognized Jesus as a prophet, acknowledging his authority and divine message. Despite their murderous intentions and irritation, they were unable to carry out their plans due to the support and protection Jesus had from the multitude. The people, however, struggled to fully grasp the personal application of Jesus' teachings to their own lives.
