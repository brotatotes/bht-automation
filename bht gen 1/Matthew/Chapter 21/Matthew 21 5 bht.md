# Matthew 21:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we see Jesus entering Jerusalem in a humble manner, riding on the foal of an ass, emphasizing his lowly state. This fulfillment of prophecy demonstrates his meekness and signifies his role as the Messiah. Furthermore, Jesus deliberately chooses to ride this common beast of burden, instead of a majestic horse, symbolizing his rejection of worldly power and his mission as the Prince of Peace. His actions not only fulfill ancient prophecies but also serve as a powerful reminder of the importance of humility and the insignificance of worldly grandeur.

### Marvin Vincent:

2. "But He thus fulfilled a prophetic announcement, in which the Messiah is represented as the king entering Jerusalem, and yet as lowly, the meekness symbolized by His riding upon an ass’s colt."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The daughter of Zion (τη θυγατρ Σιων). Jerusalem as in Isaiah 22:4 (daughter of my people). So Babylon (Isaiah 47:1), daughter of Tyre for Tyre (Psalms 45:12)."

2. "Riding (επιβεβηκως). Perfect active participle of επιβαινω, 'having gone upon.'"
