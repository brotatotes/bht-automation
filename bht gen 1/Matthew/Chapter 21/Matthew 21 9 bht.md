## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Albert Barnes:
1. "The word 'hosanna' means 'save now,' or 'save, I beseech thee.' It is a Syriac word, and was a form of acclamation used among the Jews."
2. "Their use of it on this occasion was a joyful acclamation, and an invocation of a divine blessing by the 'Messiah.'"
3. "To come 'in the name of the Lord' here means to come 'by the authority' of the Lord, or to come 'commissioned' by him to reveal his will."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The word 'Hosanna' is a cry of praise and adoration, but it is also a plea for salvation. It is a recognition of our need for God's saving grace and a declaration of our trust in His power to deliver us from our sins and the challenges we face."

2. "When we cry out 'Hosanna,' we are acknowledging that Jesus is our Savior and King. We are surrendering ourselves to His lordship and seeking His guidance and protection. It is a humble plea for Him to come and rescue us from the darkness and bring us into His light."

3. "In the cry of 'Hosanna,' we find both desperation and hope. It is a cry of desperation because we recognize our own inability to save ourselves. But it is also a cry of hope because we believe in the power of God to save and redeem us. It is a cry that expresses our longing for a Savior and our confidence that He will come to our aid."

### John Calvin:
1. "Matthew relates expressly the Hebrew words, in order to inform us, that these applauses were not rashly bestowed on Christ, and that the disciples did not utter without consideration the prayers which came to their lips, but that they followed with reverence the form of prayer, which the Holy Spirit had prescribed to the whole Church by the mouth of the Prophet."
2. "And the design of Matthew was, as we have just hinted, to quote in Hebrew a well-known psalm, for the purpose of showing that Christ was acknowledged by the multitude as a Redeemer."
3. "He is said to come in the name of God, who not only conducts himself, but receives the kingdom, by the command and appointment of God."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Two vast streams of people met on that day. The one poured out from the city, and, as they came through the gardens whose clusters of palm rose on the southeastern comer of Olivet, they cut down the long branches, as was their wont at the feast of Tabernacles, and moved upward toward Bethany with loud shouts of welcome."
2. "It was at this precise point (may it not have been from the sight thus opening upon them?) that the shout of triumph burst forth from the multitude: 'Hosanna to the Son of David! Blessed is He that cometh in the name of the Lord!'"
3. "Hosanna. The Greek form of a Hebrew word found in Psalms 118:25, meaning: 'Save now,' or 'give thy salvation.' Used as a congratulatory expression, here applied in the highest sense to the Messiah: the Son of David."
