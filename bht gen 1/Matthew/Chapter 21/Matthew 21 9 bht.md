# Matthew 21:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, people cry out "Hosanna," a plea for salvation and a cry of surrender, recognizing both their need for God's saving grace and Jesus as the true savior. These cries express a longing for eternal deliverance and trust in Christ's redemptive work. The multitudes, possibly driven by a Divine impulse, say these words without fully understanding their meaning. Jesus receives this cry of praise and adoration, yet restrains public honor to avoid interference with his preaching.
