# Matthew 22:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this passage, Jesus responds to the Pharisees' anger with another parable. While some commentators believe that the Pharisees left after the previous parable, others suggest they stayed to hear this one. Jesus uses parables to teach and address the audience's thoughts and actions, using earthly examples to convey spiritual truths. The purpose of this parable is to challenge the Pharisees and increase their resentment towards Jesus.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He made a still further statement, to show how the gospel would be received and treated by them."
2. "The real answer here, as is frequently the case in the New Testament, refers to what was passing in the mind, or to the conduct of those who were addressed, not to what they said."
3. "He answered or made reply to the Pharisees, who had been enraged at him for what he had already spoken to them."

These quotes highlight the purpose of Jesus' parables - to reveal the reception and treatment of the gospel by the Pharisees, as well as the emphasis on addressing the thoughts and actions of the listeners rather than their spoken words.

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Matthew's report definitely locates the parable here by παλιν."

### John Gill:

2. "He spake by parables, similitudes, and comparisons, taken from earthly things, and against whom he directed the following one." 

3. "The following parable is spoken with much the same design as the former, and might increase their resentment the more."
