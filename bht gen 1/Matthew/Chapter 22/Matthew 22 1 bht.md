# Matthew 22:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this passage, Jesus responds to the Pharisees once again, conveying a deeper message about how the gospel will be received. He answers their rage and addresses their thoughts and conduct. Through his parabolic discourse, Jesus uses earthly comparisons to convey a powerful message, and he takes the opportunity to share another parable with those who have not yet left him.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Albert Barnes:
1. "He made a still further statement, to show how the gospel would be received and treated by them."
2. "The real answer here, as is frequently the case in the New Testament, refers to what was passing in the mind, or to the conduct of those who were addressed, not to what they said."
3. "He answered or made reply to the Pharisees, who had been enraged at him for what he had already spoken to them."

Note: The commentary is quite short, so I have included all the relevant quotes.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Answered. See above." 
2. "Again in parables; not necessarily, in a number of parables, but in parabolic discourse."

### John Gill:
1. "Jesus answered and spake unto them again... for though Mark seems to intimate, that upon the delivery of the last parable of the vineyard, they left him, and went their way; yet since he does not relate the following parable, they might not leave him until they had heard that." 

2. "Jesus spoke by parables, similitudes, and comparisons, taken from earthly things, and against whom he directed the following one." 

3. "Jesus said, as hereafter related."
