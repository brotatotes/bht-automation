# Matthew 22:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we are presented with the solemn truth that God's omniscient gaze is upon every professed disciple of the Lord Jesus throughout the ages. As commentators explain, it signifies the future judgment of individuals rather than a national judgment. The parable illustrates how individuals are called to accept the invitation of being in a relationship with God, symbolized by putting on the Lord Jesus. It cautions against being mere bystanders in the Church, emphasizing the importance of genuine faith and a transformed life, as God examines our hearts to ensure our true acceptance of His invitation.
