# Matthew 22:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The parable describes the necessity of being clothed in the righteousness of Christ in order to enter the kingdom of heaven. It emphasizes that mere outward appearances or empty professions of faith are not enough. This story serves as a cautionary tale, warning against self-righteousness and urging believers to be prepared spiritually at all times, as we never know when the call to enter God's kingdom may come. It also highlights the silence and guilt of those who do not possess the wedding garment, symbolizing their rejection of the righteousness freely offered by Christ.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "The wedding garment represents the righteousness that is required to enter into the kingdom of heaven. Without this garment, one cannot partake in the joyous celebration of the wedding feast." 

2. "The man's silence in response to the question reveals his guilt and lack of excuse. He is unable to defend himself because he knows that he has willfully neglected to put on the wedding garment, symbolizing his refusal to accept the righteousness offered to him."

3. "This parable serves as a warning to all who profess to follow Christ but do not bear the fruit of righteousness. It reminds us that mere outward appearances or empty professions of faith are not enough to gain entrance into the kingdom of heaven."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Not having [μη εχων] . It is hardly possible to convey the subtle sense of the negative particle [μη] to the English reader."
2. "The man had not [ουκ] a wedding garment. When the king addresses the guest, he is thinking not so much of the outward token of disrespect, as of the guest 's mental attitude toward the proprieties of the occasion."
3. "He was speechless [εφιμωθη] . Lit., he was muzzled or gagged. It is used of muzzling the ox (1 Timothy 5:18), and is addressed by Christ to the demon (Mark 1:25), and to the raging sea (Mark 4:39)."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Friend. The word used in chap. Matthew 20:13, and addressed to Judas (chap. Matthew 26:50). It means 'companion,' without implying friendship."
2. "How camest thou! It was a bold intrusion, a despising of the king, to appear in his own ordinary dress. This points to the pride of self-righteousness. Some think it indicates lawlessness or hypocrisy."
3. "He was speechless. There can be no excuse for failure to have on the wedding garment, to be righteous through and in Christ Jesus."

### John Gill:
1. "How couldest thou expect to meet with acceptance with me, or to be suitable company for my people, not being arrayed with the garments of salvation, and robe of righteousness, as they are?"
2. "He had nothing to say for himself... their mouths will be stopped, and they will have nothing to say in vindication of themselves; their righteousness will not answer for them in a time to come."
