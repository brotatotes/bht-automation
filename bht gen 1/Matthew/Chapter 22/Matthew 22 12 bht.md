# Matthew 22:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this parable, a king invites guests to a wedding feast. However, one guest is found without a wedding garment, symbolizing the righteousness of Christ. Commentators emphasize that merely being present is not enough; one must be clothed in the righteousness of Christ to be accepted by God. The guest's silence when questioned highlights our dependence on Christ's righteousness and the impossibility of justifying ourselves. This parable serves as a warning against approaching God on our own terms, emphasizing the need for humility, repentance, and faith in Christ's righteousness for acceptance into the kingdom of heaven.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The wedding garment represents the righteousness of Christ that is imputed to believers through faith. It is not enough to simply be present at the wedding feast; one must also be clothed in the righteousness of Christ to be accepted by God."

2. "The question posed by the king to the man without the wedding garment reveals the man's lack of preparation and disregard for the king's invitation. It serves as a reminder that we cannot approach God on our own terms, but must come to Him in humility and repentance."

3. "The man's silence in response to the king's question signifies his guilt and inability to justify himself. It highlights the fact that no amount of excuses or explanations can cover up our spiritual nakedness before God. We are completely dependent on the righteousness of Christ for acceptance."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The word 'friend' does not imply friendship." 
2. "He was speechless - He had no excuse." 
3. "So it will be with all hypocrites."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The man had not [ουκ] a wedding garment. When the king addresses the guest, he is thinking not so much of the outward token of disrespect, as of the guest's mental attitude toward the proprieties of the occasion."
2. "It implies, as Dr. Morison observes, that the man was conscious of the omission when he entered, and was intentionally guilty of the neglect."
3. "He was speechless [εφιμωθη]. Lit., he was muzzled or gagged. It is used of muzzling the ox (1 Timothy 5:18), and is addressed by Christ to the demon (Mark 1:25), and to the raging sea (Mark 4:39)."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Friend. The word used in chap. Matthew 20:13, and addressed to Judas (chap. Matthew 26:50). It means ‘companion,’ without implying friendship."
2. "How camest thou! It was a bold intrusion, a despising of the king, to appear in his own ordinary dress. This points to the pride of self-righteousness. Some think it indicates lawlessness or hypocrisy."
3. "He was speechless. There can be no excuse for failure to have on the wedding garment, to be righteous through and in Christ Jesus."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Not having a wedding-garment (μη εχων ενδυμα γαμου). Μη is in the Koine the usual negative with participles unless special emphasis on the negative is desired as in ουκ ενδεδυμενον."
2. "There is a subtle distinction between μη and ου like our subjective and objective notions."
3. "Wunsche does report a parable by a rabbi of a king who set no time for his feast and the guests arrived, some properly dressed waiting at the door; others in their working clothes did not wait, but went off to work and, when the summons suddenly came, they had no time to dress properly and were made to stand and watch while the others partook of the feast."

### John Gill:
1. "How couldest thou expect to meet with acceptance with me, or to be suitable company for my people, not being arrayed with the garments of salvation, and robe of righteousness, as they are?"
2. "He had nothing to say for himself: not but that there will be pleas made use of by hypocrites, and formal professors, another day; who will plead either their preaching and prophesying in Christ's name; or their attendance on outward ordinances; or the works they have done, ordinary or extraordinary; but then these will all be superseded and silenced, their own consciences will condemn them, their mouths will be stopped, and they will have nothing to say in vindication of themselves."
3. "Their righteousness will not answer for them in a time to come."

### John Wesley:
1. "A wedding garment - The righteousness of Christ, first imputed, then implanted." 
2. "It may easily be observed, this has no relation to the Lord's Supper, but to God's proceeding at the last day." 
3. "The wedding garment represents the righteousness that comes from faith in Christ, which is necessary for entrance into the kingdom of heaven."
