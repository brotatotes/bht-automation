# Matthew 22:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse describes the fate of someone who is excluded from the heavenly city, bound hand and foot with no power to resist. They are cast into utter darkness, a place of complete separation from God's presence. This punishment emphasizes the severity and darkness of their fate, as they find themselves in a region of darkness with its horrors, experiencing weeping and gnashing of teeth. The attendants, likely angels, are the ones who carry out this punishment, ensuring the secure transfer of the individual to their place of punishment.
