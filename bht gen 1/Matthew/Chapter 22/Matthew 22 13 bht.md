# Matthew 22:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the darkness that awaits the unworthy is emphasized as being outside of the heavenly city, excluded from its joyous festivities. The phrase "outer darkness" alludes to the severity and darkness of the hypocrites' punishment, suggesting a complete separation from God's presence and light. The use of the term "bind him hand and foot" signifies the magnitude of their crime and the inescapability of their punishment. Ultimately, those cast into the outer darkness will experience weeping and gnashing of teeth, accompanied by a sense of shame and regret.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The expression is emphatic—"the darkness which is outside." To be "outside" at all—or, in the language of Matthew 25:30- :, to be "without" the heavenly city, excluded from its joyous nuptials and gladsome festivities—is sad enough of itself, without anything else."
2. "But to find themselves not only excluded from the brightness and glory and joy and felicity of the kingdom above, but thrust into a region of 'darkness,' with all its horrors, this is the dismal retribution here announced, that awaits the unworthy at the great day."
3. "Shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth."

### Albert Barnes:

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Was speechless (εψιμωθη). Was muzzled, dumb from confusion and embarrassment."
