In this verse, Jesus is confronted with a deceptive question, designed to trap him and undermine his authority.

His answer challenges us to consider the balance between our earthly obligations and our ultimate loyalty to God, reminding us that God's authority transcends all human institutions.

### John Wesley:
1. "The question posed to Jesus was a trap, designed to force him into making a statement that would either offend the Jewish people or undermine his authority. But Jesus, in his wisdom, saw through their deceit and responded with a profound answer that not only evaded their trap but also revealed a deeper truth about the nature of authority and allegiance."

This requires discernment and courage, as we navigate the tension between our earthly obligations and our ultimate allegiance to God."
