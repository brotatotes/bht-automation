### Philip Schaff:
1. "To say Yes, would alienate the people, who hated the Roman yoke; to say No, would have given good ground for accusing Him to the Roman authorities."
2. "Themselves regarding 'the person of men,' the Pharisees did not avow their own belief, that it was not lawful."
3. "Their motive now was not their usual hostility to Rome, but hatred of Christ."

### John Gill:

### John Wesley:
1. "The question posed to Jesus was a trap, designed to force him into a no-win situation. If he answered 'yes,' he would be seen as a collaborator with the oppressive Roman regime. If he answered 'no,' he would be seen as a rebel against Roman authority." 

2. "Jesus' response reveals his wisdom and understanding of the situation. He asks for a coin and points out the image of Caesar on it, implying that if the coin bears Caesar's image, it belongs to Caesar. This response not only avoids the trap but also teaches a deeper lesson about the distinction between earthly and spiritual matters."

3. "Jesus' answer challenges his listeners to consider their priorities. While it is important to give to Caesar what belongs to him, it is even more important to give to God what belongs to Him. This reminds us that our ultimate allegiance is to God and His kingdom, not to any earthly authority."

4. "Jesus' response also highlights the tension between the political and spiritual realms. While we are called to be good citizens and obey the laws of the land, we must always remember that our true citizenship is in heaven. This means that our actions and decisions should be guided by our commitment to God's kingdom and His principles."
