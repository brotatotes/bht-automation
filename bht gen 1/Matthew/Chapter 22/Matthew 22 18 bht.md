### John Wesley:
1. "Ye hypocrites" - The commentator highlights the term "hypocrites" as a way to describe those who pretend to have a scruple of conscience. This emphasizes the insincerity and deceitfulness of their actions.

2. "Pretending a scruple of conscience" - The commentator points out that the individuals being addressed in the verse are pretending to have a moral dilemma or concern. This suggests that their actions are not driven by genuine conviction but rather by ulterior motives.

3. "Their outward show of piety masks their true intentions" - The commentator suggests that the hypocrites' outward display of religious devotion serves as a cover for their true intentions. This implies that their actions are driven by self-interest rather than a sincere desire to follow God's commandments.
