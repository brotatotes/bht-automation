## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Philip Schaff:
1. "Render therefore unto Cesar, etc. Render to 'the powers that be,' the service due them. Comp. Romans 13:1-7. Obedience to this precept would have spared Jerusalem, but the subtlest snare they devised for our Lord became their own destruction."
2. "Unto God the things that are God's. Religious duties are to be rendered to God. Possibly a hint that in denying Him, they denied the honor due to God, and also a reference to man as bearing the image of God, so that political and religious duties are distinguished, but not divided."
3. "Real religion makes men better citizens, since it enjoins a religious fulfillment of political obligations. Under a free government, this religious fulfillment of political duties is essential to preserve the State against anarchy."

### Archibald T Robertson:

2. This verse challenges us to consider the balance between our earthly responsibilities and our spiritual allegiance. It reminds us that while we are citizens of this world, we are ultimately citizens of the kingdom of God. We are called to live in this world, but not be of it.

3. The phrase "what is already Caesar's" suggests that we should give to the government what rightfully belongs to it, such as taxes and obedience to the laws. However, it also implies that there are things that do not belong to Caesar, such as our ultimate allegiance and devotion to God. We are called to discern and prioritize our obligations accordingly.
