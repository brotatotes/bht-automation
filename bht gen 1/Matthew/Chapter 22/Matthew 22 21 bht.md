# Matthew 22:21 Commentary Help Text

The Bible verse being described is a reminder to fulfill our civic responsibilities and acknowledge the authority and laws of the land. It emphasizes the importance of giving back what is owed to the governing authorities, both in terms of financial obligations and obedience. By using the imagery of Caesar's coin, it highlights the duty to recognize and submit to the government's rule. At the same time, it reminds us not to neglect our spiritual obligations to God, as true faith encompasses both our civic and religious duties.
