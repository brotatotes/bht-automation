## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "In Luke, οἱ ἀντιλέγ . = οἵτινες λέγουσιν Mark." 
2. "Here, the art. being absent, we must understand that they came, saying that there was no resurrection."
3. "i.e. either, in pursuance of their well-known denial of that doctrine, or, which is more probable, actually saying, maintaining it against our Lord: viz., in shape and manner following."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "There is no resurrection." - The Sadducees' denial of the resurrection and immortality of the soul aligns them with the Skeptics and Epicureans among the Greek philosophers.

2. "This sneering spirit is prominent in Sadducees of every age." - The Sadducees' scoffing question reflects their mocking attitude towards the doctrine and Christ Himself.

3. "Errorists often think that opposition to their opponents is agreement with them." - The Sadducees may have hoped for an answer that would show sympathy with their views, but truth always opposes two contrary errors.

### John Wesley:
1. "The Sadducees, who did not believe in the resurrection, were trying to trap Jesus with a hypothetical question about marriage in the afterlife. This verse highlights the importance of understanding the context in which a question is asked, as it reveals the motives behind it." 

2. "Jesus' response to the Sadducees not only addresses their question but also teaches a profound truth about the resurrection. He explains that in the resurrection, people will be like angels and will not marry or be given in marriage. This challenges our limited understanding of eternity and reminds us that our earthly relationships will be transformed in the presence of God."

3. "Through his response, Jesus also emphasizes the power and authority of God. He reminds the Sadducees that God is the God of the living, not the dead, affirming the reality of the resurrection. This reassures believers that death is not the end, but a transition into eternal life with God."

4. "This passage encourages us to approach questions and challenges with wisdom and discernment. Jesus' response demonstrates the importance of understanding Scripture and having a deep knowledge of God's character. It reminds us to seek truth and not be swayed by the opinions or agendas of others."
