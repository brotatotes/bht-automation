# Matthew 22:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we see a law known as the Levirate marriage being discussed. This law aimed to preserve families and their inheritances, especially in cases where a man died without children. The law required the brother-in-law to marry the widow, and any children from this marriage would be regarded as the deceased brother's heirs. This practice not only protected the widow from destitution but also emphasized the importance of family and community in ancient Jewish society. While it may seem foreign to us now, this law served a specific purpose in its cultural context.
