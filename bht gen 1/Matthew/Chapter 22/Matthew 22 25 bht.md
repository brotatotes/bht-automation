# Matthew 22:25 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This verse presents a hypothetical scenario involving a family of seven brothers. The eldest brother marries a wife but dies without having any children. According to the Jewish law, his next brother is expected to marry the widow and raise children for his deceased brother. However, the Sadducees, who denied the resurrection, use this story as a common objection, trying to prove that the idea of resurrection is absurd. This fictional case challenges the teaching of the resurrection and serves as a point of contention between different beliefs and interpretations.

### John Gill:
1. "There was in the city, town or neighbourhood, where these Sadducees dwelt, probably at Jerusalem, a family, in which were seven sons, all brethren by the father's side."
2. "The eldest of these seven brethren married a wife, and after some time died, having no children, son or daughter, by his wife; and therefore, according to the above law, leaves her to his next brother to marry her, and raise up seed unto him."
3. "According to the Jewish canons, they were to wait and see, whether she was with child by his brother or not; for if she was, it was not necessary, yea, it was unlawful for him to marry her."

### John Wesley:
1. "This story seems to have been a kind of common-place objection." 
2. "No doubt they brought [the objection] upon all occasions." 
3. "The Sadducees, who denied the resurrection, thought they had found a case in which the doctrine of the resurrection would be absurd and impracticable."
