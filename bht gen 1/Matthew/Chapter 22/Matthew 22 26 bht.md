# Matthew 22:26 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, we are presented with a story that delves into the complexities of the levirate marriage practice. The repetition of the phrase "likewise the second also" emphasizes the futile pattern of brothers marrying the same woman and failing to produce descendants. This narrative challenges the religious leaders to think deeply about the limitations of human efforts in fulfilling God's purposes. Jesus, with his deep understanding of the law, provokes thought by highlighting the absurdity and need for a different solution in this situation.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Philip Schaff:
1. "The mention of 'the seventh' in this verse refers to the practice of levirate marriage, where a man would marry his brother's widow in order to continue his brother's lineage. This was based on the belief that a man's lineage was crucial for the inheritance of land and blessings."
2. "By using the phrase 'the seven,' Jesus is highlighting the significance of this practice and the importance of understanding the complexities of the law. He is challenging the religious leaders to think deeply about the implications of their question."
3. "This verse reminds us that Jesus was not only a teacher of spiritual truths, but also a master of the law. He had a deep understanding of the cultural and legal context in which he ministered, and he used this knowledge to challenge and provoke thought in his listeners."

### John Gill:
1. "The repetition of the phrase 'likewise the second also' emphasizes the pattern of the brothers marrying the same woman and dying without children. It highlights the futility of their actions and the tragic cycle they were caught in." 

2. "The commentary suggests that the brothers' actions were in accordance with the levirate law, which required a man to marry his deceased brother's widow to preserve the family line. However, their repeated failure to produce offspring underscores the limitations of human effort in fulfilling God's purposes." 

3. "The mention of the seventh brother marrying the woman serves as a climax to the narrative, emphasizing the absurdity of the situation. It shows that even after six failed attempts, the seventh brother still followed the same pattern, highlighting the futility of their actions and the need for a different solution."
