# Matthew 22:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this prophetic parable, the chosen people of God, the Jews, are represented as the ones initially invited to the kingdom of heaven. Their rejection of the invitation is seen through the rejection of the first messengers of the gospel, including John the Baptist, Christ, and His disciples. The invitation was extended to the Jews first, emphasizing their privileged position, but sadly, many of them chose not to accept it. However, Jesus later extends the invitation to all people, demonstrating that the opportunity for salvation is not limited to a select few.
