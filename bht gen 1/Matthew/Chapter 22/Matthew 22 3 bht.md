# Matthew 22:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this parable, the first messengers of the Gospel, including John the Baptist, Jesus Himself, and His disciples, are represented by servants inviting those who had been called to the wedding feast. The rejection of the invitation by the Jews highlights their aversion to the Gospel and their refusal to acknowledge Jesus as the Messiah. However, this rejection leads to the invitation being extended to others, signifying the inclusive nature of God's plan of salvation, welcoming both the righteous and the sinners.
