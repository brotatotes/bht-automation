# Matthew 22:32 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, commentators argue that the resurrection of the dead is a fundamental point of the law. They point to God's covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob as evidence of their continued existence after death. By stating that God is not the God of the dead but of the living, they emphasize the mutual relationship and ongoing connection between God and humanity. Ultimately, this verse challenges the belief that the soul dies with the body and supports the belief in the resurrection and the immortality of the soul.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### John Gill:
1. "Though a man confesses and believes that the dead will be raised, yet that it is not intimated in the law, he is a heretic; since it is a fundamental point, that the resurrection of the dead is of the law."
2. "Says R. Simai, from whence is the resurrection of the dead to be proved out of the law? From Exodus 6:4 as it is said, 'I have also established my covenant with them, to give them the land of Canaan: to you' it is not said, but 'to them'; from hence then, the resurrection of the dead may be proved out of the law."
3. "Thus our Lord having to do with the same sort of persons, fetches his proof of the doctrine of the resurrection out of the law, and from a passage which respects the covenant relation God stands in to his people, particularly Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; and which respects not their souls only, but their bodies also, even their whole persons, body and soul."

### John Wesley:
1. "God is not the God of the dead, but of the living." - This quote highlights the argument that God's relationship with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob implies their continued existence after death, refuting the belief that the soul dies with the body.
