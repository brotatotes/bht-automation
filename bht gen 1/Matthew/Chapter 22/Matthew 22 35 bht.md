# Matthew 22:35 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
A scribe, seeking to test Jesus' wisdom and knowledge, asked him a seemingly innocent but tempting question. This challenging question was designed to expose any ignorance on Jesus' part and undermine his claim as the Son of God. However, the scribe's intention was not malicious, but rather an opportunity for Jesus to showcase his deep understanding and insight, as he had previously done in silencing the Sadducees. So, what initially appeared as an innocent inquiry became the greatest temptation for Jesus to demonstrate his wisdom and prove his divine authority.
