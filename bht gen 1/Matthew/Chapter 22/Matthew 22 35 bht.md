# Matthew 22:35 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, a scribe, a Mosaic jurist with expertise in interpreting the Law, approaches Jesus with a tempting question. The seemingly innocent question serves as a trial of Jesus' knowledge and understanding, with the intention of trapping or exposing him. The scribe, aware of Jesus' wisdom in silencing the Sadducees, seeks to test if Jesus' wisdom extends beyond that encounter. Though the scribe's intentions were not malicious, the question posed becomes a great temptation and an opportunity for Jesus to demonstrate his wisdom and understanding of the law.
