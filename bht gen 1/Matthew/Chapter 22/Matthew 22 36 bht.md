### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The A. V. and Rev. alike miss the point of this question, which is: which kind of command is great in the law?"
2. "Not, which commandment is greatest as compared with the others?"
3. "It was in view of this kind of distinction that the scribe asked the question; not as desiring a declaration as to which commandment was greatest, but as wanting to know the principle upon which a commandment was to be regarded as a great commandment."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "What commandment is great in the law?" - This question is not asking for a comparison between commandments, but rather seeks to identify the commandment that encompasses and includes all others. 

2. "Not merely greater than the rest, but 'great,' as including the rest." - The commandment being referred to is not just superior to the others, but it is of such significance that it encompasses and incorporates all the other commandments within it.

3. "If there was a reference to the disputes of the Rabbins about great and small commandments, the meaning would be: 'What kind of a commandment is great in the law?' but this sense, though literally correct, does not suit the answer so well." - While there may have been debates among the Rabbis regarding the importance of different commandments, the question being asked here is not about the kind of commandment, but rather about the one that holds the greatest weight and significance in the law.
