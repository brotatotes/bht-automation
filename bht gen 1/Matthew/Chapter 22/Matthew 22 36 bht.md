# Matthew 22:36 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The commentators shed light on a question posed to Jesus, asking which commandment is the greatest in the law. It is not a comparison between commandments, but a search for the most important commandment that encompasses all others. This commandment is not just superior to the rest, but includes and summarizes them. It goes beyond mere classification and cuts through debates about different commandments. Jesus is being asked to identify the principle upon which a commandment is regarded as great.

### Philip Schaff:

### John Gill:
1. "The question is not which of the laws was the greatest, the oral, or the written law... but the question was about the written law of Moses; and not merely about the decalogue, or whether the commands of the first table were greater than those of the second, as was generally thought; or whether the affirmative precepts were not more to be regarded than negative ones, which was their commonly received opinion; but about the whole body of the law, moral and ceremonial, delivered by Moses." 

2. "It was moved that it might be said which was the greatest and weightiest of them all. Some thought the commandment of the sabbath was the greatest... Others give the preference to circumcision... Others say of the 'phylacteries', that the holiness of them is the greatest of all... In this multiplicity of opinions, Christ's is desired on this subject, though with no good intention."

3. "Which is the great commandment in the law?... The question is not which of the laws was the greatest, the oral, or the written law... but the question was about the written law of Moses; and not merely about the decalogue, or whether the commands of the first table were greater than those of the second, as was generally thought; or whether the affirmative precepts were not more to be regarded than negative ones, which was their commonly received opinion; but about the whole body of the law, moral and ceremonial, delivered by Moses."
