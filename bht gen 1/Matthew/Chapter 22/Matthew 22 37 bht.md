2. "and though this is now the case of man, yet his obligation to love the Lord in this manner is still the same; and when the Spirit of God does produce the grace and fruit of love in his soul, he does love the Lord sincerely; because of the perfections of his nature, and the works of his hands, and because of the blessings of grace bestowed, and especially for Christ, the unspeakable gift of his love."
3. "The Hebrew phrase seems to denote the vehemency of affections, with which God is to be beloved. Though the Jewish writers s paraphrase and interpret it, 'with all thy substance', or 'money'; and in the Misna t, the following interpretation is given of the whole; 'with all thy heart', with thy imaginations, with the good imagination, and with the evil imagination; and 'with all thy soul', even if he should take away thy soul; and 'with all thy strength', with all thy 'mammon', or riches; or otherwise, 'with all thy might', with every measure he measures unto thee, do thou measure unto him.'"
