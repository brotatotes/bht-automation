# Matthew 22:40 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Bible verse being described emphasizes the unity between the cardinal precepts of the law and the writings of the prophets. These aspects may seem distinct, but they are connected by a common principle. The law serves as a snare, while the prophets foretell of Christ, but there is no contradiction between them. The verse suggests that the writings of the prophets expand upon and explain the precepts of the law, all of which are interconnected and cannot be separated from one another. To better understand this verse, one can refer to Mark 12:32-34 for further insight.
