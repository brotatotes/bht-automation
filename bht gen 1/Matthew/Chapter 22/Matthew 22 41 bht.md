# Matthew 22:41 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, a gathering of Pharisees takes place, possibly following a previous confrontation. Jesus, addressing the entire group, poses a question to them, specifically focusing on the scribes. This interaction occurs during a transition between the departing Pharisees, who are no longer willing to challenge Him, and the incoming crowd who fill the vacant spaces. The central theme revolves around the Pharisees' reliance on the law and their rejection of the promised Messiah for salvation.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Philip Schaff:
1. "Now while the Pharisees were gathered together. Probably as they gathered after the last attack."
2. "Jesus asked them. Fuller and more exact than Mark and Luke, who seem to imply that the question was put concerning the scribes."
3. "This probably took place while His audience was changing: the Pharisees were about to withdraw, no longer daring to question Him; and 'the multitude' (Mark 12:37) beginning to take the vacated places."

### John Gill:
1. "Salvation was not by the law, and the works of it, which they set up for doctors and interpreters of, and advocates for, but by the Messiah, who was promised to their fathers, and they expected."
2. "Christ directs his discourse not to him individually, but to all the Pharisees before he parted with them, and puts a question to them, in his turn."
3. "This is to be understood not of their gathering together, to consult privately about him; this is expressed before in Matthew 22:34 but of their gathering together about Christ, to hear what answer he would return to the question their learned doctor would put to him."
