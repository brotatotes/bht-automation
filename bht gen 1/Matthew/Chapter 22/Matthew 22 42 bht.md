# Matthew 22:42 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
With the Pharisees expecting a political Messiah, Jesus challenges their limited understanding by asserting his divine authority and position as the promised descendant of David. The question he poses highlights the paradoxical nature of his identity, as both the Son of David and the Lord of David. Through this, Jesus invites us to reflect on our own understanding of who he is, encouraging us to surrender our preconceived notions and embrace the truth of his divine identity as the Son of God who reigns over all creation.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### John Calvin:
1. "Satan therefore permitted Christ to be acknowledged as a true man and a son of David, for he would in vain have attempted to overturn this article of faith; but—what was worse—he stripped him of his Divinity, as if he had been only one of the ordinary descendants of Adam." 

2. "And ever since Christ was manifested to the world, heretics have attempted by various contrivances—and as it were under ground—to overturn sometimes his human, and sometimes his Divine nature, that either he might not have full power to save us, or we might not have ready access to him." 

3. "For as the weakness of the flesh, by which he approached to us, gives us confidence, that we may not hesitate to draw near to him, so if that weakness alone were before our eyes, it would rather fill us with fear and despair than excite proper confidence."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The Pharisees included the acknowledged interpreters of the Old Testament. Our Lord would prove the insufficiency of their interpretation on a point which they rightly deemed of most importance."
2. "What they thought of Him, He does not ask them. Since He has been abundantly proven to be 'the Christ,' the question comes to us in this form, as an all-important one. One answer only can be correct."
3. "A common title applied to the Messiah. A correct answer, but incomplete. This incompleteness is then proven. On this one-sided view of the Messiah, as a descendant of David, the king and warrior, their false political false hopes had been based."

### John Gill:
1. "If this question was put to some persons, it would appear, that they have no thoughts of Christ at all."
2. "The Arrian thinks he is a created God, of a like, but not of the same nature with the Father."
3. "Only believers in Christ have a good thought of him, to their own joy and comfort."

### John Wesley:
1. "Jesus' question is not a mere intellectual exercise, but a profound theological statement about his identity as the Messiah and his relationship to David. By quoting Psalm 110, Jesus is asserting his divine authority and his position as the promised descendant of David who would reign forever."

2. "The Pharisees and religious leaders were expecting a political Messiah who would overthrow the Roman rule and establish an earthly kingdom. But Jesus challenges their limited understanding by pointing to his heavenly authority and eternal reign."

3. "Jesus' question also highlights the paradoxical nature of his identity. He is both the Son of David, a human descendant, and the Lord of David, the divine ruler. This mystery of the Incarnation is at the heart of Jesus' mission and the fulfillment of God's plan for salvation."

4. "In this verse, Jesus invites us to reflect on our own understanding of who he is. Do we see him merely as a teacher or prophet, or do we recognize him as the divine Son of God who holds all authority and reigns over all creation?"

5. "Ultimately, Jesus' question challenges us to surrender our preconceived notions and expectations about the Messiah and to embrace the truth of his identity as the Son of David and the Lord of all."
