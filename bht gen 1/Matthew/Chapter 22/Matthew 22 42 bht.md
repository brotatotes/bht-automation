## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### John Calvin:
1. "Satan therefore permitted Christ to be acknowledged as a true man and a son of David, for he would in vain have attempted to overturn this article of faith; but—what was worse—he stripped him of his Divinity, as if he had been only one of the ordinary descendants of Adam." 
2. "And ever since Christ was manifested to the world, heretics have attempted by various contrivances—and as it were under ground—to overturn sometimes his human, and sometimes his Divine nature, that either he might not have full power to save us, or we might not have ready access to him."
3. "For as the weakness of the flesh, by which he approached to us, gives us confidence, that we may not hesitate to draw near to him, so if that weakness alone were before our eyes, it would rather fill us with fear and despair than excite proper confidence."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The Pharisees included the acknowledged interpreters of the Old Testament. Our Lord would prove the insufficiency of their interpretation on a point which they rightly deemed of most importance."
2. "What they thought of Him, He does not ask them. Since He has been abundantly proven to be ‘the Christ,’ the question comes to us in this form, as an all-important one."
3. "A correct answer, but incomplete. This incompleteness is then proven. On this one-sided view of the Messiah, as a descendant of David, the king and warrior, their false political false hopes had been based."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "The Christ, the Messiah, not Christ as a proper name of Jesus."
2. "Jesus here assumes that Matthew 22:110 refers to the Messiah."
3. "By his pungent question about the Messiah as David's son and Lord, he really touches the problem of his Person (his Deity and his Humanity)."

### John Gill:
1. "If this question was put to some persons, it would appear, that they have no thoughts of Christ at all."
2. "Only believers in Christ have a good thought of him, to their own joy and comfort."
3. "Such think often, and well, of the dignity of Christ's person, of the excellency and usefulness of his offices, of the virtue of his blood, righteousness, and sacrifice, and of the sufficiency of his grace for them."

### John Wesley:
1. "Jesus' question challenges the common understanding of the Messiah as merely a descendant of David. He is highlighting the paradoxical relationship between David and the Messiah, suggesting that the Messiah is not just a human ruler, but also divine."

2. "By quoting Psalm 110, Jesus is pointing to the authority and exalted status of the Messiah. He is emphasizing that the Messiah is not just a political leader, but also the Son of God who reigns over all."

3. "Jesus' question exposes the limited understanding of the religious leaders, who failed to recognize the true identity and nature of the Messiah. He is inviting them to reconsider their preconceived notions and to open their hearts to the revelation of God's plan for salvation."
