# Matthew 22:45 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The passage being described emphasizes the complex nature of the Messiah, who is both the Son of David according to human lineage and the preexistent eternal Son of God, as preached by the Apostles. The Pharisees, due to their ignorance and failure to understand the Old Testament, could not adequately answer the question posed to them. However, if they had recognized the Messiah's divine nature, they would have understood that he is not only the son of David but also his Lord and creator.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Philip Schaff:
1. "The solution is not given here; but plainly preached by the Apostles from the day of Pentecost: the Messiah was Son of David according to the flesh, yet the preexistent eternal Son of God: the God-man." 
2. "If the Pharisees were ignorant of this solution, it was their own fault, since the Old Testament plainly pointed to it."
3. "Our Lord's claims involved this: He had been called the 'Son of David;' He had claimed to be the Son of God some time before, and they afterwards accused Him of so doing."

### John Gill:
1. "The question is to be answered upon true and just notions of the Messiah, but unanswerable upon the principles of the Pharisees."
2. "They were able to make answer to the question, separately considered, as that he should be of the lineage and house of David; should lineally descend from him, be of his family, one of his offspring and posterity, and so be properly and naturally his son."
3. "Had they understood and owned the proper divinity of the Messiah, they might have answered, that as he was God, he was David's Lord, his maker, and his king; and, as man, was David's son, and so both his root and offspring."
