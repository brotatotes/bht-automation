# Matthew 22:46 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we see a clear divide between Pharisaical Judaism and Christ, leading them to part ways forever. The hostility against Jesus, who claimed to be the Son of God and the Messiah, is evident in the next chapter. Jesus' response to the people's attempts to trap Him showcased His wisdom and authority, effectively silencing them and leaving no room for further debate. The dilemma faced by the religious leaders forced them to either acknowledge Jesus' deity or confess their ignorance, but they chose silence instead.
