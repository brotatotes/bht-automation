# Matthew 23:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we are reminded not to seek titles or positions of authority, but to recognize that Christ alone is our true leader. As believers, we are called to follow his teachings and example. The role of leaders within the church is to guide and direct others towards Christ, upholding his word and ordinances. Ultimately, our focus should be on our dependence on Christ as the head of the church, as our faith and baptism unify us under his lordship.
