## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Albert Barnes:

2. "Neither of these commands forbids us to give proper titles of civil office to men, or to render them the honor belonging to their station."
3. "They prohibit the disciples of Jesus from seeking or receiving mere empty titles, producing distinctions among themselves, implying authority to control the opinions and conduct of others, and claiming that others should acknowledge them to be superior to them."

### Marvin Vincent:

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "While διδασκαλος represents Ραβ, καθηγητες stands for the more honourable Ραββαν, -βων" (McNeile). 

2. Dalman (Words of Jesus, p. 340) suggests that the same Aramaic word may be translated by either διδασκαλος or καθηγητες.

3. The use of these words here by Jesus like "Jesus Christ" in his Prayer (John 17:3) is held by some to show that they were added by the evangelist to what Jesus actually said, since the Master would not have so described himself. But he commended Peter for calling him "the Christ the Son of the living God" (Matthew 16:16). We must not empty the consciousness of Jesus too much.

### John Gill:
1. "It is their business to lead and direct souls to Christ, to guide their feet in the way of peace, and to go before them, as examples to them, in word, in conversation, faith, and purity."
2. "They are to guide them according to the word of God, and not their own dictates; and teach them to observe the rules, and obey the ordinances of Christ, and not what are of their own inventing and prescribing."
3. "Direct men to a dependence on Christ, as head of the church, who is the one Lord, as his faith is one, and his baptism one also."
