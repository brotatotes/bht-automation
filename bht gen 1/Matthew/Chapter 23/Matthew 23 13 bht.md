# Matthew 23:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The commentators shed light on a verse that reveals a solemn denunciation of those who abuse their authority and hinder others from attaining true knowledge and salvation. By shutting heaven and denying the key of knowledge to the people, they prevent them from experiencing grace and understanding the mysteries of God. The verse rebukes their false teachings, legalistic practices, and resistance to the Messiah, ultimately preventing believers from entering the kingdom of heaven. These woes serve as a compassionate warning against self-righteousness and the obstruction of others' spiritual growth.
