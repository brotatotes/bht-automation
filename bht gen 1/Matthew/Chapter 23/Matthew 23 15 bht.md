# Matthew 23:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse being described condemns the scribes and Pharisees for their hypocrisy and their efforts to convert others to their beliefs. Despite their zealous attempts to gain proselytes, their actions only lead to deeper condemnation and wickedness. These religious leaders were driven by selfish motives, seeking to increase their own numbers, gain wealth, and obtain recognition among the people. However, their methods were corrupt and their converts often became even more entrenched in wickedness. They were more interested in advancing their own interests rather than genuinely guiding others towards righteousness.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The Lord speaks not here of those pious Godfearing men, who were found dwelling among the Jews, favouring and often attending their worship but of the proselytes of righteousness, so called, who by persuasion of the Pharisees, took on them the whole Jewish law and its observances." 
2. "These were rare and it was to the credit of our nature that they were. For what could such a proselyte, made by such teachers, become? A disciple of hypocrisy merely neither a sincere heathen nor a sincere Jew doubly the child of hell condemned by the religion which he had left condemned again by that which he had taken."
3. "The expression διπλότερον ὑμῶν occurs in the same connexion, and probably in allusion to this passage, in Justin Martyr, Tryph. § 122, p. 215, οἱ δὲ προσήλυτοι οὐ μόνον οὐ πιστεύουσιν, ἀλλὰ διπλότερον ὑμῶν βλασφημοῦσιν εἰς τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites!" - This phrase highlights the strong condemnation Jesus has for the religious leaders who were hypocritical in their actions and teachings.

2. "Ye compass sea and land to make one proselyte" - This quote emphasizes the extent to which the scribes and Pharisees would go to convert someone to their religious beliefs, even going as far as traveling great distances.

3. "Ye make him twofold more the child of hell than yourselves" - This statement reveals the negative influence the scribes and Pharisees had on the converts they made, leading them to become even more deeply entrenched in hypocrisy and condemnation.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Ye compass sea and land - You take every means, spare no pains, to gain proselytes."
2. "To be a child of hell was a Hebrew phrase, signifying to be deserving of hell, to be awfully wicked."
3. "The Pharisees gained them either to swell their own numbers, or to make gain by extorting their money under various pretences."

### John Calvin:
1. "Christ declares, on the contrary, that so far is this zeal from deserving applause, that they more and more provoke the vengeance of God, because they bring under heavier condemnation those who devote themselves to their sect."
2. "We ought to observe how corrupt their condition at that time was, and what confusion existed in religion; for as it was a holy and excellent work to gain disciples to God, so to allure the Gentiles to the Jewish worship—which was at that time degenerate, and was even full of wicked profanation — was nothing else than to hurry them from Scylla to Charybdis."
3. "An instance of the same kind may be seen at the present day among the monks; for they are diligent in culling proselytes from every quarter, but those proselytes, from being lascivious and debauched persons, they render altogether devils: for such is the filthiness of those puddles, within which they carry on their reveling, that it would corrupt even the heavenly angels."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Real missionary effort was contrary to the spirit of the Pharisees, indicating too high an estimate of the Gentiles."
2. "A proselyte of righteousness was really ‘neither a sincere heathen nor a sincere Jew.’ The law could only proselyte, it could not convert."
3. "‘Proselytes’ generally become more extreme than their teachers. In this case they would become Pharisees, rather than Jews, lacking even the remnant of good in their teachers."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The 'son of Gehenna' means one fitted for and so destined for Gehenna." 
2. "The more converted the more perverted" (H.J. Holtzmann). 
3. "The Pharisees claimed to be in a special sense sons of the kingdom (Matthew 8:12). They were more partisan than pious."

### John Gill:
1. "The Jews were very diligent and industrious, which is meant by compassing of sea and land: they used all kinds of methods, ways and means, to gain such a point, and sometimes very wicked ones."
2. "They coveted to make proselytes, because hereby either they strengthened their own party, or filled their purses with their substance, or got applause and credit among the common people."
3. "And a little after, 'Jacob made proselytes, as it is written, Genesis 35:2 "Jacob said unto his household",' And in imitation of these they might be fond of making proselytes, but no further than their own interest was some way or other concerned."
