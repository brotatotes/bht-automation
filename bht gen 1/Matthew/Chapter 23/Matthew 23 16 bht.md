### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Note omission of 'Scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites' with this third woe." This highlights the significance of Jesus directly addressing the blind guides without specifically mentioning the Scribes and Pharisees. It suggests that Jesus is condemning a broader group of leaders who are misleading others.

2. "They split hairs about oaths, as Jesus had explained in Matthew 5:33-37, between the temple and the gold of the temple." This quote references a previous teaching by Jesus in Matthew 5, emphasizing that the blind guides are focusing on trivial matters instead of understanding the true meaning and importance of oaths.

3. "He owes his oath, is bound by his oath." This phrase sheds light on the concept of being a debtor to one's oath. It suggests that the blind guides have a responsibility to fulfill their oaths and are accountable for their words and actions.

Overall, these quotes help to deepen our understanding of the verse by highlighting the broader condemnation of the blind guides, their misguided focus on trivial matters, and their responsibility to fulfill their oaths.
