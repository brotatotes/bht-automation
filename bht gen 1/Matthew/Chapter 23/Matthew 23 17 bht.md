# Matthew 23:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the commentators convey that the sanctification of something comes from a higher source. The gold in the temple is not inherently holy but derives its sanctity from the temple itself, which is consecrated by the presence of God. The foolishness of the Pharisees is exposed for placing greater value on the gold than on the temple, for it is the temple that grants holiness to the gold. Ultimately, it is emphasized that the spirit behind one's actions and words holds greater significance than mere surface-level observance.
