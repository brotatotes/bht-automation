# Matthew 23:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, there is a rebuke towards those who foolishly place more importance on the gold of the temple than on the temple itself. The gold derives its sanctity from the temple, which in turn is sanctified by God. It is a foolish and false distinction to hold the gold in higher regard than the temple, as any holiness the gold possesses is solely due to its association with the temple. This kind of thinking reveals the greed and foolishness of those who prioritize material possessions over the sacredness of God's presence in the temple.
