# Matthew 23:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, there is a mention of an altar, specifically the altar of burnt-offerings located in the court of the priests. This altar is significant because it is where all the animals and offerings of the temple are sacrificed. It is a sacred and valuable place, as it is the authorized altar in the temple. Not only does God allow Himself to be called as a witness and judge through the symbols of His presence, but swearing by the altar is also a serious matter that carries weight and obligation.
