# Matthew 23:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, Jesus is teaching about the sincerity and integrity of making vows and oaths. It is not the external act of swearing that matters, but rather the heart behind it. He emphasizes that the altar, temple, and gifts hold great significance, and by swearing by them, one is invoking the sacredness and holiness associated with them. Ultimately, any oath made by invoking a created thing is an implicit appeal to God, highlighting the accountability and seriousness of one's words in His presence.
