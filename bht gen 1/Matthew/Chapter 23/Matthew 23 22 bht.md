# Matthew 23:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we are reminded that heaven is the glorious throne of God, where He dwells and reveals His majesty. Swearing by anything that has a connection to God is essentially swearing by God Himself, and so it should be regarded as binding. The essence of an oath lies in sincerely calling upon God as a witness to our truthfulness. This passage not only addresses the act of swearing but also emphasizes the importance of truthfulness, condemning any false distinctions and deceitfulness.
