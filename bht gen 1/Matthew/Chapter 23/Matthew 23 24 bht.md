This serves as a warning against blindly following those who do not practice what they preach, highlighting the importance of true righteousness over mere outward appearances.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Ye blind guides, which strain out." - The stricter Jews would strain their drinks through linen or gauze to avoid accidentally consuming any unclean insects, as prescribed in Leviticus. This custom is referenced by Jesus in this verse. 

2. "Just as the Buddhists do now in Ceylon and Hindustan." - The practice of straining drinks to remove impurities is not unique to the Jews, as it is also observed by Buddhists in certain regions. 

3. "Swallow a camel." - In contrast to straining out the smallest impurity, Jesus highlights the hypocrisy of the religious leaders by pointing out that they are willing to overlook much larger transgressions, symbolized by swallowing a camel, the largest unclean animal known to the Jews.

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Strain at is an old misprint perpetuated. Hence the Rev. correctly, as Tynd., strain out."
2. "Insects were ceremonially unclean, so that the Jews strained their wine in order not to swallow any unclean animal."
3. "Moreover, there were certain insects which bred in wine. Aristotle uses the word gnat of a worm or larva found in the sediment of sour wine."
4. "The rendering is feeble. It is drink down; gulp. Note that the camel was also unclean."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Strain out the gnat, i.e., to filter wine, so as to avoid swallowing a gnat." 
2. "The saying is proverbial; this straining actually took place to avoid defilement." 
3. "And swallow the camel, i.e., indulge in the greatest impurities."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Strain out the gnat" - By filtering through, not the "straining at" in swallowing so crudely suggested by the misprint in the A.V. (Authorized Version).
2. "Swallow the camel" - Gulping or drinking down the camel. An oriental hyperbole like that in Matthew 19:24.
3. Both insects and camels were ceremonially unclean (Leviticus 11:4; Leviticus 11:20; Leviticus 11:23; Leviticus 11:42).

### John Gill:
1. "To strain at a gnat, and swallow a camel, became at length a proverb, to signify much solicitude about little things, and none about greater."
2. "These men would not, on any consideration, be guilty of such a crime, as not to pay the tithe of mint, anise, and cummin, and such like herbs and seeds; and yet made no conscience of doing justice, and showing mercy to men, or of exercising faith in God, or love to him."
3. "Just as many hypocrites, like them, make a great stir, and would appear very conscientious and scrupulous, about some little trifling things, and yet stick not, at other times, to commit the grossest enormities, and most scandalous sins in life."

### John Wesley:
1. "Ye blind guides, who teach others to do as you do yourselves" - This quote highlights the hypocrisy of the religious leaders, emphasizing that they are blind to their own faults while instructing others. It exposes the danger of following those who do not practice what they preach.

2. "To strain out a gnat - From the liquor they are going to drink!" - This quote illustrates the absurdity of the religious leaders' actions. It emphasizes their meticulousness in filtering out the smallest impurities, while ignoring the greater moral issues at hand.

3. "Swallow a camel" - This phrase captures the irony of the situation, contrasting the leaders' attention to minor details with their willingness to overlook major transgressions. It serves as a powerful metaphor for their hypocrisy and lack of true righteousness.
