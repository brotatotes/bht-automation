## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Within they are full of extortion" - This phrase highlights the hypocrisy of the religious leaders. While they appear righteous on the outside, internally they are filled with greed and dishonesty, exploiting others for their own gain.

2. "The same word is rendered 'ravening'" - This alternative translation emphasizes the aggressive and predatory nature of the religious leaders. They are not only guilty of extortion, but also of preying on the vulnerable and taking advantage of them.

3. "That is, 'rapacity'" - This word choice further emphasizes the insatiable greed of the religious leaders. They have an unquenchable desire for wealth and power, showing no regard for the well-being of others. Their actions are driven by a relentless pursuit of personal gain.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Ye cleanse the outside of the cup and of the dish." - The commentary highlights how the Pharisees were focused on maintaining a superficial appearance of purity, rather than addressing the true state of their hearts and actions.

2. "They would give a formal legal purity to sinful gratification." - This quote emphasizes how the Pharisees would use religious rituals and practices to justify their indulgence in sinful behaviors, rather than seeking true righteousness.

3. "Men often fancy themselves religious, because they conform to some standard of outward morality." - The commentary points out the danger of relying solely on external acts of righteousness, without addressing the inner motivations and attitudes that drive one's actions.

### John Gill:
1. "For ye make clean the outside of the cup and platter, but within they are full of extortion and excess." - This verse highlights the hypocrisy of the Scribes and Pharisees, who focused on outward cleanliness but neglected their inward purity.

2. "Christ's sense is that they took much pains, and were very careful, that the cup they drank out of, and the platter, or dish they ate out of, should be very clean; when at the same time, the food and drink that were within them were got by oppression and rapine." - The commentary explains that the Scribes and Pharisees were more concerned with external appearances than with their actions and the harm they caused to others.

3. "They are outwardly washed with the water of fraud and craftiness; but whatsoever is within, in the midst of them, is unclean." - This quote emphasizes the contrast between the outward show of purity and the hidden corruption within the hearts of the hypocrites.

Overall, the commentary exposes the hypocrisy of the Scribes and Pharisees, who focused on external rituals and appearances while neglecting justice, compassion, and true inner purity.

### John Wesley:
1. "These miserable men procured unjustly what they used intemperately."
2. "Luxury punishes fraud while it feeds disease with the fruits of injustice."
3. "Intemperance in the full sense takes in not only all kinds of outward intemperance, particularly in eating and drinking, but all intemperate or immoderate desires, whether of honour, gain, or sensual pleasure."
