# Matthew 23:25 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
I apologize for the oversight. Here is the requested description for the Bible verse:

Based on the commentaries provided, the Bible verse exposes the hypocrisy of religious leaders who focus on external appearances and rituals while neglecting their true character and actions. They are likened to cups and dishes that are meticulously cleaned on the outside but remain full of extortion, fraud, and excess within. The commentators emphasize that true cleanliness and righteousness should begin from within, as external acts of piety are insufficient without authentic transformation of the heart.
