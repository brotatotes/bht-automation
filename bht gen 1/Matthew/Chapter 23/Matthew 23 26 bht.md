# Matthew 23:26 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse being described reminds us of the importance of genuine inner transformation and integrity, rather than superficial displays of righteousness. The commentators highlight how the external actions should be a reflection of the inward purity. They emphasize the need to cleanse the heart first, as outward morality without inner purity is hollow. Ultimately, the verse exposes the hypocrisy of those who perform outward acts of devotion but fail to truly live according to the teachings they claim to follow.

2. "And that is all" - This phrase emphasizes the limited extent of their actions. The religious leaders' efforts are merely external displays, lacking any genuine commitment to the prophets' message.

3. "Ye neither observe their sayings, nor imitate their actions" - This statement reveals the hypocrisy of the religious leaders. Despite their outward show of reverence, they do not truly listen to or follow the teachings of the prophets, nor do they embody their righteous actions.
