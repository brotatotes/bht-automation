# Matthew 23:27 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This verse describes the hypocrisy of certain individuals, comparing them to whitened sepulchres or graves. Despite their outward appearance of beauty and influence, they are filled with corruption and deadness within. Their actions and character contradict their public image, as they conceal their inner decay behind a facade of righteousness and respectability. The metaphor exposes the shallowness of their piety and serves as a reminder to value genuine purity over superficial appearances.

3. "Their outward conduct appeared well, but their hearts were full of hypocrisy, envy, pride, lust, and malice - suitably represented by the corruption within a whited tomb."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Whited sepulchres [ταφοις κεκονιαμενοις] . Not the rock - tombs, belonging mostly to the rich, but the graves covered with plastered structures."

2. "For ye are like unto whited sepulchres; or 'covered with lime', as the Syriac, Arabic, and Persic versions, render it. For the Jews used to mark their graves with white lime, that they might be known: that so priests, Nazarites, and travellers, might avoid them, and not be polluted with them."
3. "Which indeed appear beautiful outward; especially at a distance, and when new marked: but within are full of dead men's bones, and of all uncleanness; worms and rottenness, which arise from the putrefied carcasses, and are very nauseous and defiling."
