# Matthew 23:28 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Within the verses described, commentators acknowledge the striking dichotomy between the external façade of righteousness and the true, corrupted nature underneath. They paint a vivid picture of a heart that is not a sanctuary for the living God but rather a pit of corruption and hypocrisy. The religious practices exhibited are superficial, mere whitewashing that fails to penetrate the depths of their inner selves, which are tainted with wickedness and a rebellious disposition towards God's law. The descriptions urge readers to look beyond appearances and seek authenticity in their faith.
