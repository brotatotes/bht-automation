# Matthew 23:28 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we are confronted with a powerful portrayal of the human condition. As Schaff's commentator states, our hearts can often be seen as graves of pestilent corruption, devoid of the living God and steeped in opposition to His law. Additionally, our outward displays of righteousness can be mere superficial adornments, not truly reflecting the depths of our hearts. It is a stark reminder of the need for genuine transformation and alignment with God's will beyond mere appearances.
