# Matthew 23:29 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse being described portrays religious leaders who outwardly venerate the prophets by building grand tombs for them, yet inwardly reject their message and even plot to kill the greatest Prophet of all. These tombs, located near the Mount of Olives, serve as a reminder of the hypocrisy of these leaders. Their actions demonstrate a pattern of honoring the dead while persecuting the living messengers of God, revealing their insincere and deceitful nature. Jesus addresses not only the Pharisees but the entire Jewish nation in this reproachful warning.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Albert Barnes:
1. "Ye build the tombs of the prophets...This they did professedly from veneration and respect for their character."
2. "By doing this, they profess respect for his character and veneration for his memory."
3. "The original word means, also, to show any proper honor to the memory of the dead, as by speaking well of them, praying near them, or rearing synagogues near them in honor of their memory."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Tombs of the prophets. By this name are called four monuments at the base of the Mount of Olives, in the valley of Jehosaphat; called at present the tombs of Zechariah, Absalom, Jehosaphat, and St. James."
2. "They appear...to be quite extensive, consisting of winding or semicircular galleries, passing under the mountain more than a hundred feet from east to west, and terminating in a rotunda about eighty feet from the entrance."
3. "The reference would be all the more telling, if, as has been conjectured, the Pharisees were engaged in constructing the tombs of Zechariah and Absalom at the time that the Lord addressed them."

### John Calvin:
1. "The scribes endeavored to gain the favor of the ignorant multitude, and indeed of all the Jews, by this additional hypocrisy, that they cherished with reverence the memory of the prophets; for while in this manner they pretended to maintain their doctrine, any one would have supposed that they were faithful imitators of them, and very keen zealots for the worship of God."
2. "It is customary, indeed, with hypocrites thus to honor, after their death, good teachers and holy ministers of God, whom they cannot endure while they are alive. Nor does this arise merely from the common fault, which Horace thus describes: 'We hate virtue while it is in safety, but when it has been removed from our eyes, we seek it with envy;' but as the ashes of the dead no longer give annoyance by harsh and severe reproofs, they who are driven to madness by the living voices of those men are not unwilling, by adoring them, to make an empty display of religion."
3. "Our Lord, perceiving that the scribes and priests of his age were eager to obtain the applause of the people, on the ground of their being devout worshippers of the prophets, reproves them for deceit and mockery, because they not only reject, but even cruelly persecute, the prophets that are now present, and whom God has sent to them. But it is a display of base hypocrisy, and shameful impudence, to desire to be thought religious on account of worshipping the dead, while they endeavor to murder the living."

### Philip Schaff:

### Archibald T Robertson:

3. "But because they did all this, that they might be thought to be very innocent and holy men, and far from being guilty of the crimes their forefathers were; when they were of the very selfsame blood thirsty, persecuting spirit; and did, and would do the same things to the prophets and apostles of the New Testament, their fathers had done to the prophets of the Old."
