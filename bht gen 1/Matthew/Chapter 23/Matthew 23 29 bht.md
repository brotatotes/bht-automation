# Matthew 23:29 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, religious leaders are condemned for superficially honoring the prophets by building sepulchres. These monuments, which may have been grand and ornamental, were constructed to show respect and veneration for the renowned individuals buried within them. However, it is suggested that the actual burial places of the prophets may have been neglected or forgotten, despite the outward display of respect. The location of these tombs, believed to be near the Mount of Olives on the road from Jerusalem to Bethany, adds a tangible aspect to the discussion.
