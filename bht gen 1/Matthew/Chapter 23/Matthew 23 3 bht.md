### Henry Alford:
1. "The οὖν here is very significant: because they sit on Moses’ seat: and this clears the meaning, and shews it to be, ‘all things which they, as successors of Moses, out of his law, command you to observe, do;’"
2. "there being a distinction between their lawful teaching as expounders of the law, and their frivolous traditions superadded thereto, and blamed below."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "All, therefore, whatsoever ... - That is, all that they teach that is consistent with the Law of Moses - all the commands of Moses which they read to you and properly explain."
2. "The word 'all' could not be taken without such a restriction, for Christ himself accuses them of teaching many things contrary to that law, and of making it void by their traditions, Matthew 15:1-6."
