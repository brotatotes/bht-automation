# Matthew 23:31 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse being described is one in which the audience is confronted with their own guilt by acknowledging the sins of their ancestors. Their conscience serves as a witness to their own wrongdoing. While they may have intended to highlight their connection to their ancestors and their spirit, in doing so, they inadvertently expose their own hypocrisy. Their actions and words align with the same immoral characteristics and principles of their forefathers, implicating them in the guilt of their ancestors.
