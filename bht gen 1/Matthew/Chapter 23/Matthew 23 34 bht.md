# Matthew 23:34 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the speaker is about to send messengers with supernatural credentials, both wise and learned individuals, to test whether the hardened ones will show respect to them. The choice of these messengers reflects the veneration the Jews claimed for the ancient prophets, as these messengers would not be inferior but even surpass them. It serves as a reminder that the multiplication of privileges and the rejection of previous messengers hasten impending doom for those who persist in their hardened ways.
