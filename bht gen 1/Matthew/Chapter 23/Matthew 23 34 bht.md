# Matthew 23:34 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, messengers of God are foretold to be rejected and persecuted by those who claim to honor the teachings of the prophets. The rejection of these messengers will be a continuation of the iniquities of their ancestors. These messengers, sent by Christ Himself, will include prophets, wise men, and scribes, and their rejection will fill up the cup of iniquity for the stubborn and obstinate. This pattern of rejecting divine messengers has been witnessed throughout history, and their defiance ultimately brings forth condemnation.
