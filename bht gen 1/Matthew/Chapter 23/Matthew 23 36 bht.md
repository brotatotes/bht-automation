# Matthew 23:36 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Upon this generation, the sins of Israel accumulated until they reached their fullness, awaiting the divine retribution that would descend upon them in the destruction of Jerusalem. This impending judgment, emphasizing the immediacy and certainty of divine consequences, serves as a solemn warning for all generations. As the chosen nation turned away from God, rejecting His messengers, the guilt and punishment due to them would culminate in the devastating calamities spoken by Christ. The gravity of their actions necessitated repentance before it was too late.
