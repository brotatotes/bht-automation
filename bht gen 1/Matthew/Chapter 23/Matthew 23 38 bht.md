# Matthew 23:38 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Bible verse speaks of the temple in Jerusalem being abandoned by God and left in the hands of the people. The temple, once the house of God, would soon become a spiritual ruin followed by its physical destruction. This abandonment would signify the coming desolation of the city itself. As Jesus left the temple for the last time, he prophesied its fate, pronouncing it as desolate and forsaken by God and Christ.
