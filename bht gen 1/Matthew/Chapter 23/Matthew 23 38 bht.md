# Matthew 23:38 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The commentators describe a powerful warning given by Jesus about the temple and its impending destruction. They emphasize that the temple, once the house of God, is now deserted for its rejection of Him. Jesus declares that the city and the temple will become desolate, abandoned by God and doomed to ruin. This prophecy serves as a sign of God's judgment and the consequences of their actions. Ultimately, it demonstrates the consequence of forsaking God's presence and disregarding His warnings.
