### Albert Barnes:
1. "The Pharisees appointed weighty burdens, or grievous and heavy precepts, and insisted that the people should obey them, though they lent no assistance."
2. "The 'heavy burdens' refer not here to the traditions and foolish customs of the Pharisees, but they clearly mean the ceremonies and rights appointed by Moses."
3. "The Pharisees were rigid in requiring that all the people should pay the taxes, give of their property, comply with every part of the law with the utmost rigor, yet they indulged themselves and bore as little of the expense and trouble as possible."

### John Calvin:
1. "Christ reproves the stern and rigid manner of teaching which was usually followed by those proud hypocrites, who authoritatively demand from others what they owe to God, and are rigorous in enforcing duties, and yet indolently dispense with the performance of what they so strictly enjoin on others, and allow themselves to do whatever they please."

2. "For those who truly fear God, though they sincerely and earnestly endeavor to bring their disciples to obey Him, yet as they are more severe towards themselves than towards others, they are not so rigid in exacting obedience, and, being conscious of their own weakness, kindly forgive the weak."

3. "It is impossible to imagine anything that can exceed the insolence in commanding, or the cruelty, of stupid despisers of God, because they give themselves no concern about the difficulty of doing those things from which they relieve themselves; and therefore no man will exercise moderation in commanding others unless he shall first become his own teacher."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "They so presented the correct law as to make its precepts heavy burdens, like loads, packs on beasts of burden."
2. "The reference is not simply to the traditions they added, but also to the mode of presenting the law itself, as demanding a servile obedience in minute details irrespective of the spirit of the commandment."
3. "Imposing such burdens, they did not in the least lighten them by spiritual precept or example."

2. "The binding of these heavy things means the imposing them on men, obliging them to observe them very strictly, under great penalties, should they omit them."
3. "They were so slothful and indolent themselves, that though they strictly enjoined the observance of their numerous and unwritten traditions on the people, yet in many cases, where they could without public notice, they neglected them themselves, or at least, made them lighter and easier to them."

### John Wesley:
1. "This verse highlights the hypocrisy of the religious leaders who burdened the people with heavy rules and regulations, while they themselves did not practice what they preached."
2. "Jesus is exposing the self-righteousness and lack of compassion in the hearts of the Pharisees, who were more concerned with outward appearances and maintaining their own power and status."
3. "By pointing out the hypocrisy of the religious leaders, Jesus is calling for a genuine transformation of the heart, emphasizing the importance of practicing what one preaches and living a life of integrity."
