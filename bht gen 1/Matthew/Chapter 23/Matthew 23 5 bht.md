# Matthew 23:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse being described highlights the hypocritical actions of the scribes and Pharisees. They perform good deeds and display their devotion, not out of genuine piety, but for the purpose of gaining human praise. These individuals make a show of their religious practices by wearing phylacteries - small scrolls with Scripture verses - on their foreheads and arms, and by enlarging the fringes of their garments. However, their motivations are rooted in pride and self-righteousness rather than true reverence for God's commandments. Their external displays serve as mere acts of ostentation, disguising their inward hypocrisy.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Whatever good they do, or zeal they show, has but one motive - human applause."
2. "They make broad their phylacteries - strips of parchment with Scripture-texts on them, worn on the forehead, arm, and side, in time of prayer."
3. "And enlarge the borders of their garments - fringes of their upper garments."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The word 'phylactery' comes from a word signifying to keep, preserve, or guard."
2. "The practice of using phylacteries was founded on a literal interpretation of that passage where God commands the Hebrews to have the law as a sign on their foreheads, and as frontlets between their eyes."
3. "The Pharisees enlarged them, or made them wider than other people, either that they might make the letters larger or write more on them, to show, as they supposed, that they had special reverence for the law."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The scribes and Pharisees deport themselves with a view to being contemplated as actors in a theatre; so that men may fix their gaze upon them admiringly."
2. "The phylacteries, called by the Rabbis tephillin, prayer-fillets, were worn on the left arm, toward the heart, and on the forehead."
3. "They were reverenced by the Rabbis as highly as the scriptures, and, like them, might be rescued from the flames on a Sabbath."

### John Calvin:
1. "He had lately said that the scribes live very differently from what they teach; but now he adds that, if they have anything which is apparently good, it is hypocritical and worthless, because they have no other design than to please men, and to vaunt themselves."
2. "Thus not only is the ambition of the scribes and Pharisees reproved, but our Lord, after having condemned the transgression and contempt of the Law of God in their whole life, that they might not shield themselves by their pretended holiness, anticipates them by replying, that those things of which they boast are absolute trifles, and of no value whatever, because they spring from mere ostentation."
3. "But so far were they from profiting by these simple instructions, that, by making perfect righteousness to consist in the adorning of robes, they despised the Law throughout their whole life. For it was impossible to treat the Law of God with greater contempt, than when they imagined that they kept it by pompous dress, or pronounced masks contrived for enacting a play to be a keeping of the Law."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Self-righteousness rests on pride, and, inevitably becoming exhibitional, betrays its origin."
2. "The Pharisees, as sticklers for the rigid observance of the law, made these fringes larger than others."
3. "But the Pharisees, however significant their ritualism, murdered Him to whom it pointed."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Ostentation regulates the conduct of the rabbis." 
2. "They took literally the words about 'a sign unto thy hand,' 'a memorial between thine eyes,' and 'frontlets.'"
3. "The superstitious would wear them as mere charms to ward off evil."

### John Gill:
1. "All their works they do for to be seen of men... they sought neither the glory of God, nor the good of their fellow creatures, nor any spiritual advantage and pleasure to themselves, in their performances." 
2. "They make broad their phylacteries... they understood them literally, and observed them in the above manner. These the Jews call 'Tephillin', because they use them in time of prayer, and look upon them as useful, to put them in mind of that duty."
3. "Enlarge the borders of their garments... The observance of this law is of so much consequence with the Jews, that they make all the commandments to depend on it and say, that it is equal to them all."

### John Wesley:
1. "The Jews, understanding those words literally, It shall he as a token upon thy hand, and as frontlets between thine eyes... used to wear little scrolls of paper or parchment, bound on their wrist and foreheads, on which several texts of Scripture were writ." 

2. "These they supposed, as a kind of charm, would preserve them from danger. And hence they seem to have been called phylacteries, or preservatives."

3. "The fringes of their garments... God had enjoined them to wear, to remind them of doing all the commandments... The Pharisees affected to wear broader and larger than other men."

These quotes provide insights into the literal practices of the Jews and the Pharisees, shedding light on the significance of phylacteries and fringes in their religious observance.
