# Matthew 23:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the verse being described, the commentators shed light on the actions of certain religious leaders. They highlight the hypocritical nature of their motives, emphasizing their desire for human recognition rather than genuine devotion. These leaders engage in outward displays of holiness, such as wearing broad phylacteries and enlarging the borders of their garments, but these actions are deemed insignificant and even deceptive. While their rituals may seem significant, they ultimately fail to embody true righteousness and tragically contribute to the rejection and murder of the One to whom these practices pointed.

2. "Thus not only is the ambition of the scribes and Pharisees reproved, but our Lord, after having condemned the transgression and contempt of the Law of God in their whole life, that they might not shield themselves by their pretended holiness, anticipates them by replying, that those things of which they boast are absolute trifles, and of no value whatever, because they spring from mere ostentation."
3. "Let us also learn from this, how ingenious men are in mixing up vain deception, in order to conceal their vices under some pretext and cloak of virtues, by turning to the purposes of their own hypocrisy those exercises of piety which God has enjoined."

### John Wesley:
1. "The Jews, understanding those words literally, It shall he as a token upon thy hand, and as frontlets between thine eyes, Exodus 13:16.
