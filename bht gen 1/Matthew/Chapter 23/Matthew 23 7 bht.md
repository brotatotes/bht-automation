# Matthew 23:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the focus is not just on the literal usage of titles but on the underlying spiritual significance. The disciples, by addressing Jesus as "Rabbi," recognize his authority and position as a teacher. The use of such titles, like "Rabbi," had become a source of spiritual pride and desire for recognition among the religious leaders. The verse emphasizes the distinction between the outward show of respect and the true humility and willingness to learn from Jesus, which the disciples exemplify by acknowledging him as their teacher.
