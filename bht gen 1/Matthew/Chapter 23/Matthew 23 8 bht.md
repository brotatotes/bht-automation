## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The title 'Rabbi' was a term of respect and honor given to Jewish teachers and scholars. Jesus warns against seeking titles and positions of authority for the sake of personal glory. He emphasizes the importance of humility and recognizing God as the ultimate source of wisdom and guidance." 

2. "By calling God their 'Master,' Jesus reminds his disciples that they are not the ultimate authority in matters of faith and knowledge. They are to submit themselves to God's teachings and rely on Him as their true guide."

3. "Jesus encourages his followers to prioritize the pursuit of knowledge and understanding over the desire for recognition and status. The focus should be on learning and growing in wisdom, rather than seeking titles and positions that elevate oneself above others."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "They were on a level; they were to be equal in authority; they were brethren; and they should neither covet nor receive a title which implied either an elevation of one above another."
2. "Everything which would tend to make a distinction among them or destroy their parity - everything which would lead the world to suppose that there were ranks and grades among them as ministers, they were to avoid."
3. "This title corresponds with the title 'Doctor of Divinity' as applied to ministers of the gospel; and, so far as I can see, the spirit of the Saviour’s command is violated by the reception of such a title, as really as it would have been by their being called 'Rabbi'."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "But this prohibition includes all the manifestations of religious pride spoken of, since it prohibits the pride itself."

2. "For one is your master, even Christ; meaning himself, the true Messiah, the head of the church, King of saints, and Lord of all."
3. "And all ye are brethren; not merely as the descendants of Adam, but as being in a spiritual relation, the children of God, and disciples of Christ, and so have no superiority one over another."
