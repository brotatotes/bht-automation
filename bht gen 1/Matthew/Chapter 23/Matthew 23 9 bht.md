## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "To construe these injunctions into a condemnation of every title by which Church rulers may be distinguished from the flock which they rule, is virtually to condemn that rule itself and accordingly the same persons do both." 

2. "But when we have guarded ourselves against these extremes, let us see to it that we retain the full spirit of this warning against that itch for ecclesiastical superiority which has been the bane and the scandal of Christ's ministers in every age."

3. "The warning against calling no man father upon the earth is not a prohibition against using the term in its natural and proper sense, but rather a caution against the abuse of titles and positions of authority within the Church."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Religion requires all proper honor to be shown to Him."
2. "The word 'father' also denotes 'authority, eminence, superiority, a right to command, and a claim to particular respect.'"
3. "Christian brethren are equal. Only God has supreme authority."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The use of the term 'Father' in this verse is significant, as it refers to those who sought to be called 'Abba' or 'Father.' This highlights the intimate relationship between God and His children, emphasizing the closeness and love that exists between them."

2. "The comparison to the title 'Papa' or 'Pope' helps us understand the weight and authority associated with the term 'Father.' Just as the Pope is seen as the spiritual father and leader of the Catholic Church, God is the ultimate Father, deserving of our reverence and respect."

3. "By addressing God as 'Father,' we acknowledge His role as the source of our existence and the one who cares for us like a loving parent. This term reminds us of the unconditional love, guidance, and protection that God provides to His children."

### John Calvin:
1. "He claims for God alone the honor of Father, in nearly the same sense as he lately asserted that he himself is the only Master; for this name was not assumed by men for themselves, but was given to them by God."
2. "Nor is there any importance in the distinction which some have brought forward, that men, by whom children have been begotten, are fathers according to the flesh, but that God alone is the Father of spirits."
3. "The true meaning therefore is, that the honor of a father is falsely ascribed to men, when it obscures the glory of God."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "A natural father is not meant. Nor are titles of respect to the aged forbidden."
2. "It rather forbids honoring any one as an absolute spiritual authority, because this opposes the authority of our Father in heaven."
3. "Compare the Papal usage in all its forms of priesthood from the one Father (Papa) claiming infallibility, to the parish priest, or 'Father,' claiming infallibility derived from that source."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Jesus meant the full sense of this noble word for our heavenly Father."
2. "Certainly the ascription of 'Father' to pope and priest seems out of harmony with what Jesus here says."
3. "He should not be understood to be condemning the title to one's real earthly father."

### John Gill:
1. "Our Lord does not mean, by any of these expressions, to set aside all names and titles, of natural and civil distinction among men, but only to reject all such names and titles, as are used to signify an authoritative power over men's consciences, in matters of faith and obedience."
2. "Christ's sense is, that he would have his disciples not fond of any titles of honour at all; and much less assume an authority over men, as if they were to depend on them, as the founders of the Christian religion, the authors of its doctrines and ordinances."
3. "One is your Father, which is in heaven; who is so, both by creation and adoption, and is possessed of all paternal authority; and is to be honoured and obeyed by all; from whom all wisdom and knowledge is derived, and who has the care and government of all in heaven and in earth."
