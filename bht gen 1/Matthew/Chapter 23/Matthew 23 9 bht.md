# Matthew 23:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, there is a caution against the abuse of power and authority within the Church. It warns against the tendency of church leaders to seek superiority and claim spiritual authority as their own. The verse emphasizes that only God deserves the title of Father, ascribing it to men only obscures His glory. It does not forbid using respectful titles for elders or acknowledging the role of a natural father. Rather, it serves as a reminder to not elevate any individual as an absolute spiritual authority, which would undermine the authority of our heavenly Father.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "To construe these injunctions into a condemnation of every title by which Church rulers may be distinguished from the flock which they rule, is virtually to condemn that rule itself and accordingly the same persons do both." 
2. "But when we have guarded ourselves against these extremes, let us see to it that we retain the full spirit of this warning against that itch for ecclesiastical superiority which has been the bane and the scandal of Christ's ministers in every age."
3. "The warning against calling no man father upon the earth is not a prohibition against using the term in its ordinary sense, but a caution against the abuse of it, as a title of spiritual authority, in the Church."

### John Calvin:
1. "He claims for God alone the honor of Father, in nearly the same sense as he lately asserted that he himself is the only Master; for this name was not assumed by men for themselves, but was given to them by God."
2. "Nor is there any importance in the distinction which some have brought forward, that men, by whom children have been begotten, are fathers according to the flesh, but that God alone is the Father of spirits."
3. "The true meaning therefore is, that the honor of a father is falsely ascribed to men, when it obscures the glory of God."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "A natural father is not meant. Nor are titles of respect to the aged forbidden." 
2. "It rather forbids honoring any one as an absolute spiritual authority, because this opposes the authority of our Father in heaven." 
3. "Compare the Papal usage in all its forms of priesthood from the one Father (Papa) claiming infallibility, to the parish priest, or 'Father,' claiming infallibility derived from that source."
