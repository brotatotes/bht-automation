# Matthew 24:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the commentator John Calvin emphasizes the idea of a new and magnificent temple being erected, fulfilling the prophecies. He also notes the hesitations and doubts of those who questioned Christ's ability to reign and the need to remove the "mass of stones" obstructing his rule. Philip Schaff adds to this understanding by describing how Jesus never returned to the Jewish part of the temple, leaving it desolate. He also highlights the significance of the buildings and stones within the temple complex.

### John Calvin:
1. "It remained, therefore, that he should erect a new temple far more magnificent, and that he should produce a more flourishing condition of the kingdom, as had been foretold by the Prophets."
2. "They do not, indeed, in express terms acknowledge their hesitation, but they tacitly throw out a suggestion of it when they allege, in opposition to Christ, the mass of stones which must be got out of the way, and which must indeed be utterly laid low if he intended to reign."
3. "Many simple persons of our own day are carried away by a similar admiration of Popery; for, perceiving it to be supported by very great wealth and by immense power, they are filled with absolute amazement, so as to despise a Church of mean and slovenly aspect."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "From the temple, i.e.., the exclusively Jewish part, inclosed from the court of the Gentiles. He never returned, and henceforth the temple was virtually desolate."
