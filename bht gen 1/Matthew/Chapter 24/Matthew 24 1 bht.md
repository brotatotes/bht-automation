# Matthew 24:1 Commentary Help Text

As Jesus departed from the temple, he left behind a desolate and tragic scene, never to return. The disciples, observing the grandeur and strength of the temple buildings, expressed their disbelief that such a magnificent structure could be destroyed. The massive stones and beautiful craftsmanship of the temple left even the conqueror Titus astonished. However, this destruction was a fulfillment of Jesus' prophetic words, signaling the end of an era and paving the way for a new and more magnificent kingdom.
