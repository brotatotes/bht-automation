# Matthew 24:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the face of various temptations and persecutions, some may stumble and fall away from the faith, stumbling at the cross and becoming treacherous to true believers. These apostates, filled with hatred, can become fierce enemies and persecutors. However, in the midst of false prophets and iniquity, we are encouraged to hold fast to faith, love one another, and have hope until the end, for those who do so will be saved from the impending destruction. Let us be mindful not to lose our first love for God.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### John Calvin:
1. "He now enumerates the temptations which will arise from bad examples."
2. "Christ is to many a stone of offense, on which some dash themselves, or by meeting which some are thrown back, and others fall away."
3. "In this expression Christ appears to me to include many kinds of troubles; for not only do they that had entered into the right course fall away, but many are exasperated against Christ; others, forgetful of moderation and justice, break out into rage; others grow profane, and lose every feeling of piety; and others, amidst the confusion which prevails, take upon themselves a liberty to commit crimes."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Then shall many be offended, or 'fall away.' The fulfilment will culminate in the last days."
2. "Deliver up one another, i.e., to tribunals, to heathen magistrates, as was the case in Apostolic times."
3. "Hate one another. Whenever apostasy occurs, this recurs, since this is the opposite of Christian love."

### John Gill:
1. "When they saw the apostles, some of them beaten, and imprisoned; others put to death, and others forced to fly from place to place; and persecutions and affliction, because of Christ and his Gospel, likely to befall themselves, would be discouraged hereby, and stumble at the cross; and fall off from the faith of the Gospel, and the profession of it."
2. "The apostates, who would fall off from the Christian religion, would prove treacherous to true believers, and give in their names to the persecutors, or inform them where they were, that they might take them, or deliver them into their hands themselves."
3. "These apostates should hate them, in whose communion they before were, and to whom they belonged; and even to a very great degree of hatred, as it often is seen, that such who turn their backs on Christ, and his Gospel, prove the most bitter enemies, and most violent persecutors of its preachers and followers."

### John Wesley:
1. "But hold ye fast faith, in spite of false prophets."
2. "Love, even when iniquity and offences abound."
3. "And hope, unto the end. He that does so, shall be snatched out of the burning."
4. "The generality of those who love God will leave their first love."
