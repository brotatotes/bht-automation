# Matthew 24:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, Christians are warned about the challenges they will face in the last days. Many who professed to follow Christ will fall away and betray their fellow believers out of self-interest. These apostates will harbor a deep hatred towards the faithful, becoming bitter enemies and persecutors. However, true believers are encouraged to hold fast to their faith, to continue to love even in the face of evil, and to maintain hope until the very end.

3. "In this expression Christ appears to me to include many kinds of troubles; for not only do they that had entered into the right course fall away, but many are exasperated against Christ; others, forgetful of moderation and justice, break out into rage; others grow profane, and lose every feeling of piety; and others, amidst the confusion which prevails, take upon themselves a liberty to commit crimes."
