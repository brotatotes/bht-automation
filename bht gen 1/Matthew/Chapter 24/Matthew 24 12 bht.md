# Matthew 24:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In a time when heathen licentiousness infiltrated the profession of Christianity, the ardor of love among believers was fading. The wickedness of the world caused a chilling effect on the spirit and energy of believers, leading to a decrease in the desire to do good. While this affected the majority, there were still some whose love and zeal remained steadfast despite the surrounding iniquity and the treachery of false teachers.
