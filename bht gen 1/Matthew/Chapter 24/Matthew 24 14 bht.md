# Matthew 24:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Gospel had spread throughout the entire world, serving as a witness to all nations and offering them the opportunity to accept or reject Christ's message. It was through this universal preaching of the Gospel that the destruction of Jerusalem would be foretold. Despite not being universally preached, the Gospel had already reached various parts of the world prior to its fall. The account of Josephus, an eyewitness and Jew, further illustrates the fulfillment of this prophecy in remarkable detail.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The Gospel had been preached through the whole 'orbis terrarum,' and every nation had received its testimony, before the destruction of Jerusalem."
2. "This was necessary not only as regarded the Gentiles, but to give to God's people the Jews, who were scattered among all these nations, the opportunity of receiving or rejecting the preaching of Christ."
3. "The apostasy of the latter days, and the universal dispersion of missions, are the two great signs of the end drawing near."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The preaching of the gospel throughout the Roman world preceded the end of the Jewish state; the promulgation of the gospel throughout the whole world will be the sign of the end of this world."
2. "To them, if they accept; against them, if they reject it. It is not revealed here, which result will preponderate."
3. "The universal extension of missions, no less than the great apostasy, is a sign of the approach of our Redeemer."

### John Gill:
1. "And this Gospel of the kingdom... gives the best account of the glories of it." 
2. "Shall be preached in all the world... for a witness unto all nations." 
3. "The universal preaching of the Gospel all over the world, was the last criterion and sign, of the destruction of Jerusalem."

### John Wesley:
1. "This Gospel shall be preached in all the world" - Not universally: this is not done yet: but in general through the several parts of the world, and not only in Judea.
2. "And this was done by St. Paul and the other apostles, before Jerusalem was destroyed."
3. "Josephus's History of the Jewish War is the best commentary on this chapter. It is a wonderful instance of God's providence, that he, an eyewitness, and one who lived and died a Jew, should, especially in so extraordinary a manner, be preserved, to transmit to us a collection of important facts, which so exactly illustrate this glorious prophecy, in almost every circumstance."
