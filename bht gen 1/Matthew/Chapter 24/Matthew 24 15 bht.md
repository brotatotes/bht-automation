# Matthew 24:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the commentators shed light on the meaning of the "abomination of desolation." While some interpret it as the Roman army and their idolatrous images, others suggest that it represents any form of estrangement from God, including heathenism. The abomination is seen as the profanation or corruption of pure worship. The warning serves as a call for the readers to understand and consider the significance of the prophecy of Daniel. Furthermore, it reminds them not to be too attached to the temple and its ceremonies, as sacrifices would cease with the coming of the Redeemer.

### Henry Alford:
1. "Like other prophecies, it is probable that they are pregnant with several interpretations, and are not yet entirely fulfilled."
2. "The error has mainly arisen from supposing that the parallel warning of Luke is identical in meaning with our text and that of Mark."
3. "Putting then St. Luke’s expression and the text together, I think that some internal desecration of the holy place by the Zelots coincided with the approach of Cestius, and thus, both from without and within, the Christians were warned to escape."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The abomination of desolation means the Roman army, and is so explained by Luke 21:20."

2. "Such a prediction was not only well adapted for removing ground of offense, but likewise for animating the minds of the godly, that amidst the sorest calamities—knowing that God was looking upon them, and was taking care of their salvation—they might betake themselves to the sacred anchor, where, amidst the most dreadful heavings of the billows, their condition would be firm and secure."
