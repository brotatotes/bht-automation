# Matthew 24:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Amidst the approaching calamity, the verse foretells a swift and certain fulfillment, with some commentators proposing a connection to the Roman eagles, detested by the Jews and revered as idols by the soldiers.

It is a call to understanding, urging readers to carefully contemplate the profound message conveyed by the prophecy of Daniel.
