### John Gill:
1. "Hence those words of Virgil: 'Nudus ara, sere nudus, hyems ignava colono.' Upon which Servius observes, that in good weather, when the sun warms the earth, men might plough and sow without their clothes."
2. "And it is reported by the historian of Lucius Quinctius Cincinnatus, that the messengers who were sent to him found him ploughing naked beyond the Tiber: not that he was entirely naked, but was stripped of his upper garments."
3. "For our Lord's meaning is not, that the man working in the field, should not return home to fetch his clothes, which were not left there; they were brought with him into the field, but put off; and laid aside in some part of it while at work."
