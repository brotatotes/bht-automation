# Matthew 24:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, a man working in the field is depicted, having set aside his outer garments to work without encumbrance. The field symbolizes the ordinary, everyday life of the common man, where work and toil are necessary for survival. The image of leaving one's clothes at home signifies a willingness to fully engage in the work at hand, without being weighed down by distractions or unnecessary burdens. It is a reminder that in times of focused labor, one must be determined and ready to fully commit, just as the farmer in this verse.
