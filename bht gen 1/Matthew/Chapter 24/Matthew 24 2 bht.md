# Matthew 24:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the presence of Jesus on the mount of Olives, the disciples, in their bewildered state, inquire about the destruction of the temple and the signs of Jesus' coming and the end of the world. Jesus, aware of their confusion, delivers a prophecy that would leave no trace of the magnificent temple, with not a single stone left upon another. This prophecy was remarkably fulfilled by the Roman general Titus, who completely destroyed the temple, even digging up its foundations. The devastation was unprecedented, validating the startling nature of Jesus' prediction and emphasizing the gravity of the event.
