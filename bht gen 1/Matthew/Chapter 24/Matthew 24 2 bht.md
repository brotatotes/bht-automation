# Matthew 24:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In a time of peace and seemingly unlikely destruction, a magnificent work of art and sanctuary of religion was prophesied to have every stone toppled. Jesus, sitting on the Mount of Olives, foretells the precise fulfillment of the prophecy, with the temple being completely destroyed in contradiction to Titus' wishes to save it. As Jesus clarifies the distinction between the destruction of the temple and the signs of his coming and the end of the world, his words strike as shocking and unexpected, highlighting the gravity of his prophecy and the spiritual and moral decay of the religious establishment.
