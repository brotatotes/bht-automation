# Matthew 24:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the city of Jerusalem is described as being overwhelmed by a calamity of unparalleled magnitude. The Jewish Christians were able to escape this great tribulation by fleeing to Pella. The siege of the city during the Passover feast resulted in internal dissensions, scarcity of food, and unimaginable horrors. The destruction and devastation that followed the siege led to the death of a vast number of people and the enslavement or dispersal of the survivors. The significance of these events extends beyond their immediate context, pointing to a future time of great tribulation.
