## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### John Calvin:
1. "There was great danger arising from this temptation, that wretched men, while their affairs were in a troubled and desperate condition, would be deceived by false pretenses, would seek phantoms instead of Christ, and would embrace the delusions of Satan, as if they were assistance from God."
2. "When we are left without direction in adversity, nothing is more pernicious than to be deceived, under the disguise of the name of God, by falsehoods which not only shut against us the door of repentance, but increase the darkness of infidelity, and at length overwhelm us with despair, and drive us to madness."
3. "The repetition of the statement, therefore, was far from being superfluous, when the danger was so great; and especially when Christ warns them that false prophets will come prepared with no ordinary instruments of deception, with signs and wonders fitted to confound weak minds."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "During the subsequent period, is exact enough."
2. "This indicates that the disciples then expected that the second Advent would immediately follow; and was first of all a caution against impostors."
3. "Believe it (or 'him') not. This phrase furnishes no argument against the visible personal coming of Christ, which seems to be taken for granted throughout."

### John Gill:
1. "When some, that were scattered up and down in the country, would insinuate to their countrymen, that the Messiah was in such a place: saying, lo! here is Christ, or there, believe it not." 
2. "For both during the time of the siege, there were such that sprung up, and pretended to be Messiahs, and deliverers of them from the Roman power."

### John Wesley:
1. "In these verses, Jesus is warning his disciples about false messiahs and false prophets who will come and try to deceive people with signs and wonders. He wants them to be discerning and not easily swayed by these false claims."

2. "Jesus is emphasizing the importance of not being led astray by those who claim to have special knowledge or insight about the end times. He wants his followers to stay focused on him and his teachings, rather than getting caught up in speculation and fear."

3. "These verses serve as a reminder that Jesus is the ultimate authority and source of truth. We should be cautious of anyone who claims to have secret knowledge or a special revelation about the future. Our trust should be in Jesus alone, who has already revealed himself to us through his life, death, and resurrection."
