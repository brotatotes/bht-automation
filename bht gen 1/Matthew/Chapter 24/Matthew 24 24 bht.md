# Matthew 24:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the face of false Christs and prophets, who use signs and wonders to deceive and lead others astray, believers are warned to stay vigilant and discerning. These imposters may create illusions, appearing powerful and mighty, but their manipulative tactics cannot deceive the true followers of Christ. While there may be attempts to deceive even the elect, God's provision of grace and the security found in the hands of Christ ensure that His people will not be completely led astray. God, in His sovereignty, will not allow His body of believers to be easily deceived.
