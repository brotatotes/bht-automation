# Matthew 24:26 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Beware of those who claim the Messiah will suddenly appear from unexpected places like deserts or secret chambers, for they seek to deceive and lead people astray. These impostors, influenced by the misguided hopes of the time, gather followers in hidden and secluded areas to rebel against worldly authorities. Therefore, let us be cautious of their schemes and not be easily swayed by supposed special knowledge or secret interpretations concerning the return of Jesus. Instead, let us remain discerning, rooted in the teachings of Jesus, and avoid falling into the traps of enthusiasm, superstition, or fanaticism.
