# Matthew 24:28 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, the commentators emphasize the universality and inevitability of judgment. They describe Jerusalem as a fallen and corrupted body, ready to be devoured. The eagles, symbolizing God's means of certain punishment, gather together with the scent of prey, just like the vultures flock around a carcass from distant places. The commentators point to the destruction of Jerusalem by the Roman armies and the future judgment of the world, emphasizing the need for believers to unite in Christ as the head of the Church.

2. "First, at Jerusalem: where the corrupting body lies, thither shall the vultures (literally) gather themselves together, coming as they do from far on the scent of prey."

### Marvin Vincent:

### John Calvin:
1. "By whatever methods Satan endeavors to scatter the children of God in various directions, still in Christ himself is the sacred bond of union, by which they must be kept united."
2. "This ought to be carefully observed; for Christ does not restrict us either to the primacy of the Roman See, or to any other foolery, but employs this method alone for binding his Church together, that all in every quarter should look to him as the only head."
3. "Christ intended to argue from the less to the greater, that if birds have so great sagacity as to flock in great numbers from distant places to a single carcass, it would be disgraceful in believers not to assemble to the Author of life, from whom alone they derive their actual nourishment."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "We therefore apply the metaphor to the necessity, inevitableness, and universality (‘wheresoever’) of judgment."
2. "The ‘carcass’ represents moral corruption; the ‘eagles,’ God’s means of certain punishment when the time is ripe."
3. "The context points to two special occasions: 1. The destruction of Jerusalem when the Roman ‘eagles’ appeared as ministers of vengeance; 2. the last days when the cup of the world’s iniquity shall be full and God’s swift messengers of judgment (‘the angels’) shall come."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Carcase (πτωμα). As in Matthew 14:12, the corpse. Originally a fallen body from πιπτω, to fall, like Latin cadaver from cado, to fall."
2. "The proverb here as in Luke 17:37, is like that in Job 39:30; Proverbs 30:17."

### John Gill:
1. "Not Christ, as he is held forth in the Gospel, crucified and slain, through whose death is the savour of life, and by whom salvation is, and to whom sensible sinners flock, encouraged by the ministry of the word."
2. "The people of the Jews are designed by it, in their fallen, deplorable, miserable, and lifeless state, who were like to the body of a man, or any other creature, struck dead with lightning from heaven."
