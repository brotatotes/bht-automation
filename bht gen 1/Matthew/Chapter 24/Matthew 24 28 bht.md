In this Bible verse, the commentator quotes describe a fallen body or corpse, symbolizing moral corruption, and the presence of griffon vultures or Roman eagles, representing God's means of certain punishment. The verse speaks of the inevitableness and universality of judgment, applying this metaphor to the necessity of discernment.

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Carcase [Ï€Ï„Ï‰Î¼Î±] . From piptw, to fall. Originally a fall, and thence a fallen body; a corpse." 
2. "The griffon vulture is meant, which surpasses the eagle in size and power."
3. "Aristotle notes how this bird scents its prey from afar, and congregates in the wake of an army."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "We therefore apply the metaphor to the necessity, inevitableness, and universality (‘wheresoever’) of judgment."
2. "The ‘carcass’ represents moral corruption; the ‘eagles,’ God’s means of certain punishment when the time is ripe."
3. "The context points to two special occasions: 1. The destruction of Jerusalem when the Roman ‘eagles’ appeared as ministers of vengeance; 2. the last days when the cup of the world’s iniquity shall be full and God’s swift messengers of judgment (‘the angels’) shall come."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Carcase (Ï€Ï„Ï‰Î¼Î±). As in Matthew 14:12, the corpse. Originally a fallen body from Ï€Î¹Ï€Ï„Ï‰, to fall, like Latin cadaver from cado, to fall."
2. "The proverb here as in Luke 17:37, is like that in Job 39:30; Proverbs 30:17."
3. "Eagles (Î±ÎµÏ„Î¿). Perhaps the griffon vulture, larger than the eagle, which (Aristotle) was often seen in the wake of an army and followed Napoleon's retreat from Russia."

### John Gill:
1. "Not Christ, as he is held forth in the Gospel, crucified and slain, through whose death is the savour of life, and by whom salvation is, and to whom sensible sinners flock, encouraged by the ministry of the word."
2. "The people of the Jews are designed by it, in their fallen, deplorable, miserable, and lifeless state, who were like to the body of a man, or any other creature, struck dead with lightning from heaven."
3. "Wherever the Jews were, whether at Jerusalem, where the body and carcass of them was, in a most forlorn and desperate condition; or in any other parts of the country, the Roman eagles, or legions, would find them out, and make an utter destruction of them."

### John Wesley:
1. "Our Lord gives this, as a farther reason, why they should not hearken to any pretended deliverer."
2. "Expect not any deliverer of the Jewish nation; for it is devoted to destruction."
