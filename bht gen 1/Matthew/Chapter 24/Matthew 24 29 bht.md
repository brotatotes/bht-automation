# Matthew 24:29 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
After the great distress and trials of those days, there will come a time of immense calamity and chaos. The sun will be darkened, the moon will lose its light, and the stars will fall from the sky. This imagery signifies the obscuring of knowledge, the disruption of societal order, and the falling away of spiritual leaders. Yet, these events are not to be taken literally, but rather symbolize the tumultuous state of the world and the Church during the last days. Ultimately, this period of tribulation will lead to the glorious and joyful fulfillment of God's plans.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The important insertion in Luke (Luk 21:23-24) shows us that the θλῖψις includes ὀργὴ τῷ λαῷ τούτῳ, which is yet being inflicted: and the treading down of Jerusalem by the Gentiles, still going on...shall the coming of the Lord Himself happen." 
2. "The darkening of the material lights of this world is used in prophecy as a type of the occurrence of trouble and danger in the fabric of human societies...The physical signs shall happen as accompaniments and intensifications of the awful state of things which the description typifies."
3. "The Knowledge of God shall be obscured, the Truth nigh put out, worldly wisdom darkened, the Church system demolished, and her teachers cast down. And all this in the midst of the fearful signs here recounted: not setting aside, but accompanying, their literal fulfillment."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Immediately after the tribulation of those days" - events will occur that may be properly represented by the darkening of the sun and moon, and by the stars falling from heaven. The term "immediately" means "soon" or "the next in order." It is necessary that there should have been events which would be properly expressed by the language which the Savior uses.
2. "The images used here are not to be taken literally." They are often employed by the sacred writers to denote any great calamities. The darkening of the sun and moon, and the falling of the stars, represent inexpressible calamity or any great catastrophe.
3. "The roaring of the waves of the sea denotes great tumult and affliction among the people." The distress of nations, with perplexity, and people's hearts failing them for fear, are figures of great and terrible calamities. Their fears would be so great as to take away their courage and strength.

### John Calvin:
1. "The principal object of his reply was, to confirm his disciples in good hope, that they might not be dismayed on account of the troubles and confusion that would arise."
2. "The meaning therefore is, that the predictions which had been formerly made about the miraculous shaking of heaven and earth, ought not to be restricted to the commencement of redemption, because the prophets had embraced the whole course of it, till it should arrive at perfection."
3. "To encourage his followers to patience, he employs this argument, that the tribulations will at length have a happy and joyful result."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "After the tribulation of those days, not the tribulation attending the destruction of Jerusalem, but the period of trial which belongs to the ‘last times.’"
2. "The sun shall be darkened...the moon shall not give her light...the stars shall fall from heaven...the powers of the heavens shall be shaken."
3. "The knowledge of Christ, the Sun of the Church and the world shall be obscured; the reflected light of science...shall cease to guide...the leaders and teachers of the Church shall become apostates...the influences which rule human society shall be disturbed."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "The use of εν ταχε in Revelation 1:1 should make one pause before he decides."
2. "Here we have a prophetic panorama like that with foreshortened perspective."
3. "Literalism is not appropriate in this apocalyptic eschatology."

### John Gill:
1. "Immediately after the distress the Jews would be in through the siege of Jerusalem, and the calamities attending it; just upon the destruction of that city, and the temple in it, with the whole nation of the Jews, shall the following things come to pass."
2. "Shall the sun be darkened: not in a literal but in a figurative sense; and is to be understood not of the religion of the Jewish church; nor of the knowledge of the law among them, and the decrease of it; nor of the Gospel being obscured by heretics and false teachers; but of the Shekinah, or the divine presence in the temple."
3. "And the stars shall fall from heaven; which phrase, as it elsewhere intends the doctors of the church, and preachers falling off from purity of doctrine and conversation; so here it designs the Jewish Rabbins and doctors, who departed from the word of God, and set up their traditions above it."

### John Wesley:
1. "Immediately after the tribulation of those days — Here our Lord begins to speak of his last coming. But he speaks not so much in the language of man as of God, with whom a thousand years are as one day, one moment."
2. "Many of the primitive Christians not observing this, thought he would come immediately, in the common sense of the word: a mistake which St. Paul labours to remove, in his Second Epistle to the Thessalonians."
3. "The powers of the heavens — Probably the influences of the heavenly bodies."
