# Matthew 24:29 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
After a period of trial in the last times, the distress faced by the Jews during the destruction of Jerusalem, and the shaking of the powers of the heavens, a prophetic panorama with foreshortened perspective unfolds. The sun shall be figuratively darkened, while the moon, representing the ceremonial law, ceases to give her light. The falling of the stars signifies the Jewish Rabbins and doctors departing from the word of God, paving the way for the establishment of Gospel ordinances. This apocalyptic eschatology should not be approached with literalism, as our Lord's words transcend human time and perspective. 

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Philip Schaff:
1. "After the tribulation of those days, not the tribulation attending the destruction of Jerusalem, but the period of trial which belongs to the 'last times.'" 
2. "The sun shall be darkened...the moon shall not give her light...the stars shall fall from heaven...the powers of the heavens shall be shaken." 
3. "The knowledge of Christ, the Sun of the Church and the world shall be obscured; the reflected light of science...shall cease to guide; the leaders and teachers of the Church shall become apostates; the influences which rule human society shall be disturbed."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "The use of εν ταχε in Revelation 1:1 should make one pause before he decides." 
2. "Here we have a prophetic panorama like that with foreshortened perspective."
3. "Literalism is not appropriate in this apocalyptic eschatology."

### John Gill:
1. "Immediately after the distress the Jews would be in through the siege of Jerusalem, and the calamities attending it; just upon the destruction of that city, and the temple in it, with the whole nation of the Jews, shall the following things come to pass." 

2. "Shall the sun be darkened: not in a literal but in a figurative sense; and is to be understood not of the religion of the Jewish church; nor of the knowledge of the law among them, and the decrease of it; nor of the Gospel being obscured by heretics and false teachers; but of the Shekinah, or the divine presence in the temple."

3. "The moon shall not give her light; which also is to be explained in a figurative and metaphorical sense; and refers not to the Roman empire, which quickly began to diminish; nor to the city of Jerusalem; nor to the civil polity of the nation; but to the ceremonial law, the moon, the church is said to have under her feet."

4. "The stars shall fall from heaven; which phrase, as it elsewhere intends the doctors of the church, and preachers falling off from purity of doctrine and conversation; so here it designs the Jewish Rabbins and doctors, who departed from the word of God, and set up their traditions above it."

5. "The powers of the heavens shall be shaken; meaning all the ordinances of the legal dispensation; which shaking, and even removing of them, were foretold by Haggai 2:6 and explained by the author of the Epistle to the Hebrews, Hebrews 12:26 whereby room and way were made for Gospel ordinances to take place, and be established."

### John Wesley:
1. "Immediately after the tribulation of those days" - Here our Lord begins to speak of his last coming. But he speaks not so much in the language of man as of God, with whom a thousand years are as one day, one moment.
2. "Many of the primitive Christians not observing this, thought he would come immediately, in the common sense of the word: a mistake which St. Paul labours to remove, in his Second Epistle to the Thessalonians."
3. "The powers of the heavens" - Probably the influences of the heavenly bodies. Mark 13:24; Luke 21:25.
