# Matthew 24:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this eschatological discourse, Jesus warns his disciples about the destruction of the temple, the signs of his coming, and the end of the world. As they sit on the mount of Olives, the disciples seek answers from Jesus about the timing and signs of these events. Jesus replies, addressing their questions while also providing a broader understanding of his coming and the ultimate culmination of all things. His words serve as both a warning and a call to be prepared for his coming and the end of the world.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Against this mistake He warns them, Matthew 24:6 ; Matthew 24:14 , Luke 21:24 , and also in the two first parables in our ch. 25."
2. "For the understanding of this necessarily difficult prophetic discourse, it must be borne in mind that the whole is spoken in the pregnant language of prophecy, in which various fulfilments are involved."
3. "Another weighty matter for the understanding of this prophecy is, that (see Mar 13:32 ) any obscurity or concealment concerning the  time of the Lord’s second coming, must be attributed to the right cause, which we know from His own mouth to be, that the divine Speaker Himself, in His humiliation,  did not know the day nor the hour ."

### Albert Barnes:

### John Calvin:
1. "Having believed from their infancy that the temple would stand till the end of time, and having this opinion deeply rooted in their minds, they did not suppose that, while the building of the world stood, the temple could fall to ruins."
2. "They associate the coming of Christ and the end of the world as things inseparable from each other; and by the end of the world they mean the restoration of all things, so that nothing may be wanting to complete the happiness of the godly."
3. "A foolish hope which they entertained, as to the immediate reign of Christ, drove them to hasten to the attainment of happiness and rest, without attending to the means."
