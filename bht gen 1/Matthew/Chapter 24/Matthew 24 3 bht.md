# Matthew 24:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the passage, Jesus sits on the mount of Olives, opposite the temple, prompting a discussion with His disciples about future events. The disciples, the intimate followers of Jesus, associate His coming with the end of the world, eagerly anticipating their ultimate happiness and rest. While some are mistaken in thinking the temple will stand forever, Jesus warns of its destruction and provides answers about its fate. These teachings intertwine the accounts of the temple's destruction and the final judgment, offering a glimpse into both events.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Against this mistake He warns them, Matthew 24:6 ; Matthew 24:14 , Luke 21:24 , and also in the two first parables in our ch. 25."
2. "For the understanding of this necessarily difficult prophetic discourse, it must be borne in mind that the whole is spoken in the pregnant language of prophecy, in which various fulfillments are involved."
3. "Two parallel interpretations run through the former part as far as Matthew 24:28 ; the destruction of Jerusalem and the final judgment being both enwrapped in the words, but the former, in this part of the chapter, predominating."

### John Calvin:
1. "Having believed from their infancy that the temple would stand till the end of time, and having this opinion deeply rooted in their minds, they did not suppose that, while the building of the world stood, the temple could fall to ruins."
2. "They associate the coming of Christ and the end of the world as things inseparable from each other; and by the end of the world they mean the restoration of all things, so that nothing may be wanting to complete the happiness of the godly."
3. "But above all, a foolish hope which they entertained, as to the immediate reign of Christ, drove them to hasten to the attainment of happiness and rest, without attending to the means."

### Philip Schaff:

2. "The disciples. Mark (Mark 13:3): 'Peter, and James, and John, and Andrew,' the four fishermen first called and first named in all the lists, the confidential disciples."

### John Gill:
1. "This place, very probably, our Lord chose to sit in, that he might give his disciples an occasion to discourse more largely with him on this subject."
