# Matthew 24:30 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we see a powerful depiction of mourning and sorrow beyond grief itself. It is a deep anguish and recognition of the gravity of sin, leading one to physically beat their chest as a sign of intense emotional pain. This mourning is not self-centered, but rather a genuine sorrow for the brokenness of the world and a longing for God's redemption. It is a transformative experience that humbles us, leading us to seek reconciliation with God and others, ultimately finding comfort in His nearness and the promise of restoration. (Word count: 72)

2. "The act of beating their breasts signifies a profound recognition of the gravity of sin and its consequences. It is a visceral response to the brokenness and fallenness of the world, a recognition that sin has caused immense suffering and separation from God."

3. "This mourning is not self-pity or self-centered sorrow, but a genuine sorrow for the state of the world and a longing for God's redemption and restoration. It is a recognition that true comfort and healing can only come from God."

4. "Through this mourning, we acknowledge our own sinfulness and the need for God's forgiveness and mercy. It is a humbling and transformative experience that leads us to seek reconciliation with God and others."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The important matter is to recognize it when it comes, not to know in advance what it will be."

3. "Certainly nothing is said here of the general judgment, but only of the gathering of Christ's people."
