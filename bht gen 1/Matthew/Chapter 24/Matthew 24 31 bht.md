# Matthew 24:31 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we are reminded of the gathering of God's faithful people, often symbolized by the sound of trumpets in biblical imagery. The angels, as messengers, are sent by God to call together the elect from all corners of the earth. This gathering is not only a physical gathering, but also a gathering of those who have remained steadfast in their faith and who continue to demonstrate their love through their actions. It serves as a reminder that true faith is not simply a one-time decision, but an ongoing commitment to follow God and extend His love to others.
