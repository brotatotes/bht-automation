# Matthew 24:33 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Addressed to the disciples as representatives of all Christians, this verse contains signs that indicate the impending destruction of Jerusalem. These signs serve as a reminder that calamities and desolations on the Jews are evidence of the son of man's arrival, displaying power and glory. Notably, the verse does not imply personal witness to these events, but rather a message of imminent deliverance from persecutions, with the promise of everlasting redemption and the establishment of the eternal kingdom. The coming of Christ signifies the end of sorrows, afflictions, and darkness, and the arrival of eternal light for his people.
