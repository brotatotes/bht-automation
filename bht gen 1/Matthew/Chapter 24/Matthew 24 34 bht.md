## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Albert Barnes:
1. "The destruction of Jerusalem took place about forty years after this was spoken."
2. "He does not mean to exclude the reference to the judgment, but to say that the destruction of Jerusalem would be such as to make appropriate the words of the prediction, were there nothing beyond."
3. "Thus the words of Christ describing the destruction of Jerusalem had a fulness of signification that would meet also the events of the judgment, and whose meaning would not be 'entirely filled up' until the world was closed."

### John Calvin:
1. "Though Christ employs a general expression, yet he does not extend the discourses to all the miseries which would befall the Church, but merely informs them, that before a single generation shall have been completed, they will learn by experience the truth of what he has said."
2. "For within fifty years the city was destroyed and the temple was razed, the whole country was reduced to a hideous desert, and the obstinacy of the world rose up against God."
3. "The meaning therefore is: 'This prophecy does not relate to evils that are distant, and which posterity will see after the lapse of many centuries, but which are now hanging over you, and ready to fall in one mass, so that there is no part of it which the present generation will not experience.'"

### Philip Schaff:
1. "'Generation' in the literal sense, the reference being to the destruction of Jerusalem." 
2. "'Generation' in the sense of 'race,' as often. Applied to the Jewish nation, meaning that the Jewish people shall remain until the fulfillment of all these things."
3. "The single advantage of this is that it extends 'ye,' in Matthew 24:33, to the whole body of believers."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "The problem is whether Jesus is here referring to the destruction of Jerusalem or to the second coming and end of the world."
2. "If to the destruction of Jerusalem, there was a literal fulfillment."
3. "In the Old Testament, a generation was reckoned as forty years."

### John Gill:
1. "Not the generation of men in general; as if the sense was, that mankind should not cease, until the accomplishment of these things."
2. "But it respects that present age, or generation of men then living in it; and the sense is, that all the men of that age should not die, but some should live till all these things were fulfilled."
3. "This is a full and clear proof, that not anything that is said before, relates to the second coming of Christ, the day of judgment, and end of the world; but that all belong to the coming of the son of man, in the destruction of Jerusalem, and to the end of the Jewish state."

### John Wesley:
1. "This generation of men now living shall not pass till all these things be done" - The phrase suggests that while some individuals from that generation would still be alive, not all would witness the fulfillment of these events. This prediction proved true, as the city and temple were destroyed approximately 39 or 40 years later.

2. "The expression implies, that great part of that generation would be passed away, but not the whole." - This commentary highlights that a significant portion of that generation would have already passed away by the time these events occurred, indicating that the fulfillment of the prophecy would not be immediate.

3. "For the city and temple were destroyed thirty-nine or forty years after." - This statement provides a specific timeframe for the fulfillment of the prophecy, emphasizing that the destruction of the city and temple took place nearly four decades after the prediction was made.
