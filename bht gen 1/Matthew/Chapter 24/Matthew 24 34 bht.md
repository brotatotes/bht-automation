# Matthew 24:34 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
It is prophesied that the events described in this verse would occur within a specific generation, referring either to the destruction of Jerusalem or the end of the Jewish state. The phrase "this generation" suggests that although many individuals from that time would pass away, there would still be some who would witness the fulfillment of these prophecies. The city and temple were ultimately destroyed around 39 or 40 years later, confirming the accuracy of the prediction.
