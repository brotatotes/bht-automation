# Matthew 24:36 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
No one, not even Jesus Himself, knows the exact day of judgment. This fact was not revealed during Jesus' earthly ministry, but it is possible that it was later revealed to the apostle John. The timing of this significant event remains a mystery, known only to God the Father.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The very important addition to this verse in Mark, and in some ancient MSS. here (but see digest), οὐδὲ ὁ υἱός, is indeed included in εἰ μὴ ὁ πατήρ [μου] μόνος, but could hardly have been inferred from it, had it not been expressly stated." 
2. "All attempts to soften or explain away this weighty truth must be resisted; it will not do to say with some Commentators, ‘nescit ea nobis,’ which, however well meant, is a mere evasion."
3. "In the course of humiliation undertaken by the Son, in which He increased in wisdom (Luk 2:52), learned obedience (Heb 5:8), uttered desires in prayer (Luke 6:12, &c.), this matter was hidden from Him."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The 'general signs' of its approach have been given, as the budding of the fig-tree is a certain indication that summer is near; but 'the precise time' is not indicated by these things."
2. "The precise time would not be foretold."
3. "Knoweth no man, no, not the angels."

### John Calvin:
1. "Christ intended to hold the minds of believers in suspense that they might not, by a false imagination, fix any time for the final redemption."
2. "He wishes his disciples so to walk in the light of faith, that while they are uncertain as to the time, they may patiently wait for the revelation of him."
3. "That men may not feel uneasy at not knowing that day, Christ represents angels as their associates in this matter; for it would be a proof of excessive pride and wicked covetousness, to desire that we who creep on the earth should know more than is permitted to the angels in heaven."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Christ did not know the day and hour of His future coming since Matthew 24:37 shows that this is referred to."
2. "This seems to be a voluntary self-humiliation in knowledge, a part of Christ’s emptying of Himself."
3. "His voluntarily not knowing, or ‘sacred unwillingness to know,’ the day of judgment during the days of His flesh, is a warning against chronological curiosity and mathematical calculation in the exposition of Scripture prophecy."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Not even the Son... but the Father only." - This phrase highlights the unique knowledge and authority of God the Father in determining the timing of significant events, such as the second coming and the end of the world.

2. "No one but the Father knows the day or the hour." - Jesus emphasizes the mystery surrounding the exact timing of these future events, emphasizing that it is not for anyone, including himself as the Son, to know or reveal.

3. "Jesus as Man, expected the End, within the lifetime of his contemporaries." - This statement acknowledges the human nature of Jesus and suggests that he had an expectation of the end times occurring during the lifetime of those he was addressing. This adds depth to the understanding of Jesus' perspective on the timing of these events.

### John Gill:
1. "The words manifestly regard the date of the several things going before, which only can be applied to that catastrophe, and dreadful desolation."
2. "Though the destruction itself was spoken of by Moses and the prophets, was foretold by Christ, and the believing Jews had some discerning of its near approach, yet the exact and precise time was not known."
3. "No, not the angels of heaven; who dwell there, always behold the face of God, stand in his presence ready to do his will, and are made acquainted with many of his designs, and yet know not the time of God's vengeance on the Jews."

### John Wesley:
1. "But of that day — The day of judgment; Knoweth no man." 
2. "Not while our Lord was on earth." 
3. "Yet it might be afterward revealed to St. John consistently with this."
