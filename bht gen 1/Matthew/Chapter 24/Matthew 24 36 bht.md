## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Philip Schaff:
1. "Christ did not know the day and hour of His future coming since Matthew 24:37 shows that this is referred to."
2. "This seems to be a voluntary self-humiliation in knowledge, a part of Christ's emptying of Himself."
3. "His voluntarily not knowing, or 'sacred unwillingness to know,' the day of judgment during the days of His flesh, is a warning against chronological curiosity and mathematical calculation in the exposition of Scripture prophecy."

### John Wesley:
1. "But of that day â€” The day of judgment; Knoweth no man" - This verse highlights the mystery and uncertainty surrounding the exact timing of the day of judgment. It emphasizes that even Jesus, during his time on earth, did not possess this knowledge. 

2. "Not while our Lord was on earth" - This quote further emphasizes that the knowledge of the day of judgment was not revealed by Jesus during his earthly ministry. It underscores the limitations of human understanding and the divine nature of this event.

3. "Yet it might be afterward revealed to St. John consistently with this" - This statement suggests that while Jesus did not reveal the timing of the day of judgment during his earthly ministry, it is possible that this knowledge was later revealed to the apostle John.
