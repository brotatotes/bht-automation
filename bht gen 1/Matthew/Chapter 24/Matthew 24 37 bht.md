## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Albert Barnes:
1. "The coming of the Son of man would be as it was in the days of Noah." This comparison highlights the parallel between the time of Noah and the future coming of Jesus. It suggests that just as the people in Noah's time were unaware and unprepared for the flood, so too will people be caught off guard when Jesus returns.

2. "Noah." The mention of Noah reminds us of the biblical account in Genesis 6-9, where Noah was chosen by God to build an ark and save his family and the animals from the great flood. This reference helps us understand the significance of Noah as a figure of faith and obedience in the face of impending judgment.

3. "The Greek way of writing 'Noah'." This comment highlights the linguistic aspect of the verse, emphasizing the cultural and historical context in which the Gospel of Matthew was written. It reminds us that the New Testament was written in Greek and provides insight into the translation and interpretation of biblical names and terms.

### John Calvin:

2. "Since indifference of this sort will exist about the time of the last day, believers ought not to indulge themselves after the example of the multitude."
3. "And though we shall immediately find him commanding the disciples to guard against surfeiting and earthly cares, yet in this passage he does not directly condemn the intemperance, but rather the obstinacy, of those times, in consequence of which, they despised the threatenings of God, and awaited with indifference their awful destruction."
