In this Bible verse, the commentators highlight the ignorance and unbelief of the people. They were unaware of the impending judgment and the exact timing of it. Their persistent unbelief blinded them, causing them to disregard warnings and engage in wickedness. Despite having some knowledge, they carried on with their ordinary lives, unconcerned and indifferent to the impending destruction.
