# Matthew 24:39 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Despite clear warnings and undeniable evidence, a group of individuals stubbornly refused to believe in the impending flood. Their unbelief was so deeply rooted that it blinded their minds and hardened their hearts. This persistent disbelief led to their ultimate destruction, as they disregarded the universal deluge that claimed the lives of all except for a few. Ignoring the warnings, they remained indifferent and careless, choosing to deny the impending doom that was upon them.
