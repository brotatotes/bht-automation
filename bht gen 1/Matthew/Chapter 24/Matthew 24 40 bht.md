# Matthew 24:40 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, commentators emphasize the suddenness and unexpected nature of a calamity that overtakes individuals. Some suggest that being taken can mean being rescued from danger or even being taken away by death. The verse highlights the individual and personal nature of the event, with people being separated instantly. It is a reminder of the transitory nature of life and the need for perseverance and faith. Those who are taken find themselves in the immediate protection of God, while those who are left must face the common calamities of the world.
