# Matthew 24:40 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the urgency and immediacy of the situation are emphasized by using the present tense. One is taken indicates being delivered into God's immediate protection, while one is left implies sharing the common calamities. The distinction is not based on death, but rather being taken by the eagles (Roman army) and either killed or carried captive. This event differs from others mentioned in the Bible, showing that our Lord speaks as having the whole transaction present before his eyes.
