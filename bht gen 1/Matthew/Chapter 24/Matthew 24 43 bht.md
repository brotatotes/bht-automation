# Matthew 24:43 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In these verses, the idea of surprise is prominent, likening the coming of the son of man to the unexpected arrival of a thief in the night. This comparison should not be interpreted negatively, but rather emphasizes the secret and sudden nature of Christ's return. Christians are likened to housekeepers, responsible for the care of their own souls, always watchful and prepared for the Lord's coming. This vigilance is crucial to prevent any disorder or confusion when the time of his arrival arrives.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Philip Schaff:
1. "The idea of surprise is the main one, as throughout these verses."
2. "Watchfulness under uncertainty is constant."
3. "The figure has a further application to the hour of death, when for the individual the Lord comes; and to great catastrophes of judgment upon nations."

### John Gill:
1. "The coming of the son of man is here represented by the coming of the thief in the night: but when he is compared to a thief, this is not to be understood in a bad sense, in which Satan is called one, who comes to kill and to destroy the souls of men; and likewise heretics and false teachers, and everyone that climbs up, and gets into the church of God in a wrong way; but this only respects the manner of Christ's coming, which is like that of a thief, secretly, suddenly, and at unawares."

2. "The 'good man of the house', or householder, is every Christian, or believer in Christ, who has a house to look after, his own soul, the spiritual affairs and everlasting salvation of it, things of moment and concern unto him."

3. "As it became the one, so it does the other, to watch, to be upon their guard, to be in a readiness, to have their loins girt about, and their lights burning, and they like men that wait for their Lord; that so when he comes, their houses may not be broken up, may not be surprised, and the several powers and faculties of their souls may not be thrown into disorder and confusion."
