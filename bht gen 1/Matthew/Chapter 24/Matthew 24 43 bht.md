# Matthew 24:43 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, the imminent coming of the Son of Man is likened to the arrival of a thief in the night. However, this comparison should not be understood negatively, as the manner of Christ's coming is secretive, sudden, and unexpected. As believers, we are exhorted to be like diligent housekeepers, watching over our souls and being prepared for Christ's return. Just as a good man of the house is vigilant and ready, so should we remain watchful, with our loins girded and our lights burning, eagerly awaiting our Lord.

1. "The coming of the son of man, is here represented by the coming of the thief in the night: but when he is compared to a thief, this is not to be understood in a bad sense, in which Satan is called one, who comes to kill and to destroy the souls of men; and likewise heretics and false teachers, and everyone that climbs up, and gets into the church of God in a wrong way; but this only respects the manner of Christ's coming, which is like that of a thief, secretly, suddenly, and at unawares."
