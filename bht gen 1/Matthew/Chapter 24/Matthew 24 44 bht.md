## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Albert Barnes:
1. "He charged them to pray always, that they might be accounted worthy to escape those things - the judgments coming upon the wicked - and to stand before the Son of man." 
2. "He also charged them to take heed and not to suffer their hearts to be overcharged with surfeiting, or too much eating, or drunkenness, or the cares of this life, lest that day should come upon them unawares."
3. "Things improper if there were no judgment - especially mad and wicked when the judgment is near."

### John Calvin:
1. "Since, therefore, we are informed that Christ's coming will be sudden and unexpected, like that of a robber, and since we are expressly forewarned that we must always watch, lest he come upon us when asleep, and we be swallowed up with the ungodly, there is no excuse for our indolence."
2. "More especially since there is reason to dread not only a breach of the wall, and a loss of our property, but a deadly wound to ruin our soul, unless we are on our guard."
3. "The tendency of these words therefore is, that the warning of Christ should arouse us; for, though the last judgment be delayed for a long time, yet it hangs over us every hour; and, therefore, when there is ground for alarm, and when danger is near, it is unreasonable that we should be sluggish."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "To be ready at all is to be ready always."
2. "The caution of this passage is not a threatening for the Lord's people."
3. "Those ready find Him a Friend; only those not ready find His coming as uncomfortable as that of a thief."
