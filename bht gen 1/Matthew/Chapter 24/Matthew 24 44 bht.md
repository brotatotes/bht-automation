# Matthew 24:44 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The passage being described emphasizes the importance of readiness for the future state and the second coming of Christ. It encourages constant vigilance and warns against distractions and worldly concerns. The figure of the thief is used to convey the unexpectedness of Christ's second coming. Being ready is not simply relying on God's mercy, external acts, or professions of faith, but rather being in Christ, adorned with his righteousness, and washed in his blood. The passage also serves as a warning for those who are not ready, as they will be excluded from eternal blessings.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Albert Barnes:
1. "He charged them to pray always, that they might be accounted worthy to escape those things - the judgments coming upon the wicked - and to stand before the Son of man." 

2. "He also charged them to take heed and not to suffer their hearts to be overcharged with surfeiting, or too much eating, or drunkenness, or the cares of this life, lest that day should come upon them unawares." 

3. "Things improper if there were no judgment - especially mad and wicked when the judgment is near."

### John Calvin:
1. "Since, therefore, we are informed that Christ’s coming will be sudden and unexpected, like that of a robber, and since we are expressly forewarned that we must always watch, lest he come upon us when asleep, and we be swallowed up with the ungodly, there is no excuse for our indolence."
2. "More especially since there is reason to dread not only a breach of the wall, and a loss of our property, but a deadly wound to ruin our soul, unless we are on our guard."
3. "The tendency of these words therefore is, that the warning of Christ should arouse us; for, though the last judgment be delayed for a long time, yet it hangs over us every hour; and, therefore, when there is ground for alarm, and when danger is near, it is unreasonable that we should be sluggish."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "To be ready at all is to be ready always."
2. "The caution of this passage is not a threatening for the Lord’s people."
3. "Those ready find Him a Friend; only those not ready find His coming as uncomfortable as that of a thief."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "It is useless to set the day and hour for Christ's coming."
2. "It is folly to neglect it."
3. "This figure of the thief will be used also by Paul concerning the unexpectedness of Christ's second coming."

### John Gill:
1. "And if this can be applied to a readiness for a future state after death; for the second coming of Christ, and last judgment; this lies not in a dependence on the absolute mercy of God; nor in an external humiliation for sin; nor in an abstinence from grosser sins, or in mere negative holiness; nor in any outward, legal, civil, and moral righteousness; nor in a submission to Gospel ordinances; nor in a mere profession of religion; but in being in Christ, having on his righteousness, and being washed in his blood."
2. "And such a readiness in either branch of it, is not of themselves, but lies in the grace of God, which gives a meetness for glory; and in the righteousness of Christ, the fine linen, clean and white, which being granted by him, his people are made ready for him."
3. "And miserable will those be, who will not be ready, who will not have the oil of grace in their hearts with their lamps, nor the wedding garment on them; they will be shut out, and bid to depart into everlasting burnings."
