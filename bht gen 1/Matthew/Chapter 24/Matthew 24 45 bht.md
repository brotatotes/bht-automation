# Matthew 24:45 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This verse speaks about a servant, specifically those in prominent positions, who are called to be vigilant, sober, and diligent in their responsibilities. They are reminded that their elevated status comes with a greater burden and must not be used for self-indulgence. As stewards of God's word and entrusted with leading others, they are called to be faithful and wise, diligently carrying out their duties and continually aware that their role is one of service and accountability.

### John Calvin:
1. "Christ had formerly exhorted the whole family in general to watch for his coming, so now he demands extraordinary care from the principal servants, who had been appointed over others for the purpose of pointing out, by their example, the path of sobriety, watchfulness, and strict temperance."
2. "By these words he reminds them that they were not elevated to high rank for the purpose of indulging in ease, indolence, and pleasure; but that, the higher the rank of honor which they had obtained, the heavier was the burden which was laid on them."
3. "Let all who are called to an honorable office learn from this, that they are so much the more strongly bound, not only to bestow their labor faithfully, but to strive with their utmost zeal and industry to discharge their duty."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Faithfulness alone is success."
2. "Ministers of Christ are referred to, since these are elsewhere represented as 'set' by Him in the Church."
3. "The food is God's word, which is to be rightly divided."

### John Gill:
1. "The 'servant' is there called a 'steward', for such a servant is meant; and a name that is very proper for the apostles and ministers of the word, who are stewards of the mysteries of Christ, and of the manifold grace of God."
2. "And they are 'wise', who know and are well instructed in divine things; who make Christ the main subject of their ministry; who improve their talents and time for their master's use, and the advantage of those that are under their care."
3. "The ministers are, by their Lord, made and placed as rulers; not as lords and tyrants over God's heritage, to govern them in an arbitrary way, but as over them in the Lord, to rule them according to the word of God, and the laws of his house."

### John Wesley:
1. "Who then is the faithful and wise servant â€” Which of you aspires after this character?"
