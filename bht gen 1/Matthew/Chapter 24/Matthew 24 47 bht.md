# Matthew 24:47 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, a faithful servant is rewarded for their loyalty and diligence. Their reward is not just material, but a promotion to possess the full inheritance and be called blessed. This reward is unlike earthly promotions, as it is characterized by the diffusion of love, where the more each servant receives, the more there is for all. This truth is certain and can be depended on, giving hope to all wise and diligent servants that they will be honored with greater gifts and inherit everything in the other world, including glory, happiness, and bliss.
