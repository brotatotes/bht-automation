## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### John Calvin:
1. "They imagine that the day when they must render an account will never come; and, under the pretext of Christ's absence, they promise themselves that they will remain unpunished."
2. "No excitement of exhortation, therefore, can be more powerful or efficacious, than to represent to us that rigid tribunal which no man will be able to escape."
3. "At the same time, Christ takes a passing glance at the ease with which insolence grows, when a man has once shaken off the bridle, and given himself up to sinning."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The verse is a caution to the faithful to persevere, and a warning to those who intrude into the ministry."
2. "Shall say, not openly, for the official position forbids that; but in his heart, and in his conduct."
3. "The servant began well, and still recognizes Christ as His Lord. The spring of all his evil conduct was unbelief; whether the Lord came sooner or later, his duty remained the same."

### John Gill:
1. "An evil servant, an unwise and faithless one, who though he may have gifts and talents, yet destitute of the grace of God."
2. "Sometimes wicked and graceless men are in such places."
3. "Begins to think that either he will not come at all, to call him to an account for the use of his time, gifts, and talents; or if he does, it will be long first ere he will come."
