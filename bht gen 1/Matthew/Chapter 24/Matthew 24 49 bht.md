# Matthew 24:49 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the leader of God's heritage abuses his power and behaves as if he were above God, causing harm instead of nourishment. This behavior is a manifestation of unfaithfulness to Christ, leading to pride, censure, and despotism over fellow believers. This leader shows leniency towards evil members, calling upon the world for support, and indulges in worldly and immoral pleasures. Such actions include burdening believers with unnecessary practices, offending their conscience, and leading a self-serving and ungodly life that contradicts the teachings of Christ.
