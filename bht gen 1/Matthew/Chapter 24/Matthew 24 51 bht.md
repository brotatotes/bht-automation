# Matthew 24:51 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the consequences of leading a hypocritical life are vividly described. It signifies a dreadful sundering of the conscience and practice, reflecting the torment of the condemned. The punishment depicted here, a vivid image of cutting or sawing asunder, emphasizes the severity of the consequences for those who choose to live in disobedience. Through this warning, we are reminded of the need for authenticity, as pretending to be righteous while indulging in sinful behaviors leads to extreme punishment and a separation between conscience and conduct.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The expression here is perhaps not without a symbolical reference to that dreadful sundering of the conscience and practice which shall be the reflective torment of the condemned."
2. "By the mingling and confounding of which only is the anomalous life of the wilful sinner made in this world tolerable."
3. "The punishment of cutting, or sawing asunder, is a vivid image that highlights the severity of the consequences for those who choose to live in disobedience."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Extreme punishment is here meant, but the peculiar expression indicates something further, a fearful separating of the conscience and the conduct, so that the condemning power of the former is a constant scourge against the continued evil of the latter. This will be a terrible element of future retribution."
2. "Such a servant is not necessarily a mere hypocrite, but his conduct deserves and will receive the punishment allotted to hypocrites. Unfaithfulness, especially in the ministry, will suffer the worst punishment: the faithful servant was also 'wise', the evil servant is most unwise."
3. "The future punishment is of the same character for all, even though there be degrees of it. This picture of judgment on rulers of the Church comes first. The history of ecclesiastical despotism in every age, and on the smaller as well as the largest scale, abundantly shows how needful the warning has been."

### John Wesley:
1. "Allot him his portion with the hypocrites" - This verse highlights the fate of those who claim to be followers of Christ but live hypocritical lives. It serves as a warning against the dangers of pretending to be righteous while indulging in sinful behaviors.

2. "The worst of sinners, as upright and sincere as he was once" - This quote emphasizes the severity of hypocrisy, suggesting that those who were once upright and sincere can become the worst of sinners when they engage in hypocrisy.

3. "No hypocrisy can be baser, than to call ourselves ministers of Christ, while we are the slaves of avarice, ambition, or sensuality" - This statement underscores the gravity of hypocrisy among ministers of Christ, particularly when they are driven by selfish desires instead of serving God and His people faithfully. It calls for a genuine transformation and surrender to God's grace.
