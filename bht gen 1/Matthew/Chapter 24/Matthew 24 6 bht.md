# Matthew 24:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Amidst violent agitations and bloody wars in the Roman Empire, the end of the Jewish economy and the destruction of Jerusalem loom. As rumors of wars reach their ears, the disciples are urged to meet the calamities with courage, acknowledging that the chaos is regulated by the will of God. Through these convulsions, they are called to remain watchful and untroubled, for the end they inquire about is not yet, but rather the beginning of sorrows leading to lasting tranquility.
