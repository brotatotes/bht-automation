# Matthew 24:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Nation rising against nation, kingdoms in conflict, famines, and pestilences spreading - these were the harbingers of destruction, even before the fall of the Roman Empire. The Jewish nation was at the center of these uprisings, engaging in battles with various other groups. Famine struck, resulting in severe scarcity and loss of life, while pestilences ravaged communities. Earthquakes shook different parts of the world, leaving no region untouched. These events foreshadowed the impending ruin and chaos that would eventually envelop Jerusalem.
