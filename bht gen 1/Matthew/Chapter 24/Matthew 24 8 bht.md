# Matthew 24:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we are given a glimpse into a future filled with heavy calamities and intense suffering. Even in the midst of trials and tribulations, there is hope for the future, as these woes are not proof of the end, but of the beginning. The sufferings mentioned are compared to the birth-pangs of a woman in labor, with the physical woes serving as a prelude to even greater moral woes. Despite the intensity of these circumstances, believers are encouraged to exercise patience and find consolation in their faith in Jesus.
