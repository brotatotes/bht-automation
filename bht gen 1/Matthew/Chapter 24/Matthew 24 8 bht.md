# Matthew 24:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In a time of great suffering and tribulation, believers are cautioned to endure patiently, understanding that their present hardships are just a glimpse of what is to come. These sorrows, likened to the pains of childbirth, signify not the final judgment, but rather the necessary birth pangs of God's redemptive plan. It is through faith in Jesus, the true Messiah, that believers can find deliverance from the calamities that have befallen humanity.
