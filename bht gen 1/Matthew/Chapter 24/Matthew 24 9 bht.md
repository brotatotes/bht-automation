# Matthew 24:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this passage, we hear the warning of trials and tribulations that the disciples will face because of their faith. The gospel they preach will not be well-received, and they will be hated and persecuted by the world. As they bear witness to the name of Christ, they will face affliction, imprisonment, and even death. This suffering is not a result of their wrongdoing but rather a testament to the hostility and opposition they will encounter as messengers of the gospel.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### John Calvin:
1. "It is painful and distressing enough in itself that the children of God should be afflicted in such a manner as not to be distinguished from the reprobate and the despisers of God." 
2. "But Christ treats here strictly of the afflictions which the disciples had to endure on account of the gospel."
3. "He intended to warn his disciples that the doctrine of the gospel, of which they were to be witnesses and messengers, would never be pleasant or agreeable to the world."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "They shall deliver you up, etc. Soon literally fulfilled. But it may now be referred to the spirit of persecution, always latent in the world and to break out in the last times."
2. "Hated of all the nations. The Roman historian Tacitus speaks of the early Christians as a hated race of men."
3. "But to be universally abhorred is not a proof of being a Christian. It must be for my name's sake. This hatred has not ceased; it will probably manifest itself anew in startling form."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Ye shall be hated (εσεσθε μισουμενο). Periphrastic future passive to emphasize the continuous process of the linear action." 
2. "For tribulation (θλιψιν see Matthew 13:21), a word common in the Acts, Epistles, and Apocalypse for the oppression (pressure) that the Christians received."
3. "For my name's sake (δια το ονομα μου). The most glorious name in the world today, but soon to be a byword of shame (Acts 5:41). The disciples would count it an honour to be dishonoured for the Name's sake."

### John Gill:
1. "Our Lord proceeds to acquaint his disciples, what should befall them in this interval; and quite contrary to their expectations, who were looking for a temporal kingdom, and worldly grandeur, assures them of afflictions, persecutions, and death."
2. "The Jews continuing in their obstinacy and unbelief, would deliver them up to the civil magistrates, to be scourged and imprisoned by them."
3. "And shall kill you; as the two James', Peter, Paul, and even all the apostles, excepting John, who suffered martyrdom, and that before the destruction of Jerusalem."

### John Wesley:
1. "Then shall they deliver you up to affliction - As if ye were the cause of all these evils." 

2. "And ye shall be hated of all nations - Even of those who tolerate all other sects and parties." 

3. "But in no nation will the children of the devil tolerate the children of God."
