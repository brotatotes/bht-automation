# Matthew 25:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we witness a scene of urgency and desperation as those who were unprepared and lacking in wisdom come knocking at the door of the bridegroom. Their cries and pleas reveal their late realization of the consequences of their foolishness. The request to be opened unto serves as a symbolic element within the parable, highlighting the authority and supremacy of the bridegroom. Although persistently pursuing admission, they lacked true obedience and were ultimately left outside, unable to partake in the festivities.
