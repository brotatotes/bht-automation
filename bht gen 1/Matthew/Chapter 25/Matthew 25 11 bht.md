# Matthew 25:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this passage, we encounter individuals who arrive at the door of the bridegroom's house, pleading for entry. The exclamations of "Lord, Lord" express both the recognition of the bridegroom's authority and their desperation to be allowed into the festivities. Unfortunately, their lack of preparation and foolishness prevent them from gaining access. Their appeals are met with disappointment as they come to the realization of the consequences of their unpreparedness and lack of obedience.
