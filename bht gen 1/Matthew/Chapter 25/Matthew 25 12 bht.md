# Matthew 25:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, Jesus declares, "I know you not," indicating a lack of personal connection and approval. These individuals are characterized as graceless, foolish virgins, who neglected to acknowledge Christ and his righteousness. Jesus never knew them as his chosen people or his sheep. The door is shut, signifying a permanent exclusion, and they are commanded to depart. This cautionary lesson emphasizes the necessity of a genuine relationship with Christ and the consequences of neglecting it.

2. "Applied to professing Christians, having only a profession of religion, but no real piety, it means, I do not know or acknowledge you as Christians."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "I know you not." - This phrase indicates that there is a lack of personal relationship between the speaker and the individuals being addressed. It implies that without a genuine connection, there is no basis for special treatment or favor.

2. "No reason for special or unusual favours." - This highlights the principle that favor or blessing is often contingent upon a personal relationship or a sense of recognition. Without that connection, there is no justification for receiving special treatment.

3. "Abide the consequences of their own negligence." - This phrase suggests that the individuals being addressed will face the consequences of their own actions or lack of action. It emphasizes personal responsibility and accountability for one's choices and behavior.

### John Gill:
1. "Verily I say unto you, I know you not; which must be understood in consistence with the omniscience of Christ: he knew their persons, conduct, and state; he knew they were foolish virgins, graceless professors, who had made no account of him and his righteousness."
2. "They were none of the people whom he foreknew, or knew as his own, and loved with an everlasting love; he never knew them as his father's choice in him, or as this father's gift to him; he never knew them in the everlasting covenant, or as his sheep, for whom he died."
3. "Which answer implies, that as the door was shut, so it should remain; there was no admittance for them, nor any to be hoped for; and it is all one as if he had said, begone, and depart hence."
