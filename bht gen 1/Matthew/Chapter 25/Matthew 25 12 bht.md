# Matthew 25:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the Lord delivers a surprising and solemn response to the foolish virgins. The commentators emphasize that the Lord's reply signifies a lack of personal connection and knowledge between Him and these individuals. It becomes apparent that the Lord knew the true nature of the foolish virgins, who were characterized as graceless and lacking in genuine faith. Their negligence and disregard for the Lord and His righteousness had consequences, as they were not chosen in the everlasting covenant and never had an intimate relationship with Him.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "The attempt to establish a difference between 'I know you not' here, and 'I never knew you' in Matthew 7:23...is to be resisted...it is a kind of criticism which tampers with some of the most awful warnings regarding the future."
2. "If it be asked why unworthy guests were admitted to the marriage of the King's Son, in a former parable, and the foolish virgins are excluded in this one...those festivities are celebrated in this life, in the Church militant; these at the last day, in the Church triumphant."
3. "To those, even they are admitted who are not adorned with the wedding garment; but to these, only they to whom it is granted to be arrayed in fine linen clean and white, which is the righteousness of saints."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The refusal is definite and apparently final, and is the basis for the exhortation which follows."
2. "The lesson respects the blessedness of endurance unto the end, of keeping the light bright for the coming of the Bridegroom, however delayed."
3. "The ten virgins represent Gentile congregations accompanying the Bride, the Jewish Church."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "I know you not" - This phrase indicates a lack of personal relationship and familiarity between the speaker and the individuals being addressed. It suggests that there is no intimate knowledge or connection between them.

2. "No reason for special or unusual favours" - The lack of personal knowledge implies that there is no basis for granting special privileges or exceptions to these individuals. They cannot expect to receive preferential treatment due to their lack of relationship with the speaker.

3. "Consequences of their own negligence" - The individuals being addressed are responsible for their own negligence and lack of attention. They will have to face the repercussions of their actions or inaction, as they have not taken the necessary steps to establish a relationship or seek the favor of the speaker.

### John Gill:
1. "The Lord and bridegroom from within, thought fit to give them an answer, but an unexpected and awful one to them."
2. "He knew their persons, conduct, and state; he knew they were foolish virgins, graceless professors, who had made no account of him and his righteousness."
3. "He never knew them as his father's choice in him, or as this father's gift to him; he never knew them in the everlasting covenant, or as his sheep, for whom he died."

These quotes highlight the unexpected and severe response of the Lord to the foolish virgins. They emphasize that the Lord knew the true nature of these individuals and their lack of genuine faith and devotion. The commentary also emphasizes that the Lord never had a personal relationship with them or approved of their actions.
