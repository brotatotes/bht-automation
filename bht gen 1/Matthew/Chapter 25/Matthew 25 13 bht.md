# Matthew 25:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we are reminded to be vigilant and prepared for the coming of the Son of Man, both in death and in the final judgment. We are urged to watch and be alert, not knowing the exact timing of these events. Being ready requires more than mere knowledge or understanding, but also the presence of the Holy Spirit in our hearts. Even in moments of rest, our hearts should remain awake and attentive. True security comes from maintaining this watchfulness, rather than being complacent or negligent.

2. "It is not, therefore, without good reason that they appear in their actual order—that of the Virgins first, and of the Talents following—since it is the sole condition of a profitable outward activity for the kingdom of God, that the life of God be diligently maintained within the heart."
3. "the virgins were represented as waiting for their Lord, we have the servants working for Him; there the inward spiritual life of the faithful was described; here his external activity."

2. "The coming of our Lord, in so far as individuals are concerned, is the day of death." - This highlights the understanding that for each person, the coming of the Lord is experienced in their own death. It underscores the urgency to be ready at all times, as death can come unexpectedly.

3. "Watch therefore, that the Christian profession is supplied by the oil of the Spirit." - This quote emphasizes the need for the Christian profession to be fueled by the Holy Spirit.

1. "He that watches has not only a burning lamp, but likewise oil in his vessel." This quote emphasizes the importance of being prepared and vigilant.
