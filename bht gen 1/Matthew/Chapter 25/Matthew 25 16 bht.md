## BHT:
In this verse, we learn that the master expects his servants to be active and diligent in utilizing the resources given to them. It emphasizes that faithful stewardship and diligent use of talents are more important than the specific amount gained. God has entrusted each of us with unique gifts, and we are called to be good stewards, using our resources wisely for His glory. The servants in this parable demonstrate promptness, courage, and boldness in carrying out their responsibilities, functioning as traders for Christ's sake and the good of others.
