# Matthew 25:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we see the principle of multiplication and growth emphasized. The parable teaches us that when we are faithful with what we have been given, we can experience an increase in blessings and opportunities. It doesn't matter how much or how little we start with; what matters is our willingness to use and multiply what has been entrusted to us. Our efforts and labor, under the divine blessing, will be rewarded and accepted by our Lord, regardless of the initial amount we were given.
