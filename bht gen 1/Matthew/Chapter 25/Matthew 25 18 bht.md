# Matthew 25:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This verse depicts a person who received a gift but failed to use it or made no use of it, as if anxious to prevent the gift from being misused or lost. This individual neglected the abilities and spiritual gift given to them, burying them in earthly matters and failing to serve their Lord. It reminds us that even those with few talents should not use it as an excuse to not improve themselves, and challenges us to ask ourselves if we are hiding the talents that God has granted us.
