In this verse, the distinction is not between good and bad but between the wise and the foolish, according to Jamieson, Fausset, and Brown. John Calvin emphasizes the importance of wisdom for those entrusted with important responsibilities, while Philip Schaff explains that the foolish virgins symbolize those who are unprepared and lacking in wisdom. The verse also highlights the need for wisdom among all believers to guard against the schemes of Satan and to navigate the course of their lives.
