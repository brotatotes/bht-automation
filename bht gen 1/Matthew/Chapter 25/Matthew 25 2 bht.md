# Matthew 25:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This verse contrasts the wise and foolish, without distinguishing between good and bad. It warns against those who resemble believers but will be disowned by Jesus. God requires wisdom from all His children, especially stewards, to avoid being prey to Satan. The wise virgins, representing the prepared and faithful, trust in Jesus for salvation, while the foolish rely on temporary and unreliable foundations. This equal division carries significance, as it emphasizes the need for wisdom and steadfast faith in Christ for eternal life.
