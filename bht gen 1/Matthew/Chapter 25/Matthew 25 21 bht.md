# Matthew 25:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this passage, we find warm and delighted commendation, with the phrase "Well done" reflecting satisfaction and approval. The verse speaks of being faithful over a few things and being rewarded with rulership over many things. The commentator suggests that this could refer to a position of authority in the kingdom of glory or during the millenium. The phrase "Into the joy of thy Lord" emphasizes the personal spiritual life and the joyous inheritance that awaits those who serve Christ faithfully.
