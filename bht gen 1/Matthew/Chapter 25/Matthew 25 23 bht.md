# Matthew 25:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the parable described by these commentators, the focus is on faithfulness and the rewards that come from it. Regardless of the size of the trust or the amount given, faithfulness is what matters. It is emphasized that even those with lesser gifts can be just as faithful and praiseworthy as those with greater gifts. Additionally, it is clarified that the parable does not imply that man can earn eternal happiness through their efforts, nor does it suggest that true grace can be lost. Instead, the parable highlights the inseparable connection between faithfulness and eternal glory.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Philip Schaff:
1. "The same commendation for the same faithfulness; the amount was smaller, but the trust was smaller, the reward was the same also." 
2. "In spiritual things faithfulness is success."

### John Gill:
1. "A man that has lesser gifts, and is of less usefulness, may be as good and as faithful in his service, and as praise worthy, as a man of greater gifts, and more extensive usefulness."
2. "Whatever difference may be made between the saints, or between one minister and another in the Millennium state, yet in the ultimate glory, their joy, bliss, and happiness, will be alike."
3. "It is not to be established from this parable, that man has a power to improve the stock of sufficient grace given him, and by his improvement procure eternal happiness to himself."
4. "Nor is it to be inferred from hence, that true grace once given, or implanted, may be taken away or lost; for the parable speaks not of what is wrought in men, but of goods and talents bestowed on them, and committed to their trust; which may be lost or taken away, or be wrapped up in a napkin, and lie useless by them; when true grace is the incorruptible seed which never dies, but always remains."
5. "That good part which shall never be taken away nor lost, but is inseparably connected with eternal glory."
