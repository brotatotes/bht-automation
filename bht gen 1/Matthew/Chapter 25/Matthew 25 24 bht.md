# Matthew 25:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, the commentator describes a person who sees God as harsh and demanding, attributing their own shortcomings to Him. They view God as a hard master, expecting more than they are capable of. However, the commentator notes that God is not a niggardly or exacting figure, but rather generous with His grace and gifts. The verse serves as a reminder that everyone is accountable for their own talents and should use them for the good of others and to honor God, rather than making excuses or blaming Him for their own failures.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "I knew thee that thou art an hard man—harsh."
2. "The sense is obvious: 'I knew thou wast one whom it was impossible to serve, one whom nothing would please: exacting what was impracticable, and dissatisfied with what was attainable.'"
3. "Thus do men secretly think of God as a hard Master, and virtually throw on Him the blame of their fruitlessness."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "No one is excused for neglecting his duty because he has few talents." 
2. "A hard man - Of a sordid, griping disposition; taking advantage of the poor, and oppressing them."
3. "Reaping ... - This is indicative of an avaricious and overbearing disposition; compelling the poor to sow for him, and reaping all the benefit himself."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Hard [σκληρος]. Stronger than the austere [αυστηρος] of Luke 19:21 (see there), which is sometimes used in a good sense, as this never is."
2. "Strawed [διεσκορπισας]. Rev., didst scatter. Not referring to the sowing of seed, for that would be saying the same thing twice."
3. "The scattering refers to the winnowing of the loosened sheaves spread out upon the threshing - floor. 'The word,' as Trench observes 'could scarcely be applied to the measured and orderly scattering of the sower's seed. It is rather the dispersing, making to fly in every direction.'"

Note: The commentary is about Matthew 25:24.

### John Gill:
1. "For he that has the least gifts, is accountable for them; and therefore ought to make use of them to the good of his fellow creatures, and the interest of his Lord and Master."
2. "He calls him 'Lord', though he had not served him, and pretends he knew him; but if he had, he would have had a true affection for him, faith in him, and would have observed his commands."
3. "Christ is neither niggardly, nor exacting; he requires nothing that is not his, and gives his grace, and bestows his gifts liberally, and upbraids not."
