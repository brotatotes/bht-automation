# Matthew 25:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, there are various commentators who shed light on the concept. They describe how men tend to perceive God as a harsh and demanding master, holding Him responsible for their lack of productivity. However, these notions are inconsistent and self-convicting, for they do not align with the truth of God's character. Ultimately, God is loving and generous, bestowing grace and gifts while requiring only what is already His.
