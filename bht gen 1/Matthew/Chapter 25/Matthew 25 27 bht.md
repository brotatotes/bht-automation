# Matthew 25:27 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This verse reminds us that God has entrusted us with resources, and it is our responsibility to use them wisely and productively. The expectation is not just to maintain what we have been given but to actively seek to increase and multiply it. We are called to faithfully steward what has been entrusted to us, taking action and utilizing our talents for a greater purpose. This requires genuine love and devotion, not treating our service to God as a transactional arrangement but as a labor of love and a means to grow and develop.
