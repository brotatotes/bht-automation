# Matthew 25:28 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the command to take away the talent, whether it be a spiritual or temporal gift, is given. This act of judgment on the slothful servant becomes an act of mercy to the faithful one. The talent represents a gift that can be taken away unlike special grace, which is without repentance. While gifts may fail and cease, the more diligent and laborious ones are given more spiritual light and knowledge, making their gifts appear more illustrious through the slothfulness of others.
