# Matthew 25:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, there is a cautionary tale about the foolish virgins who were unprepared for the bridegroom's arrival. Their lack of oil signifies their lack of spiritual preparation and readiness. The warning is clear that true readiness for the Lord's return requires both a genuine relationship with God and the cultivation of a deep connection with the Holy Spirit, represented by the oil. This parable serves as a reminder to believers to not just have a superficial faith, but to have a heart filled with the oil of the Holy Spirit, which empowers faith to work through love.

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "The foolish virgins took their lamps, but they did not take any oil with them. This signifies their lack of preparation and readiness for the bridegroom's arrival."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Took no oil with them" - This phrase suggests that the foolish virgins were unprepared for the bridegroom's arrival, as they did not bring any oil for their lamps. 

2. "Probably none at all" - This indicates that the foolish virgins may have completely overlooked the need for oil, emphasizing their lack of foresight and preparedness. 

3. "Not realizing their lack of oil till they lit the torches" - This highlights the delayed realization of the foolish virgins, who only discovered their lack of oil when they attempted to light their lamps upon the arrival of the bridegroom.

### John Gill:
1. "The grace of the Spirit being of an holy and sanctifying nature, exceeding valuable and precious, and a curious piece of workmanship, and what is only applied unto, and bestowed on the elect of God and with which all the vessels of mercy, small and great, are anointed, and are made prophets, priests, and kings, and is what is, as that was, lasting and abiding."
2. "Grace, which comes from Christ, the true olive tree; is pure, and of a purifying nature; and comes through a bruised, crucified Christ; and being put into the heart, causes the light of good works, and a becoming conversation, to shine forth."
3. "Now these foolish virgins, though they took up a lamp of a profession, yet were unconcerned for the oil of grace, to fill, maintain, and trim this lamp: they were ignorant of the nature and use of true grace; they saw no need of it, and therefore did not ask for it, or about it; they neglected it, made light of it, and denied it as useless; and being destitute of it, took up their profession without it; and in this lay their folly."

### John Wesley:
1. "The foolish took no oil with them" - This highlights the lack of preparation and foresight on the part of the foolish individuals. They did not have enough oil to sustain their lamps, symbolizing a lack of faith and spiritual readiness.

2. "No more than kept them burning just for the present" - This emphasizes the short-sightedness of the foolish individuals. They only had enough oil to keep their lamps burning for the immediate moment, without considering the future or potential challenges that may arise.

3. "A lamp and oil with it, is faith working by love" - This statement underscores the importance of both faith and love in the Christian life. The lamp represents faith, while the oil symbolizes love. True faith is not just a passive belief but is active and fueled by love for God and others.
