# Matthew 25:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This verse warns of the danger of being spiritually unprepared, lacking the necessary oil of the Holy Spirit for a lasting relationship with God. The foolish virgins had the appearance of readiness but lacked the vital oil, symbolizing spiritual vitality and readiness. It emphasizes the need for a personal and intimate connection with God, as true faith requires more than religious practices and calls us to continually seek and cultivate a deep relationship with Him. Without the oil of grace and a faith working by love, our lamp can dim and our spiritual emptiness will be exposed.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:

### John Gill:
1. "The grace of the Spirit being of an holy and sanctifying nature, exceeding valuable and precious, and a curious piece of workmanship, and what is only applied unto, and bestowed on the elect of God and with which all the vessels of mercy, small and great, are anointed, and are made prophets, priests, and kings, and is what is, as that was, lasting and abiding."
2. "Grace, which comes from Christ, the true olive tree; is pure, and of a purifying nature; and comes through a bruised, crucified Christ; and being put into the heart, causes the light of good works, and a becoming conversation, to shine forth."
3. "Now these foolish virgins, though they took up a lamp of a profession, yet were unconcerned for the oil of grace, to fill, maintain, and trim this lamp: they were ignorant of the nature and use of true grace; they saw no need of it, and therefore did not ask for it, or about it; they neglected it, made light of it, and denied it as useless; and being destitute of it, took up their profession without it; and in this lay their folly."

### John Wesley:
1. "The foolish took no oil with them â€” No more than kept them burning just for the present."
2. "None to supply their future want, to recruit their lamp's decay."
3. "The lamp is faith. A lamp and oil with it, is faith working by love."
