# Matthew 25:30 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This verse describes a servant who, despite being given talents and gifts by the Lord, fails to utilize them effectively. He is cast into outer darkness, a place of separation from God's presence, where there is weeping and gnashing of teeth. This parable acts as a warning to believers, reminding them of the importance of faithfully using their gifts for the kingdom of God in order to avoid facing the same fate as the unprofitable servant. It also emphasizes that simply being harmless is not enough for salvation, as demonstrated by the servant's damnation.
