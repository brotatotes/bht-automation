# Matthew 25:32 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
At the final judgment, when Christ returns, the world will be consumed by fire. The dead in Christ will rise from their graves and the wicked will also be brought forth to face judgment. Christ's kingdom will be established and all nations will be gathered before Him. The righteous will receive a crown of glory, while the wicked will receive their deserved punishment. Angels will assist in this collection and the Judge will easily discern between the righteous and the hypocrites.
