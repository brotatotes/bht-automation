# Matthew 25:33 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the righteous are depicted as sheep placed on the right hand, a position denoting honor and favor, while the goats represent the wicked, positioned on the left hand, symbolizing dishonor and separation from God's favor. The imagery underscores the clear distinction between the two groups, emphasizing the forthcoming judgment that awaits each individual. The sheep, representing the innocent and virtuous, are set apart by the Good Shepherd, who shows affection and respect for them. Conversely, the goats symbolize the impure, graceless individuals who are offensive to Christ.
