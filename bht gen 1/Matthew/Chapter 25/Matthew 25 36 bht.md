# Matthew 25:36 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This verse calls us to extend true compassion beyond meeting physical needs, to also care for the emotional and spiritual well-being of others. It emphasizes the importance of reaching out to the vulnerable and marginalized, as our actions towards them are ultimately actions towards Jesus. Through acts of visitation, sympathy, and care, we are called to actively seek out and support those who are suffering and isolated. Clothed with love and protected with compassion, we are reminded of the importance of personal presence and attention in showing care for others.
