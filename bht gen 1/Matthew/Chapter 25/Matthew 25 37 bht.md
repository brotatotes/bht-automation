# Matthew 25:37 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, the righteous are depicted as cherished and noticed by God. They are surprised and humbled to discover the good they have done, unaware of the significant impact of their actions. Christ welcomes them into the kingdom prepared for them since the beginning of time, ensuring their immediate possession of their inheritance. The righteousness of these individuals, not their own works, is what qualifies them for a place at Christ's right hand. The righteous and the wicked alike struggle to comprehend the true worth of their actions, while only the Judge holds the ultimate understanding.

3. "The righteous shall be welcomed with a gracious invitation to inherit the kingdom prepared for them from the foundation of the world.
