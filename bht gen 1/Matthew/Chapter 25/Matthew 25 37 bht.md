# Matthew 25:37 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse being described talks about the distinction between the righteous and the wicked, highlighting their attitudes towards their own works. The righteous are characterized by their humility and gratitude towards God's grace and favor, understanding that their righteousness is a gift from Him rather than a source of self-righteousness. They do not depend on their works for salvation but see them as evidence of their faith and relationship with God. Both the righteous and the wicked are unaware of the true worth of their actions compared to how the Judge perceives them.
