# Matthew 25:38 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the commentators emphasize the actions of the believers towards Jesus in his earthly form and in his followers. As John Gill points out, the believers had never personally witnessed Jesus themselves, but they had seen him in others. They had provided for him when he was hungry, thirsty, and in need. Additionally, they had demonstrated their love for him by extending their care to his followers, especially those who were in need of clothing and provisions.
