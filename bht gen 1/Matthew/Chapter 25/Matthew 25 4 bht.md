# Matthew 25:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The parable being described highlights the contrast between the foolish and the wise. The foolish, lacking the essential preparation, symbolize those without the inward grace to meet Christ. In contrast, the wise recognized the need to continuously replenish their love and spiritual strength, actively nurturing it in their hearts. Their pursuit led to a state of unwavering faith, making their lamps burn bright until the Bridegroom arrived. The vessels containing the oil of grace represented the sanctified space within their hearts, where love and light flourished.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "The insufficiency of this without something else, of which they never possessed themselves, shows that 'the foolish' mean those who, with all that is common to them with real Christians, lack the essential preparation for meeting Christ."
2. "The wisdom of 'the wise' consisted in their taking with their lamps a supply of oil in their vessels, keeping their lamps burning till the Bridegroom came, and so fitting them to go in with Him to the marriage."
3. "This supply of oil, then, representing that inward grace which distinguishes the wise, must denote, more particularly, that 'supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ,' which, as it is the source of the new spiritual life at the first, is the secret of its enduring character."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "In their vessels (εν τοις αγγειοις). Here alone in the N.T., through αγγη in Matthew 13:48." 

2. "Extra supply in these receptacles besides the oil in the dish on top of the staff."

### John Gill:
1. "They were concerned for the true grace of God, being enlightened by the Spirit of God; they saw their need of the grace of God, and being directed by him where it was to be had, went to Christ for it."
2. "Here, in these vessels, sanctified by the Spirit of God, the wise virgins had the oil of grace, which is an internal thing: it is nothing in the head, in the tongue, or in the hand, but something in the heart."
3. "It is a principle of light, life, love, and holiness wrought in a man's heart; it has its seat in the mind, understanding, and judgment, in the will, conscience, and the affections."
