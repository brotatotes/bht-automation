# Matthew 25:42 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the repetition of the negative creates a powerful image of finality and condemnation, much like the sound of clods falling on a coffin or tomb. It is interesting to note the surprise displayed by both the sheep and the goats, highlighting the unexpected nature of their eternal destiny. These individuals were among Christians, yet they neglected to help the needy, revealing their lack of true faith, love, and grace. As a result, they are justly condemned and deemed unworthy of the Kingdom of Heaven.
