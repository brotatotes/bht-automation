# Matthew 25:43 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we find condemnation for those who failed to show compassion and hospitality towards those in need. The commentators emphasize that these individuals neglected to care for the poor members of Christ, even when they were in dire circumstances. Instead of extending a helping hand, they turned a blind eye, causing the needy to suffer. Their actions stand in stark contrast to the righteous, and as a result, they face a different fate.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### John Gill:
1. "Did not take the poor members of Christ into their houses, and take care of them in their families, when they were obliged to flee from their places of abode, or wandered about preaching the Gospel."
2. "Who must have perished in the streets, if others, that bore the Christian name, had not been more compassionate than they."
3. "Their conduct, behaviour, and character, are just the reverse of the righteous, and therefore it is no wonder that their sentence is different."
