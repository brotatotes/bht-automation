# Matthew 25:44 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, commentators warn about the futility of the excuses and self-righteousness displayed by the wicked. They emphasize that the day of judgment will expose the true intentions and callousness of those who despise the poor. The verse reveals the obstinacy and pride of the wicked, who stubbornly refuse to acknowledge their wrongdoing and fail to recognize Christ in those they dismiss. Ultimately, their attempts to justify themselves will be in vain as the truth is exposed in the presence of God.

2. "For whence comes the great cruelty of their pride towards the poor, but because they think that they will not be punished for despising them?"

### Philip Schaff:
