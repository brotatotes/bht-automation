# Matthew 25:45 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the narrator portrays someone who is deeply offended and authoritative, exuding an aura of stern countenance. Their response is characterized by an utter lack of provision, withholding even the smallest crumbs of bread or a sip of water from the needy. Interestingly, the narrator emphasizes that this neglect and absence of empathy is perceived by the offended individual as a personal affront, as if they themselves were personally subjected to such treatment.
