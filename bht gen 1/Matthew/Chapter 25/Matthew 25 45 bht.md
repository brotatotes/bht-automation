# Matthew 25:45 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, it is clear that those who fail to show kindness to the followers of Christ are ultimately revealing their lack of love for Him. The neglect of doing good to believers is a significant reason for condemnation, as it is viewed as a direct offense against Christ Himself. This neglect is seen as not just a lack of material support, but a heartless rejection of basic care and compassion, as if the individuals themselves were personally mistreated. Ultimately, these actions are condemned both by conscience, the light of nature, and divine revelation.
