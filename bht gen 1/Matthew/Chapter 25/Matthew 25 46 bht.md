# Matthew 25:46 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Bible verse being described is one that speaks about the concept of punishment and reward, specifically pertaining to the contrast between eternal life and everlasting suffering. Commentators emphasize that "punishment" refers to torment and suffering inflicted for crime, expressing absolute misery rather than annihilation. The sentence of punishment is pronounced upon the wicked, who would witness their own descent into punishment, while the righteous would observe the glory and eternal life. The verse highlights that the decisions made on this day of judgment are final and irreversible, with punishment and reward lasting for eternity.

### Henry Alford:
1. "The ζωή here spoken of is not bare existence, which would have annihilation for its opposite; but blessedness and reward, to which punishment and misery are antagonist terms."
2. "I very much questioned whether the thorough study of Scripture prophecy would not make me more and more distrustful of all human systematizing, and less willing to hazard strong assertion on any portion of the subject."
3. "The coincidence of these portions with the process of the great last things in Revelation 20:1-15; Rev 21:1-27 is never to be overlooked, and should be our guide to their explanation, however distrustful we may be of its certainty."

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Sentence, it should seem, was first pronounced—in the hearing of the wicked—upon the righteous, who thereupon sit as assessors in the judgment upon the wicked."
2. "Sentence is first executed, it should seem, upon the wicked, in the sight of the righteous—whose glory will thus not be beheld by the wicked, while their descent into 'their own place' will be witnessed by the righteous."
3. "The decisions of this awful day will be final, irreversible, unending."

### Albert Barnes:

2. "The original word translated here as 'punishment' means torment, or suffering inflicted for crime... It does not mean simply a 'state or condition,' but absolute, positive suffering."
3. "The literal meaning of the word ['everlasting'] expresses absolute eternity... the obvious and plain interpretation of the word demands this signification in this place."

1. "The word ‘punishment’ expresses positive misery, not ‘annihilation;’ especially ‘life,’ the contrasted expression, means here far more than mere continued existence."
2. "Endless and boundless life is contrasted with endless and boundless misery."
3. "The two facts, one transcendently glorious, the other unspeakably awful, are revealed: the details, blissful and terrible alike, are wisely withheld."

2. "There is such a distinction as Aristotle pointed out between μωρια (vengeance) and κολασις."
3. "The difficulty to one's mind about conditional chastisement is to think how a life of sin in hell can be changed into a life of love and obedience."

### John Gill:
1. "Their excuses will not be regarded, their pleas will be of no avail, their pretensions to interest in Christ, and love to him, will be set aside; the sentence will remain irrevocable, and there will be no appeal from it."
2. "These goats, or formal professors, shall be obliged, whether they will or not, to depart from the presence of Christ; the angels will be ordered to take and cast them into everlasting burnings."
3. "Such as are justified by the righteousness of Christ, and who, though they have done works of righteousness under the influence, and by the assistance of the grace of God, yet have not depended upon them, but upon Christ, for life and salvation: these shall go into heaven, the place appointed for them, to enjoy that eternal life in soul and body, which is the free gift of God, through Christ."

### John Wesley:
1. "Either therefore the punishment is strictly eternal, or the reward is not: the very same expression being applied to the former as to the latter."
2. "The wicked shall then go away into everlasting fire, in the view of the righteous. Thus the damned shall see nothing of the everlasting life; but the just will see the punishment of the ungodly."
3. "It is not only particularly observable here, 1. That the punishment lasts as long as the reward; but, 2. That this punishment is so far from ceasing at the end of the world, that it does not begin till then."
