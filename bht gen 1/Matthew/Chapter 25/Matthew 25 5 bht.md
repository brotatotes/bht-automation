# Matthew 25:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the disciples are depicted as slumbering and sleeping before being called to attend to Christ. Commentators emphasize the different states of slumber, highlighting both physical and spiritual aspects. The disciples' slumber is seen as a representation of the peace they were experiencing, whether it was true or false. Despite their ease and quietness, the sudden call from Christ disrupts their tranquil state.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Christ 'tarries,' among other reasons, to try the faith and patience of His people."
2. "The world 'slumbered' signifies, simply, 'nodded,' or, 'became drowsy'; while the word 'slept' is the usual word for lying down to sleep, denoting two stages of spiritual declension."
3. "Such was the state alike of the wise and the foolish virgins, even till the cry of the Bridegroom's approach awoke them."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Slumbered and slept [ενυσταξαν και εκαθευδον]. Slumbered is, literally, nodded." 
2. "Nodded is aorist, denoting a transient act, the initial stage of slumber. They dropped their heads." 
3. "Slept is imperfect, of continuous slumber."

These quotes highlight the different nuances of the words used in the verse, emphasizing the gradual progression from nodding to falling into a continuous slumber.

### John Calvin:
1. "Some interpret this slumbering in a bad sense, as if believers, along with others, abandoned themselves to sloth, and were asleep amidst the vanities of the world; but this is altogether inconsistent with the intention of Christ, and with the structure of the parable."
2. "There would be greater probability in explaining it to denote death, which overtakes believers before the coming of Christ; for it is not at that time only that we must look for salvation, but also when we have left the world and are sleeping in Christ."
3. "But I take it more simply as denoting earthly occupations, in which believers must be engaged, so long as they dwell in the body; and, though forgetfulness of the kingdom of God ought never to steal upon them, yet the distracting influence of the occupations of this world is not inappropriately compared to sleep."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Now while the bridegroom tarried; as they were waiting for him; an allusion to the delay of the Lord." 
2. "All slumbered and slept. Sleep overcame them, even while trying to keep awake. This probably refers to a gradual forgetfulness of, or ceasing to expect at once, the coming of Christ." 
3. "It indicates an unconscious giving way to the influence of the world. Christ's coming will be unexpected by all, even by those who make calculations about it."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "They all slumbered and slept" - This phrase paints a vivid picture of the disciples' physical state, emphasizing their complete unawareness of the events unfolding around them.
2. "Dropped off to sleep, nodded" - The use of these verbs highlights the gradual progression from wakefulness to drowsiness, capturing the disciples' inability to stay alert and focused.
3. "Many a preacher has seen this happen while he is preaching" - This observation draws a parallel between the disciples' physical slumber and the spiritual apathy that can sometimes be observed in listeners during sermons, reminding us of the importance of staying spiritually awake and engaged.

### John Wesley:
1. "Before they were called to attend him, they all slumbered and slept." 
2. "The wise enjoying a true, the foolish a false peace." 
3. "Were easy and quiet."
