# Matthew 25:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this parable, the bridegroom's delay serves as a trial for the faith and patience of believers. All the virgins, both wise and foolish, experienced a period of slumber and sleep, symbolizing spiritual lethargy and forgetfulness. The distinction between the wise and foolish lies in their inner state, with the wise having a genuine readiness and the foolish deceived by a false sense of peace. The delay of the bridegroom serves as a reminder that the timing of Christ's coming is uncertain, calling believers to remain vigilant and faithful.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Christ 'tarries,' among other reasons, to try the faith and patience of His people."
2. "The world 'slumbered' signifies, simply, 'nodded,' or, 'became drowsy'; while the world 'slept' is the usual word for lying down to sleep, denoting two stages of spiritual declension."
3. "Such was the state alike of the wise and the foolish virgins, even till the cry of the Bridegroom's approach awoke them."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The bridegroom tarried - That is, while they waited for him. It was uncertain at what time he would come. He delayed longer than they expected."
2. "All slumbered and slept - Waiting until near midnight, they fell into repose."
3. "This circumstance is designed simply to show more clearly the 'duty of being ready,' Matthew 25:13. It does not mean to affirm it 'as a fact' that none will be ready."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Slumbered is, literally, nodded." 
2. "Nodded is aorist, denoting a transient act, the initial stage of slumber."
3. "Slept is imperfect, of continuous slumber."

### John Calvin:
1. "Some interpret this slumbering in a bad sense, as if believers, along with others, abandoned themselves to sloth, and were asleep amidst the vanities of the world; but this is altogether inconsistent with the intention of Christ, and with the structure of the parable."
2. "There would be greater probability in explaining it to denote death, which overtakes believers before the coming of Christ; for it is not at that time only that we must look for salvation, but also when we have left the world and are sleeping in Christ."
3. "But I take it more simply as denoting earthly occupations, in which believers must be engaged, so long as they dwell in the body; and, though forgetfulness of the kingdom of God ought never to steal upon them, yet the distracting influence of the occupations of this world is not inappropriately compared to sleep."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Now while the bridegroom tarried; as they were waiting for him; an allusion to the delay of the Lord." 
2. "All slumbered and slept. Sleep overcame them, even while trying to keep awake. This probably refers to a gradual forgetfulness of, or ceasing to expect at once, the coming of Christ." 
3. "It indicates an unconscious giving way to the influence of the world. Christâ€™s coming will be unexpected by all, even by those who make calculations about it."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "They all slumbered and slept." - This phrase depicts a state of spiritual lethargy and complacency, highlighting the vulnerability of believers to become spiritually drowsy and lose their focus on God.
2. "They dropped off to sleep, nodded, and then went on sleeping." - The use of different tenses emphasizes the gradual progression of their spiritual slumber, indicating that it is not an instantaneous event but a gradual decline into spiritual apathy.
3. "Many a preacher has seen this happen while he is preaching." - This statement acknowledges the relatability of the scene, as it is not uncommon for preachers to witness their congregation becoming disengaged and spiritually drowsy during sermons. It serves as a reminder for both preachers and listeners to remain vigilant and attentive to God's Word.

### John Gill:
1. "Christ tarries to try the graces of his people, who should exercise faith in his coming, by looking, watching, and waiting for it, desirous of it, and hastening unto it; being ready for him, prepared to receive him, and to go with him to the nuptial-chamber."
2. "By this slumber, and sleep, is not meant a natural death... but a dead, lifeless, and sleepy frame of spirit in the wise virgins: which lies in grace not being in exercise; in a slothfulness to perform religious duties; in taking up a satisfaction with the outward parts of religion; in an indifference about the interest of Christ; in an unconcernedness at the omission of duty, or commission of sin; and in an entire ease of mind with regard to such a frame and state."
3. "The wise virgins are children of the day, and not of the night; though they sleep, their hearts wake, and they sleep with grace in their hearts; neither of which can be said of the foolish virgins, or formal professors."

### John Wesley:
1. "Before they were called to attend him, they all slumbered and slept" - This highlights the state of unawareness and complacency that both the wise and foolish virgins experienced before the arrival of the bridegroom. 

2. "The wise enjoying a true, the foolish a false peace" - This phrase emphasizes the difference in the inner state of the wise and foolish virgins. The wise virgins had a genuine sense of peace and readiness, while the foolish virgins were deceived by a false sense of security. 

3. "The bridegroom delayed" - This phrase indicates that the delay in the arrival of the bridegroom was a test for all the virgins. It reveals that the timing of the bridegroom's coming is uncertain, and it challenges the readiness and faithfulness of the virgins.
