# Matthew 25:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In a time when the Bridegroom is least expected, His arrival is likened to that of a thief in the night, catching people unaware. At midnight, a cry is made to announce His sudden arrival and prompt vigilance. This cry serves as a metaphor for the coming of Christ, a new and unexpected event that demands readiness and a spiritual awakening. As this parable reminds us, God's timing is often mysterious and His intervention brings light and hope into the darkness of our lives.
