### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Their folly consisted in not making provision against its exhaustion, by taking with their lamp an oil-vessel wherewith to replenish their lamp from time to time, and so have it burning until the Bridegroom should come."
2. "Certainly not. Since the parable was designed to hold forth the prepared and the unprepared to meet Christ at His coming, and how the unprepared might, up to the very last, be confounded with the prepared."
3. "The real difference between the two classes who profess to love the Lord's appearing is a radical oneâ€”the possession by the one class of an enduring principle of spiritual life, and the want of it by the other."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Burning until midnight, the oil was exhausted: they gave a dim and obscure light."
2. "They trimmed them by removing the burnt parts of the linen or the torch, so that they would burn clear."
3. "This strikingly represents the conduct of most people at the approach of death. They then begin to make ready. They are alarmed, anxious, and trembling, and then they ask the aid of others, but often when it is forever too late."
