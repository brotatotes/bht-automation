# Matthew 25:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The foolish virgins, deeply regretting their lack of preparedness, acknowledge the wisdom of the wise and seek their assistance. The imagery of the lamps going out illustrates the diminishing faith of those who only profess religion outwardly. This passage serves as a warning against negligence and emphasizes the urgency of nurturing and upholding genuine faith before facing the uncertainty of death or judgment. In their desperation, the foolish virgins realize the futility of seeking help elsewhere and come to recognize the emptiness of their own self-love-driven desires for grace.
