# Matthew 25:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, two groups are engaged in a conversation about oil. The wise group, recognizing the limited supply, kindly refuses to share, prompting the foolish group to realize that there might not be enough for all. The commentators emphasize the need for personal responsibility and reliance on God's grace. They caution against seeking salvation from others or relying solely on our own virtues. Ultimately, the verse encourages us to approach God to obtain the grace and salvation freely offered to us.

2. "It is merely a friendly way of reminding them of the proper way of obtaining the needed and precious article, with a certain reflection on them for having it now to seek." 
3. "Now, since what we pay the demanded price for becomes thereby our own property, the salvation which we thus take gratuitously at God's hands, being bought in His own sense of that word, becomes ours thereby in inalienable possession."

3. "Directing them to go to proper persons for grace; not to men, even ministers of the Gospel, nor to angels; but to God the Father, the Father of mercies, and God of all comfort, who sits on a throne of grace, and gives it liberally to them that come to him for it through Christ, and ask it of him."
