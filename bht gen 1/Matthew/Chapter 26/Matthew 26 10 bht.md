# Matthew 26:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, Jesus perceives an excellent and morally beautiful deed, a good work done out of sincere love to Him. It was a rebuke to some, while bringing comfort to others. Although misjudged by some, this act, directed by the inspiration of the Spirit, was founded on assured confidence and aimed to honor and glorify Christ. It teaches us that true courage and steadfastness in acting properly can only come from depending solely on the will of God, even when faced with criticism from those who profess to love Him.
