# Matthew 26:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, a noble act of love is displayed and praised. Jesus perceives and acknowledges this morally beautiful deed, which is founded on assured confidence and inspired by the Spirit. While some may misjudge and criticize such actions, Jesus defends and champions them, recognizing the motive and measuring the moral quality. The rebuke and disapproval from the disciples may trouble the doer, but it ultimately demonstrates the impact of this good work upon Jesus himself.
