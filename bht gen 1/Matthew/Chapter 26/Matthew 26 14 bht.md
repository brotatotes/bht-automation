# Matthew 26:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Judas Iscariot, one of Jesus' twelve chosen apostles, made a conscious decision to betray Jesus, disregarding the admonition and opportunity for salvation. Driven by his growing dissatisfaction, greed, and unchecked desires, Judas approached the chief priests, willingly offering to hand Jesus over to them. This cautionary tale reminds us of the complexity of human nature, the power of free will, and the importance of examining our own hearts and motivations to guard against succumbing to temptation and sin.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### John Calvin:
1. "Christâ€™s admonition was so far from being of any avail for softening the heart of Judas, or producing any change in it for the better, that he immediately went away, without any concern, to transact an infamous bargain with his enemies." (Commentary on Matthew 26:14)

2. "The bare mention of the burying ought to have softened a heart of iron; for it would have been easy to infer from it, that Christ offered himself as a sacrifice for the salvation of the human race." (Commentary on Matthew 26:14)

3. "This extremity of vengeance God does not execute on any but those who are already devoted to destruction. Let us therefore learn to repent early, lest our long-continued harshness should confirm the reign of Satan within us." (Commentary on Matthew 26:14)

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The principal motive, as is inferred from the strong expression of John (John 12:6), was avarice."
2. "The character of Judas laid him open to this Satanic influence, and nothing could do this more effectually than love of gain."
3. "The rest were neither well instructed nor highly spiritual, and in outward appearance Judas was probably equal to any of them."

### John Gill:
1. "He was not an open enemy, nor one of Christ's common hearers, nor one of the seventy disciples, but one of his twelve apostles, whom he made his intimates and associates; whom he selected from all others, and called, qualified, and sent forth to preach his Gospel, and perform miracles." 
2. "This man went to the chief priests; of his own accord, unasked, from Bethany, to Jerusalem, to Caiaphas's palace, where the chief priests, the implacable enemies of Christ, with the Scribes, and elders of the people, were met together, to consult his death."
3. "For nothing could have fallen out more to their wishes, who were met together on this design."

These quotes provide insight into Judas Iscariot's role as one of the twelve apostles, his voluntary decision to go to the chief priests to betray Jesus, and the satisfaction of the chief priests in Judas' offer to betray Jesus.

### John Wesley:
1. "Judas, one of the twelve disciples, made a conscious decision to betray Jesus. This highlights the complexity of human nature and the power of free will." 

2. "Judas' betrayal was not a spontaneous act, but a result of his growing dissatisfaction and greed. It serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of unchecked desires and the consequences of succumbing to them." 

3. "Judas' actions remind us that even those closest to Jesus are not immune to temptation and sin. It serves as a reminder to examine our own hearts and motivations, and to guard against the subtle ways in which we may be led astray."
