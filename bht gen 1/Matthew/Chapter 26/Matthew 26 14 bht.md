# Matthew 26:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the betrayal of Jesus by Judas, one of his chosen disciples, is depicted. The motive behind Judas' actions is understood to be rooted in his love for money and greed. This shocking act of betrayal is even more significant considering that Judas was not an outsider, but rather someone who was hand-picked by Jesus to be part of the twelve disciples. It serves as a reminder of the presence of evil and the vulnerability of even those closest to Jesus, emphasizing the importance of remaining faithful and guarding against temptation.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Philip Schaff:
1. "The principal motive, as is inferred from the strong expression of John (John 12:6), was avarice."
2. "The character of Judas laid him open to this Satanic influence, and nothing could do this more effectually than love of gain."
3. "Seeing the enmity of the rulers, hearing the denunciations upon the class, who as rich and honored filled the stations to which his desires pointed, convinced from the final prediction that our Lord would be put to death, the hour had come when his sordid soul was ready to listen to the suggestions of Satan."

### John Wesley:
1. "Judas, one of the twelve disciples, is singled out as the one who betrays Jesus. This highlights the shocking nature of his actions, as he was not an outsider or enemy, but someone who had been chosen by Jesus himself."
2. "The fact that Judas was willing to betray Jesus for money reveals his true character and motives. It shows that he valued material wealth more than his relationship with Jesus and the mission they were on."
3. "Judas' betrayal serves as a reminder of the presence of evil and the reality of human weakness. It reminds us that even those closest to Jesus are not immune to temptation and can fall into sin if they do not guard their hearts and remain faithful to him."
