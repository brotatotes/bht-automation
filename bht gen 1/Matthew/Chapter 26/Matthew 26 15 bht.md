2. "Thirty pieces of silver. Silver shekels, each worth a little more than two shillings, or fifty cents."
3. "Some think that this was the earnest money. But Judas returned thirty pieces (chap. Matthew 27:3), and the answer then given him indicates that the rulers were done with him."

### John Gill:
1. "He first made the motion; a barbarous and shocking one! to deliver his Lord and Master, with whom he had familiarly conversed, and from whom he had received so many favours, into the hands of those that hated him."
2. "They did not tempt him, by first offering him so much money, if he would betray him; but he himself first moves it to them, and tempts them with it to offer him an handsome reward."
