# Matthew 26:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, the mention of thirty pieces of silver alludes to the prophecy in Zechariah and emphasizes the low estimation of Jesus by the religious leaders. This exchange of thirty pieces of silver also fulfills Scripture, echoing the betrayal of the Messiah. It serves as a poignant reminder of the depths of human greed and the willingness to betray the innocent for selfish desires. The value of the silver, equivalent to the price of a slave, reveals their willingness to trade the Son of God for a meager sum of money.

### John Gill:
1. "He himself first moves it to them, and tempts them with it to offer him an handsome reward: and it is to be observed, that he does not mention the name of Jesus, either because they might be talking of him, when he came into their company; or else as suiting his language to theirs, who, when they spake of him, usually said, 'he', or 'that man', or 'this fellow'."

2. "The value of a shekel of gold, according to Brerewood, was, of our money, 'fifteen shillings'; and some make it to come to a great deal more; to 'one pound sixteen shillings and sixpence' sterling."

3. "Now thirty shekels of silver were the price of a servant, Exodus 21:32. So Maimonides observes, that the 'atonement of "servants", whether great or small, whether male or female, the fixed sum in the law is 'thirty shekels of good silver', whether 'the servant' is worth an hundred pound, or whether he is not worth but a farthing,' and which was in value of our money about 'three pounds fifteen shillings'."

2. "This exchange of thirty pieces of silver also echoes the prophecy in Zechariah 11:12-13, where the prophet foretells the betrayal of the Messiah for the same amount. It highlights the fulfillment of Scripture in the events surrounding Jesus' arrest and crucifixion." 

3. "The transaction of thirty pieces of silver serves as a poignant reminder of the depths of human greed and the lengths people are willing to go to satisfy their selfish desires, even at the cost of betraying the innocent."
