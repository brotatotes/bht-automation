# Matthew 26:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse being described is about the first day of unleavened bread, which marks the beginning of the Feast of Unleavened Bread, a significant event in the Jewish calendar commemorating the liberation from slavery in Egypt. The mention of the specific day, Thursday, adds credibility to the historical accuracy of the narrative. The parallel references to Exodus and the connection to Jesus as the ultimate Passover Lamb deepen our understanding of the sacrificial nature of Christ's death and its fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies.

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "The passover meal is meant, though in John 18:28 it is probable that the passover feast is referred to as the passover meal (the last supper) had already been observed."

1. "The first day of unleavened bread" refers to the beginning of the Feast of Unleavened Bread, which was a significant event in the Jewish calendar. This feast commemorated the Israelites' liberation from slavery in Egypt and their journey to the Promised Land. It was a time of remembrance and celebration of God's faithfulness and deliverance.

3. The parallel references to Exodus 12:6,15; Mark 14:12; and Luke 22:7 emphasize the significance of this day in both the Old and New Testaments. It shows the continuity and fulfillment of God's plan throughout history, as Jesus, the ultimate Passover Lamb, was crucified during the Feast of Unleavened Bread. This connection deepens our understanding of the sacrificial nature of Christ's death and its fulfillment of the Old Testament prophecies.
