# Matthew 26:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
On the night of the fifteenth of Nisan, with the purpose of declaring the signs and wonders done in Egypt to their fathers, the Israelites observe a significant event. This night is distinct from all others, as they repeat certain words and engage in rituals to provoke questions and discussions from the children. Failure to utter the three designated words - the passover, the unleavened bread, and the bitter herbs - on this night renders one subject to reproof. The repetition aims to strengthen the connection with their history and perpetuate remembrance.
