# Matthew 26:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, the disciples are gathered with Jesus during the Last Supper. They are questioned about who among them will betray Jesus, causing them concern and confusion. Despite their fear, the disciples do not react angrily and honestly express their disbelief that any of them could commit such a betrayal. The question posed reflects the humility and self-examination that should accompany their participation in the Lord's Supper, as even the most devoted followers are capable of questioning their own loyalty.

3. "The question 'Is it I, Lord?' reflects the humility and self-examination that should accompany the partaking of the Lord's Supper."
