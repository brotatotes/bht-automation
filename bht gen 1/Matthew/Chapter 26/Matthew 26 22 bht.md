# Matthew 26:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This passage from the Bible encompasses a moment of tension and questioning among the disciples. It begins with John seeking confirmation from Jesus, and is followed by a series of questions where each disciple wonders if they could be the one to betray him. Although the disciples are concerned and seek reassurance, their genuine denial of guilt and their loyalty to Jesus shines through. This scene sets the stage for the revelation of Judas as the betrayer.
