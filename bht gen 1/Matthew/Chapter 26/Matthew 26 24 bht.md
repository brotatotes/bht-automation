## BHT:
In this verse, we see how Jesus' journey from suffering to glory is in accordance with divine prophecies, as he willingly sacrifices himself for the expiation of sins. The consequences for the one who betrays Jesus are portrayed as miserable and regrettable, to the point where it would have been better if they had never been born. This raises a thought-provoking question about the fate of those who ultimately perish, suggesting a similar tragic outcome.
