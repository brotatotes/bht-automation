# Matthew 26:26 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this passage, commentators discuss the breaking of unleavened cakes during a feast and the symbolic significance of bread. They suggest that this breaking of bread during the paschal feast was not the usual breaking of Passover cakes. The bread used during these occasions was easily broken and represented Jesus' body, following the style of the Old Testament and the practices of the Jews during the Passover. The word "Eucharist" is also mentioned as a common name for the Lord's Supper, emphasizing its nature as a feast of thanksgiving.
