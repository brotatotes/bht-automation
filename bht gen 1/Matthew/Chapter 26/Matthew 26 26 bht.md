# Matthew 26:26 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As the disciples gathered for a meal, Jesus took the bread, broke it, and gave thanks, symbolizing the blessing of the offering. This act of breaking the bread and giving thanks marked the beginning of the Holy Communion, also known as εὐχαριστία. This bread, though not literally transformed into Christ's body, served as a powerful symbol of his body that would be broken and offered as a sacrifice for humanity's salvation. Through this sacramental union, believers partake in the flesh and blood of Christ, not merely as empty signs, but as a genuine participation in his redemptive work.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The looking up to heaven and giving thanks was a virtual ‘blessing’ of the meal or the bread."
2. "From this giving of thanks for and blessing the offering, the Holy Communion has been from the earliest times also called εὐχαριστία."
3. "In the literal meaning then, this (is) my Body, we have BREAD, ‘the staff of life,’ identified with THE BODY OF THE LORD: not that particular ἄρτος with that particular σάρξ which at that moment constituted the Body before them, nor any particular ἄρτος with the present Body of the Lord in heaven: but τοῦτο, the food of man, with τὸ σῶμά μου."

### John Calvin:
1. "While it is true that believers are commanded to give thanks to God, because he supports them in this fading life, Christ did not merely refer to ordinary eating, but directed his view to the holy action, in order to thank God for the eternal salvation of the human race."
2. "For what is the nature of a sacramental union between a thing and its sign? Is it not because the Lord, by the secret power of his Spirit, fulfills what he promises? So then those later instructions about the letter are not less absurd than the Papists."
3. "But now I must add, that it is not an empty or unmeaning sign which is held out to us, but those who receive this promise by faith are actually made partakers of his flesh and blood."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Took bread. The unleavened cakes, used on these occasions, easily broken."
2. "And blessed. As was the custom. Luke and Paul say: ‘gave thanks,’ which is the same thing."
3. "Take, eat; this is my body."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Jesus broke one of the passover wafers or cakes that each might have a piece, not as a symbol of the breaking of his body."
2. "The bread as a symbol represents the body of Jesus offered for us, 'a beautifully simple, pathetic, and poetic symbol of his death.'"
3. "Jesus, of course, does not mean that the bread actually becomes his body and is to be worshipped. The purpose of the memorial is to remind us of his death for our sins."

### John Gill:
1. "The paschal supper was now concluded, when Christ entered upon the institution of his own supper."
2. "Christ broke the bread, as the symbol of his body, which was to be broken by blows, and scourges, thorns, nails, and spear, and to be separated from his soul, and die as a sacrifice for the sins of his people."
3. "Now when he says, 'this is my body', he cannot mean, that that bread was his real body; or that it was changed and converted into the very substance of his body; but that it was an emblem and representation of his body."

### John Wesley:
1. "Jesus took the bread — the bread or cake, which the master of the family used to divide among them, after they had eaten the passover."
2. "This bread is, that is, signifies or represents my body, according to the style of the sacred writers."
3. "Now Christ substituting the holy communion for the passover, follows the style of the Old Testament, and uses the same expressions the Jews were wont to use in celebrating the passover."
