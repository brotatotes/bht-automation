## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "He gave, not to each, but once for all: in remarkable coincidence with Luke 22:17, λάβετε τοῦτο κ . διαμερίσατε ἑαυτοῖς." 
2. "It is quite uncertain whether our Lord followed minutely the Jewish practices, and we cannot therefore say whether the cup was one of wine and water mixed." 
3. "The πάντες is remarkable, especially with reference to the practice of the Church of Rome, which forbids the cup to the laity."

### John Calvin:
1. "As it was the design of Christ to keep our faith wholly fixed on himself, that we may not seek anything apart from him, he employed two symbols to show that our life is shut up in him."
2. "Christ, in order to show that he alone is able to discharge perfectly all that is necessary for salvation, says that he supplies the place of meat and drink; by which he gives an astonishing display of his condescension, in thus letting himself down to the feeble capacity of our flesh for the purpose of invigorating our faith."
3. "We learn that the Son of God employed two symbols together, to testify the fullness of life which he bestows on his followers. What right had a mortal man to separate those things which God had joined together?"

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Although the institution may have been independent of the regular mode of celebrating the Passover, the giving of thanks mentioned here, taken in connection with 1 Corinthians 10:16 (‘the cup of blessing’), indicates that this was a cup of thanksgiving, hence probably the third cup of the Passover feast."
