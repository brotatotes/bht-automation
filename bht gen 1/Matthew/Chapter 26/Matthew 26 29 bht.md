# Matthew 26:29 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, there is a contrast between something new in terms of time and something new in terms of quality. The newness refers to a future reunion and celebration in the heavenly kingdom, where all elements will be of a higher quality. Jesus, in directing believers to partake in the sacrament, points them to the perfect vision and fruition of the future Marriage Supper of the Lamb. This celebration signifies the assured victory of His militant Church and is a taste of the new and glorious kingdom of God.
