# Matthew 26:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, a diverse group of leaders, including chief priests, scribes, and elders, gathered in the open court or hall, forming the center of a building. They assembled for a meeting, not in a palace, but at the high priest's palace, perhaps for privacy. This meeting was not a casual gathering, but a formal assembly of religious and political figures, including members of the highest governing body, the sanhedrin. The presence of these chief priests, scribes, and elders emphasized the gravity and significance of the situation at hand, as they came together to discuss an affair of great importance.
