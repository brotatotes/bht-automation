2. "Christ spoke to them in the person of one man, who was to be admonished more than all the rest." This implies that Peter needed special attention and encouragement due to his impending denial of Christ.

This emphasizes the compassionate nature of Jesus, who wanted to ensure that Peter would not be completely devastated by his denial and would find comfort in his forgiveness.
