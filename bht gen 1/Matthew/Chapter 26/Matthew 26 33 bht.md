# Matthew 26:33 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, despite the love and devotion Peter has for Jesus, he allows his self-confidence and pride to overshadow the comforting promises given to him. Even if all others were to stumble or flee, Peter is sure of his unwavering loyalty to Jesus. However, his mistake lies in relying on his own strength rather than trusting completely in God's power. Peter's boastfulness leads him to a low point, even lower than the other disciples.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Philip Schaff:
1. "Instead of laying hold of the comforting part of the promise, Peter reverts to the first part." 
2. "The utterance of affection, yet of self-confidence and arrogance, since 'all' refers to the other disciples."
3. "Hence he was allowed to fall lower than the rest."

### John Gill:
1. "though all the men in the world, friends, and foes, though even all the rest of the disciples, who were his most intimate friends, most closely attached to him, and who dearly loved him, and sincerely believed in him, should be so stumbled at what should befall him, as to flee from him, and be tempted to relinquish his cause, and interest; yet nothing should ever cause him, in the least, to stumble and fall, to desert him, or hesitate about him, or cause him to take the least umbrage and offence at what might come upon him"
2. "he was positive of would be the case, not only that night, but ever after"
3. "No doubt he said this in the sincerity of his heart, and out of his great fervour of affection for Christ; but what he failed in, was trusting to his own strength, being self-confident"
