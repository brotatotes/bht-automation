# Matthew 26:36 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In a place called "the valley of fatness," Jesus sought refuge and communion with God, not to hide, but in anticipation of the approaching conflict and sacrifice. Gethsemane, with its ancient olive trees and association with abundant olive oil production, becomes a backdrop of provision amidst impending suffering. Jesus' deliberate choice of this location signifies his obedient surrender to the Father's will, exemplifying a model of prayer and trust in the midst of trial and anguish.
