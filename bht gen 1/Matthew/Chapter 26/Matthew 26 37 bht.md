# Matthew 26:37 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we witness a profound human experience of Jesus, as he takes with him three chosen disciples for comfort and support during his deepest moment of anguish and sorrow. Not only does Jesus feel the weight of his own impending suffering, but he also carries the burden of the sins of humanity. As he enters the depths of his anguish, his sorrow becomes severe, penetrating his soul and leaving him in a state of deep distress. Jesus, the man of sorrows, experiences immense grief and agonizing pain as he faces the suffering that lies ahead.
