# Matthew 26:37 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the midst of his divine glory on the mount, the chosen witnesses now find themselves witnessing the human anguish of our Savior in the valley. Though James and John, His favored disciples, were near Him, they could only offer comfort without the ability to truly help Him. Feeling forsaken and burdened with trouble, Jesus retreats into solitude, penetrated with sorrow and almost overwhelmed by the weight of His impending suffering that is yet to come.
