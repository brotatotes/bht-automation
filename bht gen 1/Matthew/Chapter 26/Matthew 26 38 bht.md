# Matthew 26:38 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we witness Jesus' profound sorrow and anguish as he faced the impending sacrifice for humanity. His soul was overwhelmed with grief, to the point of feeling half-dead. This sorrow was not merely caused by the physical pain, but also by the knowledge that he was facing God's judgment and bearing the weight of our sins. Jesus' suffering was immense, as he carried the burden of our transgressions and was brought to the very edges of death.
