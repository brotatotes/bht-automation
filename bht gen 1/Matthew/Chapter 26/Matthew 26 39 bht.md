# Matthew 26:39 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the midst of great reverence and sorrow, Jesus enters the Holy of Holies alone, aware of the sword of God's justice and the pouring down of God's wrath. Yet, He subordinates His desire for removal of the bitter cup to the holy will of His Father. Through prayer, Jesus as the Son of God expresses both reverence and boldness, addressing His Father in the face of impending sufferings and death. The extreme sorrows He experiences are necessary not for Him, but for us, and in His cries and tears, God hears and eases the severity of His inward conflict.
