# Matthew 26:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we see religious leaders using cunning and deceitful tactics to plot against Jesus, as they were threatened by his influence on the people. The leaders were puzzled about how to apprehend him and considered using subterfuge to secretly arrest him and deliver him to the Roman governor for execution. Despite their repeated attempts, Jesus had managed to escape their grasp in the past, leading to their increasing desperation to eliminate him. His powerful following among the crowds from Galilee made them fear losing their authority and control.
