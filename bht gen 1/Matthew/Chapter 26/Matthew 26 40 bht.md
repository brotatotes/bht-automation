# Matthew 26:40 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the disciples' inability to stay awake is highlighted as a point of disappointment for Jesus. The commentators express the extreme nature of their sleepiness, emphasizing that it was a result of both physical fatigue and sorrow. This sleep is likened to the spiritual sleep and drowsiness of believers, symbolizing a lack of responsiveness to the Word of God. Despite their close relationship with Jesus, the disciples were so deeply asleep that even His words were initially unable to rouse them.

1. "The chief reason of their sleepiness was their sorrow, as is expressed in Luke 22:45, what Christ had said to them of his soul troubles, and what they saw in him, had filled their hearts with sorrow, which brought on them an amazement and stupidity of mind; and this issued in sleep."
2. "Now, though this sleep was natural bodily sleep, which the disciples fell into, yet was an emblem of, and carried in it a resemblance to, the spiritual sleep and drowsiness of the people of God."
3. "Yet as the disciples were so much asleep, that the bare words of Christ did not arouse them from it for a while; so such is the sleep of the saints sometimes, that they are not to be aroused by the bare ministry of the word, though the most powerful arguments, and the most moving and melting language are made use of."
