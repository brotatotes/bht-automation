# Matthew 26:43 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, we see the disciples struggling with exhaustion and confusion. Mark highlights their confusion and uncertainty as they are left speechless in the presence of Jesus' wisdom and authority. Even the most knowledgeable and respected individuals can be left in a state of shock and uncertainty when faced with Jesus' questions. Additionally, the disciples' physical tiredness and drowsiness mirror their spiritual weariness and lack of awareness of the significant events that are unfolding before them. Despite their best efforts, they struggle to comprehend the gravity of Jesus' impending arrest and crucifixion.
