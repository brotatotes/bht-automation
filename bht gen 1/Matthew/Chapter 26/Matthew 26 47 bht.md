# Matthew 26:47 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In a moment of treachery, one of the chosen Twelve, Judas Iscariot, identifies Jesus to the religious authorities, leading to his arrest. The chief priests, fearing resistance, mobilize a large armed group to apprehend Jesus, even enlisting the help of a detachment of Roman soldiers. Judas's actions show the depth of his betrayal, as he not only guides the authorities to Jesus but also greets him with a kiss. Yet, amidst this scene of betrayal, Jesus displays remarkable submission, willingly surrendering himself to those who seek his arrest.

3. "The reason of this posse, and of their being thus armed, might be either for fear of the people, who, should they be alarmed, and have any notice of their design, might rise and make an uproar, and attempt to rescue him; or that by having a Roman band with them, and the chief priests and their officers, it might appear, that what they did they did by authority."
