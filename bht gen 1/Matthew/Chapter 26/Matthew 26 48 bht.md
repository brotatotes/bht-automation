# Matthew 26:48 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, the act of a kiss is used as a sign of intimate and cordial affection. Judas, restrained either by reverence or shame, attempted to conceal his treacherous intentions by delivering this kiss. He needed to provide the soldiers with a signal to identify Jesus, whom he feared might elude them through divine power or the support of His disciples. This sign was necessary because the soldiers were likely unfamiliar with Jesus and needed guidance to carry out their arrest.
