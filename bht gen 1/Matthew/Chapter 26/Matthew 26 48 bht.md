# Matthew 26:48 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this particular Bible verse, a sign is given by Judas to identify Jesus. The kiss he gives Jesus is seen as a sign of affectionate intimacy, but in this context, it becomes a revolting and treacherous act of an enemy. The kiss serves as a necessary indication for the Roman soldiers who might not have recognized Jesus otherwise. As Judas kisses Jesus fervently, it becomes clear that his intention to betray Jesus is camouflaged within this seemingly harmless gesture.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The common rendering of ἔδωκεν as a plusq. perf. is unnecessary and unwarranted: the aorist is simply historical, gave them a sign; when is not stated."
2. "On Mark's addition, καὶ ἀπαγάγετε ἀσφαλῶς, see notes there."
3. "The aorist tense in this context simply indicates that the giving of the sign occurred in the past, without specifying the exact timing."

### John Calvin:
1. "Judas was restrained, either by reverence for our Lord, or by shame for his crime, from venturing openly to avow himself as one of the enemies."
2. "The warning which, Mark tells us, he gave the soldiers — to lead them away cautiously, was given, I conjecture, for this reason, that he recollected the numerous proofs by which Christ had formerly attested his divine power."
3. "It was, at the same time, astonishing madness, either to attempt to conceal himself by frivolous hypocrisy, when he came into the presence of the Son of God, or to oppose the tricks and dexterity of men to his boundless power."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The kiss among the ancients was a sign of affectionate and cordial intimacy, and particularly a token of fidelity." 
2. "Judas may have feared He might still elude them, either by some exercise of His acknowledged power, or, more probably, with the help of His disciples." 
3. "The signal agreed upon would be necessary to point Him out to the Roman soldiers, who might not have understood the conversation or had orders to act upon this sign."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Judas had given the leaders to understand that he would kiss Jesus in order to identify him for certain."
2. "The kiss was a common mode of greeting and Judas chose that sign and actually 'kissed him fervently.'"
3. "This revolting ostentatious kiss is 'the most terrible instance of the εκουσια φιληματα εχθρου,' the profuse kisses of an enemy."

### John Gill:
1. "Judas himself might not be able to discern him, so as to point him out, until he came very near him."
2. "It is very likely that the Roman soldiers...might never have seen him, and so could not know him without some sign was given them."
3. "Judas might the rather pitch upon this to be the sign, partly because it might be what had been usual with the disciples...and partly because he might think this would best cover his treacherous designs."
