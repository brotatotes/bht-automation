# Matthew 26:49 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, a disciple named Judas approaches Jesus with a kiss. Commentators note the doubt surrounding the purpose of this kiss, suggesting it was a deceitful act of treachery. The compound verb used to describe the kiss signifies an ostentatious or emphatic salute. While the greeting may have appeared sincere, it was actually a pretense of compassion, disguising Judas' true intentions of betrayal. This act, reminiscent of previous acts of betrayal in the Old Testament, serves as a stark reminder of the deceptive nature of Judas' actions.
