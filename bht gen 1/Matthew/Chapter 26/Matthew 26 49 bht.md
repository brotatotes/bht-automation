# Matthew 26:49 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In a powerful and tender scene, a prominent figure in the Bible receives an ostentatious salute that includes an embrace and a kiss. This familiar act of greeting is used to express various emotions throughout the Scriptures, from the affectionate embrace of a prodigal son's return to the deceitful address of deceitful actions. This gesture is not simply a superficial greeting, but a deep and meaningful expression of both the emotions and intentions of those involved.
