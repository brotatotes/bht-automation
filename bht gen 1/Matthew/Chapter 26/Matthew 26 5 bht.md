# Matthew 26:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the commentators shed light on the circumstances surrounding the event described. God discreetly restrained the enemies from acting on their own accord, while His providence guided Christ's path to His sacrificial death. The religious leaders, driven by their desire to maintain power, planned to delay their schemes until after the feast to avoid a possible uprising. However, God's divine plan prevailed, and the true paschal Lamb was ultimately offered up on this significant day.
