# Matthew 26:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
During a significant feast, Christ's enemies were restrained by God, who had appointed Him to be a sacrifice. The timing was deliberate, to contrast the body with its shadow. This plan overruled the desires of Christ's enemies, who had initially decided to refrain from acting during the feast. Despite the human wisdom and fear of the people motivating their actions, God's counsel prevailed, ultimately leading to the crucifixion of Christ, the true paschal Lamb.
