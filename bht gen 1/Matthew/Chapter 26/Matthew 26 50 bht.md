The hypocrisy of Judas is exposed, revealing the true nature of deceit and the inevitable manifestation of evil in the presence of the Lord. This act of betrayal, exemplified by Judas' kiss, serves as a stinging rebuke, prompting reflection on the meekness, gentleness, and heroic behavior of Jesus throughout his suffering. With calm composure and dignity, Jesus willingly surrenders himself to his enemies, displaying his superiority even in captivity.
