# Matthew 26:51 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the heat of the moment, Peter, one of Jesus' disciples, impulsively draws his sword, aiming to cleave the head of the servant who had seized Jesus. However, divine intervention causes Peter to miss his intended target and instead, he slices off the servant's ear. This incident exposes Peter's zeal but also highlights God's unseen hand at work, protecting both Jesus and those who opposed him. The servant, identified as Malchus, was involved in the initial arrest of Jesus, leading to this intense moment.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The servant [τον δουλον] . The article marks the special servant; the body - servant." 
2. "Ear [ωτιον] . A diminutive in form but not in sense; according to a Greek popular usage which expressed parts of the body by diminutives."
3. "Peter aimed his blow at the servant's head, but missed."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Peter did not wait for the answer."
2. "Peter was no swordsman, for he missed his blow."
3. "Carnal weapons used in Christ's cause deprive His opponents of 'ears,' i.e., of willingness to listen to the truth."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Like the other Synoptics Matthew conceals the name of Peter, probably for prudential reasons as he was still living before A.D. 68."
2. "The sword or knife was one of the two that the disciples had (Luke 22:38). Bruce suggests that it was a large knife used in connexion with the paschal feast."
3. "Evidently Peter aimed to cut off the man's head, not his ear (ωτιον is diminutive in form, but not in sense, as often in the Koine)."

### John Gill:
1. "He being now thoroughly awaked with the rest, by what Christ had said to him; and more so by the surprise of the multitude of armed men about him; and remembering his solemn protestations of abiding by his master; and seeing him just now ready to be seized, and carried away; without knowing his master's mind, or waiting his answer to the question the other disciples put, stretched out his hand, and drew his sword." 

2. "The blow was levelled at his head, and with an intention, no doubt, to have cleaved him down, but sloping on one side took off his ear."

3. "The servant's name was Malchus, as John says; and it was his right ear that was cut off, as both he and Luke relate."

### John Wesley:
1. "Probably the person that seized Jesus first" - This quote suggests that the servant of the high priest who was struck may have been the one involved in the initial arrest of Jesus, providing context for the incident.
2. "Aiming, it seems, to cleave his head" - This quote highlights the severity of the attack, indicating that the person who struck the servant intended to cause serious harm or even kill him.
