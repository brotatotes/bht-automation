# Matthew 26:51 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, a servant of the high priest's is struck by Peter with a sword, resulting in the servant losing his ear. The commentators describe Peter's intent to harm the servant, with one stating that Peter narrowly missed aiming for a lethal blow. However, another commentator notes that there was divine intervention which caused Peter's strike to instead only cut off the servant's ear. This incident highlights the conflict between fervor and reason in the disciples' response to Jesus' arrest, reminding us of the importance of obedience to God's will and the need for moderation in our actions.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The real reason of the non-apprehension was, that the servant was healed by the Lord."
2. "This is the first opposition to ‘Thy will be done.’"
3. "The aim was a deadly one, and Peter narrowly escaped being one ὅστις ἐν τῇ στάσει φόνον πεποιήκει."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The servant [τον δουλον] . The article marks the special servant; the body - servant."
2. "Ear [ωτιον] . A diminutive in form but not in sense; according to a Greek popular usage which expressed parts of the body by diminutives."
3. "Peter aimed his blow at the servant's head, but missed."

### John Calvin:
1. "We are much more courageous and ready for fighting than for bearing the cross; and, therefore, we ought always to deliberate wisely what the Lord commands, and what he requires from every one of us, lest the fervor of our zeal exceed the bounds of reason and moderation."
2. "But as they improperly attempt more than the calling of God commands or permits, their rashness is justly condemned; and therefore let us learn, that in order that our obedience may be acceptable to the Lord, we must depend on his will, so that no man shall move a finger, except so far as God commands."
3. "One reason ought, above all, to lead us to be zealous in cultivating this modesty; which is, that instead of a proper and well-regulated zeal, confused irregularity for the most part reigns in us."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Peter did not wait for the answer."
2. "Carnal weapons used in Christ's cause deprive His opponents of 'ears,' i.e., of willingness to listen to the truth."
3. "Christ's grace may restore this willingness, as it healed this ear."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Matthew conceals the name of Peter, probably for prudential reasons as he was still living before A.D. 68."
2. "The sword or knife was one of the two that the disciples had."
3. "Evidently Peter aimed to cut off the man's head, not his ear."

### John Gill:
1. "He being now thoroughly awaked with the rest, by what Christ had said to him; and more so by the surprise of the multitude of armed men about him; and remembering his solemn protestations of abiding by his master; and seeing him just now ready to be seized, and carried away; without knowing his master's mind, or waiting his answer to the question the other disciples put." 

2. "Stretched out his hand, and drew his sword, and struck a servant of the high priest's, and smote off his ear."

3. "The blow was levelled at his head, and with an intention, no doubt, to have, cleaved him down, but sloping on one side took off his ear."
