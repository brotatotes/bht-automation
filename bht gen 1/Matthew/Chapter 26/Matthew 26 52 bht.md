# Matthew 26:52 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, Jesus' firm rebuke to Peter for his rash act of violence with the sword reinforces the principle that his kingdom operates under different principles than the world's kingdoms. This incident reveals Peter's initial misunderstanding of the true nature of Jesus' mission and the importance of the spiritual weapons the Church is called to employ, rather than resorting to carnal and violent measures. Moreover, Jesus's admonition that those who take the sword will perish with the sword serves as a cautionary reminder of the destructive consequences of responding to aggression with more aggression.
