2. "Jesus' response to Peter's action is a gentle rebuke, reminding him that those who live by the sword will die by the sword. This statement not only condemns violence as a means of achieving God's kingdom, but also serves as a reminder that the use of force ultimately leads to destruction and death."

### John Gill:
1. "This Christ said not only to rebuke Peter for his rashness, but to soften the minds of the multitude, who must be enraged at such an action."
2. "Had it not been for these words, and this action of Christ's; and more especially had it not been owing to the powerful influence Christ had over the spirits of these men, in all probability Peter, and the rest of the apostles, had been all destroyed at once."
