# Matthew 26:56 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the face of the Passion and Death of Christ, the Scriptures find their central point, fulfilling the prophecies and purpose of a merciful God. Fulfilling what was predicted, wicked men unknowingly carry out God's plan, directed by His providence even amidst chaos. As Christ willingly surrenders Himself for others, His disciples flee in fear, yet the Church stands firm, for new Christians replace the old, despite the disciples' ingratitude. Christ's meekness in betrayal and the disciples' momentary weakness all play a part in the grand design of God's redemption.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The Passion and Death of Christ were especially ἡ τῶν γραφῶν πλήρωσις. In this they all found their central point."
2. "Some of them did not flee far. Peter and John went after Him to the palace of the High-priest."
3. "ὅτε μὲν γὰρ κατεσχέθη, ἔμενον · ὅτε δὲ ἐφθέγξατο ταῦτα πρὸς τούς ὄχλους, ἔφυγον · εἶδον γὰρ λοιπόν, ὅτι οὐκ ἔτι διαφυγεῖν ἔνι, ἑκόντος ἑαυτὸν παραδόντος αὐτοῖς καὶ λέγοντος κατὰ τὰς γραφὰς τοῦτο γίνεσθαι."

### John Calvin:
1. "First, therefore, we are here informed, that whatever may be the unbridled rage by which Satan and all ungodly men are actuated, still the hand of God always prevails, so as to draw them reluctantly wherever he pleases."
2. "Secondly, we are informed, that though wicked men fulfill what was predicted in the Scriptures; yet, since God does not employ them as his lawful ministers, but directs them, by a secret movement, to that which was farthest from their wish, they are not excusable."
3. "While all things are mingled in confusion, and while the devil, by spreading darkness abroad, appears to overturn the whole order of the world, let us know that the providence of God shines above in heaven, to bring at length to order what is confused."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "This word of our Lord is therefore His final surrender of Himself to death; a willing offering of Himself for others, in accordance with the purpose of a merciful God."
2. "Only after Christ died for men, could men die for Him."
3. "The Church can never fail; new Christians take the place of the old ones."

### John Gill:
1. "The Scriptures of the prophets he refers to, as having, or about to have, by this conduct, their accomplishment, were such, as regarded the betraying him by Judas, the taking him in this secret, private, insidious, yet violent manner; in all which he showed great meekness, calmness, and submission." 

2. "Then all the disciples forsook him and fled; not only went away from him, and left him alone, as he foretold they would, John 16:32, but they ran away from him in a precipitant manner, like timorous sheep, the shepherd being about to be smitten."

3. "Every thing in this account is an aggravation of their pusillanimity, and ingratitude; as that they were the 'disciples' of Christ that forsook him, whom he had called, and sent forth as his apostles to preach his Gospel; and to whom he had given extraordinary gifts and powers."
