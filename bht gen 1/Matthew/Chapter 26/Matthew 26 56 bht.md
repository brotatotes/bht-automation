# Matthew 26:56 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we learn that despite the unbridled rage of Satan and wicked men, the hand of God prevails, guiding them unwillingly to fulfill His purposes. This demonstrates that even in the midst of chaos, God's providence shines above, bringing order to the world. The verse also highlights Jesus's willingness to sacrifice Himself for others, fulfilling God's merciful purpose. Furthermore, it reminds us that through Christ's death, believers are empowered to give their lives for Him, and the Church is sustained by the continuous influx of new Christians.
