## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "He was ἀρχιερεὺς τοῦ ἐνιαυτοῦ ἐκείνου, Annas having been deposed, and since then the High-priests having been frequently changed by the Roman governors." 
2. "Probably they had assembled by a preconcerted design, expecting their prisoner."
3. "This was a meeting of the Sanhedrim, but not the regular assembly, which condemned him and handed Him over to Pilate."

### John Calvin:
1. "According to the flesh, it was disgraceful that the Son of God should be seized, bound, and made a prisoner; but when we reflect that by his chains we are loosed from the tyranny of the devil, and from the condemnation in which we were involved before God, not only is the stumbling-block, on which our faith might have struck, removed out of the way, but in place of it there comes an admiration of the boundless grace of God, who set so high a value on our deliverance, as to give up his only-begotten Son to be bound by wicked men." 

2. "This will also be a pledge of the astonishing love of Christ towards us, that he spared not himself, but willingly submitted to wear fetters on his flesh, that our souls might be freed from fetters of a far worse description." 

3. "And here a frightful and hideous spectacle is placed before our eyes; for nowhere else than at Jerusalem was there at that time either a temple of God, or lawful worship, or the face of a Church. The high priest was a figure of the only Mediator between God and men; those who sat along with him in the council represented the whole Church of God; and yet all of them unite in conspiring to extinguish the only hope Of salvation."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Appointed by the Romans, Annas having been deposed, as frequently occurred."
2. "Mark inserts 'the chief priests,' indicating a meeting of the Sanhedrin or council."
3. "The examination before Annas would allow time for them to come together."

### John Gill:
1. "They led him away to Caiaphas, the high priest; who was high priest that year; for the priesthood was frequently changed in those times." 
2. "The year before this, Simeon, or Simon ben Camhith, was high priest; and the year before that, Eleazar, the son of Ananus; and before him, Ishmael ben Phabi, who were all three, successively, made high priests by the Roman governor."
3. "A council was held about a week before this, in which Caiaphas assisted, and then gave counsel to the Jews, that it was expedient, that one man should die for the people."

### John Wesley:
1. "The fact that Jesus was led away to Caiaphas, the high priest, highlights the religious authority that was involved in his trial and ultimately his crucifixion." 

2. "The mention of Annas, the father-in-law of Caiaphas, suggests a complex web of familial and political connections within the religious leadership of the time." 

3. "This sequence of events emphasizes the orchestrated nature of Jesus' arrest and subsequent trial, revealing the collusion between religious and political powers to bring about his downfall."
