# Matthew 26:58 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the shadow of the night, one of Jesus' closest disciples, Peter, hesitated and followed from a distance. His love for his Master urged him on, but fear held him back, keeping him at a safe distance. Yet, unwittingly, Peter found himself among the very ones who would later play a part in the capture of Jesus. This ironic twist revealed the conflict within Peter, torn between loyalty and self-preservation.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Philip Schaff:
1. "Peter followed afar off. Not out of curiosity, yet like a mere spectator. Such following leads to danger, not to victory."
2. "Entered in. John tells that he himself, as an acquaintance of the high priest, went in, while Peter stood without; the former procured admission for the latter."
3. "And sat with the officers. Those who had been engaged in the capture. He remained there for some time, from about midnight to cock crowing."

### John Gill:
1. "Peter's following Christ showed love to him; he was loathe to leave him, his bowels moved towards him, and he wanted to know how it would fare with him, and what would become of him."
2. "Keeping at a distance, following him afar off, betrayed fear, lest he should be observed, and taken up, and come into danger."
3. "It showed want of integrity at that time, and some degree of hypocrisy, in placing himself among the servants of the high priest, as if he was none of the followers of Jesus, but was of the same complexion and cast with them."

### John Wesley:
1. "Love constrained him to follow his Master."
2. "Fear made him follow afar off."
3. "Unfit companions as the event showed."
