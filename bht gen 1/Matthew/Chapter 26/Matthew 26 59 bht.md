# Matthew 26:59 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the face of Jesus' trial, the chief priests and elders resorted to deceitful measures, seeking false witnesses whose testimony could lead to Jesus' death. Their intention was clear - they were determined to find any reason to condemn Jesus, even if it meant bending their own rules and procedures. Their actions reveal a deep-seated prejudice against Jesus and a willingness to corrupt the justice system to achieve their desired outcome. Their relentless pursuit of false testimony and the promise of rewards expose the extent of their hatred towards Jesus and their desperation to bring about his downfall.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### John Calvin:
1. "By these words the Evangelists remark, that nothing was farther from the design of the priests than to inquire into the cause, so that, when the matter was thoroughly understood, they might decide what was proper."
2. "In seeking false witnesses, their treacherous cruelty is manifested; and when, after being disappointed of their expectation, they still do not desist, this affords a still more striking display of their blinded obstinacy."
3. "Thus, amidst the darkness of their rage, the innocence of the Son of God shone so brightly, that the devils themselves might know that he died innocent."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The Sanhedrin, Joseph of Arimathea and Nicodemus were probably absent (Luke 23:51), since their opposition would have been in vain."
2. "It was not the first time this body had consulted against Him."
3. "Knowing that true witness could not be had, they actually sought 'false witness.' Such a sin is greatest in judges."

### John Gill:
1. "Now these thus assembled together, sought false witness against Jesus, to put him to death." This quote highlights the malicious intent of the chief priests and elders, who were determined to find any reason to condemn Jesus to death, even if it meant resorting to false witnesses.

2. "Their manner of procedure in judgment against a false prophet, a deceiver, and one that enticed to idolatry, and such an one they would have Jesus to be, was quite different from what they took with other persons." This quote reveals that the religious leaders were willing to bend their own rules and procedures in order to secure a conviction against Jesus, further emphasizing their unjust and biased treatment of him.

3. "The sanhedrim cannot be thought to do this in person, but they sent out their officers to seek for such men, as could or would produce anything against him, and no doubt promised them a handsome reward."

It highlights their desperation to find any evidence, no matter how fabricated, to support their case against him.
