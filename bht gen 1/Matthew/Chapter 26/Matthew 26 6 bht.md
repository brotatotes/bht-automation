## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Not at this time a leper, or he could not be at his house receiving guests."
2. "It is at least possible that he may have been healed by our Lord."
3. "Who he was, is wholly uncertain."

These quotes provide insights into the identity and condition of Simon, highlighting the possibility of his healing and the uncertainty surrounding his background.

### John Calvin:
1. "They did not venture to attack Christ by open violence, and to oppress him by stratagem was no easy matter; but now that Judas suggests to them a plan of which they had not thought, the very facility of execution leads them to adopt a different opinion."
2. "John 12:3 expresses the name of the woman who anointed Christ, which is omitted by the other two Evangelists; but he does not mention the person who received Christ as a guest, while Matthew 26:6 and Mark 14:3 expressly state that he was then at supper in the house of Simon the leper."
3. "As to its being said by John that his feet were anointed, while the other two Evangelists say that she anointed his head, this involves no contradiction. Unquestionably we know that anointments were not poured on the feet; but as it was then poured in greater abundance than usual, John, by way of amplification, informs us that Christâ€™s very feet were moistened with the oil."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Probably already healed by Jesus, since otherwise he would have been unclean."
2. "He must not be confounded with the Pharisee called Simon, at whose house in Galilee a similar anointing had taken place long before (Luke 7:36-50)."
3. "Both families may have occupied the same house; or Simon may have been the owner, and Lazarus his tenant."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "All sorts of fantastic theories have arisen about it."
2. "Some even identify this Simon with the one in Luke 7:36, but Simon was a very common name and the details are very different."
3. "Some hold that it was Martha's house because she served (John 12:2) and that Simon was either the father or husband of Martha, but Martha loved to serve and that proves nothing."

### John Gill:
1. "The time of Christ's death being at hand, he keeps nigh to Jerusalem, where he was to suffer and die, in the room and stead of sinners."
2. "This Simon was one of those lepers that had a sense of his mercy, and was grateful for it, as appears by his entertaining Christ at his house."
3. "Christ goes in and dwells with such whom he heals, and with such he is always welcome."

### John Wesley:
1. "This act of anointing Jesus with expensive perfume was an extravagant display of love and devotion. It was a powerful symbol of pouring out everything for Jesus, holding nothing back. It challenges us to examine our own hearts and ask ourselves if we are willing to give our all for Him." 

2. "The woman's act of anointing Jesus' feet with her tears and wiping them with her hair demonstrated a deep humility and reverence. It reminds us that true worship involves not only our words and actions, but also the posture of our hearts." 

3. "Jesus' response to the disciples' criticism of the woman's action teaches us the value of sacrificial giving. He commends her for her act of love and declares that her story will be told wherever the gospel is preached. This reminds us that our acts of devotion and sacrifice have eternal significance."
