# Matthew 26:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, a woman pours expensive perfume on Jesus' head as an extravagant expression of love and devotion. Her act challenges us to examine our own willingness to sacrifice for Jesus and reminds us to appreciate and value acts of devotion, regardless of how unconventional or extravagant they may seem to others. Jesus's response to the criticism of the disciples serves as a reminder not to judge or dismiss the expressions of love and adoration offered to God.

### John Calvin:
1. "They did not venture to attack Christ by open violence, and to oppress him by stratagem was no easy matter; but now that Judas suggests to them a plan of which they had not thought, the very facility of execution leads them to adopt a different opinion."

2. "John 12:3 expresses the name of the woman who anointed Christ, which is omitted by the other two Evangelists; but he does not mention the person who received Christ as a guest, while Matthew 26:6 and Mark 14:3 expressly state that he was then at supper in the house of Simon the leper."

3. "As to its being said by John that his feet were anointed, while the other two Evangelists say that she anointed his head, this involves no contradiction. Unquestionably we know that anointments were not poured on the feet; but as it was then poured in greater abundance than usual, John, by way of amplification, informs us that Christ's very feet were moistened with the oil."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Probably already healed by Jesus, since otherwise he would have been unclean."
2. "He must not be confounded with the Pharisee called Simon, at whose house in Galilee a similar anointing had taken place long before (Luke 7:36-50)."
3. "Both families may have occupied the same house; or Simon may have been the owner, and Lazarus his tenant."

### John Gill:
1. "The time of Christ's death being at hand, he keeps nigh to Jerusalem, where he was to suffer and die, in the room and stead of sinners."
2. "This Simon was one of those lepers that had a sense of his mercy, and was grateful for it, as appears by his entertaining Christ at his house; and may teach us thankfulness to Christ, who has healed all our diseases."
3. "Christ goes in and dwells with such whom he heals, and with such he is always welcome."

### John Wesley:
1. "This act of pouring the expensive perfume on Jesus' head can be seen as an extravagant expression of love and devotion. It shows the woman's willingness to give her best to honor Jesus, regardless of the cost or what others may think."
2. "The woman's action also serves as a reminder that true worship and discipleship involve sacrifice. It challenges us to examine our own hearts and consider what we are willing to give up for the sake of honoring and following Jesus."
3. "Jesus' response to the criticism of the disciples highlights the importance of recognizing and appreciating acts of devotion and worship, even if they may seem unconventional or extravagant to others. It reminds us not to judge or dismiss the expressions of love and adoration that others offer to God."
