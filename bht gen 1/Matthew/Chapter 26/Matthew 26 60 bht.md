# Matthew 26:60 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, there are false witnesses who try to distort the words of Christ, twisting them into a crime. The false witnesses could not find any evidence to condemn Him, but eventually, two of them came forward, although their testimony was flawed. Christ's words were misunderstood and misinterpreted, as some of what was said was true, but not in the sense that the false witnesses portrayed.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### John Calvin:
1. "The appellation of false witnesses is applied not to those who contrive a lie which had no foundation, but to those who calumniously pervert what was justly said, and turn it into a crime."
2. "Christ had indeed said, that when the temple of his body was destroyed, he would raise it up within three days."
3. "The false witnesses do not now resort to some new contrivance, but they put a wrong interpretation on his words, as if he boasted that he would practice some juggling in building the temple."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "And found it not, i.e., to answer their purpose."
2. "Many false witnesses came, as was natural; but two witnesses to one specific point were required."
3. "Afterward; after numerous vain attempts to find two, even apparently concordant, witnesses."
4. "Two. The smallest number requisite."

### John Gill:
1. "Though many false witnesses came, yet found they none; whose testimonies were sufficient to put him to death, which was what they were resolved upon."
2. "According to their law, a man must not die by the mouth of one witness only, but by the mouth of two or three witnesses agreed in a point."
3. "They could not put up, as they otherwise willingly would, with any sort of witnesses: at the last came two false witnesses; who were agreed in a point, and whose testimonies were alike."

### John Wesley:
1. "Yet found they none — On whose evidence they could condemn him to die."
