# Matthew 26:60 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In their attempt to condemn Jesus to death, the religious leaders sought false witnesses but were unable to find any whose testimonies were consistent or sufficient. According to Jewish law, at least two witnesses were required, and the witnesses presented by the religious leaders did not meet this criterion. Despite their efforts, the false witnesses were unable to provide convincing evidence against Jesus. Additionally, it is important to note that some of the words attributed to Jesus were either misinterpreted or completely fabricated.
