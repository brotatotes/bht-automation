# Matthew 26:61 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, the witnesses falsely accused Jesus of intending to destroy the temple. However, the commentators shed light on the true meaning of Jesus' words. He referred to his own body as the temple, not the physical temple made with hands. The witnesses misquoted and misinterpreted his words, presenting a twisted version of what he actually said. Their discrepancies and deliberate misrepresentation further reveal their ulterior motives and lack of understanding.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "According to him, they said, 'We heard him say, I will destroy this temple that is made with hands, and within three days I will build another made without hands.'"
2. "That which they 'attempted' to accuse him of is what he had said respecting his body and their destroying it, John 2:19; 'Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.'"
3. "They neither stated it as it was, nor did they state correctly its meaning, nor did they agree about the words used. It was therefore very little to their purpose."

2. "Nor did he say one word about the temple of God... but only 'this temple', referring to his body, or human nature; in which he, the Son of God, dwelt, as in a temple."
3. "Intending the resurrection of his body by his own power, after it had been dead three days; and so they perverted his sense, as well as misquoted his words."
