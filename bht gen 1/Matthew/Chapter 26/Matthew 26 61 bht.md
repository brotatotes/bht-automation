## BHT:
In this Bible verse, the commentators shed light on the true meaning of Jesus' words. They emphasize that when Jesus said, "destroy this temple," he was referring to his own body, not the physical temple. His words were not a boast of power or a desire to destroy, but rather an invitation for the Jews to take action. Furthermore, the commentators clarify that Jesus did not claim to be able to rebuild the temple, but rather proclaimed his ability to raise his own body from death after three days.
