# Matthew 26:62 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the midst of a tense and heated exchange, Jesus chooses to remain silent, withholding the deeper meaning of His words from His audience. This deliberate choice demonstrates His knowledge that His time had come and that an explanation was unnecessary. The high priest, fueled by anger and aggression, demands answers, but Jesus, in his silence, displays a wisdom that surpasses the frivolity of the objection. Despite the pressure to respond, Jesus remains resolute, recognizing that silence allows truth to speak for itself.

### Henry Alford:
1. "Our Lord was silent; for in answering He must have opened to them the meaning of these his words, which was not the work of this His hour, nor fitting for that audience."
2. "It is not easy to say whether this sentence ought to be taken as one question or two."

### John Calvin:
1. "Christ was silent when false witnesses pressed hard upon him...because he did not seek to be now acquitted, knowing that his hour was come."
2. "Caiaphas triumphs over him on account of his silence, as if he was struck dumb by being vanquished; which is usually the case with men who are conscious of having done wrong."
3. "Christ was again silent, not only because the objection was frivolous, but because, having been appointed to be a sacrifice, he had thrown aside all anxiety about defending himself."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Silence would be a contempt of important testimony."
2. "Is it true or false? if true, what is its meaning?"
