# Matthew 26:63 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In a tense and solemn moment, the high priest speaks urgently, demanding an oath from Christ. The authority of the high priest is evident as he adjures the Lord, with a specific intention or plan in mind. Christ's silent submission before his judges leads to their self-condemnation, while the choice presented to the high priest's court is between convicting Christ as a blasphemer or an impostor. In this pivotal moment, the divinity of Christ becomes unmistakable, as the title "the Christ, the Son of God" holds the clearest and most definite testimony.
