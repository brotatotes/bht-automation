# Matthew 26:63 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this passage, the high priest, with his title of Christ, calls upon Jesus to take an oath, recognizing the significance of the prophecies that hold him as the Messiah. Jesus responds by maintaining his silence, fully aware of the predetermined outcome and the futile attempt to defend himself. Despite the weight of the high priest's words and the accusations against him, Jesus remains resolute and composed, refusing to engage in the futile exercise of attempting to sway his accusers.

1. "Jesus came publicly forward, bearing the title of the Christ. Why do they not consider the fact itself? Why do they not examine the signs, by means of which a correct decision might have been formed?"
2. "From the words of Caiaphas we may infer, that it was at that time common among the Jews to bestow on the Messiah the title of the Son of God."
3. "Such is also his reason for using the word Blessed, which Mark gives instead of God; for this pretended reverence for God was intended to bring a heavier charge against Christ than that of profaning the holy name of God."

2. "They merely offered the alternative of a conviction as a blasphemer or an impostor."

2. "To be silent in a court of judicature is the fourth virtue; this Christ had, and all others."
3. "Jesus was given out to be the Messiah, and his disciples believed him to be the Son of God, and he had affirmed himself to be so; wherefore the high priest, exerting his priestly power and authority, puts him upon his oath."
