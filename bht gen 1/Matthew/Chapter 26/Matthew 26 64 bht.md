## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "By 'σὺ εἶπας', more may perhaps be implied than by Mark's ἐγώ εἰμι: that is a simple assertion: this may refer to the convictions and admissions of Caiaphas."
2. "ἀπʼ ἄρτι: The glorification of Christ is by Himself said to begin with his betrayal, see John 13:31; from this time from the accomplishment of this trial now proceeding."
3. "The ὄψεσθε is to the council, the representatives of the chosen people, so soon to be judged by Him to whom all judgment is committed."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Thou hast said the truth; or, as Luke Luke 22:70 has it, 'Ye say that I am.' This was not, however, said 'immediately.' Before Jesus acknowledged himself to be the Messiah, he said to them Luke 22:67-68, 'If I tell you ye will not believe, and if I also ask you' - that is, propose the proofs of my mission, and require you to give your opinion of them 'ye will not answer me, nor let me go.'" 

2. "Nevertheless - This word should have been translated: 'moreover or furthermore.' What follows is designed to explain and give confirmation to what he had said."

3. "Sitting on the right hand of power - That is, of God, called here the Power - equivalent to 'the Mighty, or the Almighty.' It denotes dignity and majesty; for to sit at the right hand of a prince was the chief place of honor."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Thou hast said. An affirmation. You have spoken the truth." 
2. "What thou hast asked me is the fact." 
3. "Apart from my affirmation, you shall see for yourself."

### John Calvin:
1. "If I tell you, says he, you will not believe: by which words he means, that though he were to prove to them a hundred times that he was the Christ, it would be of no avail with obstinate men."
2. "Jesus affirms that he is the Christ, not for the purpose of avoiding death, but rather of inflaming the rage of his enemies against him."
3. "For by this word hereafter he distinguishes between his first and second coming. We may draw from this a useful doctrine, which is still more extensive. For how comes it that wicked men are so much at their ease? How comes it that they are so insolent in rebellion, but because they do not set a high value on the crucified Jesus?"

### Philip Schaff:
1. "To be silent would be construed as a confession that He was not the Messiah."
2. "This calm response, drawn out by the oath, is a public declaration of His Messiahship."
3. "His glory would appear to them as a sign of its truth. He was conscious of His glory in the moment of His condemnation, in His deepest humiliation."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Thou hast said": This affirmative reply from Jesus acknowledges Caiaphas' statement but also hints at a deeper meaning, suggesting that Jesus is indeed the fulfillment of the prophecies in Daniel and Psalms.
2. "I am": Mark's version of this statement emphasizes Jesus' divine identity, affirming that he is the Messiah and the Son of God.
3. "The day will come when Jesus will be the Judge and Caiaphas the culprit": Jesus not only acknowledges his role as the Judge in the future but also implies that Caiaphas, as the high priest, will be held accountable for his actions. This highlights the ultimate authority and justice of Jesus.

### John Gill:
1. "He might truly say he was the Messiah, since all the characters of him in the books of the prophets, met in him; and all the miracles he was to work in proof of his Messiahship were wrought by him."
2. "By 'the son of man', is meant Christ in the human nature; who then appeared at their bar as a mere man, in a very despicable form and condition, but hereafter they should see him in a more glorious one, and at 'the right hand of God'."
3. "Though this may also be understood of Christ's second coming to judgment, at the last day; when as he went up to heaven in a cloud, he will return, and come also in the clouds of heaven."

### John Wesley:
1. "He speaks in the third person, modestly, and yet plainly."
2. "Sitting on the right hand of power - That is, the right hand of God."
3. "And coming upon the clouds of heaven - As he is represented by Daniel, Daniel 7:13,14."
