# Matthew 26:66 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the face of a unanimous vote, Jesus was declared guilty and deserving of death by the court. However, dissent can be seen in the exception of Joseph of Arimathea, who did not agree with the decision. The severity of the charges brought against Jesus, specifically blasphemy, was taken into consideration, indicating that the sentence would have been just if the accusations were true. The court followed proper procedures, holding a formal meeting during daylight to pass the final sentence.
