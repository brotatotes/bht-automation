# Matthew 26:67 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the midst of Jesus' trial, after openly declaring his identity as the Son of God, the Sanhedrin ordered him to be removed from their presence. It was at this point that the soldiers, under their authority, began a series of contemptuous acts against Jesus, including spitting in his face and striking him with their fists. This degrading treatment fulfilled prophecies and demonstrated the intense humiliation and suffering Jesus endured while bearing witness to his divine nature.

2. "κολαφίζω is to strike with the fist."
