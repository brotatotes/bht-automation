# Matthew 26:68 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the commentators highlight the cruel mockery and ridicule that Jesus endured during His crucifixion. They describe how Jesus was physically struck and asked sarcastically who was hitting Him. The term "Christ" is used mockingly, questioning His claims and His silence is seen as evidence of His alleged impostor status. Despite the physical abuse, there is a deeper level of mocking directed at Jesus' person, His office, and His role as the head of His church. It is evident that these actions will have consequences for those who inflicted such cruelty upon Him.
