# Matthew 26:69 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the scene described by the commentators, a man named Peter finds himself in the courtyard, outside the hall where a trial is taking place. As he sits and observes, he is approached by a damsel who accuses him of being connected to the person on trial. This accusation brings upon Peter a deep sense of pain and grief. The commentators mention the precision of the language used, with one noting that the writer has in mind another damsel. Despite the turmoil and suffering Jesus endured, it is the denial by his own disciple that strikes a profound chord.
