# Matthew 26:69 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this description of a Bible verse, we explore the vulnerability and innocence of a young, unmarried woman, adding intrigue and complexity to the narrative. This verse highlights the cultural context of the time, where women were often seen as possessions or objects to be protected. We also learn that even the slightest force or opposition can easily overpower a person without the support of God. The denial by a close disciple causes more pain and grief than physical mistreatment from enemies.

2. "Here Peter had placed himself, and here he sat making his observations."
3. "And when she charges him with being 'with' him, her meaning is not, that he was with him in the garden, when he was taken; where it cannot be thought she was to see him; nor with him in the temple, or in any part of Jerusalem, where she possibly might have seen him; but that he was a disciple of his, one that believed in him, embraced him as the Messiah, had imbibed his principles and doctrines, and was of his party; and was only come thither as a spy, to see what would be done to him."
