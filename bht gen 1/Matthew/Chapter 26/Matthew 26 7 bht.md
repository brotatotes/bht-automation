# Matthew 26:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, a woman pours a precious ointment from an alabaster flask onto Jesus' head during a supper. The flask was a narrow-necked cruet, resembling a closed rosebud. The ointment symbolizes Jesus being anointed with the oil of gladness, representing his divine anointing and the pouring forth of the Gospel to the world. This act of faith highlights Jesus as the true Messiah, prophet, priest, and king of his church. The significance of this event is intertwined with the betrayal of Judas and the subsequent events that unfold.
