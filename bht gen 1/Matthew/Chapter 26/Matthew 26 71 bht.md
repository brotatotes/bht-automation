# Matthew 26:71 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this passage, we see a moment of weakness and fear as a disciple of Jesus, referred to with contemptuous and disrespectful language, denies any association with his master. The disciple's choice to distance himself from Jesus is motivated by both fear and a lack of understanding, revealing his faithlessness. This denial takes place despite Jesus' foreknowledge of the disciple's actions. Ultimately, this incident serves as a reminder of the vulnerability and consequences that can arise from succumbing to fear and failing to fully trust in God's guidance.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Albert Barnes:
1. "How clearly does it prove that our Lord was omniscient, that all these things were foreseen!"
2. "To this charge he might have been silent, thinking, perhaps, that he was concealed, and there was no need of denying Jesus then."
3. "This denial was in a stronger manner and with an oath."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The disciples had gone out, not because they were eager to leave Jesus, but because they were afraid of being interrogated further. This fear reveals their lack of understanding and faith in Jesus' teachings."
2. "Their fear was a barrier to their growth and learning. It prevented them from fully embracing the truth and hindered their ability to carry out the mission Jesus had entrusted to them."
3. "This incident serves as a reminder that fear can often cloud our judgment and hinder our progress. It is only when we trust in God's guidance and have faith in His promises that we can overcome our fears and step out in obedience."

### John Calvin:
1. "But this difficulty is easily obviated; for Mark says nothing that is inconsistent with the narrative of the other Evangelists, but explains more fully what they pass by in silence."
2. "Indeed, I have no doubt that, when Christ said to Peter, before the cock crow, he meant the cock-crowing, which includes many crowings; for cocks do not merely crow once, but repeat their crowings many times; and yet all the crowings of a single watch are called but one cock-crowing."
3. "None of us will say that profane historians are inconsistent with each other, when some one of them relates what the others have not touched; and, therefore, though Mark’s narrative is different, still it does not contradict the others."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "In his embarrassing position, he left the fire, going out to the arched gateway leading from the court to the street; probably no further." 
2. "As Peter himself probably informed Mark of this, it was not the cock-crow that brought him to repentance; nor does he conceal his forgetfulness of the signal." 
3. "Again, a woman’s weapon, of contempt and ridicule; potent enough, when human weakness is not supported by Divine grace."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Peter was not safe out here, for another maid recognized him and spoke of him as 'this fellow'." 
2. "The use of the term 'this fellow' with a gesture to those out there emphasizes the disdain and contempt with which Peter was regarded." 
3. "This incident highlights the vulnerability and pressure that Peter faced in denying Jesus, as even a maid's recognition could expose him."

### John Gill:
1. "He chose rather to keep his ground, but was very uneasy; and therefore moved into the porch, where he sat very pensive, considering what was proper for him to do."
2. "She speaks of Christ in the same contemptuous manner, as her fellow servant had done; for this appellation of Christ was commonly, if not always used by way of contempt."
3. "This sorry fellow, that is sauntering and lurking about here, is certainly one of this man's disciples."
