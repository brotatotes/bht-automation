# Matthew 26:71 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In a time of fear and doubt, even the closest followers of Jesus were not exempt. Sent out in pairs, the disciples leaned on each other for support and encouragement, just as we need the support of fellow believers to overcome our own fears and strengthen our faith. The story of Peter's denial of Jesus serves as a reminder of the pressure faced, highlighting the disdain and contempt with which he was regarded, and the constant fear of exposure. Despite the temptation to flee, Peter chose to stand his ground, contemplating his next steps with unease.

1. "The disciples had gone out, not because they were finished with their mission, but because they were afraid of facing more questions. This shows that even the closest followers of Jesus were not immune to fear and doubt."

2. "The disciples' fear is a reminder that faith does not always come easily. It is a journey filled with uncertainties and challenges. But it is in these moments of fear and doubt that we have the opportunity to grow and deepen our faith."

3. "The disciples' fear also highlights the importance of community and support. They were sent out in pairs, not alone, so that they could lean on each other and encourage one another in times of doubt. We too need the support of fellow believers to strengthen our faith and overcome our fears."

### Philip Schaff:

2. "He chose rather to keep his ground, but was very uneasy; and therefore moved into the porch, where he sat very pensive, considering what was proper for him to do."
