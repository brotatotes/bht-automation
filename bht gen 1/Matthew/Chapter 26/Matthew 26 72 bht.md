## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The man" suggests a lack of familiarity with Jesus, highlighting the possibility that he did not know Jesus' name. This emphasizes the man's desperation and the depth of his need for healing.

2. This phrase also reflects the man's humility and recognition of his own limitations. By referring to Jesus simply as "the man," he acknowledges Jesus' authority and power, positioning himself as a humble supplicant.

3. The use of "the man" also underscores the universal nature of the man's request. It suggests that his plea for healing is not limited to a specific individual but extends to all who are in need, emphasizing the inclusive and compassionate nature of Jesus' ministry.

### John Calvin:
1. "A sinner, after having once fallen, is always hurried on from bad to worse; so that those who begin with ordinary offenses afterwards rush headlong into the basest crimes, from which at first they would have recoiled with horror."
2. "This is the just vengeance of God, after we have deprived ourselves of the assistance of the Holy Spirit, to allow Satan a violent exercise of power over us, that, having subdued and made us his slaves, he may drive us wherever he pleases."
3. "When the rigor of the grace of Christ was extinguished in Peter, whoever might afterwards meet him and interrogate him about Christ, he would have been ready to deny a hundred or a thousand times."

Note: The provided commentary is quite long, so I had to condense it significantly to meet the word count requirement.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Denied with an oath. The oath is mentioned by Matthew alone, and was uttered to the maid in the porch."
2. "From evasion to perjury, one sin leading to another."
3. "Peter was now 'a stone of stumbling,' not a 'rock.'"

### John Gill:
1. "He swore by the God of truth; made a solemn appeal to the omniscient God, the searcher of hearts, that he was so far from being ever with Jesus of Nazareth, or a disciple of his, that, says he, I do not know the man."
2. "Peter knew Christ in every sense; he knew him spiritually, whom to know is life eternal: and he valued the knowledge of him above all things else."
3. "This instance of Peter's shows the wickedness and deceitfulness of man's heart; and what the best of men are, or would be, when left to themselves, and of God: they become like other men, even like the men of the world, whose mouths are full of cursing and bitterness."

### John Wesley:
1. "He denied with an oath" - This suggests that Peter's denial of Jesus was not a spontaneous act, but rather a deliberate and premeditated decision. It reveals the depth of Peter's fear and the extent to which he was willing to go to distance himself from Jesus.

2. "To which possibly he was not unaccustomed" - This implies that Peter may have used oaths in his everyday speech before he became a follower of Jesus. It highlights the fact that Peter was still in the process of learning and growing in his faith, and that his actions were influenced by his previous way of life.

3. "Before our Lord called him" - This phrase emphasizes the transformative power of Jesus' call on Peter's life. It suggests that Peter's denial with an oath was a reflection of his old self, and that he would later experience a profound change and become a faithful disciple of Jesus.
