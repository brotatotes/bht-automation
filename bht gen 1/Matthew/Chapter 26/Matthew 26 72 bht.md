# Matthew 26:72 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, a man, initially lacking familiarity with Jesus, encounters a transformative moment when Jesus is about to reveal His true identity and power. This universal theme of encountering Jesus echoes the potential for profound revelations and life-changing encounters. Peter's denial of Jesus, marked by oaths and contemptuous language, showcases the wickedness of the human heart and the dangers of relying on one's own strength. This moment of denial occurs before Peter fully comprehends the significance of his relationship with Jesus, highlighting the transformative power that Jesus' call would later have on Peter's character and faith.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The man" in this context suggests a lack of familiarity with Jesus, as if he did not know His name. This highlights the significance of Jesus' response, as He is about to reveal His true identity and power to the man.

2. This phrase emphasizes the initial state of the man's ignorance about Jesus, setting the stage for a transformative encounter. It underscores the potential for a profound revelation and the opportunity for the man to experience a life-changing encounter with the Son of God.

3. The use of "the man" instead of a specific name creates a sense of universality, allowing readers to relate to the man's initial lack of knowledge about Jesus. It reminds us that we too can encounter Jesus in our own lives, even if we initially do not recognize Him or know His name.

### John Calvin:
1. "A sinner, after having once fallen, is always hurried on from bad to worse; so that those who begin with ordinary offenses afterwards rush headlong into the basest crimes, from which at first they would have recoiled with horror."
2. "This is the just vengeance of God, after we have deprived ourselves of the assistance of the Holy Spirit, to allow Satan a violent exercise of power over us, that, having subdued and made us his slaves, he may drive us wherever he pleases."
3. "We ought also to observe, that almost in a single moment Peter thrice gave way; for this shows how unsteady we are, and how liable to fall, whenever Satan drives us."

### Philip Schaff:

3. "Peter was now ‘a stone of stumbling,’ not a ‘rock.’"

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "With an oath (μετα ορκου)." - Peter's use of an oath in his denial of Jesus reflects a common practice among Jews at that time, highlighting the seriousness of his denial.

2. "Probably a former habit so common to the Jews at that time." - The commentary suggests that Peter's use of an oath may have been a habitual practice among Jews during that period, providing cultural context to his actions.

3. "He even refers to Jesus as 'the man' (τον ανθρωπον), an expression that could convey contempt." - Peter's choice of words, referring to Jesus as "the man," may indicate a sense of contempt or disdain, further emphasizing the depth of his denial.

### John Gill:
1. "He swore by the God of truth; made a solemn appeal to the omniscient God, the searcher of hearts, that he was so far from being ever with Jesus of Nazareth, or a disciple of his, that, says he, I do not know the man."
2. "Peter knew Christ in every sense; he knew him spiritually, whom to know is life eternal: and he valued the knowledge of him above all things else."
3. "This instance of Peter's shows the wickedness and deceitfulness of man's heart; and what the best of men are, or would be, when left to themselves, and of God: they become like other men, even like the men of the world, whose mouths are full of cursing and bitterness."

### John Wesley:
1. "He denied with an oath" - This suggests that Peter's denial of Jesus was not a spontaneous reaction, but rather a deliberate and premeditated act. It highlights the depth of Peter's fear and his desperate attempt to distance himself from Jesus in order to protect himself.

2. "To which possibly he was not unaccustomed" - This implies that Peter may have used oaths in his everyday speech, indicating a lack of reverence for the sacredness of making promises. It reveals a character flaw in Peter, showing that he was not immune to the temptations of the world and was prone to relying on his own strength rather than trusting in God.

3. "Before our Lord called him" - This phrase suggests that Peter's denial of Jesus occurred before he fully understood the significance of his relationship with Jesus. It highlights the transformative power of Jesus' call, as Peter's subsequent actions and experiences would demonstrate a profound change in his character and faith.
