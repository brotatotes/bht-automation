# Matthew 26:73 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the heat of the examination, there was a stir and excitement surrounding the conclusion. The bystanders approached Peter and boldly accused him of being a follower of Jesus, as his speech gave him away. It was through his dialect, peculiar to Galileans, that Peter was revealed. The world often grasps onto weak arguments against the faithful, not realizing the providential hand of God.
