# Matthew 26:73 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse in question portrays a scene where a man's speech exposes his identity as one of Jesus' followers. The commentators provide insights into the significance of the man's language, suggesting that his Galilean dialect, known for peculiar pronunciation, was a readily detectable marker. Additionally, the use of the term "bewrayeth" or "betrayeth" emphasizes how the man's speech serves as evidence against him. Despite the different commentator perspectives and the mention of surrounding circumstances, the verse ultimately highlights the revealing power of one's words in unveiling their true affiliation.
