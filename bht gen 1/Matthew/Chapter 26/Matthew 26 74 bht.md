# Matthew 26:74 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this passage, a person's actions take a sharp turn as they descend into a state of lost self-control, profanity, and blasphemy. Their complete abandonment of restraint and guidance lead them to curse, swear, and invoke curses upon themselves. This rapid deterioration serves as a vivid reminder of the importance of self-control and the damaging consequences that can arise when it is abandoned.
