# Matthew 26:75 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we see Peter going outside to avoid being accused because of his tears. The denials had already taken place, and he went outside from the gate where they occurred. Through a compassionate look, Jesus brought to remembrance Peter's promises and the guilt of his denial. This look pierced Peter's heart with sorrow, leading to true repentance and tears. Ultimately, Peter's departure was not to save himself, but to be alone in his grief and seek reconciliation with God. The look from Jesus served as a reminder and catalyst for Peter's repentance and restoration.

2. "True repentance is deep, thorough, bitter. Peter wept bitterly. It was sincere sorrow - sorrow proportioned to the nature of the offence he had committed."
3. "A look from Jesus - a look of mingled affection, pity, and reproof - produces bitter sorrow for sin.
