# Matthew 26:75 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, a fallen individual's repentance is brought about by a profound look from Christ, igniting a turning within themselves. The voice of God is oftentimes passed by with indifference, but here we are reminded that when the Lord looks upon someone, true repentance commences. True repentance involves feeling grief and shame, leading to tears as a display of sincere remorse. This genuine repentance, accompanied by a remembrance of God's words and law, allows for restoration and a chance at salvation.

### John Calvin:
1. "He must, therefore, have received the look from Christ, in order that he might come to himself."
2. "We all have experience of the same thing in ourselves; for which of us does not pass by with indifference and with deaf ears — I do not say the varied and numerous songs of birds which however, excite us to glorify God — but even the voice of God, which is heard clearly and distinctly in the doctrine of the Law and of the Gospel?"
3. "Let us therefore know, that whenever any one has fallen, his repentance will never begin, until the Lord has looked at him."
4. "And by this example we are taught that we ought to entertain confident hope, though our repentance be lame; for God does not despise even weak repentance, provided that it be sincere."
5. "But it may be asked, Is weeping requisite in true repentance? I reply, Believers often with dry eyes groan before the Lord without hypocrisy, and confess their fault to obtain pardon; but in more aggravated offenses they must be in no ordinary degree stupid and hardened, whose hearts are not pained by grief and sorrow, and who do not feel ashamed even so far as to shed tears."

### Philip Schaff:
