# Matthew 26:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the midst of a scene filled with anger, indignation, and resentment, a valuable lesson emerges. The disciples, driven by a sense of practicality and limited understanding, questioned the purpose and necessity of an action that was intended as a loving gesture. Their critical remarks and misunderstanding highlight the danger of allowing a mercantile spirit or a cynical mindset to overshadow acts of love and devotion. Ultimately, this passage reminds us to look beyond the surface and to recognize the worth and significance of selfless acts done for the honor of Christ and the good of His cause.
