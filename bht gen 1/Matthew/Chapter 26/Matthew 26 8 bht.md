# Matthew 26:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse being described is a scene where an act of devotion and sacrifice is met with disdain and objection from the disciples, particularly Judas Iscariot. The disciples, including Judas, question the value, necessity, and potential loss associated with the action. Their reactions range from resentment to anger, fueled by a lack of understanding and an inability to grasp the true significance of the act. This incident serves as a warning against the danger of allowing negativity and critical voices to influence our perception of acts of love and devotion towards Christ.

### John Calvin:
1. "But when he began, under a plausible pretext, to condemn the expense as superfluous, all of them easily caught the contagion. And this example shows what danger arises from malignant and envenomed tongues."
2. "If light and foolish credulity induced the disciples of Christ to take part with Judas, what shall become of us, if we are too easy in admitting murmurers, who are in the habit of carping wickedly at the best actions?"
3. "They ought, on the contrary, to have inquired more fully if the action deserved reproof; more especially when their Master was present, by whose decision it was their duty to abide."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The disciples' (Matthew); 'there were some' (Mark); 'one of the disciples, Judas Iscariot' (John). No doubt, all shared the feeling for the time; Mark distinguishes 'some' in a company, of which the disciples formed a part; John mentions the author of the objection, and gives his motives." 

2. "If John and Judas were reclining at this table in the same relative positions as at the Last Supper, John would probably have heard nothing but the remark of Judas." 

3. "Sacrifices, made out of love to Christ, seem wasteful' to the world, and even to the Church when under the influence of a mercantile spirit."

### John Gill:
1. "Their resentment was private, though it might be betrayed by their looks, and afterwards showed itself in words."
2. "This indignation was either at the woman, for acting such an imprudent part, or at Christ himself, for allowing such an action to be done unto him."
3. "They call that waste, or loss, which was spent on Christ himself; whereas, whatever is laid out for the honor of Christ, or the good of his interest, ought not to be reckoned loss."

### John Wesley:
1. "His disciples seeing it, had indignation" - The disciples were filled with anger and disapproval when they witnessed the act. This shows that they had a strong sense of justice and righteousness.

2. "Several of them were angry, and spoke" - The anger of the disciples was not just a silent emotion, but it led them to express their concerns and objections. This indicates that they were not passive followers, but individuals who were willing to voice their opinions.

3. "None so warmly as Judas Iscariot" - Among the disciples, Judas Iscariot was particularly vocal and passionate in his indignation. This highlights his strong reaction and suggests that he may have had personal motives or ulterior motives for his anger.
