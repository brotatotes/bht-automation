# Matthew 26:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
A valuable and extravagant ointment, worth over 300 denarii, was poured out, prompting both admiration and indignation. One commentator suggests that the omission of the word "ointment" in the text requires it to be supplied, emphasizing its significance. The suggestion to sell it and give the proceeds to the poor was seen as a mere pretext by one disciple, who was later revealed to be a hypocrite. This event teaches us about the conflicting reactions to the expression of devotion and the danger of deceit within a community.
