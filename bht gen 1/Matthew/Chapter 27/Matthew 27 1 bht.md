# Matthew 27:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Under the cover of dawn, the chief priests and elders of the people hastily gathered together, fueling their unjust intentions. Knowing that stoning Jesus to death would provoke the people, they sought a different course of action. They devised a plan to falsely accuse Him before the Roman authority, charged with blasphemy and claiming to be the Son of God. Their scheme aimed at crucifixion, an ignoble and excruciating death under Roman law. The darkness of their hearts and their determination to shed innocent blood led them to seek the condemnation of Jesus by earthly judges.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Albert Barnes:
1. "The chief priests and elders of the people took counsel - They agreed that he deserved to die, 'on a charge of blasphemy;' yet they did not dare to put him to death by stoning, as they did afterward Stephen Acts 7:0, and as the law commanded in case of blasphemy, for they feared the people." 
2. "They therefore 'consulted,' or took counsel together, to determine on what pretence they could deliver him to the Roman emperor, or to fix some charge of a civil nature by which Pilate might be induced to condemn him."
3. "On a charge of 'blasphemy' they knew he could not, as that was not an offence against the Roman laws, and over which, therefore, Pilate claimed no jurisdiction."

### John Calvin:
1. "By so doing, they observe the form of judicial proceedings, that they may not be suspected of undue haste, when they run to Pilate at an unusually early hour."
2. "The Evangelists...relate, that as soon as it was daylight, they condemned Christ to death, and did not lose a moment in earnestly putting into execution their wicked design."
3. "For the stoning of Stephen took place in a seditious manner, as happens in cases of tumult; but it was proper that the Son of God should be solemnly condemned by an earthly judge, that he might efface our condemnation in heaven."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Probably about sunrise, since the twilight is short in that latitude."
2. "It is characteristic of Pharisaism to be most formal when most unjust."
3. "Their plan appears to have been: 1. To ask Pilate’s consent, without inquiry, to their sentence of death. 2. If necessary, to make the vague charge, that Jesus claimed to be King of the Jews. 3. Another charge mentioned by John, that He claimed to be the Son of God, may have been determined on, in case He denied the political character of His Messiahship."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "After dawn came the Sanhedrin held a formal meeting to condemn Jesus and so ratify the illegal trial during the night."
2. "Luke gives the details of this second ratification consultation."
3. "The phrase used, 'took counsel,' is a Latin idiom for 'συνεβουλευσαντο'."

### John Gill:
1. "Their feet ran to evil, and they made haste to shed blood." 
2. "This being now a case of necessity, and great importance, they are all summoned and gathered together."
3. "They chose crucifixion as the most ignominious and painful; and therefore determined to deliver him up to the Roman governor, and use their interest with him to put him to death, according to the Roman law."
