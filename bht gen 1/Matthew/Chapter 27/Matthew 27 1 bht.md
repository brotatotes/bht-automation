# Matthew 27:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
At sunrise, in a region where twilight is brief, a group, characterized by formality and injustice, hurried to seek Pilate's consent for a predetermined sentence of death. Their plan involved making charges of claiming to be King of the Jews and Son of God, perhaps to have options depending on Jesus' response. This gathering was summoned due to the urgent and imperative nature of the situation. Their choice of crucifixion revealed a deliberate desire for the utmost humiliation and agony.

3. "Their plan appears to have been: 1. To ask Pilate's consent, without inquiry, to their sentence of death. 2. If necessary, to make the vague charge, that Jesus claimed to be King of the Jews. 3.
