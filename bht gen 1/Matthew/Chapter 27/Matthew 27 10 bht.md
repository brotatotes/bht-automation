# Matthew 27:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, through the insights of various commentators, we learn that a significant price was paid for a field owned by a potter. This transaction, valued as lowly and contemptuous, fulfilled ancient prophecies and demonstrated the low estimation of the Son of God by those involved. The act of writing and recording is seen as a command from the Lord Himself, an opportunity to exhibit reverence for His word and deepen our understanding of it.
