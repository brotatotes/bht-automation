## BHT:
In the judgment hall, the eternal Son of God, standing before a Heathen governor, avows himself to be the Christ and a king. The Sanhedrin fears defilement, condemning Jesus for blasphemy, while Pilate receives a political accusation. Through his response, Jesus demonstrates his divine identity and the nature of his kingdom, standing boldly to open a new way to the throne of God for all who believe in his name.
