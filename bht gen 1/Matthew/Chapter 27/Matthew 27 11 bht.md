# Matthew 27:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we see Jesus standing before Pilate, the Roman governor, facing accusations and judgment. The religious leaders had condemned him for blasphemy but sought to bring a political charge against him to gain Pilate's attention. Jesus, the eternal Son of God and the Prince of the kings of the earth, stood before a heathen governor as the substitute for his people. His confident affirmation of his identity as the Christ and a king exemplifies his unwavering conviction and purpose. Through his sacrificial death, he opens a new way for us to stand boldly before God's throne of grace.
