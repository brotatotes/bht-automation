# Matthew 27:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the accused individual was aware of their innocence and the inability of their accusers to prove the charges against them. Despite having a defense and the opportunity to refute the allegations, they chose to remain silent. This silence allowed their innocence to be questioned and suspicions to arise. By not responding, they achieved a greater purpose - demonstrating that through grace, righteousness can be attained. Additionally, their silence prevented the furtherance of the desires of those seeking their harm.
