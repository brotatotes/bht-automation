# Matthew 27:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, a man is being accused of claiming to be a king, but the commentators emphasize that this accusation is false and nothing more than a political offense. Despite the stirring of the people, the man's actions were not meant to incite mutiny or have political motives. Even though he remained silent in the face of the accusations, the authorities tried to elicit a response from him. The verse raises questions about the credibility of the witnesses and the nature of their testimonies, particularly given the status and influence of those providing them.
