# Matthew 27:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, the accused is silent in the face of false accusations made by the chief priests and elders. The accusers were not credible witnesses, but rather individuals who wrongfully accused the accused. Despite the repeated and pressing accusations, the accused did not respond to the charges brought against him. The main charge against him was that he claimed to be a king, but this accusation lacked truth and substance.
