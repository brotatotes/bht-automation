# Matthew 27:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, we witness a remarkable scene unfold before us. The accused, who is innocent, stands before the governor, calm and composed. Despite being urged to defend himself, he remains silent, not uttering a single word. This silence astonishes the governor, who is unaccustomed to such self-restraint. The lack of response to the baseless accusations is a testament to the dignified demeanor and patience of the accused, leaving those present in awe of his character.
