# Matthew 27:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
During the Passover feast, a custom was established to release a prisoner, allowing the people to exercise their influence and potentially gain favor with the ruling authorities. This yearly tradition held significance in the religious calendar, giving the people a sense of power and highlighting their resentment towards the Roman rule. The custom, though not mandated by Mosaic law, was likely of Roman origin, as indicated by the reference to the Roman governor. Now, in this verse, John 18:39, we see this custom and its implications being portrayed.
