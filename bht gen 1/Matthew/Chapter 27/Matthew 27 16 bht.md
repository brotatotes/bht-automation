# Matthew 27:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, we encounter a notable prisoner named Barabbas, who was involved in an insurrection and committed murder. His crimes were not just any ordinary offenses but were politically motivated. This context suggests that the decision to release Barabbas over Jesus was influenced by the political atmosphere rather than Barabbas' personal innocence. Additionally, his name, Barabbas, may mean "the son of his father," adding complexity to his identity.
