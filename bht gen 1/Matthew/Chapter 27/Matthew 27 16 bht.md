## BHT:
Barabbas, the infamous and notorious prisoner, was a thief, robber, and murderer who had participated in a sedition and insurrection. His name, "the son of a father," suggested that he was a child of his father who was spoiled and ruined, perhaps even a child of the devil himself. Known as the chief of robbers, Barabbas' notoriety was widespread, making him a significant figure in the story.

### Henry Alford:
1. "The name Barabbas, בַּר אַבָּא , ‘son of his father,’ was not an uncommon one."
2. "The plays on this name Barabbas (e.g. τὸν υἱὸν τοῦ πατρὸς αὐτῶν , τοῦ διαβόλου , ἐξῃτήσαντο .… Theophylact, see also Olshausen in loc. vol. ii. p. 507) are utterly unworthy of serious exegesis."
3. "It does not appear why this man was ἐπίσημος . The murderers in the insurrection in which he was involved were many ( Mar 15:7 )."

2. "Barabbas... signifies 'the son of a father': a father's child that was spoiled and ruined, and a child of his father the devil."
