# Matthew 27:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this captivating passage, we witness the intricate dynamics between Pilate, the council, and Jesus. Pilate's convoluted approach betrays his awareness of Jesus' Messianic claim. Although he should have released Jesus, he cunningly aimed to avoid opposing the council. This led to the audacious proposal of Barabbas, which was not only a crime and an evasion of responsibility but also a blunder. Pilate intentionally presented Barabbas alongside Jesus, hoping that the council would choose the scandalous criminal over the innocent Messiah. His intention, despite lacking moral earnestness, was to protect Jesus from harm.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Philip Schaff:
1. "Pilate seems to have known of the Messianic claim. His policy was crooked. He ought to have released Jesus, but he would avoid opposing the council."
2. "To put Jesus, as yet uncondemned, on a level with Barabbas, was a crime; a cowardly shirking of responsibility, and a blunder."
3. "Pilate was not 'weak and irresolute;' but baffled in his purpose by superior cunning. Yet his purpose, like his character, was lacking in moral earnestness."

### John Gill:
1. "For it was to them the release of a prisoner was to be made, and so the proposal of one; and it was at their option, who should be the person." 
2. "Pilate on purpose proposed such an infamous person along with him, not doubting but they would have preferred him, whatever were their prejudices against him, before such a scandalous person as Barabbas." 
3. "His view was not to reproach Christ, by joining him with so wicked a man, but in order to save him."
