# Matthew 27:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
During the trial of an individual, the suggestion to release a prisoner - possibly Barabbas - seems to have come from the Jews themselves. This proposal put Pilate in the power of the Sanhedrin, causing him to catch at straws to escape condemning Jesus, whom he perceived as a harmless lunatic or exponent of a superstitious cult. Pilate intentionally offered Barabbas alongside Jesus, hoping the people would choose the scandalous prisoner over the alleged rival of Caesar. Ultimately, an unwittingly significant decision was made, pitting two prisoners who represented the antagonistic forces of all time against each other.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "In John’s narrative, the suggestion of liberating Barabbas seems to come from the Jews themselves; but not necessarily so: he may only be giving, as before, a general report of what passed."
2. "The συνηγμ . οὖν αὐτ . seems to imply that a great crowd had collected outside the Prætorium while the trial was going on."
3. "It is possible that the addition τὸν λεγόμενον χριστόν, which Pilate could hardly have heard from the Jews, may have been familiar to him by his wife’s mention of Jesus."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Pilate seems to have known of the Messianic claim. His policy was crooked. He ought to have released Jesus, but he would avoid opposing the council." 
2. "To put Jesus, as yet uncondemned, on a level with Barabbas, was a crime; a cowardly shirking of responsibility, and a blunder; for this proposal placed Pilate in the power of the Sanhedrin."
3. "Pilate was not ‘weak and irresolute;’ but baffled in his purpose by superior cunning. Yet his purpose, like his character, was lacking in moral earnestness."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Pilate was catching at straws or seeking any loophole to escape condemning a harmless lunatic or exponent of a superstitious cult such as he deemed Jesus to be, certainly in no political sense a rival of Caesar." 
2. "The Jews interpreted 'Christ' for Pilate to be a claim to be King of the Jews in opposition to Caesar, 'a most unprincipled proceeding' (Bruce)." 
3. "So Pilate unwittingly pitted against each other two prisoners who represented the antagonistic forces of all time."

### John Gill:
1. "For it was to them the release of a prisoner was to be made, and so the proposal of one; and it was at their option, who should be the person." 
2. "Pilate on purpose proposed such an infamous person along with him, not doubting but they would have preferred him, whatever were their prejudices against him, before such a scandalous person as Barabbas."
3. "His view was not to reproach Christ, by joining him with so wicked a man, but in order to save him."
