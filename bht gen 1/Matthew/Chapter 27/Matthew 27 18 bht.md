# Matthew 27:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse describes the event of Jesus being handed over to Pilate by the religious leaders, who were motivated by envy, malice, and a desire for revenge. Pilate, already familiar with Jesus, saw through their ulterior motives and their attempt to manipulate the situation. This knowledge added a layer of complexity to the trial, as it raised questions about Pilate's own motives and the extent to which he was influenced by external pressures.

1. "He saw in their countenances, and by their charges against him, and by the whole of their conduct, that it was not out of any regard to Caesar, or to the peace and tranquillity of the civil government, or to strict justice; but from envy, at his popularity, at his fame and credit he had among the people."
2. "Pilate might the rather hope to succeed in this scheme of his to release him, by proposing him with so notorious a person to the populace, when the one, as he might reasonably judge, was abhorred by them, and the other had got great credit and esteem among a large number of them."
