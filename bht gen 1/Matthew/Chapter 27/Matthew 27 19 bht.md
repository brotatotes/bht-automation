# Matthew 27:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, a governor's wife pleads for the release of a just man, knowing the innocence and purity of his character. The commentators highlight her urgent request, in which she implies the potential divine consequences of harming him. Furthermore, they recognize the fear and entanglement that this plea brings upon the governor, who is aware that the man is free from any crime. Notably, the commentators note the significance of the wife's dream, which serves as a divine instrument to defend the innocent man and reveal the true satisfaction for the sins of others.
