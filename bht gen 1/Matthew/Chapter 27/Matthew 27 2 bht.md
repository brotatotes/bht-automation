# Matthew 27:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The commentators shed light on the decision to take Jesus to Pilate, emphasizing the Jewish leaders' intention to ensure His condemnation and highlight the fulfillment of prophecy. The presence of Pilate in Jerusalem during the feast was strategically manipulated to achieve their desired outcome. Jesus' binding not only reflects his physical restraint but also symbolizes the spiritual bondage of humanity and the need for a Savior. The binding, which was continuous from his arrest, serves as a reminder of the divine plan and Jesus' ultimate act of love and sacrifice for humanity's salvation.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The reason for taking Jesus to Pilate was to ensure that He would be condemned to death. The Jewish leaders knew that they did not have the authority to execute someone, so they brought Jesus before Pilate, the Roman governor, who had the power to carry out the death sentence." 

2. "Pilate's usual residence was in CÃ¦sarea, but during the feast, he would come to Jerusalem. This was a strategic move by the Jewish leaders, as they knew that Pilate's presence in the city would make it easier for them to manipulate the situation and achieve their desired outcome." 

3. "The fact that Pilate was the one to ultimately decide Jesus' fate is significant. It highlights the fulfillment of prophecy, as Jesus had foretold that He would be handed over to the Gentiles and crucified. This event also serves as a reminder of the political and religious dynamics at play during Jesus' time, and the lengths that the Jewish leaders were willing to go to ensure His death."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The bonds put on Him in the garden seem to have been removed sometime during the night."
2. "Probably in a solemn procession, with a view of influencing both the people and the governor."
3. "Pilate had an unyielding and severe disposition...his conduct led to repeated revolts among the Jews, which he suppressed by bloody measures."

### John Wesley:
1. "Having bound him" - This action of binding Jesus not only symbolizes his physical restraint, but also reflects the spiritual bondage that humanity is under. It highlights the powerlessness of humanity to free themselves from sin and the need for a Savior.

2. "They had bound him when he was first apprehended" - This emphasizes the continuity of Jesus' suffering and persecution. From the moment of his arrest, Jesus willingly submitted himself to the will of God, knowing that he would face further trials and ultimately be crucified for the redemption of humanity.

3. "To secure him from any danger of an escape" - The binding of Jesus serves as a reminder of the divine plan and the fulfillment of prophecies. Despite the attempts of the religious leaders to prevent Jesus from fulfilling his mission, his binding ultimately leads to his crucifixion, which is the ultimate act of love and sacrifice for humanity's salvation.
