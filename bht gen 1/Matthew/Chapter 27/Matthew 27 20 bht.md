# Matthew 27:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the midst of the crowd's excitement, Pilate receives a message from his wife. The chief priests and elders take advantage of the situation, manipulating the multitudes to turn against Jesus. They use their influence and deception to persuade the people to choose Barabbas over Jesus, even going so far as to play on fears of Roman intervention and subversion of their religious authority. The leaders see the peril and spare no effort to ensure Jesus' condemnation, thirsty for his blood and intent on his destruction.

3. "they thirsted after his blood, and were bent upon his death: to release Barabbas, if Jesus was not destroyed, would not answer their end: they desired Barabbas's liberty for no other reason, but for the sake of the destruction of Jesus."
