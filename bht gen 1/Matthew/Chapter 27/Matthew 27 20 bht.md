# Matthew 27:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the midst of Pilate's wavering and the crowd's chaotic uproar, the chief priests and elders strategically manipulate the multitude. Taking full advantage of the political climate and the people's desires for freedom and authority, they cunningly persuade them to reject Jesus and to request the release of Barabbas. Fear and self-interest guide their actions, allowing them to successfully instigate the condemnation of Jesus. The message from Pilate's wife and the threat of Roman interference further fuel the people's choice, as they overlook justice in favor of maintaining their position and nation.
