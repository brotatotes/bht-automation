# Matthew 27:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The crowd, driven by their hatred for Jesus and their desire for his crucifixion, cries out to Pilate, "Let him be crucified." Their demand for the punishment intended for Barabbas, combined with their forgetfulness of the potential consequences, reveals their malicious intent in setting a dangerous precedent. Unbeknownst to them, their actions would ultimately result in dire consequences, as the Roman Empire's wrath would be unleashed upon them within a few years.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "They chose crucifixion as the ordinary Roman punishment for sedition, and because of their hate to Jesus."
2. "The double accusative after verbs of doing and saying of or to any one is the common construction."

### John Calvin:
1. "If you have no compassion for the man, pay some regard, at least, to your own honor; for it will be generally thought by foreigners, that he was put to death for a chastisement to you all."
2. "Even themselves call Jesus the King; meaning, that this title was constantly used, as if it had been his ordinary surname."
3. "They choose rather to be deprived of the hope of the promised redemption, and to be devoted to perpetual slavery, than to receive the Redeemer, whom God had offered to them."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Let him be crucified. Pilate did not expect this. Their own law would have punished Jesus by stoning. But Pilate had placed Jesus on a level with Barabbas and they ask the punishment due to him." 
2. "They put the Innocent One in the place of the guilty. Thus the details of prophecy in regard to the manner of Christ’s death were to he fulfilled."

2. "Surely you would not have me put him to death, and that for no other reason but this, because he is called either by himself or others, Christ, or the Messiah, or the king of the Jews!"
3. "They all say unto him, let him be crucified; which was a Roman punishment, inflicted on the meanest and worst of men; as wicked servants, thieves, robbers, and cut-throats."

### John Wesley:
1. "Let him be crucified" - The crowd's cry for Jesus' crucifixion reveals their desire for the punishment that Barabbas deserved. This highlights the irony of their malice, as they unknowingly set a dangerous precedent for the Roman governor.
2. "They forgot...furnished the Roman governor" - The crowd's malicious actions were driven by their immediate desire for Jesus' crucifixion, but they failed to consider the long-term consequences. Their forgetfulness of the potential repercussions would later come back to haunt them.
3. "Within a few years it turned dreadfully upon themselves" - The commentator suggests that the crowd's role in Jesus' crucifixion would eventually have dire consequences for them. This foreshadows the future events that would unfold, where the Roman Empire's wrath would be unleashed upon the very people who called for Jesus' crucifixion.
