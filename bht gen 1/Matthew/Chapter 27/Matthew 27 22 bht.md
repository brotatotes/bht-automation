# Matthew 27:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The crowd's demand for Jesus to be crucified reveals their malice and disregard for justice. Their desire for punishment sets a dangerous precedent, as they forget the long-term consequences of their actions. In the end, their participation in Jesus' crucifixion would turn dreadfully upon themselves, bringing about their own suffering and punishment.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Their own law would have punished Jesus by stoning. But Pilate had placed Jesus on a level with Barabbas and they ask the punishment due to him." 
2. "They put the Innocent One in the place of the guilty. Thus the details of prophecy in regard to the manner of Christ’s death were to he fulfilled."
3. "Popular movements which do not rest on moral convictions are as shifting as the sand. The ‘voice of the people,’ when misguided, may be the voice of Satan; yet God overrules even this for good."

### John Gill:
1. "He could not have thought they would have asked the life of so vile a wretch, that had been guilty of such capital crimes, crimes to be abhorred by all men."
2. "Surely you would not have me put him to death, and that for no other reason but this, because he is called either by himself or others, Christ, or the Messiah, or the king of the Jews!"
3. "They all say unto him, let him be crucified; which was a Roman punishment, inflicted on the meanest and worst of men; as wicked servants, thieves, robbers, and cut-throats."
