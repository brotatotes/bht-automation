# Matthew 27:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, we see Pilate's repeated questioning and desire to release Jesus, indicating a persistence in wanting to set Him free. However, despite Pilate's recognition of Jesus' innocence and lack of any criminal action, the alliance of godless men was resolute in their pursuit to have Him crucified. Jesus, without sin, faced unwarranted accusations that brought about an intense contrast between His purity and the corrupt intentions of those seeking His crucifixion.
