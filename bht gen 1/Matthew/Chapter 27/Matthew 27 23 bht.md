# Matthew 27:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, the indecisive Pilate questions the reason behind his decision, trying to place himself in the shoes of the person he is addressing. He desires to release Jesus and persistently asks for a reason to condemn him, but the mob's inflamed passion for blood leads to a gladiatorial-like show of frenzy. Pilate's feeble protest and acknowledgment of Jesus' innocence are overshadowed by the clamorous demands for his crucifixion, showing that even in the face of irrefutable proof of Jesus' innocence, the desires of godless men prevail.
