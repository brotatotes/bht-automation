# Matthew 27:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we see Pilate's dilemma and his attempt to distance himself from the responsibility of condemning Jesus. Pilate, aware of the injustice of the situation, chose to succumb to the pressure from his superiors, even though he acknowledged the wrongness of his decision. As he washed his hands, he was participating in a symbolic act, well-known by both Jews and heathens, to express innocence and detachment from the guilt of Jesus' crucifixion. Despite his actions, Pilate's testimony unintentionally affirmed the righteousness of Jesus, even as he condemned himself.
