# Matthew 27:25 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The imprecation, "His blood be on us and on our children," carries a weighty significance. The Jewish nation, in their guilt and pride, invoked the consequences upon themselves. This imprecation was dreadfully fulfilled in the ruin and calamities that befell them, including the brutal crucifixions during the siege of Jerusalem. These events point to the immense guilt of crucifying Jesus and serve as a solemn reminder of the consequences that can follow rash actions against God's Son.
