# Matthew 27:26 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, it is evident that the Son of God, who was free from all sin, took upon himself a severe punishment to satisfy our need for redemption. The punishment served to strengthen our faith, instill a reverential fear of God's wrath, and humble us by acknowledging our own misery. The crucifixion itself was a gruesome act, where the innocent one suffered in place of the guilty, enduring unimaginable torment as his body was mercilessly nailed and suspended on the cross until his eventual death.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### John Calvin:
1. "For if the Son of God had not been free from all sin, we would have had no right to look for satisfaction from his death."
2. "But even the severity of the punishment serves to confirm our faith, not less than to impress our minds with dread of the wrath of God, and to humble us by a conviction of our miseries."
3. "For we must have hearts harder than stones, if we are not cut to the quick by the wounds of the Son of God, if we do not hate and detest our sins, for expiating which the Son of God endured so many torments."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The guilty one was released, and the innocent one entered upon his punishment."
2. "Roman scourging was a fearful punishment. The entire body was bared, the lashes were given without number."
3. "Pilate sacrificed his independent position as a representative of the Roman law, to the fanaticism of the Jewish hierarchy."

### John Wesley:
1. "The person crucified was nailed to the cross as it lay on the ground, through each hand extended to the utmost stretch, and through both the feet together." 

2. "Then the cross was raised up, and the foot of it thrust with a violent shock into a hole in the ground prepared for it." 

3. "This shock disjointed the body, whose whole weight hung upon the nails, till the persons expired through mere dint of pain."
