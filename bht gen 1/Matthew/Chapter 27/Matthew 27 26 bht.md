# Matthew 27:26 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse describes the brutal punishment that Jesus underwent before his crucifixion. According to commentators, it was a Roman custom to scourge the condemned before execution, inflicting immense suffering. This scourging symbolized the severity of sin and the sacrifice of Jesus. Pilate, pressured by the Jewish hierarchy, reluctantly handed Jesus over to be crucified, a punishment that involved nailing his outstretched hands and feet to a cross. The crucifixion process itself was excruciating, as the cross was raised, dislocating the body and causing the condemned to endure immense pain until death.
