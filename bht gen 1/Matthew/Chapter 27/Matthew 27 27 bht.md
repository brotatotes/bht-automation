# Matthew 27:27 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the scene is set in the governor's palace, previously the palace of Herod, where the Roman soldiers, a cohesive and disciplined cohort, had gathered for the purpose of mocking and abusing Jesus. The soldiers delighted in their sport, taking pleasure in demonstrating their contempt for both the Jews and the condemned man. This portrayal reminds us that Jesus willingly endured humiliation and disgrace on our behalf, ultimately leading to our redemption and restoration in the presence of God.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:

1. "The residence of the Roman governor was the former palace of Herod, in the upper city."
2. "The σπεῖρα is the cohort, the tenth part of a legion."
3. "To Him, to make sport with Him. This happened in the guard-room of the cohort."

### John Calvin:
1. "Our filthiness deserves that God should hold it in abhorrence, and that all the angels should spit upon us; but Christ, in order to present us pure and unspotted in presence of the Father, resolved to be spat upon, and to be dishonored by every kind of reproaches."
2. "For this reason, that disgrace which he once endured on earth obtains for us favor in heaven, and at the same time restores in us the image of God, which had been not only stained, but almost obliterated, by the pollutions of sin."
3. "We are also taught that the kingdom of Christ ought not to be estimated by the sense of the flesh, but by the judgment of faith and of the Spirit. For so long as our minds grovel in the world, we look upon his kingdom not only as contemptible, but even as loaded with shame and disgrace; but as soon as our minds rise by faith to heaven, not only will the spiritual majesty of Christ be presented to us, so as to obliterate all the dishonor of the cross, but the spittings, scourgings, blows, and other indignities, will lead us to the contemplation of his glory."
