## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Possibly the mantle in which he had been sent back from Herod" - This suggests that the cloak mentioned in the verse could be the same one that was used to mock Jesus during his trial before Herod. 

2. "See note on Luk 23:11" - This reference indicates that there is additional information about the cloak in Luke 23:11, which could provide further insight into its significance. 

3. "Or perhaps one of the ordinary soldiers' cloaks" - This alternative possibility suggests that the cloak could have been a common item worn by soldiers, highlighting the humiliation and mockery Jesus endured during his crucifixion.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "His clothing was replaced after the scourging, and probably also the robe which Herod had put on Him to mock Him." 
2. "This robe was removed, and instead they put on him a scarlet robe, the sign of His having attained royal honors."
3. "Mark and John speak of it as 'purple;' but imperial or royal purple is more scarlet than blue."

### John Gill:
1. "For one man to spit upon another, as these soldiers afterwards did on Christ, or to strip him of his garment, according to the Jewish canons, were punishable with a fine of four hundred pence." 
2. "His clothes on his back seem to be all he had in this world, and of these he is stripped." 
3. "This was an emblem of his being clothed, as it were with our sins, which are as scarlet, and of his bloody sufferings in the human nature."

### John Wesley:
1. "They put on him a scarlet robe" - This act of clothing Jesus in a scarlet robe was a mocking gesture, as scarlet robes were typically worn by kings and generals. It was a way for the soldiers to ridicule Jesus and mock his claim to be the King of the Jews.

2. "Such as kings and generals wore" - The choice of a scarlet robe was intentional, as it symbolized power and authority. By dressing Jesus in this robe, the soldiers were sarcastically acknowledging his claim to be a king, but in a mocking and derisive manner.

3. "Probably an old tattered one" - The fact that the robe was likely old and tattered adds another layer of mockery to the scene. It suggests that the soldiers did not even bother to find a proper robe for Jesus, further demeaning him and highlighting their disdain for his claims of kingship.
