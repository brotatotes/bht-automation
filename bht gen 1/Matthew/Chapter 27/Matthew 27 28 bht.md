# Matthew 27:28 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, Jesus is described as being clothed in a scarlet robe. Commentators suggest that this robe may have been the same garment used by Herod to mock Jesus, emphasizing his suffering and humiliation. The scarlet color of the robe symbolizes power and authority, worn by kings and rulers. However, the act of clothing Jesus in this robe was a cruel mockery of his supposed kingship, adding to his humiliation. The uncertainty surrounding the exact nature of the robe leaves room for personal reflection and understanding of the significance of this detail in the crucifixion narrative.

1. "The mantle in which he had been sent back from Herod." This quote suggests that the cloak mentioned in the verse may have been the same one that Herod had used to mock Jesus. This adds a layer of symbolism to the verse, highlighting the humiliation and suffering that Jesus endured.

2. "One of the ordinary soldiers' cloaks." This quote implies that the cloak mentioned in the verse was not a special or significant garment, but rather a common item worn by soldiers. This emphasizes the humility of Jesus, who was stripped of his own clothes and given a simple garment.

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The robe, or χλαμυδα, was a symbol of authority and power, worn not only by soldiers but also by kings and emperors."
2. "The use of the robe in this verse highlights the significance of Jesus' kingship and his authority over all creation."
3. "By wearing the robe, Jesus is portrayed as the ultimate ruler, demonstrating his sovereignty and dominion over the entire universe."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "His clothing was replaced after the scourging, and probably also the robe which Herod had put on Him to mock Him (Luke 23:11), usually supposed to have been white, marking Him as a candidate for royal honors."
2. "This robe was removed, and instead they put on him a scarlet robe, the sign of His having attained royal honors."
3. "Mark and John speak of it as ‘purple;’ but imperial or royal purple is more scarlet than blue."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "The scarlet robe was a symbol of power and authority, worn by soldiers, magistrates, and kings. Its vibrant color was derived from a rare dye found in Palestine, making it a valuable and prestigious garment." 

2. "The use of the scarlet robe in mocking Jesus was a deliberate mockery of his claim to be a king. It was a cruel irony, as the soldiers dressed him in a garment associated with royalty, but in a mocking and derisive manner." 

3. "The choice between 'stripped' and 'clothed' in the manuscripts adds to the ambiguity of the scene. If Jesus was already stripped for the scourging, the soldiers may have added the scarlet robe as a further act of humiliation. However, if he was clothed and then stripped, it emphasizes the deliberate mockery and degradation inflicted upon him."

### John Gill:
1. "This is one part of the low estate Christ submitted to: his clothes on his back seem to be all he had in this world, and of these he is stripped."
2. "Whether there were two garments put upon him, the one a purple vest, and the other a scarlet robe over it; or whether scarlet was used instead of purple, is not certain; which was a colour wore by kings, and a sign of imperial dignity."
3. "This was an emblem of his being clothed, as it were with our sins, which are as scarlet, and of his bloody sufferings in the human nature."

### John Wesley:
1. "They put on him a scarlet robe" - This act of clothing Jesus in a scarlet robe was a mocking gesture, intended to ridicule his claim to be a king. It was a deliberate attempt to degrade him and highlight the stark contrast between his claim to kingship and his current state of humiliation.

2. "Such as kings and generals wore" - The choice of a scarlet robe was not accidental. Scarlet was a color associated with royalty and power, often worn by kings and generals. By dressing Jesus in this robe, the soldiers were ironically acknowledging his claim to be a king, but in a mocking and sarcastic manner.

3. "Probably an old tattered one" - The fact that the robe was likely old and tattered further adds to the humiliation and mockery Jesus endured. It symbolizes the degradation and mockery he faced, as if he were not worthy of a new or regal garment. This detail emphasizes the depth of the soldiers' contempt and their intention to humiliate Jesus.
