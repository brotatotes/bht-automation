# Matthew 27:29 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Surrounded by a mocking crowd, the Messiah bore a crown of thorns upon His head - a cruel symbol of both woundedness and mockery. The identity of the thorns remains uncertain, with suggestions ranging from a pliable plant like a prickly pear to sharp, small spines. This crown, more like a victor's garland than a royal diadem, served to taunt Him as the soldiers hailed Him as the "King of the Jews," wielding a reed as a mock scepter. This poignant scene demonstrates the curse of sin and the humility of the Messiah's kingdom, which was not of this world.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The purpose of the crown was not clear, whether it was to wound or simply for mockery."
2. "The type of thorns used in the crown is uncertain, but it is unlikely to be the acanthus or spina Christi plants due to their unsuitability."
3. "Possibly, a flexible shrub or plant like a cactus or prickly pear was used for the crown, such as the naba or nubka plant described by Hasselquist."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "A crown of thorns. This would wound as well as mock Him, though the latter was the chief design."
2. "It is difficult to determine what kind of thorns was used. Alford says: ‘Hasselquist, a Swedish naturalist, supposes a very common plant, naba or nubka of the Arabs, with many small and sharp spines; soft, round, and pliant branches; leaves much resembling ivy, of a very deep green, as if in designed mockery of a victor’s wreath.’"
3. "And a reed in his right hand, as a mock sceptre. The original, according to the best authorities, represents the passive demeanor of Christ, as if His hand did not close on the reed."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "They wove a crown out of thorns which would grow even in the palace grounds." 
2. "It was more like a victor's garland than a royal diadem, but it served the purpose." 
3. "The soldiers were familiar with the Ave Caesar and copy it in their mockery of Jesus: Hail, King of the Jews."

### John Gill:
1. "The crown of thorns...was an emblem of men, comparable to thorns; either of wicked men, and of his being encompassed with them at this time; or of good men, chosen out from among them, redeemed by him, and accounted as a royal diadem with him."
2. "This may teach us many useful lessons: we may see what a curse sin brought upon man, and upon the earth for man's sake; and even upon the Messiah, in the stead of men."
3. "A 'reed' indeed may fitly express the weakness of his kingdom in the eye of the world: but any cane or common staff, or stick, put into his hands in the room of a sceptre, would also signify the meanness of his kingdom, which was not of this world, and came not with observation."
