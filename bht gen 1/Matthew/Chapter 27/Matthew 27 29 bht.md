# Matthew 27:29 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, the imagery of a crown of thorns plays a crucial role. The thorns, chosen specifically to mock Jesus, symbolize both the wounds inflicted upon Him and the mockery intended. The verse highlights the passive demeanor of Christ, not closing His hand on the reed offered to Him. Through this act of mock-adoration, we witness the curse of sin upon both humanity and the Messiah, while also emphasizing the stark contrast between our crowns of glory as believers and the crown of thorns worn by Jesus.

### John Gill:
1. "However, it had its significance, and was an emblem of men, comparable to thorns; either of wicked men, and of his being encompassed with them at this time; or of good men, chosen out from among them, redeemed by him, and accounted as a royal diadem with him."
2. "This may teach us many useful lessons: we may see what a curse sin brought upon man, and upon the earth for man's sake; and even upon the Messiah, in the stead of men."
3. "We may observe the difference between us and Christ: we are a crown of glory, and a royal diadem in his hand; we are crowned with loving kindness and tender mercies, and have a crown of righteousness, life, and glory, laid up for us, and he was crowned with thorns."
