# Matthew 27:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This verse describes the aftermath of Judas' betrayal and betrayal. The commentators highlight his horror and unexpected condemnation, showing the power of an awakened conscience. Judas' repentance, though not godly, was marked by remorse and worldly sorrow rather than true repentance. It serves as a cautionary reminder of the consequences of our actions and the need to understand God's will. Judas' realization that Jesus would not miraculously escape reveals a misunderstanding of Jesus' purpose and mission.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "The condemnation, even though not unexpected, might well fill him with horror."
2. "Perhaps this unhappy man expected, that, while he got the bribe, the Lord would miraculously escape, as He had once and again done before, out of His enemies' power."
3. "A remarkable illustration of the power of an awakened conscience."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "That Judas did not expect this issue, seems contrary to the words of his confession (Matthew 27:4). This circumstance shows that his object was not to induce Jesus to display His glory; in that case his repentance would have led him to Christ and not to suicide."
2. "Remorse is caused by the consequences of sin; repentance is only occasioned by them; in remorse the sorrow is for the consequences, in repentance for the cause, and the sin itself."
3. "The bringing back of the money really supports the view that his one great motive was avarice. Remorse, calling for rectification before men, would point to the moving cause of his crime."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "This verb (first aorist passive participle of μεταμελομα) really means to be sorry afterwards like the English word repent from the Latin repoenitet, to have pain again or afterwards."
2. "The word does not have an evil sense in itself. Paul uses it of his sorrow for his sharp letter to the Corinthians, a sorrow that ceased when good came of the letter (2 Corinthians 7:8)."
3. "But mere sorrow avails nothing unless it leads to change of mind and life (μετανοια), the sorrow according to God (2 Corinthians 7:9)."

### John Gill:
1. "When he saw that he was condemned; that is, that Jesus was condemned...and seeing him leading to the place of execution, repented himself: not for the sin, as committed against God and Christ; but as it brought a load of present guilt and horror upon his mind, and exposed him to everlasting punishment." 

2. "It was not a godly sorrow for sin, or a sorrow for sin, as committed against God, which works repentance to salvation not to be repented of; but a worldly sorrow, which issues in death, as it did in him." 

3. "Judas's repentance was without hope of forgiveness, and was nothing else but horror and black despair, like that of Cain's, like the trembling of devils, and the anguish of damned souls."

### John Wesley:
1. "Judas seeing that he was condemned" - This highlights Judas' realization of the consequences of his actions and the weight of his guilt.
2. "Which probably he thought Christ would have prevented by a miracle" - This suggests that Judas may have expected Jesus to intervene and save him from condemnation, indicating a misunderstanding of Jesus' mission and purpose.
3. "Judas' betrayal and subsequent condemnation serve as a reminder of the consequences of our choices and the importance of understanding God's will."
