## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Observe it was τὰ τρ. ἀργ. which he brought back clearly the price of the Lord’s betrayal, not earnest-money merely."
2. "For by this time, nay when he delivered his Prisoner at the house of Annas, he would have in that case received the rest."
3. "Observe also ὁ παραδιδοὺς αὐτόν, His betrayer, the part. pres. being used as a designation, as in ὁ πειράζων, 'the Tempter,' ch. Matthew 4:3."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The condemnation, even though not unexpected, might well fill him with horror."
2. "Perhaps this unhappy man expected, that, while he got the bribe, the Lord would miraculously escape, as He had once and again done before, out of His enemies' power."
3. "A remarkable illustration of the power of an awakened conscience."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The word rendered 'repented himself,' it has been observed, does not of necessity denote a change 'for the better,' but 'any' change of views and feelings."
2. "Here it evidently means no other change than that produced by the horrors of a guilty conscience, and by deep remorse for crime at its unexpected results."
3. "True repentance leads the sinner to the Saviour. This led away from the Saviour to the gallows."

(Note: The commentary is about Judas' repentance after betraying Jesus, specifically focusing on the nature of his repentance and the consequences of his actions.)

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Repented himself [μεταμεληθεις] . See on Matthew 21:29."
2. "They ignore the question of Christ's innocence."
3. "As to Judas' sin or conscience, that is his matter. Thou wilt see to that."

### John Calvin:
1. "He says that Judas repented; not that he reformed, but that the crime which he had committed gave him uneasiness; as God frequently opens the eyes of the reprobate, so as to begin to feel their miseries, and to be alarmed at them."
2. "True repentance is displeasure at sin, arising out of fear and reverence for God, and producing, at the same time, a love and desire of righteousness."
3. "Wicked men are far from such a feeling; for they would desire to sin without intermission, and even, as far as lies in their power, they endeavor to deceive both God and their own conscience, but notwithstanding their reluctance and opposition, they are tormented with blind horror by their conscience, so that, though they do not hate their sin, still they feel, with sorrow and distress, that it presses heavily and painfully upon them."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "That Judas did not expect this issue, seems contrary to the words of his confession (Matthew 27:4). This circumstance shows that his object was not to induce Jesus to display His glory; in that case his repentance would have led him to Christ and not to suicide."

2. "Remorse is caused by the consequences of sin; repentance is only occasioned by them; in remorse the sorrow is for the consequences, in repentance for the cause, and the sin itself."

3. "The bringing back of the money really supports the view that his one great motive was avarice. Remorse, calling for rectification before men, would point to the moving cause of his crime."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "This verb (first aorist passive participle of μεταμελομα) really means to be sorry afterwards like the English word repent from the Latin repoenitet, to have pain again or afterwards."
2. "The word does not have an evil sense in itself. Paul uses it of his sorrow for his sharp letter to the Corinthians, a sorrow that ceased when good came of the letter."
3. "But mere sorrow avails nothing unless it leads to change of mind and life (μετανοια), the sorrow according to God."

### John Gill:
1. "When he saw that he was condemned; that is, that Jesus was condemned... finding that his master was condemned to death... and seeing him leading to the place of execution, repented himself." 
2. "It was not such a repentance by which he became wiser and better; but an excruciating, tormenting pain in his mind, by which he became worse."
3. "Judas's repentance was without hope of forgiveness, and was nothing else but horror and black despair, like that of Cain's, like the trembling of devils, and the anguish of damned souls."

### John Wesley:
1. "Judas seeing that he was condemned" - This quote highlights Judas' realization of his own guilt and the consequences of his actions. It reveals his expectation that Jesus would intervene and save him from condemnation, indicating his lack of understanding of Jesus' true purpose.

2. "Which probably he thought Christ would have prevented by a miracle" - This quote sheds light on Judas' misguided belief that Jesus would perform a miraculous act to save him from his impending condemnation. It underscores Judas' failure to comprehend the deeper spiritual significance of Jesus' mission.

3. "Judas' expectation of a miraculous intervention reveals his limited understanding of Jesus' true purpose" - This quote emphasizes the contrast between Judas' shallow understanding and Jesus' ultimate mission. It highlights the irony of Judas' misguided expectations and his failure to grasp the profound spiritual nature of Jesus' sacrifice.
