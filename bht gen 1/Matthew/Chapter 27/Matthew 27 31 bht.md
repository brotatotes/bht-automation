# Matthew 27:31 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we see the depiction of Jesus as a gentle and obedient sacrifice, resembling a lamb being led to slaughter. He maintains his silence, never uttering a complaint or showing any resistance, even though he had every right to defend himself. The commentators highlight the contrast between the injustice and cruelty inflicted upon Jesus by the world and the calm and patient demeanor with which he endured it. Despite the opportunity for a fair defense, Jesus was swiftly condemned and led away to be crucified outside the city.

2. "His position, authority, and convictions render the course he pursued one which entitled his name to the continued pillory of shame accorded to it in the Apostles' creed." - This quote emphasizes the lasting shame and condemnation that Pilate's actions brought upon him. It suggests that his decision to allow the mockery of Jesus was not only morally wrong but also had significant consequences.

3. "Pilate's last attempt to release Him." - This quote refers to Pilate's final effort to set Jesus free, indicating that he had the opportunity to prevent the mockery but chose not to.

### John Gill:
1. "He is brought as a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before her shearers is dumb, so he openeth not his mouth": as he made no opposition or struggle, but quietly went along with them, where they led him; so he took everything patiently from them, uttered not one complaint, or any murmuring and repining word, or anything by way of reviling; but became meekly subject to them, and submitted himself to him that judgeth righteously.
2. "Their custom was this; he whose sentence for death is finished, they bring him out from the house of judgment; and one stands at the door of it, and linen clothes in his hand, and a horse at some distance from him; and a crier goes out before him, 'saying', such an one is going to be executed with such a death, because he has committed such a sin, in such a place, at such a time, such and such being witnesses; whoever knows him to be innocent, let him come, and speak in his favour."
3. "Christ had no such length of time, or his friends any liberty granted them to speak for him. They led him out of the common hall, through Jerusalem, and through one of the gates of it, without the city, in order to crucify him, to which he was condemned."
