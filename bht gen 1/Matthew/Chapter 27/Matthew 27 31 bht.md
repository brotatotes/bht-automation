# Matthew 27:31 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the verse described, we see the fulfillment of the prophecy that the Messiah would be led like a silent lamb to the slaughter. Jesus' unwavering silence and submission to his captors as they led Him to His crucifixion is emblematic of His meekness and acceptance of His fate. Additionally, the commentators shed light on the swift and immediate nature of the execution, highlighting the injustice of how Jesus' sentence was quickly carried out without proper time for defense or appeals.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Executions usually took place without the camp." - This quote highlights the historical context of the verse, showing that the crucifixion of Jesus was in line with the customary practice of executing criminals outside the city or camp.

2. "Grotius brings examples to show that the same was the custom of the Romans." - This quote suggests that the Romans also followed a similar practice of executing criminals outside the city, further emphasizing the significance of Jesus' crucifixion happening outside Jerusalem.

3. "ἀπήγ . = ἐξάγουσιν Mark." - This quote points out that the Greek word used in Matthew for "led away" is equivalent to the word used in Mark for "led out," indicating a similarity between the two accounts of Jesus' crucifixion.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The tender mercies of the wicked are cruel." - This quote highlights the irony of Pilate's actions, as his permission of the mockery of Jesus shows a lack of moral earnestness despite his position of authority.
2. "Though Pilate was neither weak nor irresolute, he exhibited that lack of moral principle which then characterized the heathen world." - This quote emphasizes that Pilate's lack of moral principle was not due to weakness or indecisiveness, but rather a reflection of the prevailing moral climate of the time.
3. "His position, authority, and convictions, render the course he pursued one which entitled his name to the continued pillory of shame accorded to it in the Apostles’ creed." - This quote suggests that Pilate's actions were so morally reprehensible that they have been remembered and condemned throughout history, as evidenced by their mention in the Apostles' creed.

### John Gill:
1. "He is brought as a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before her shearers is dumb, so he openeth not his mouth": as he made no opposition or struggle, but quietly went along with them, where they led him; so he took every thing patiently from them, uttered not one complaint, or any murmuring and repining word, or any thing by way of reviling; but became meekly subject to them, and submitted himself to him that judgeth righteously.
2. "after that his judgment, or sentence is finished, they do not tarry with him, but slay him, 'that very day'." 
3. "he whose sentence for death is finished, they bring him out from the house of judgment; and one stands at the door of it, and linen clothes in his hand, and a horse at some distance from him; and a crier goes out before him, 'saying', such an one is going to be executed with such a death, because he has committed such a sin, in such a place, at such a time, such and such being witnesses; whoever knows him to be innocent, let him come, and speak in his favour: if one says, I have something to say in his favour: this waves with the linen clothes, and the other rides upon the horse, and runs and brings back him that is judged, to the sanhedrim; and if he is found innocent, they dismiss him: but if not, he returns, and goes to execution."
