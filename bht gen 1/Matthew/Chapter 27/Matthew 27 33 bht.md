# Matthew 27:33 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, we encounter a significant location known as Golgotha or Calvary, which translates to "skull" in Aramaic and Latin. It is not a place of dead men's skulls, but rather a skull-shaped mount outside of the city of Jerusalem. It is a site that holds historical and religious significance, being the spot where Jesus was crucified and buried in a rock-hewn tomb. This location, though once profaned by uninspiring activities, is now revered as a place where our Lord bore great shame and disgrace for the redemption of humanity.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Golgotha, an Aramaic word, translated skull in Jude 1:9:53; 2 Kings 9:35."
2. "The word Calvary comes through the Latin calvaria, meaning skull, and used in the Vulgate."
3. "The meaning is not, as Tynd., a place of dead men's skulls, but simply skull."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The Jews did not leave bodies unburied, and in their mode of execution (stoning) the skulls would be broken; there is no evidence that the Jews had a special place for public execution; and a rich man like Joseph of Arimathea would not have a garden near such a spot."
2. "Tradition has proved an unsafe guide on such points, and it is highly probable, that this spot was inside the city wall at that time."
3. "It is repugnant to sound Christian feeling to believe that a spot so often profaned and disgraced by the most unworthy superstitions, impostures, and quarrels of Christian sects, should be the sacred spot where the Saviour died for the sins of the race."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Golgotha, or Calvary, is not the traditional place of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem, but a place outside of the city." 
2. "Golgotha is a skull-shaped mount, not a place of dead men's skulls."
3. "The rock-hewn tombs resembling eyes in one of which Jesus may have been buried."

### John Gill:
1. "The true pronunciation is 'Golgoltha', and so it is read in Munster's Hebrew Gospel."
2. "It seems to be so called, because it was the place where malefactors were executed, and afterwards buried; whose bones and skulls in process of time might be dug up, and some of them might lie scattered about in this place."
3. "This place was as infamous as our Tyburn, and to be crucified at 'Golgotha', was as ignominious as to be hanged at Tyburn; which shows what shame and disgrace our Lord was brought, and what he condescended to bear on our account."

### John Wesley:
1. "Golgotha in Syriac signifies a skull or head: it was probably called so from this time." 
2. "Being an eminence upon Mount Calvary, not far from the king's gardens." 
3. "A place called Golgotha, that is, the place of a skull."
