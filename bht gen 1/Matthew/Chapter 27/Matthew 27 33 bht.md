# Matthew 27:33 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Golgotha, also known as Calvary, is a significant location outside the city walls where Jesus was crucified. It is believed to be a small hill or mount resembling a skull. This infamous place was used for public executions and burials, and it carries the symbolic weight of shame and disgrace. Though there is some debate regarding its precise location, the significance of Golgotha lies in the sacrificial death of Jesus, whose victory and atonement reached beyond the offensive smells and infamy of the site, spreading to the entire world.
