# Matthew 27:34 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, Jesus is offered a drink of vinegar mixed with gall or myrrh, which was commonly given to criminals before execution for its stupefying effect. He refuses this mixture, showcasing his awareness of its purpose and his determination to endure his sufferings to the fullest extent. Jesus' refusal also symbolizes his acceptance of the bitter cup of God's wrath, willingly embracing the sacrificial role he was destined to fulfill. His resolute rejection of the drink demonstrates his calm and patient approach to his impending death, obediently following the Father's command.
