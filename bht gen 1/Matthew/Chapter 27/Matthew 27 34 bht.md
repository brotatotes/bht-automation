# Matthew 27:34 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the commentators provide insights into the drink offered to Jesus while he was on the cross. The descriptions mention sour wine, vinegar, gall, myrrh, and the purpose of these mixtures. It is suggested that the drink had a stupefying effect and was intended to alleviate Jesus' pain. Despite the bitterness, Jesus willingly tasted the mixture out of derision but refused the one with myrrh, choosing to fully experience the extent of his suffering.

3. "Now Christ, as I have just now hinted, was not led to refuse the wine or vinegar so much by a dislike of its bitterness, as by a desire to show that he advanced calmly to death, according to the command of the Father, and that he did not rush on heedlessly through want of patience for enduring pain."
