# Matthew 27:35 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this passage, we see the description of a painful and shameful death. The crucifixion is depicted as a form of execution that was disgraceful and reserved for the lowest of criminals. The body would hang on the cross until the person's suffering led to their death. The clothing of the crucified person was usually stripped and divided among the soldiers, while special garments might be cast lots for. This scene on the cross is a fulfillment of prophetic words, symbolizing the divine plan for redemption and the victory over sin and death.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The cross was an upright pale or beam, intersected by a transverse one at right angles, generally in the shape of a ┬."
2. "The body was not supported by the nails, but by a piece of wood which passed between the legs."
3. "The words omitted in the text are clearly interpolated from John 19:24, with just the phrase τὸ ῥηθὲν ὑπὸ (or διὰ) τοῦ προφήτου assimilated to Matthew’s usual form of citation."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The crucified person was then suffered to hang, commonly, until pain, exhaustion, thirst, and hunger ended his life. Sometimes the sufferings continued for days; and when friendly death terminated the life, the body was often suffered to remain - a loathsome object, putrefying in the sun or devoured by birds." 
2. "This punishment was deemed the most disgraceful and ignominious that was practiced among the Romans. It was the way in which slaves, robbers, and the most notorious and abandoned wretches were commonly put to death."
3. "The intense sufferings of the Saviour, however, were sooner terminated. This was caused, perhaps, in some measure, by his previous fatigue and exhaustion, but still more by the intense sufferings of his soul in bearing our griefs and carrying our sorrows in making an atonement for the sins of the world."

### John Calvin:
1. "For the Evangelists exhibit to us the Son of God stripped of his garments, in order to inform us, that by this nakedness we have obtained those riches which make us honorable in the presence of God."
2. "Christ himself permitted his garments to be torn in pieces like a prey, that he might enrich us with the riches of his victory."
3. "In his person, therefore, this is worthy of observation, that the soldiers plundered his raiment, because in this pillage we discern the signs and marks by which he was formerly pointed out."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Men may honestly differ in their statements of the doctrine of the Atonement, but that our Lord then and there so suffered for men, that by virtue of His death we may be at peace with God, who hates our sins, is the only view that accounts for the facts."
2. "Hence the cross, the instrument of such torture, the sign of such shame, and on that account in itself a hindrance to the gospel among those who saw in it only this, has become the symbol of honor, blessing, and redemption."
3. "Even the superstition that bows to it, however to be deprecated, witnesses that the cross is the centre of the Christian scheme."

### John Gill:
1. "This death was not only painful and cruel, but exceedingly shameful and ignominious."
2. "They stripped him of his clothes before they fixed him to the cross, and crucified him naked, as was the custom of the Romans."
3. "They divided his garments into four parts, and each took his part; but his vesture, or coat, being seamless, and woven from top to bottom, they did not choose to tear it into pieces, but cast lots for it, who should have it."

### John Wesley:
1. "They parted his garments — This was the custom of the Romans. The soldiers performed the office of executioners, and divided among them the spoils of the criminals."
2. "My vesture — That is, my inner garment."
3. "Psalm 22:18."
