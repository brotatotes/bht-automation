# Matthew 27:37 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse in question describes the title or inscription placed above Jesus' head on the cross. This title, written in multiple languages, summarized the accusations against him and was meant to mock the Jews. It was a common practice to display such titles during crucifixions, and this particular inscription accurately conveyed the facts of Jesus' conviction and suffering. The variations in the wording of the inscription across the four Gospels serve as a testament to their independent accounts.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The 'title' appears to have been written by Pilate and sent to be affixed on the cross."
2. "It is not known whether the affixing of this title was customary."
3. "On the difference in the four Gospels as to the words of the inscription itself it is hardly worth while to comment, except to remark, that the advocates for the verbal and literal exactness of each Gospel may here find an undoubted example of the absurdity of their view."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "A man is often said to do what he directs others to do."
2. "It was customary to set up over the heads of persons crucified the crime for which they suffered, and the name of the sufferer."
3. "The difficulty may be easily removed. John says that the title was written in Hebrew, Greek, and Latin. It is not at all improbable that the inscription 'varied' in these languages."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Accusation is the cause of his condemnation and suffering."
2. "The word accusation is compounded with the Latin causa, a cause."
3. "Accusation, in this context, refers to the cause of his death."

### John Calvin:
1. "It did not happen without the providence of God, that the death of Christ was made known in three languages."
2. "God had a higher end in view; for by this presage he caused it to be widely known that the death of his Son would be highly celebrated."
3. "All nations would everywhere acknowledge that he was the King promised to the Jews."

3. "Thus He died, with His proper title over His head."
4. "Each of the four Evangelists gives a different form of this title. The entire independence of all four Gospels is fully proven by this variation."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "The title or placard of the crime...was now placed above the head of Jesus...This inscription gave the name and home, Jesus of Nazareth, and the charge on which he was convicted, the King of the Jews." 

2. "The inscription in full was: 'This is Jesus of Nazareth the King of the Jews.'"

1. "The title...contained the sum and substance of what he was accused, and for which he was condemned, and suffered."
