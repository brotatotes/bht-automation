# Matthew 27:37 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Bible verse describes the accusation and title placed upon Jesus as He was led to execution. The accusation is the cause of His suffering, and Pilate wrote it in multiple languages to widely spread knowledge of His death. The title was intended to mock the Jews, but was also a form of derision for crucifying someone they considered their king. This inscription was customary for those being crucified, publicly displaying their crime for all to see.
