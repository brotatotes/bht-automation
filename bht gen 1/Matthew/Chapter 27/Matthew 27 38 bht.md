# Matthew 27:38 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The crucifixion of Jesus, as described by commentators, is a scene of deep irony, mockery, and symbolism. Placed between two robbers, who were potentially members of Barabbas' band, Jesus faced not only the physical pain of crucifixion but also public humiliation. This placement fulfilled the prophecy and highlighted the contrast between the sinless Son of God and the guilty transgressors. Moreover, it symbolizes the choices individuals face between righteousness and sin, with Jesus serving as the ultimate example of redemption. In being crucified among criminals, Jesus identifies with the marginalized and demonstrates his boundless love and forgiveness for all.

### John Calvin:
1. "It was the finishing stroke of the lowest disgrace when Christ was executed between two robbers; for they assigned him the most prominent place, as if he had been the prince of robbers."

3. "Here we perceive how dreadful is the weight of the wrath of God against sins, for appeasing which it became necessary that Christ, who is eternal justice, should be ranked with robbers."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The two robbers were associates of Barabbas, and hence placed on either side of Jesus, who had taken the punishment due to Barabbas." This highlights the irony and mockery implied in the title "King of the Jews," as the two robbers represent the subjects of Jesus as the king.

2. "If this was so ordered by Pilate, it might be done in order to cover the sin, and take off the reproach of putting an innocent person to death, suggesting hereby he was one of them."
3. "The grand reason why it was so ordered, was, that though Christ was no transgressor, he was accounted one, and stood in the room and stead of sinners, and was numbered with them, and as such was treated by divine justice, and accordingly died for them."

### John Wesley:
1. "The fact that Jesus was crucified between two criminals is significant, as it fulfills the prophecy in Isaiah 53:12 that he would be 'numbered with the transgressors.' This placement emphasizes the contrast between Jesus, the sinless Son of God, and the guilty criminals on either side of him." 

2. "The positioning of Jesus between the two criminals also serves as a powerful symbol of the choice that each person must make. Just as the two criminals represent the two paths of righteousness and sin, Jesus stands as the ultimate example of the way of redemption and salvation." 

3. "By being crucified alongside criminals, Jesus identifies himself with the outcasts and the marginalized. This demonstrates his deep love and compassion for all people, regardless of their past or present circumstances. It is a reminder that no one is beyond the reach of God's grace and forgiveness."
