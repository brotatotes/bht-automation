In this Bible verse, there is a powerful testimony to Jesus, revealing the stupidity and madness of the priests who could digest the betrayal of innocent blood. Judas makes a belated confession of his sin, highlighting his lack of true repentance. The Sanhedrin, in response, ignore the righteousness of Christ and focus on their own guilt. This verse also serves as a warning to all, showcasing the terrors of conscience and the dangerous consequences of slaying the innocent.
