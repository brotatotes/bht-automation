# Matthew 27:40 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This verse describes the ongoing actions of someone who habitually tears down and destroys. The participles used emphasize the active and persistent nature of these actions, similar to the characterizations of the devil as the one who tempts. The verse also reflects the crowd's mockery of Jesus, reminding him of his previous claims about the temple and challenging his power. By taunting him with the power to destroy, they doubted his divinity and his ability to save himself from crucifixion. This verse presents a pitiful picture of human depravity and failure in the face of Jesus' sacrifice for sinners.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The characterizing present participle, 'ὁ καταλύων' (the one who pulls down), emphasizes the ongoing nature of the action, suggesting that this person is continuously engaged in tearing down or destroying."
2. "This present participle is similar to the one used in Matthew 4:3 ('ὁ πειράζων'), which characterizes the devil as the one who tempts. Both participles highlight the active and persistent nature of these actions."
3. "By using the present participle, the verse suggests that the person being referred to is not just a one-time destroyer, but someone who habitually tears down and undermines."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Thou that destroyest the temple" - This phrase was a mocking reference to Jesus' claim that he could destroy and rebuild the temple. It was meant to taunt him and challenge his power.
2. "Thou that didst boast that thou couldst do it" - The people were reminding Jesus of his previous statements about the temple, trying to undermine his credibility and authority.
3. "If he could destroy the 'temple,' they thought he might easily come down from the cross" - The crowd believed that if Jesus truly had the power to destroy the temple, then surely he could save himself from crucifixion. They were using this as a test of his divinity.

### John Calvin:
1. "Such is the daring presumption of wicked men, when, under the pretense of the cross, they endeavor to cut them off from the hope of the future life."
2. "Thus are they blinded by the present corruption of our outward man, so as to imagine that the hope of the future restoration of life is vain and foolish."
3. "And now those wicked men affirm that the Redeemer will not be recognized as the Son of God, unless he come clown from the cross, and thus disobey the command of his Father."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Such taunting of one executed has been repeated often enough, and does not, in itself, show that these spectators were worse than the mass of men."
2. "Power to destroy the temple implies power to do this."
3. "The taunt is in a poetic form (Hebrew parallelism); and the crowds at an execution in the east are said to give vent to their feelings in this way still."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "If thou art a son of God," the very language of the devil to Jesus (Matthew 4:3) in the early temptations, now hurled at Jesus under the devil's prompting as he hung upon the Cross.
2. There is allusion, of course, to the claim of Jesus under oath before the Sanhedrin "the Son of God" (ο υιος του θεου) and a repetition of the misrepresentation of his words about the temple of his body.
3. It is a pitiful picture of human depravity and failure in the presence of Christ dying for sinners.

### John Gill:
1. "They refer to the charge of the false witnesses against him, who misrepresenting his words in John 2:19, declared that he gave out that he was able to destroy the temple of Jerusalem, and rebuild it in three days time."
2. "They reproach him with it, and suggest, that these were vain and empty boasts of his; for if he was able to do any thing of that kind, he need not hang upon the tree, but could easily save himself."
3. "But his sonship was not to be declared by his coming down from the cross, which he could have easily effected, but by a much greater instance of power, even by his resurrection from the dead."
