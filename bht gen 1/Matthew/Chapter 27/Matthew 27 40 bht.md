# Matthew 27:40 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, commentators note the taunting and misrepresentation endured by Jesus on the Cross. The crowd's taunt, in a poetic form, reflects the human depravity and failure in the presence of the dying Christ. The references to Jesus' claims about destroying the temple and being the Son of God highlight the false witnesses' misinterpretation and the devil's attempts to challenge Jesus' identity. Ultimately, the verse emphasizes that Jesus' true sonship is not shown by self-preservation but by the greater act of resurrection from the dead.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Philip Schaff:
1. "Such taunting of one executed has been repeated often enough, and does not, in itself, show that these spectators were worse than the mass of men."
2. "Power to destroy the temple implies power to do this."
3. "The taunt is in a poetic form (Hebrew parallelism); and the crowds at an execution in the east are said to give vent to their feelings in this way still."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "If thou art a son of God," the very language of the devil to Jesus (Matthew 4:3) in the early temptations, now hurled at Jesus under the devil's prompting as he hung upon the Cross.
2. There is allusion, of course, to the claim of Jesus under oath before the Sanhedrin "the Son of God" and a repetition of the misrepresentation of his words about the temple of his body.
3. It is a pitiful picture of human depravity and failure in the presence of Christ dying for sinners.

### John Gill:
1. "They refer to the charge of the false witnesses against him, who misrepresenting his words in John 2:19, declared that he gave out that he was able to destroy the temple of Jerusalem, and rebuild it in three days time."
2. "They reproach him with it, and suggest, that these were vain and empty boasts of his; for if he was able to do any thing of that kind, he need not hang upon the tree, but could easily save himself."
3. "His sonship was not to be declared by his coming down from the cross, which he could have easily effected, but by a much greater instance of power, even by his resurrection from the dead."
