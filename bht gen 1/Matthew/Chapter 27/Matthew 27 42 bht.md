# Matthew 27:42 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, commentators emphasize the mockery and scorn Jesus faced during his crucifixion, highlighting the soldiers' reproach as a reminder of his physical and emotional torment. The phrase "He saved others" underscores Jesus' selfless and compassionate nature, while the irony and paradox of "Others he saved; himself he cannot save" emphasizes his sacrificial mission for humanity. By rejecting the miraculous proof of his power, the unbelievers failed to recognize Jesus as the true King of Israel and fulfill the prophecy.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Luke provides a more precise account of the second reproach, attributing it to the soldiers. This detail highlights the widespread mockery and scorn that Jesus faced during his crucifixion."

2. "The soldiers' reproach serves as a reminder of the physical and emotional torment that Jesus endured on the cross. It underscores the depth of his suffering and the magnitude of his sacrifice."

3. "By including the soldiers' reproach, Luke emphasizes the universality of Jesus' rejection and humiliation. It demonstrates that even those tasked with executing him joined in the mockery, further illustrating the extent of his rejection by society."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The phrase 'He saved others' highlights the selfless and compassionate nature of Jesus. It emphasizes his willingness to put others before himself and to sacrifice for their well-being."
2. "The reversal of the order in 'Others he saved; himself he cannot save' serves to emphasize the irony and paradox of the situation. While Jesus had the power to save himself, he chose not to, in order to fulfill his mission of salvation for humanity."
3. "This statement challenges us to reflect on the true meaning of salvation. It reminds us that true salvation is not about self-preservation or personal gain, but about sacrificial love and service to others."

### John Calvin:
1. "It is therefore foolish in the Jews to desire one of an opposite character, whom they may acknowledge as King; for, by so doing, they declare that they have no good-will to the King whom the Lord had promised to give."
2. "But let us, on the contrary, that our faith may firmly rely on Christ, seek a foundation in his cross; for in no other way could he be acknowledged to be the lawful King of Israel than by fulfilling what belonged to the Redeemer."
3. "And hence we conclude how dangerous it is to depart from the word of God by wandering after our speculations. For the Jews, in consequence of having imagined to themselves a King who had been suggested to them by their own senses, rejected Christ crucified, because they reckoned it absurd to believe in him; while we regard it as the best and highest reason for believing, that he voluntarily subjected himself on our account to the ignominy of the cross."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "He saved others. This may be ironical, or it is a recognition of His miracles of mercy, to taunt Him with a supposed loss of power just when He needed it most for Himself. His very mercy is used in mockery."
2. "He is the king of Israel, etc. Ironical, with a mocking suggestion of still being open to the proof of His Messiahship."
3. "Unless there was an atoning purpose in Christ's death, it will always seem strange that He did not offer some such miraculous proof of His power."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The paradox is precisely the philosophy of life proclaimed by Jesus himself."
2. "Now that he is a condemned criminal nailed to the Cross with the claim of being 'the King of Israel' over his head."
3. "Christ will not give new proofs to the blind in heart."

### John Gill:
1. "He came not to save himself, but others, and to save them spiritually and eternally by dying himself."
2. "He, as man, could easily have obtained of his Father more than twelve legions of angels that would have rescued him out of their hands."
3. "He could easily have caused the nails to have given way, and unloosed himself, and come down, who had done such mighty works among them."

These quotes highlight the commentary's emphasis on Jesus' purpose to save others, his divine power to save himself if he chose to, and the disbelief of those who witnessed his miracles but still did not believe in him.
