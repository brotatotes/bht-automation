# Matthew 27:46 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the darkest hours of despair, a cry echoes from the depths of agony. With chilling intensity, the suffering of Christ is unveiled, as He bears the weight of sin and feels forsaken. Amidst the somber atmosphere, the ninth hour strikes, marking the commencement of the Sabbath, as trumpets announce its approach. In this moment of anguish, Jesus, in His humanity, pours out His heart, expressing both trust in God and a haunting sense of forsakenness, as He experiences the consequences of sin in all its depth and universality.
