## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The weightiest question is, In what sense did He use them? His inner consciousness of union with God must have been complete and indestructible but, like His higher and holy Will, liable to be obscured by human weakness and pain."
2. "We must however take care not to ascribe all his suffering to bodily pain, however cruel: his soul was in immediate contact with and prospect of death the wages of sin, which He had taken on Him, but never committed and the conflict at Gethsemane was renewed."
3. "In the words however, ‘My God’ there speaks the same union with the Divine Will, and abiding in the everlasting covenant purpose, as in those, ‘Not my will, but thine.’"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "This expression is one denoting intense suffering."
2. "His great bodily sufferings on the cross, greatly aggravated by his previous scourging, and by the want of sympathy, and by the revilings of his enemies on the cross."
3. "It was the manifestation of God’s hatred of sin, in some way which he has not explained, that he experienced in that dread hour."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The approach of the Sabbath, and then its actual commencement, were announced by threefold blasts from the priests' trumpets." 
2. "The first three blasts were blown when one-third of the evening-sacrifice service was over, or about the ninth hour."
3. "The ninth hour, about 3 P.M. on Friday, marked the beginning of the Sabbath and the arrival of the new course of priests, Levites, and representatives of all Israel in Jerusalem."

These quotes from the commentary highlight the significance of the ninth hour in marking the start of the Sabbath and the arrival of the priests in Jerusalem. They also emphasize the role of the priests' trumpets in announcing the approach of the Sabbath.

### John Calvin:
1. "Though in the cry which Christ uttered a power more than human was manifested, yet it was unquestionably drawn from him by intensity of sorrow."
2. "Those interpreters are widely mistaken who, laying aside this part of redemption, attended solely to the outward punishment of the flesh; for in order that Christ might satisfy for us, it was necessary that he should be placed as a guilty person at the judgment-seat of God."
3. "The perception of God’s estrangement from him, which Christ had, as suggested by natural feeling, did not hinder him from continuing to be assured by faith that God was reconciled to him."

These quotes highlight the intensity of Jesus' sorrow, the necessity of his suffering for our redemption, and the paradox of feeling forsaken by God while still relying on his aid.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The agony resembles that in Gethsemane, but seems even more intense."
2. "The casting lots for His garments is a fulfillment of Matthew 27:18."
3. "This was an experience of sin and death in their inner connection and universal significance for the race, by One who was perfectly pure and holy, a mysterious and indescribable anguish of the body and the soul in immediate prospect of, and in actual wrestling with, death as the wages of sin and the culmination of all misery of man."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "This is the only sentence of any length in Aramaic preserved in Matthew, though he has Aramaic words like amen, corban, mammon, pascha, raca, Satan, Golgotha."
2. "The so-called Gospel of Peter preserves this saying in a Docetic (Cerinthian) form: 'My power, my power, thou hast forsaken me!'"
3. "Nothing from Jesus so well illustrates the depth of his suffering of soul as he felt himself regarded as sin though sinless (2 Corinthians 5:21)."

### John Gill:
1. "The Jews say that 'every day the daily sacrifice was slain at eight and a half, and was offered up at nine and a half': about which time also the passover was killed, which was another type of Christ."
2. "He calls him his God, not as he was God, but as he was man; who, as such, was chosen by him to the grace of union to the Son of God; was made and formed by him; was anointed by him with the oil of gladness; was supported and upheld by him in the day of salvation; was raised by him from the dead, and highly exalted by him at his own right hand."
3. "The condescending grace of Christ is here to be seen, that he, who was the word, that was with God from everlasting, and his only begotten Son that lay in his bosom, that he should descend from heaven by the assumption of human nature, and be for a while forsaken by God, to bring us near unto him."

### John Wesley:
1. "Our Lord's great agony probably continued these three whole hours, at the conclusion of which be thus cried out, while he suffered from God himself what was unutterable."
