# Matthew 27:47 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, there is a mocking statement directed towards Jesus, denying His claim as the Messiah. The words used highlight the belief in the coming of Elijah before the Messiah, suggesting that the mockers were intentionally trying to undermine Jesus' authority. These likely included Hellenistic Jews who had a vague understanding of the Hebrew language and associated Jesus' words with calling for Elijah. This mocking was not based on a genuine misinterpretation, but rather on a deliberate attempt to discredit Jesus.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "This was not said by the Roman soldiers, who could know nothing of Elias."
2. "It was replied in intended mockery, as 'this one among the three,' clearly indicates."
3. "This is one of the cases where those who advocate an original Hebrew Gospel of Matthew are obliged to suppose that the Greek translator has retained the original words, in order to make the reason of the reply clear."

### John Calvin:
1. "For Satan has no method more effectual for ruining the salvation of the godly, than by dissuading them from calling on God."
2. "Thus he impelled the wicked enemies of Christ basely to turn his prayer into derision, intending by this stratagem to strip him of his chief armor."
3. "This ironical language, therefore — or rather this barking of dogs — amounts to saying that Christ has no access to God, because, by imploring Elijah, he seeks relief in another quarter."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The resemblance between the word 'Eli' and the name Elijah is very close in the original." This highlights the linguistic connection between the words used by the people mocking Jesus and the belief in the coming of Elijah before the Messiah.

2. "There is here an allusion to the belief that Elijah would come before the Messiah." This comment emphasizes the cultural and religious context behind the mocking statement, indicating that it was meant to deny Jesus' claim to be the Messiah.

3. "A real misapprehension of His language, and a fear that Elijah might come, seem improbable." This suggests that the mocking statement was not based on a genuine misunderstanding of Jesus' words, but rather on a deliberate attempt to undermine His authority and messianic claims.

### John Gill:
1. "Near the cross, looking on, and mocking at him." 
2. "These could not be the Roman soldiers that said so, who had no notion of Elias."
3. "Rather the Hellenistic Jews, who not so well understanding the Hebrew language, hearing the above words, and having some notion of the prophet Elias, fancied he was calling for him."
