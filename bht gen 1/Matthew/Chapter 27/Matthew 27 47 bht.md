# Matthew 27:47 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the midst of Jesus' crucifixion, those near the cross engaged in cruel and mocking behavior, further increasing his suffering. The mistaken assumption that Jesus was calling for Elias did not come from the Roman soldiers, but instead from Hellenistic Jews or the Jews themselves. It becomes clear that this misinterpretation was not accidental, but rather intentional, as they sought to deride and ridicule Jesus even in his most vulnerable state.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "This was not said by the Roman soldiers, who could know nothing of Elias."
2. "It was replied in intended mockery, as 'this one among the three' clearly indicates."
3. "This is one of the cases where those who advocate an original Hebrew Gospel of Matthew are obliged to suppose that the Greek translator has retained the original words, in order to make the reason of the reply clear."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The taunt would be more cutting, because it was the universal belief of the Jews, as well as the doctrine of Christ, that 'Elias' would come before the Messiah."
2. "They derided him now, as calling upon 'Elias' when God would not help him; still keeping up the pretensions to being the Messiah, and invoking 'Elijah' to come from the dead to aid him."
3. "Or it is possible that this might have been said by some bystanders who did not understand the language in which he spoke, or who might not have been near enough to hear him distinctly."

### John Calvin:
1. "Satan has no method more effectual for ruining the salvation of the godly, than by dissuading them from calling on God."
2. "Thus he impelled the wicked enemies of Christ basely to turn his prayer into derision, intending by this stratagem to strip him of his chief armor."
3. "This ironical language, therefore — or rather this barking of dogs — amounts to saying that Christ has no access to God, because, by imploring Elijah, he seeks relief in another quarter."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The resemblance between the word ‘Eli’ and the name Elijah is very close in the original." 
2. "There is here an allusion to the belief that Elijah would come before the Messiah, and hence a sarcastic denial of His Messiahship." 
3. "A real misapprehension of His language, and a fear that Elijah might come, seem improbable."
