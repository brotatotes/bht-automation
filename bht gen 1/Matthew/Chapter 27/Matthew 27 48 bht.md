# Matthew 27:48 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the act of offering Jesus a sponge filled with vinegar is described. Historically, vinegar mixed with water was a common drink for Roman soldiers, and it is interesting to note that this drink was offered to Jesus. While some may interpret this action as mocking, it is suggested that it was actually done with a friendly intention. Additionally, there is a belief that the offer of vinegar to Jesus was made in anticipation of the possible arrival of Elijah.
