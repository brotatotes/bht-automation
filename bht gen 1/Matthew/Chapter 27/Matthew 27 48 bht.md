# Matthew 27:48 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we see the scene unfold as one of the soldiers offers Jesus a sponge filled with vinegar. This act, which was once offered in mockery, now becomes an act of compassion in Jesus' time of agony. As he hangs on the cross, Jesus accepts the drink, demonstrating his willingness to endure suffering for the sake of his mission. The use of a sponge on a reed, a common tool for offering drink during that time, shows the practicality of the situation. This gesture of refreshment, though small, symbolizes the victory of Jesus' love over the world's hatred.
