## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The fact that the evangelists, in describing our Lord's death, do not use the neuter verb, he died, but he breathed out his life, he gave up his spirit, seems to imply a voluntary yielding up of his life." 

2. "He gave up his life because he willed it, when he willed it, and as he willed it." 

3. "Yielded up the ghost... seems to imply a voluntary yielding up of his life."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The order of the Seven Words (as they are called) is: Before the darkness: 1. The prayer of Christ for His enemies. 2. The promise to the penitent robber. 3. The charge to Mary and John. At the close of the darkness: 4. The cry of distress to His God. Just before His death: 5. The exclamation: 'I thirst.' 6. 'It is finished.' 7. The final commendation of His Spirit to God."
2. "The intervening expression of human want ('I thirst') seems to have been uttered, to show that one of our race was suffering there, and at the same time to obtain the physical support needed to proclaim the victory won by that One of our race for us."
3. "More than victory is rest in God. It has been urged with much force that the physical cause of our Lord's death was 'a broken heart.' This view accounts for the discharge of water and blood mentioned by John (John 19:34)."

### John Gill:
1. "Father, into thy hands I commend my Spirit" - This prayer of Jesus demonstrates his strong confidence in God and his fearless attitude towards death. It reveals his deep trust in the Father and his willingness to surrender himself completely. 

2. "Being able to express himself in such a manner, this declared him to be more than a mere man" - Jesus' ability to speak with such a loud voice, despite the physical agony he had endured, points to his divine nature. It convinces the centurion that Jesus is indeed the Son of God. 

3. "He died willingly, and when nature was in its full strength" - Jesus' voluntary death shows his great love and amazing grace towards humanity. It was not forced upon him, but rather a selfless act of offering himself as a sacrifice for the salvation of his people.

### John Wesley:
1. "He dismissed his spirit - So the original expression may be literally translated: an expression admirably suited to our Lord's words, John 10:18: No man taketh my life from me, but I lay it down of myself."
2. "He died by a voluntary act of his own, and in a way peculiar to himself. He alone of all men that ever were, could have continued alive even in the greatest tortures, as long as he pleased, or have retired from the body whenever he had thought fit."
3. "And how does it illustrate that love which he manifested in his death? Insomuch as he did not use his power to quit his body, as soon as it was fastened to the cross, leaving only an insensible corpse, to the cruelty of his murderers: but continued his abode in it, with a steady resolution, as long as it was proper."
