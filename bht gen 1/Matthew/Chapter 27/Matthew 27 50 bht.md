1. "He cried, 'It is finished,'... It finished the work of atonement, made the way of salvation possible, rolled away the curse from guilty people, and opened the kingdom of heaven to all true believers."
2. "It was in the height of his agony, probably attended with deep groaning, and uttered amid sorrows which were never else experienced in our world."
3. "Yielded up the ghost... It means resigned his spirit, or 'expired.' The same phrase is used by the Septuagint in describing the death of Rachel."

### John Calvin:
1. "Though this form of prayer appears to be borrowed from Psalms 31:5, yet I have no doubt that he applied it to his immediate object, according to present circumstances; as if he had said, 'I see, indeed, O Father, that by the universal voice I am destined to destruction, and that my soul is, so to speak, hurried to and fro; but though, according to the flesh, I perceive no assistance in thee, yet this will not hinder me from committing my spirit into thy hands, and calmly relying on the hidden safeguard of thy goodness.'"

2. "Having made God the guardian of his soul, he rejoices that it is safe from all danger; and, at the same time, prepares to meet death with confidence, whenever it shall please God, because the Lord guards the souls of his people even in death."

3. "Let us now remember that it was not in reference to himself alone that Christ committed his soul to the Father, but that he included, as it were, in one bundle all the souls of those who believe in him, that they may be preserved along with his own; and not only so, but by this prayer he obtained authority to save all souls, so that not only does the heavenly Father, for his sake, deign to take them into his custody, but, giving up the authority into his hands, commits them to him to be protected."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The order of the Seven Words (as they are called) is: Before the darkness: 1. The prayer of Christ for His enemies. 2. The promise to the penitent robber. 3. The charge to Mary and John. At the close of the darkness: 4. The cry of distress to His God. Just before His death: 5. The exclamation: ‘‘I thirst.’ 6. ‘It is finished.’ 7. The final commendation of His Spirit to God." 

2. "The intervening expression of human want ('I thirst') seems to have been uttered, to show that one of our race was suffering there, and at the same time to obtain the physical support needed to proclaim the victory won by that One of our race for us."

3. "More than victory is rest in God. It has been urged with much force that the physical cause of our Lord’s death was ‘a broken heart.’ This view accounts for the discharge of water and blood mentioned by John (John 19:34)."
