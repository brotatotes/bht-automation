# Matthew 27:51 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As the earthquake struck, the rocks were rent apart, a physical manifestation of the moral upheaval taking place. The veil in the temple, thick and intricately woven, was torn from top to bottom, symbolizing the removal of the barrier between God and humanity. It was a sign of the completion of the atonement, granting all believers free access to God. The earth's shaking was a reflection of divine anger, while the cleaving of the veil signaled the breaking of Christ's body and the opening of a way through His flesh for all who believe.
