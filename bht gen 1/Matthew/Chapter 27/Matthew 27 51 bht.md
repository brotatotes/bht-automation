# Matthew 27:51 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The rending of the veil in the temple, which separated the holy of holies from the court of the priests, was a powerful symbol of the removal of the Jewish ceremonies and the opening of a new way through the flesh of Christ for all believers into the presence of God. It signified the abolishment of the old covenant and the invitation for all to approach God with familiarity and freedom. This supernatural act, accompanied by an earthquake, demonstrated the significance of Christ's death and its impact on the destiny of the earth itself.
