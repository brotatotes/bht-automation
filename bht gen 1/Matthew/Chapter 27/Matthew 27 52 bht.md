# Matthew 27:52 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In a supernatural and symbolic transaction, Jesus' death opened the tombs, proclaiming victory over death. The graves were opened at Jesus' death, but the bodies of the saints did not arise until after His resurrection. This miraculous sign left no doubt about the fact of Jesus' resurrection and His power over death and the grave.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1) "The whole transaction was supernatural and symbolic: no other interpretation of it will satisfy even ordinary common sense."
2) "What but the opening of the tombs the symbolic declaration 'mors janua vit√¶,' that the death which had happened had broken the bands of death for ever?"
3) "The graves were opened at the moment of the death of the Lord; but inasmuch as He is the first-fruits from the dead the Resurrection and the Life the bodies of the saints in them did not arise till He rose."

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "In the opening of the graves at the moment of the Redeemer's expiring, there was a glorious symbolical proclamation that the death which had just taken place had 'swallowed up death in victory'." 
2. "It was fitting that 'the Prince of Life . . . should be the First that should rise from the dead'." 
3. "Thus, while it was not deemed fitting that He Himself should appear again in Jerusalem, save to the disciples, provision was made that the fact of His resurrection should be left in no doubt."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Graves" or sepulchres were most commonly made, among the Jews, in solid rocks or in caves of rocks. The rending of the rocks, therefore, would lay them open.
2. The graves were opened by this earthquake, but the dead in them did not rise until after his resurrection.
3. It is probable that they were persons who had recently died, and they appear to have been known in Jerusalem; at least, had the ancient saints risen, they would not have been known, and would not so soon have been credited as those who had recently died.

### John Calvin:
1. "This was also a striking miracle, by which God declared that his Son entered into the prison of death, not to continue to be shut up there, but to bring out all who were held captive."
2. "For Christ is called the first-born from the dead, (Colossians 1:18,) and the first-fruits of those who rise, (1 Corinthians 15:20,) because by his death he commenced, and by his resurrection he completed, a new life."
3. "But in order that the minds of believers might be more quickly raised to hope, it was advantageous that the resurrection, which was to be common to all of them, should be tasted by a few."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "The splitting of the rocks by the earthquake and the opening of tombs can be due to the earthquake."
2. "The raising of the bodies of the dead after the resurrection of Jesus which appeared to many in the holy city puzzles many today."
3. "If we grant the possibility of such manifestations of God's power, there is little to disturb one here in the story of the death of God's Son."

### John Gill:
1. "This was a proof of Christ's power over death and the grave, by dying; when he through death, destroyed him that had the power of it, and abolished death itself."
2. "But because the other event now happened, they are both recorded here: these were saints, and such as slept in Jesus; and of whom he is the first fruits that now rose."
3. "And they rose in the same bodies in which they before lived, otherwise they could not be called their bodies, or known by those to whom they appeared."
