## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Albert Barnes:
1. "The narrative of Matthew does not determine whether they came to life before Jesus rose, and remained in the tombs, or came to life after he died. The latter is probably the correct opinion."
2. "There is nothing said of the reason why they were raised. It is not improbable to suppose that it was, amid the other wonders attending the death of Jesus, to convince the Jews that he was the Messiah."
3. "Perhaps some who had been his open friends were raised up now as an attestation that he in whom they had believed was the Christ."

### John Calvin:
1. "Matthew bestows on Jerusalem the honorable designation of the holy city... its holiness, which was founded on God's adoption, could not be effaced by any corruptions of men."
2. "On the part of man it was profane, and on the part of God it was holy."
3. "Till the destruction or pollution of the temple, which happened not long after the crucifixion of Christ."

### John Gill:
1. "The resurrection of Christ; for he rose as the first fruits, as the first begotten of the dead, and the firstborn from the dead; for he was the first that was raised to an immortal life."
2. "These saints, I apprehend, continued on earth until our Lord's ascension, and then joining the retinue of angels, went triumphantly with him to heaven, as trophies of his victory over sin, Satan, death, and the grave."
3. "These risen saints...appeared unto many; of their friends and acquaintance, who had personally known them, and conversed with them in their lifetime."
