# Matthew 27:54 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In Matthew 27:51-53, the precise details found in Mark's account are not recorded, except for the tearing of the veil. The centurion's declaration, "Truly this was the Son of God," signifies his recognition of Jesus' divinity and validates Jesus' claim to be the Son of God. The soldiers, who had heard about Jesus' claim, were convinced that the extraordinary signs and miracles they witnessed confirmed Jesus' authenticity. Their fear and acknowledgement of Jesus as the Son of God reveal the profound impact of his crucifixion on both Jews and pagans alike.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The circumstances of our Matthew 27:51-53, except the rending of the veil, are not in the possession of Mark, of the minute accuracy of whose account I have no doubt." 
2. "His report is that of one man and that man, more than probably, a convert. Matthew’s is of many, and represents their general impression." 
3. "It cannot be doubtful, I think, that he used these words in the Jewish sense and with some idea of that which they implied."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Truly this was the Son of God—There cannot be a reasonable doubt that this expression was used in the Jewish sense, and that it points to the claim which Jesus made to be the Son of God, and on which His condemnation expressly turned."
2. "The meaning, then, clearly is that He must have been what He professed to be; in other words, that He was no impostor."
3. "There was no medium between those two."

These quotes highlight the centurion's recognition of Jesus as the Son of God and the significance of this declaration in affirming Jesus' identity and refuting any doubts about Him being an impostor.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "They feared greatly - They regarded these things as proof that God was angry, and they were terrified at the prospect that vengeance was coming on them."
2. "Truly this was the Son of God - They had heard, probably, that Jesus professed to be the Son of God. Seeing these wonders, they believed that God was now attesting the truth of his professions."
3. "The centurion was a pagan, and had probably no very distinct notions of the phrase 'the Son of God' - perhaps understanding by it only that he was like the pagan heroes who had been deified; but he certainly regarded these wonders as proof that he was 'what he professed to be.'"

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The words must not be construed as a recognition of Christ's divine sonship."
2. "They were uttered by a pagan soldier in his own sense of a demigod or hero."
3. "Yet they may have taken color from the fact that the soldiers had heard from the chief priests and others that Christ had claimed to be God's son."

### John Calvin:
1. "It is wonderful that an irreligious man, who had not been instructed in the Law, and was ignorant of true religion, should form so correct a judgment from the signs which he beheld."
2. "Not only did true religion open the eyes of devout worshippers of God to perceive that from heaven God was magnifying the glory of Christ, but natural understanding compelled foreigners, and even soldiers, to confess what they had not learned either from the law or from any instructor."
3. "The centurion intended to applaud the unshaken perseverance of Christ in calling on the name of God. Nor was it merely the cry of Christ that led the centurion to think so highly of him, but this confession was extorted from him by perceiving that his extraordinary strength harmonized with heavenly miracles."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The heathen officer may have used these words in the heathen sense: hero or demigod; but this is not probable. For he had heard this accusation, must have known something of Jewish opinion; heathen became Christians through the preaching of the cross, why not through the sight of the dying Redeemer." 
2. "Such a conversion would be thus indicated."
3. "Only the centurion thus spoke, but as the soldiers ‘feared, some decided spiritual effect may have been produced on them also."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "There is no way to tell. Evidently the centurion was deeply moved by the portents which he had witnessed."
2. "How much he meant by his words we do not know, but probably he meant more than merely 'a righteous man'."
3. "If he was won now to trust in Christ, he came as a pagan and, like the robber who believed, was saved as Jesus hung upon the Cross."

### John Gill:
1. "They feared greatly; not with a true godly fear, but with a fear of punishment; lest divine vengeance should light on them, for their concern in this matter." 
2. "Which they concluded, not from any mediatorial performances, which they were utter strangers to, but from effects of divine power." 
3. "And which to them showed him to be a divine person, what he said he was, and the Jews charged him with blasphemy, on account of, and condemned him for, as these soldiers might have seen and heard."

### John Wesley:
1. "The centurion...feared, saying, Truly this was the Son of God" - This statement highlights the centurion's recognition of Jesus' divinity, acknowledging Him as the Son of God.

2. "Referring to the words of the chief priests and scribes" - This phrase emphasizes the contrast between the religious leaders who mocked Jesus' claim to be the Son of God and the centurion who witnessed the crucifixion and came to believe in Jesus' true identity.

3. "He said, I am the Son of God" - This quote from Matthew 27:43 underscores the significance of Jesus' own declaration of His divine nature, which the centurion witnessed and ultimately accepted.
