# Matthew 27:55 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we see a group of devoted women who had closely followed and ministered to Jesus throughout his ministry. These faithful women, who had accompanied Jesus from Galilee to Jerusalem, stood by him even in his darkest hour. They witnessed his sufferings from a distance and remained steadfast in their devotion, their faith shining brightly. Despite the disciples fleeing, these women, integral members of Jesus' inner circle, displayed extraordinary attachment and refused to abandon him.
