# Matthew 27:58 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
A respected and wealthy man, Joseph, sought the body of Jesus from Pilate, despite it being unlawful to remove a crucified body so soon. He showed no shame or fear in boldly entering Pilate's palace. By doing so, he prevented the body from being abused and buried in an ignominious manner, thus honoring Christ even in his death. Joseph's reputation and Pilate's favorable view of Jesus may have contributed to Pilate readily granting Joseph's request.
