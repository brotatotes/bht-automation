# Matthew 27:58 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, there is a remarkable repetition and change of subject. The courageous Joseph approaches Pilate, seeking permission to bury the body, highlighting his determination to honor and respect Jesus. This act was significant since the customary practice was to bury the crucified before sunset, yet Pilate's consent was required. His readiness to grant permission may have been influenced by Joseph's reputation and the high regard Pilate had for Jesus. Joseph's boldness in approaching Pilate and his desire to prevent the abuse of Jesus' body show his unwavering dedication to Jesus even in death.
