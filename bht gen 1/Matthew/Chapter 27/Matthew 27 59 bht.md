# Matthew 27:59 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, commentators express different aspects of the burial of Jesus. They highlight the generosity and intentionality of Joseph, who provided a suitable sepulcher for Jesus, showing "magnificence and splendor." The arrival of Nicodemus with the spices emphasizes the significance of the temporary embalming and the limited time available for the process. Despite the hurried nature of the burial, the women who were witnesses and caretakers had the intention of bestowing more elaborate care on Jesus' body.
