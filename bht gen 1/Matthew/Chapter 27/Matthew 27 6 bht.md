# Matthew 27:6 Commentary Help Text

In this verse, the chief priests, in their hypocritical manner, hesitate to put the silver pieces into the treasury, considering the price of blood as inappropriate for sacred offerings. This highlights their meticulousness in religious matters while being blind to their own guilt in condemning Jesus. Their actions unintentionally fulfill the Scripture, exemplifying divine irony. These priests, who condemned Jesus, refused to defile the treasury but had no qualms about defiling their own hands by seeking and shedding innocent blood.
