# Matthew 27:60 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In a garden near the crucifixion site, a new tomb was prepared for the body of Jesus, who rose from the dead. The tomb, chosen by providence, belonged to someone else, underscoring Christ's lack of a permanent resting place in life and death. To protect the body from harm, a large stone was rolled to seal the tomb, following the common custom of closing sepulchers. This detail of the burial scene emphasizes the significance of the location and highlights the events that followed in the resurrection story.
