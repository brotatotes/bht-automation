# Matthew 27:60 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Bible verse describes the burial of Jesus in a new tomb prepared by Joseph, which had a stone rolled to close its entrance. The commentators note that Joseph's tomb was not a natural cave, but an artificial excavated in the rock. They mention the significance of Jesus being buried in someone else's tomb, emphasizing that it fulfills the prophecy of Isaiah 53:9. The location of the tomb, near the crucifixion site, and the stone rolled to the door are also mentioned. This passage highlights the humility and sacrificial nature of Jesus' burial.
