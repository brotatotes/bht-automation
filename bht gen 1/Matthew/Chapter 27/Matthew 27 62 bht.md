# Matthew 27:62 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
On the day before the Sabbath, known as the day of preparation, the chief priests and Pharisees, driven by their hatred for Jesus, went to Pilate in the evening after the Sabbath ended. While accusing the disciples of Sabbath violation, they themselves disregarded their own Sabbath laws to plot against Jesus. The events surrounding the crucifixion and resurrection of Christ exposed their hypocrisy and revealed that the Jewish Sabbath was now abolished.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The chief priests, &c. did not go to Pilate on the sabbath, but in the evening, after the termination of the sabbath." 
2. "The meaning of the saying may have been, and was, hid from the disciples; but the fact of its having been said could be no secret."
3. "Hatred is keener sighted than love; that the raising of Lazarus would show, what sort of a thing rising from the dead was to be; and that the fulfillment of the Lord’s announcement of his crucifixion would naturally lead them to look further, to what more he had announced."

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "The crucifixion took place on the Friday and all was not over till shortly before sunset, when the Jewish sabbath commenced."
2. "That sabbath day was a high day, being the first day of the feast of unleavened bread."
3. "They hastened to take their measures after the Sabbath day was over at six on Saturday evening."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The first day of the feast of the Passover was called the day of 'preparation,' because all things were on that day got in readiness for the observances of the paschal week."
2. "The 'next day' mentioned here does not mean the following day in our acceptation of the word, or the following 'morning,' but the next day in the Jewish way of speaking - that is, after the next day had commenced, or after sundown."
3. "To suppose them to have waited until the next morning would be absurd, as the disciples would be as likely to steal him away the first night as the second."

### John Calvin:
1. "The resurrection of Christ would undoubtedly have been less manifest, or, at least, they would have had more plausible grounds for denying it, if they had not taken pains to station witnesses at the sepulcher."
2. "We see then how the Lord not only disappointeth the crafty, but employs even their own schemes as snares for holding them fast, that he may draw and compel them to render obedience to him."
3. "Yet let us observe that God, as if he had hired them for the purpose, employed their services for rendering the glory of Christ more illustrious, because no plausible ground for lying, in order to deny it, was left to them when they found the grave empty."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The morrow, which is the day after the preparation... The first day of the Passover (Friday) was in one sense a Sabbath, hence this designation is more definite." 

2. "While our Lord rested in the tomb, they desecrated the Sabbath, despite their great scrupulousness." 

3. "It is urged that this must have taken place on Friday evening after six o’clock, since the rulers would guard against the stealing away on the first night as well as on the subsequent one. But their anxiety was about the night preceding the third day."

### John Gill:
1. "It shows what consciences these men had, who accused the disciples of Christ of a violation of the Sabbath, for plucking a few ears of corn on that day; and sought to kill Jesus, because he healed a man on it, and bid him take up his bed and walk."
2. "And yet they themselves could leave their devotions, and first meet together and agree upon an address to Pilate, and then go in a body to his palace."
3. "They scrupled them not, notwithstanding their characters and profession."

These quotes highlight the hypocrisy of the chief priests and Pharisees in accusing others of Sabbath violations while themselves engaging in activities that were considered unlawful on the Sabbath. It exposes their lack of genuine conscience and their willingness to compromise their own beliefs and principles for their own agenda.
