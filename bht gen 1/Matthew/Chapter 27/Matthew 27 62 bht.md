# Matthew 27:62 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
On the day before the Sabbath, Jesus was crucified and all was not over until shortly before sunset when the Jewish Sabbath began. The crucifixion coincided with the first day of the feast of unleavened bread, which was a high day. After the Sabbath ended on Saturday evening, the religious leaders took measures to ensure that the glory of Christ would not be denied, even hiring guards to secure the empty tomb. This sequence of events illustrates the craftiness and impotence of those who opposed Jesus, as their own schemes ultimately served to solidify the truth of his resurrection.

### John Calvin:
1. "The resurrection of Christ would undoubtedly have been less manifest, or, at least, they would have had more plausible grounds for denying it, if they had not taken pains to station witnesses at the sepulcher."
2. "We see then how the Lord not only disappointeth the crafty, but employs even their own schemes as snares for holding them fast, that he may draw and compel them to render obedience to him."
3. "Yet let us observe that God, as if he had hired them for the purpose, employed their services for rendering the glory of Christ more illustrious, because no plausible ground for lying, in order to deny it, was left to them when they found the grave empty."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The morrow, which is the day after the preparation... The first day of the Passover (Friday) was in one sense a Sabbath, hence this designation is more definite." 
2. "While our Lord rested in the tomb, they desecrated the Sabbath, despite their great scrupulousness." 
3. "It is urged that this must have taken place on Friday evening after six o'clock, since the rulers would guard against the stealing away on the first night as well as on the subsequent one. But their anxiety was about the night preceding the third day."

### John Gill:
1. "It shows what consciences these men had, who accused the disciples of Christ of a violation of the sabbath, for plucking a few ears of corn on that day; and sought to kill Jesus, because he healed a man on it, and bid him take up his bed and walk." 

2. "And yet they themselves could leave their devotions, and first meet together and agree upon an address to Pilate, and then go in a body to his palace; and having obtained their request, march to Joseph's garden, and make the sepulchre sure, sealing the stone, and setting a watch, which were servile works, and, according to their laws and traditions, not to be done on the sabbath day."

3. "These were the inveterate and implacable enemies of Christ; they took counsel how to put him to death; they employed Judas to betray him, and sent a band of soldiers with him to take him; they suborned false witnesses against him; they moved the people to prefer Barabbas to him; they got him condemned to death, and followed him to the cross, where they mocked him; and still, like the troubled sea, they were restless and uneasy."

### John Wesley:
1. "The day of preparation was the day before the Sabbath, whereon they were to prepare for the celebration of it."
2. "The next day then was the Sabbath according to the Jews."
3. "The evangelist seems to express it by this circumlocution, to show the Jewish Sabbath was then abolished."
