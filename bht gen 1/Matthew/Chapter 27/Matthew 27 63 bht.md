# Matthew 27:63 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the commentators shed light on the responses and actions of various individuals towards Jesus. We see how even Jesus' enemies unintentionally affirmed the reality of His death and how others persisted in labeling Him as a deceiver. The commentators also highlight the irony of the Jewish leaders referring to Jesus as "that deceiver," despite His public teaching and miraculous works. Furthermore, they demonstrate the blindness of Jesus' disciples in not fully comprehending His words, as well as the twisted interpretations made by His accusers during His trial.
