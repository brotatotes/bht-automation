# Matthew 27:63 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this passage, the commentators provide insights into the reactions and perceptions of different individuals towards Jesus. The Jewish leaders persistently referred to Jesus as a "deceiver" even after His death, viewing His execution as evidence against His claims. On the other hand, the disciples struggled to remember His teachings and comprehend His words, as evidenced by their confusion over His reference to the temple of His body. Despite the mockery and misconception surrounding Jesus, His triumph and victory were spoken of in triumphant language, bringing hope and light out of the darkness.
