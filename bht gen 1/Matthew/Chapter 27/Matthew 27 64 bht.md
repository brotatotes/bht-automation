# Matthew 27:64 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we are presented with a situation where the tomb of Jesus is being secured with a Roman guard to prevent any tampering or theft. The religious leaders fear the potential impact of a resurrection claim and wish to expose what they perceive as deception. There is a concern about the credibility and authority of these leaders if Jesus' resurrection gains traction. The belief in Jesus' resurrection is seen as the last error or delusion, leading people away from the true teachings of Christianity.
