# Matthew 27:66 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the biblical account being described, the commentators share insights into the measures taken to secure the tomb of Jesus after His crucifixion. The stone at the entrance was sealed with a cord or string, affixed to the rock with sealing-clay, ensuring it could not be moved without detection. This strict sealing process, carried out in the presence of Roman guards, aimed to prevent any theft or tampering with the body. The commentators emphasize the wisdom and providence of God in orchestrating these precautions, which ultimately served as additional evidence of the miraculous resurrection of Jesus.
