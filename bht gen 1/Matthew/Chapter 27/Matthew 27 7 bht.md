# Matthew 27:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This Bible verse describes the purchase of the potter's field, a plot of land near Jerusalem that was of little value and unfit for agriculture or pasture. The field, which may have been dug up for the use of potters, was cheaply purchased for the purpose of burying strangers. The act of buying the field was seen as a way for the individuals involved to cover up their betrayal of innocent blood, while also providing for the burial of foreigners and heathens in Jerusalem.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Philip Schaff:
1. "The potter's field. Some well known spot, of little value, because unfit for tillage."
2. "The field of blood' would be deemed good enough for this class, who could not be wholly overlooked. The charity was at all events a cheap one, and Pharisaism is true to itself in this."
3. "This first graveyard (instead of the usual isolated sepulchres) was not consecrated but desecrated by the burial of a suicide; the remains of such are usually refused a place in 'consecrated' burial-grounds."

### John Gill:
1. "They bought with them the potter's field, to bury strangers in: a field of no great value, or it could not have been bought so near Jerusalem for so small a sum as thirty pieces of silver."
2. "Grotius's conjecture seems to be a good one, that it was a field the potter had dug up for his use, and had made the most of it; so that it was good for nothing, but for the purpose for which these men bought it, 'to bury strangers in'."
3. "By this act of humanity in providing for the interment of strangers, they designed, and hoped to have covered their wickedness in bargaining with Judas to betray innocent blood, for this sure of money."

### John Wesley:
1. "The potter's field...had probably been digged for potters' vessels, so that it was now neither fit for tillage nor pasture, and consequently of small value." 
2. "This was a small price for a field so near Jerusalem." 
3. "Foreigners - Heathens especially, of whom there were then great numbers in Jerusalem."
