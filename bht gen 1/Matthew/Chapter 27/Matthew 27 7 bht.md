# Matthew 27:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the described Bible verse, religious leaders purchase a field known as the potter's field. This field, which was rendered useless due to clay excavation, became available at a small price. While located near Jerusalem, it held little value due to its condition. The purchase of this field was intended to provide a burial place for strangers, including foreigners and non-believers, emphasizing the diverse population and cultural dynamics of Jerusalem.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The field of some well-known potter purchased at so small a price probably from having been rendered useless for tillage by excavations for clay."
2. "Not for Gentiles, but for stranger Jews who came up to the feasts."
3. "See note on Acts 1:19."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "They consulted among themselves about the proper way to dispose of this money."
2. "It is not of necessity implied that Judas actually made the contract and paid down the money to buy a field to bury strangers in - a thing which would be in itself very improbable, but that it was 'by his means' that the field was purchased."
3. "The price paid for a field so near Jerusalem may appear to be very small; but it is not improbable that it had been worked until the clay was exhausted, and was neither suitable for that business nor for tillage, and was therefore considered as of little value."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The potter’s field. Some well known spot, of little value, because unfit for tillage."
2. "‘The field of blood’ would be deemed good enough for this class, who could not be wholly overlooked. The charity was at all events a cheap one, and Pharisaism is true to itself in this."
3. "This first graveyard (instead of the usual isolated sepulchres) was not consecrated but desecrated by the burial of a suicide; the remains of such are usually refused a place in ‘consecrated ‘burial-grounds."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "The potter's field (του αγρου του κεραμεως). Grotius suggests that it was a small field where potter's clay was obtained, like a brickyard (Broadus). Otherwise we do not know why the name exists."
2. "In Acts 1:18 we have another account of the death of Judas by bursting open (possibly falling after hanging himself) after he obtained the field by the wages of iniquity."
3. "But it is possible that εκτησατο there refers to the rabbinical use of Korban, that the money was still that of Judas though he was dead and so he really 'acquired' the field by his blood-money."

### John Gill:
1. "A field of no great value, or it could not have been bought so near Jerusalem for so small a sum as thirty pieces of silver."
2. "Grotius's conjecture seems to be a good one, that it was a field the potter had dug up for his use, and had made the most of it; so that it was good for nothing, but for the purpose for which these men bought it, 'to bury strangers in'."
3. "By this act of humanity in providing for the interment of strangers, they designed, and hoped to have covered their wickedness in bargaining with Judas to betray innocent blood, for this sure of money."

### John Wesley:
1. "They bought with them the potter's field" - This field, known by that name, was purchased by the religious leaders. It was of little value due to the previous digging for potters' vessels, rendering it unsuitable for agriculture or grazing.

2. "This was a small price for a field so near Jerusalem" - Despite its proximity to Jerusalem, the potter's field was sold at a relatively low cost. This suggests that its condition and limited use greatly affected its value.

3. "Foreigners, especially heathens" - The presence of foreigners, particularly non-believers, was significant in Jerusalem at that time. This context sheds light on the diverse population and cultural dynamics within the city.
