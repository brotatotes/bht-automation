# Matthew 27:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, the name of the prophet mentioned is debatable, with some suggesting Jeremiah and others pointing to Zechariah. The commentators shed light on different aspects of the prophecy, emphasizing its fulfillment, the contemptuous treatment of the Messiah, and the significance of purchasing the potter's field with the thirty pieces of silver. The discrepancy in names purposefully showcases the unity of prophecy, amplifying the undoubted reference to the Messiah and the divine inspiration of the prophets. Through this Scripture, ancient prophecies find their astonishing fulfillment in Christ.
