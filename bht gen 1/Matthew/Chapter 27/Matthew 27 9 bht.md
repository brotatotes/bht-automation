# Matthew 27:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this scripture, a prophecy from the Old Testament is brought to fulfillment. The actions of the Sanhedrin unwittingly bring about the realization of this prophecy, highlighting the unity of prophecy and the undoubted reference to the Messiah. The purchase of the potter's field with the price Christ was valued at is a remarkable fulfillment of this hopelessly dark and complicated prophecy. Through this verse, the poor condition of the Jews at the time of Christ's coming is accurately portrayed, while the mistaken mention of Jeremiah instead of Zechariah is rectified.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Never was a complicated prophecy, otherwise hopelessly dark, more marvelously fulfilled."
2. "Perhaps the true explanation is the following, from LIGHTFOOT: 'Jeremiah of old had the first place among the prophets, and hereby he comes to be mentioned above all the rest...'"
3. "When, therefore, Matthew produceth a text of Zechariah under the name of Jeremy, he only cites the words of the volume of the prophets under his name who stood first in the volume of the prophets."

### Philip Schaff:
1) "The action of the Sanhedrin undesignedly fulfilled prophecy."
2) "The discrepancy was purposed; to show the unity of prophecy."
3) "The reference to the Messiah is undoubted."


### John Gill:
1. "Through the purchasing of the potter's field with the thirty pieces of silver, the price that Christ was valued at, a prophecy in the writings of the Old Testament had its accomplishment."
2. "The person spoken of is in Zechariah 11:4, called to 'feed the flock of slaughter', which being in a very poor condition, Zechariah 11:5, the state of the Jews, at the time of Christ's coming, is hereby very aptly represented."
3. "The Jews themselves own, that this prophecy belongs to the Messiah, though they interpret it of him in another manner."

### John Wesley:
1. "Then was fulfilled — What was figuratively represented of old, was now really accomplished."
2. "What was spoken by the prophet — The word Jeremy, which was added to the text in latter copies, and thence received into many translations, is evidently a mistake."
3. "For he who spoke what St. Matthew here cites (or rather paraphrases) was not Jeremy, but Zechariah. Zechariah 11:12."
