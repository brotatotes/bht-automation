# Matthew 28:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
On the day after the Sabbath, the women came early in the morning at daybreak, at the ending of the Sabbath, to see the sepulcher. The atmosphere was still dark, before the sun had risen, but it was during the transition from night to day. Their purpose for coming was to anoint the body of Jesus, which they had prepared with spices and ointments since the end of the previous Sabbath. Their dedicated love for Jesus led them to be the first witnesses of his resurrection, as they sought to honor him and show their faithfulness.
