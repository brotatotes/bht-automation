3. "There is perhaps more probability that this may be the same appearance as that in John 20:11-18, on account of μή μου ἅπτου there and τοὺς ἀδελφ . μου, but in our present imperfect state of information, this must remain a mere probability."

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Be not afraid" - The presence of heavenly beings often struck fear in the hearts of the ancients, but Jesus reassures the women that they have no reason to fear him. (Luke 5:8; Judges 6:22-23; Judges 13:21-22)

2. "Go tell my brethren" - Jesus lovingly refers to his disciples as his brethren, even after his resurrection. This tender appellation is meant to comfort the women and inspire confidence in them. 

3. "Into Galilee" - Jesus plans to meet his disciples in Galilee, away from the noise and chaos of the city. This quiet and peaceful setting will serve as a place of reunion, where Jesus will confirm his resurrection and commission them to spread the gospel.

### John Calvin:
1. "That they may raise themselves to Christ, the Conqueror of death, they are commanded to be cheerful."
2. "We never know aright our Lord’s resurrection, until, through the firm assurance which we have conceived in our hearts, we venture to rejoice that we have been made partakers of the same life."
3. "Here, to it is proper to remark the astonishing kindness of Christ, in deigning to bestow the name of brethren on deserters who had basely forsaken him."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Fear not. This injunction was called for by the mingled emotions of those addressed. The language has also the vivacious form of joyous feeling."
2. "Go, tell my brethren. A touching term coming from the Risen One, and applied to those who had forsaken Him. It indicates His continued affection and their fellowship with Him in His glory."
3. "All attempts to deny the historical character of the resurrection and the subsequent manifestations of Christ have failed. Consistency requires that those who deny the reality of the resurrection, deny the Apostolic history also; and what is then left to account for Christianity, a fact which must be accounted for?"

### John Gill:
1. "In other respects the saints are subject to fears; as lest they should have no share in the love of God, nor interest in Christ, or the work of God is not begun in their hearts; and by reason of sin, lest that should get the ascendant over them, and they perish by it, and so fall short of eternal glory."
2. "A very considerable relation this is, that the disciples stood in to Christ, who is the eternal Son of God, and heir of all things; and wonderful grace and condescension it was in Christ to own the relation, when they had so lately forsaken him; and now he was raised from the dead, and had glory given him."
3. "Moreover, it may be remarked, that wherever Christ has appointed to meet his people, they may expect, and be sure to see him at one time or another; as in his house and ordinances, where they are sometimes indulged with a sight of him by faith, which is an appropriating, assimilating, soul rejoicing, and satisfying one."
