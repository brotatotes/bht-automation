# Matthew 28:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Amidst their active mission and obedience, the disciples were on the move, continuously spreading the message of Jesus. Simple and unsophisticated, they ventured to report the resurrection, even if it meant challenging their frightened employers. Assigned to guard the tomb, the soldiers found themselves compelled to disclose the truth to the very people who had conspiratorial motives. This paradoxical account attests to the reality of the resurrection and its profound implications for all involved.

3. "The use of the present tense verb 'going' emphasizes the ongoing nature of their mission. It implies that the disciples were not just going on a one-time journey, but rather a continuous journey of spreading the message of Jesus."

1. "Those men, therefore, being addicted to making gain, and seizing on opportunities of making it from every quarter, after having found that their diligence was of no service to them, contrive a new method of cheating their employers out of their money." 
2. "It is at all events certain that, whether they all plotted together, or only a part of them, they sought to make profit of the cruel and implacable hatred which the priests bore towards Christ." 
3. "Thus it is evident that the reprobate, after having once given themselves up to a course of sinning, are continually entangled in new crimes; and this arises out of their desire to conceal their shame before men, while they give themselves no concern about the offense committed against God."

### Philip Schaff:
