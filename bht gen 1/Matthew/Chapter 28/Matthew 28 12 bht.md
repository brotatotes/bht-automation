# Matthew 28:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In a clandestine assembly, the Jewish authorities devised a plan to cover up the resurrection of Jesus by bribing the soldiers guarding the tomb. The desperation and fear of the Jewish leaders were evident in their willingness to spend a significant amount of money on this scheme. However, not all of the leaders were unified in this deceitful plot, as the absence of Joseph and Gamaliel suggested disagreement. The soldiers, viewed with contempt by these religious leaders, were manipulated and deceived to affirm a false account, for which they were generously rewarded.
