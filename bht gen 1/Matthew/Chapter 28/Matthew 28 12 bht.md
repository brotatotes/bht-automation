# Matthew 28:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The account describes a clandestine meeting of the Sanhedrim, with some members in opposition to the decision. The Jewish authorities resorted to bribery, offering large sums of money to convince the soldiers to spread a false story about the resurrection of Jesus. The significant sums of money given highlight the corrupting power of wealth and the desperate measures taken by the religious leaders to suppress the truth. The involvement of prominent council members and the use of deceitful tactics reveal the lengths they were willing to go to maintain their authority and deny Jesus' resurrection.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "This was a meeting of the Sanhedrim, but surely hardly an official and open one; does not the form of the narrative rather imply that it was a secret compact between those (the majority) who were bitterly hostile to Jesus?"
2. "The circumstance that Joseph had taken no part in their counsel before, leads us to think that others may have withdrawn themselves from the meeting."
3. "Gamaliel, who could hardly have consented to such a measure as this."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The Jewish authorities were willing to go to great lengths, even giving large sums of money, to cover up the truth of Jesus' resurrection. This shows the extent of their fear and desperation to maintain their power and authority." 

2. "The soldiers who were bribed with money to spread a false story about Jesus' body being stolen must have held the Jewish religious leaders in contempt. They were being used as pawns in a larger scheme to discredit Jesus and his followers." 

3. "The absence of Joseph and Gamaliel, two prominent members of the Jewish council, during this meeting shows that not all of the religious leaders were in agreement with the decision to bribe the soldiers. There may have been internal divisions and disagreements within the council."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "They deemed the matter of so much importance as to justify the calling together of the great council of the nation."
