# Matthew 28:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Bible verse in question presents a perplexing scenario of the disciples allegedly stealing Jesus' body while the guards were asleep. Commentators point out the implausibility of this claim, questioning how timid disciples could overpower trained soldiers. The accusation is criticized for its lack of probability and the illogical nature of the guards knowing about the theft if they were asleep. Additionally, the argument highlights that even if the guards were truly asleep, their negligence undermines their credibility as reliable witnesses. The commentary reinforces the inconsistency and confusion surrounding the accusation, urging readers to question its validity.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The accusation that the disciples stole the body of Jesus while the guards were asleep is a desperate attempt to explain the empty tomb. It shows the lengths to which some will go to deny the resurrection." 

2. "The idea that the disciples could have overpowered trained soldiers and stolen the body is highly improbable. It is a testament to the power of the resurrection that such a theory even exists." 

3. "The claim that the guards were asleep is not only a feeble excuse, but it also undermines their credibility as reliable witnesses. It is clear that the guards were not vigilant in their duty."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The story carries its refutation on its face."
2. "If all the soldiers were asleep, they could not discover the thieves, nor would they have proclaimed their negligence, the punishment for which was death."
3. "A few timid disciples would not have made such an attempt."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Stole him away while we slept" - This phrase, in the genitive absolute form, may seem like an Irish bull at first glance. It raises the question of how they could know about the stealing if they were asleep. 

2. "An Irish bull on the face of it" - The commentary highlights the apparent contradiction in the statement, emphasizing the confusion it presents. 

3. "If they were asleep they would not know anything about it" - This quote further emphasizes the logical inconsistency of the situation, questioning how the disciples could have any knowledge of the theft if they were asleep.

### John Gill:
1. "There is no show of probability in it, that the disciples, who were intimidated by the taking and putting Christ to death, and were now shut up in a house, for fear of the Jews, that these should venture out in the night, to take away the body of Christ."
2. "Moreover, had they took it away by stealth, it is not reasonable to think that they would afterwards have reported such a lie every where, that he was risen from the dead, when they were sure to obtain nothing by it, but reproach, afflictions, persecutions, and death."
3. "It can hardly be thought that they should be all of them asleep at once; and if they were, it is much they were not awaked by the coming up of the disciples, and the rolling away of the stone, and the bustle there must be in taking up the body, and carrying it away."

### John Wesley:
1. "Is it possible, that any man of sense should digest this poor, shallow inconsistency?"
2. "If ye were awake, why did you let the disciples steal him?"
3. "If asleep, how do you know they did?"
