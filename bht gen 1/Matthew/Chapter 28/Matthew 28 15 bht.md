# Matthew 28:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the face of overwhelming evidence of Jesus' resurrection, some chose to deny and concoct falsehoods. Soldiers, who were initially witnesses to the empty tomb, succumbed to temptation and accepted bribes to spread a fabricated story. The Jews, stubbornly refusing to acknowledge the truth, embraced a baseless account, displaying their hardness of heart. In their desperation, they even crafted an even more outlandish narrative. These actions reveal the lengths some went to suppress the undeniable reality of Jesus' resurrection.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Not only did you not repent when you learned that he had risen from the dead, but you also chose men and sent them throughout the whole world, proclaiming that a godless and lawless heresy has arisen from one Jesus, a Galilean impostor, whom his disciples stole after crucifying him." (Justin Martyr, Dial. c. Tryph. ยง 108, p. 202)
2. "This account of the matter" (referring to the lie of the Jews) (Justin Martyr, Dial. c. Tryph. ยง 108, p. 202)
3. "Eisenmenger gives an expansion of this lie of the Jews from the book called Toldoth Jeschu." (Justin Martyr, Dial. c. Tryph. ยง 108, p. 202)

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Thus consenting to brand themselves with infamy."
2. "The wonder is that so clumsy and incredible a story lasted so long."
3. "Those who are resolved not to come to the light will catch at straws."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The resurrection of the Lord Jesus, of which an account is given in this chapter, is one of the most important doctrines of the Christian religion, and is attested by the strongest evidence that can be adduced in favor of any ancient fact."
2. "They gave themselves up to great and unparalleled sufferings - going from land to land; crossing almost every sea; enduring the dangers, toils, and privations of almost every clime - for the simple object of affirming everywhere that a Saviour died and rose."
3. "The world believed them. Three thousand of the Jews themselves believed in the risen Saviour on the day of Pentecost, but 50 days after his resurrection, Acts 2:41."

### John Calvin:
1. "Armed soldiers say that the body of Christ was stolen from them by a feeble, timid, small, and unarmed body of men. What plausible grounds have they for saying so?"
2. "It was therefore a childish subterfuge, which would not have screened them from punishment, if they had had to deal with an honest and upright governor."
3. "Though it may appear strange that God should permit this false report to gain currency to extinguish the glory of his Son, we ought to render the honor which is due to his just vengeance."

Note: The provided commentary is quite long, so I had to condense it significantly to fit within the word limit.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "This saying. This report of the soldiers; not the entire account here given."
2. "Until this day, i.e., when the Gospel was written, possibly thirty or forty years after the resurrection."
3. "In view of this currency of the story, it follows that either the Sanhedrin or the early Christians invented a lie. There is no middle ground."

### John Gill:
1. "Though they had been just now in the greatest fright and consternation imaginable, at the sight of the angel, and knew what was done; yet being men of no religion or conscience, were tempted with the money, and took it."
2. "To such judicial blindness, and hardness of heart, were they given up, as to believe a lie, and which had no appearance of truth in it."
3. "They have since contrived a more monstrous and ridiculous story than this."

These quotes highlight the actions of the soldiers who were bribed, the blindness of the Jews in believing a false narrative, and the absurdity of the alternative story they created.
