# Matthew 28:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the command to go and teach all nations emphasizes the urgency of spreading the Gospel to everyone, regardless of their background. Baptism signifies a profound identification and incorporation into the triune God, symbolizing a new life and a new identity in Christ. The phrase "into the name" highlights the transformative nature of baptism, as believers are immersed into the essence and character of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, experiencing a profound union with God. This commission from Christ serves as the foundation of the disciples' authority to bring the world to the knowledge of Himself.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "And when we baptize into the Name (i.e. into the fulness of the consequence of the objective covenant, and the subjective confession) of Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, it is this which forms the ground and cause of our power to do so that this flesh of man, of which God hath made πάντα τὰ ἔθνη, is glorified in the Person of our Redeemer, through whom we all have access by one Spirit to the Father."
2. "The purpose of the Lord is to bring men to the knowledge of the truth to work on and in their hearts, and lift them up to be partakers of the divine Nature."
3. "Baptism is the contract of espousal between Christ and his Church. Our word 'in' being retained both here and in our formula of Baptism, it should always be remembered that the Sacramental declaration is contained in this word; that it answers to the 'τοῦτό ἐστιν' in the other Sacrament."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Because all power is mine, go! I can defend you. The world is placed under my control. It is redeemed. It is given me in promise by my Father, as the purchase of my death."
2. "This gracious commission was the foundation of their authority to go to the Gentiles. Jesus broke down the partition wall, and commissioned his disciples to go everywhere, and bring the 'world' to the knowledge of himself."
3. "The union of these three names in the form of baptism proves that the Son and Holy Spirit are equal with the Father. Nothing would be more absurd or blasphemous than to unite the name of a creature - a man or an angel - with the name of the ever-living God in this solemn rite."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Baptizing into the name of the Holy Trinity implies a spiritual and mystical union with him."
2. "To be baptized upon the name is to be baptized on the confession of that which the name implies: on the ground of the name."
3. "The name, as in the Lord's Prayer ('Hallowed be thy name'), is the expression of the sum total of the divine Being: not his designation as God or Lord, but the formula in which all his attributes and characteristics are summed up."

### John Calvin:
1. "Let us learn from this passage, that the apostleship is not an empty title, but a laborious office; and that, consequently, nothing is more absurd or intolerable than that this honor should be claimed by hypocrites, who live like kings at their ease, and disdainfully throw away from themselves the office of teaching."
2. "The priesthood of the New Testament consists in slaying men, as a sacrifice to God, by the spiritual sword of the word. Hence it follows, that all are but pretended and spurious priests who are not devoted to the office of teaching."
3. "True, indeed, the ancients would never have ventured to call God their Father, if they had not derived this assurance from Christ their Head; and the Eternal Wisdom of God, who is the fountain of light and life, was not wholly unknown to them. But at the commencement of the gospel God was far more clearly revealed in Three Persons; for then the Father manifested himself in the Son, his lively and distinct image, while Christ, irradiating the world by the full splendor of his Spirit, held out to the knowledge of men both himself and the Spirit."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The glorification of Christ is the ground of His sending them, and the blessed reason why in their weakness and insufficiency they can go."
2. "Because Christ rules, go, not to conquer men by force, but to work on their hearts make them disciples, docile pupils in the school of Christ."
3. "The doctrine of the Trinity receives powerful support from passages like this, but it rests even more on facts, on the whole Scripture revelation of God as Father, Son, and Holy Spirit in the three great works of creation, redemption, and sanctification."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Here is the world program of the Risen Christ and it should not be forgotten by those who seek to foreshorten it all by saying that Jesus expected his second coming to be very soon."
2. "Meanwhile we are to be ready for his coming at any time and to look for it joyfully."
3. "This program includes making disciples or learners (μαθητευσατε) such as they were themselves. That means evangelism in the fullest sense and not merely revival meetings."

### John Gill:
1. "His power and authority, and so now the commission he gave them, reached every where."
2. "They were to teach men externally, or outwardly minister the word, whilst the Spirit of God internally applied it, and taught, and made men true disciples of Christ."
3. "Christ's orders are to 'baptize': 'dip' them, as Munster's Hebrew Gospel renders it; that is, in water, which, though not expressed, is implied."

### John Wesley:
1. "Disciple all nations — Make them my disciples. This includes the whole design of Christ's commission."
2. "Baptizing and teaching are the two great branches of that general design."
3. "And these were to be determined by the circumstances of things; which made it necessary in baptizing adult Jews or heathens, to teach them before they were baptized; in discipling their children, to baptize them before they were taught."
