# Matthew 28:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
After the momentous event of Jesus' resurrection, the earth trembled with joy as the stone, symbolizing Christ's victory over death, was rolled away by an angel. The purpose of the angel's presence and the open tomb was not to let the Lord out, but to allow the women and disciples to witness the undeniable truth of the empty tomb. This act was not only a physical manifestation but also an emblem of the power of the Gospel spreading to the ends of the earth, signifying the fulfillment of God's plan of salvation.
