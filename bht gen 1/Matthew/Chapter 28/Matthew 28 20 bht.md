### Albert Barnes:
1. "I am with you... by my Spirit, my providence, my attending counsel and guidance."
2. "This also proves that Christ is divine... If he is a mere man, or a creature, how could he promise to be 'with' his disciples 'always'?"
3. "The word rendered 'world'... may... mean, I will be with you until the end of this 'age,' or during the continuance of the Jewish state... But as the presence of Christ was no less necessary after that than before, there seems to be no propriety in limiting the promise to his own age."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The doctrines and precepts of Christ, nothing less and nothing more, are the proper subjects of Christian faith and practice."
