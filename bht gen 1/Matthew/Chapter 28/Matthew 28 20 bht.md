# Matthew 28:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, Christ commands his disciples to spread the Gospel to all nations, baptizing and teaching them to observe all his commandments. They are given the power and authority from heaven and earth to fulfill this great commission. Christ promises to be with them always, supporting and guiding them in their mission until the end of the age. This presence is not physical, but spiritual, as he empowers them through the grace of his Spirit. The disciples, and all future ministers, are to faithfully teach and observe all the doctrines and precepts of Christ.
