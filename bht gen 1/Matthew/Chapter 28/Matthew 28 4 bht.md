The guards are overwhelmed by the angel's glory, which they had never witnessed before, and are paralyzed in awe, becoming as lifeless as dead men. This encounter reflects the supernatural and divine nature of the event taking place - the resurrection of Christ - and highlights the contrast between the power of God and the powerless state of humankind.
