# Matthew 28:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Amidst the confusion and fear surrounding the empty tomb, with soldiers trembling and doubts lingering, a group of women approached, seeking the crucified Jesus. As they entered the open tomb, they encountered angels who reassured them, "Fear not ye." These women, with their hearts set on finding the crucified Christ, were met with the divine affirmation that they need not be afraid. They sought the One who had been crucified, and in their seeking, found hope and salvation.
