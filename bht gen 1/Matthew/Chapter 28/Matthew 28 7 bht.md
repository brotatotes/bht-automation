# Matthew 28:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, we see the extraordinary honor bestowed upon women as they are the bearers of the first glad tidings from beyond the grave. The gathering of the disciples in Galilee serves as a measure of prudence, protecting them from persecution and distancing them from the old temple. By meeting in Galilee, a place where Jesus preached and had a large number of disciples, he confirms his resurrection and strengthens their faith. These words, adding solemnity to the important announcement, serve as a confirmation of the truth and accuracy of the resurrection.
