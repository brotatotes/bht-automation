## BHT:
The event described in this Bible verse involves the responses of the women who witnessed Jesus' resurrection. Their departure from the tomb was marked by fear and haste, as they fled and ran to share the news. This combination of emotions is natural given the overwhelming experience of witnessing the empty tomb and hearing about Christ's resurrection. Feelings of fear, joy, and astonishment mingled within them as they processed the astonishing reality before them.
