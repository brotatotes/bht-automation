# Matthew 28:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, Jesus suddenly appears to the women who were pondering over the angel's message and the empty tomb. He greets them with the word "Hail" or "Rejoice," conveying a message of joy and well-wishing. Overwhelmed by awe, they fall at his feet, holding on to them in reverence and worship. This act of worship is allowed by Jesus, although Mary Magdalene had been instructed not to hold onto his body too eagerly. Through their encounter, the women find assurance that Jesus has truly risen from the dead, dispelling any doubts of his resurrection.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Neither Mark nor Luke recounts, or seems to have been aware of, this appearance... it does not therefore follow that the narratives are inconsistent."
2. "Mark’s account is evidently broken off suddenly; and Luke’s appears to have been derived from one of those who went to Emmaus, who had evidently but an imperfect knowledge of what happened before they left the city."
3. "partly in fear and as suppliants, for the Lord says μὴ φοβεῖσθε, but shewing also the χαρά with which that fear was mixed, joy at having recovered Him whom they loved."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "All hail!—the usual salute, but from the lips of Jesus bearing a higher signification."
2. "How truly womanly!"
3. "And they came and held him by the feet."

### Albert Barnes:

2. "The meaning of the word 'hail,' here, is rejoice; a term of salutation connected with the idea of joy at his resurrection, and at meeting them again."

1. "The Lord, perceiving that Mary was too eager to embrace and kiss his feet, orders her to retire; because it was proper to correct the superstition, and to point out the design of his resurrection."
2. "Mary was withheld from perceiving [the design of his resurrection], partly by an earthly and carnal affection, and partly by foolish zeal."
