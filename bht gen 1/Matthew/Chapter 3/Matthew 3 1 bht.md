# Matthew 3:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In those days, before Jesus began His public ministry, John the Baptist appeared on the scene. He was described as gracious and as the one who proclaimed the grace of God. John, also known as John the Baptist, made his appearance as a public figure, likely at the age of thirty. He preached in the wilderness of Judea, not to trees and wild beasts, but to people who came from the cities, towns, and villages in that region. This silence in Scripture teaches us obedience, reverence to parents, patience, perseverance, and the distinction of true preaching.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "This silence of Scripture suggests lessons of obedience and reverence to parents, of patience and perseverance in the long processes of education for our life-work."
2. "Cometh, makes his appearance as a public personage; probably at the Levitical age of thirty years, as in the case of our Lord."
3. "Preaching should still be thus distinguished from lecturing, catechising, etc. John was emphatically a herald, and in the truest sense a prophet."

### John Gill:
1. "He describes him by his name John, in Hebrew יוחנן, 'Jochanan', which signifies 'gracious', or 'the grace of the Lord', or 'the Lord has given grace'; which agrees with him, both as a good man, on whom the Lord had bestowed much grace, and as a preacher, whose business it was to publish the grace of God in Christ." 

2. "From his being the first administrator of the ordinance of baptism, he is called John the Baptist; and this was a well known title and character of him."

3. "The place where he preached is mentioned, in the wilderness of Judea; not that he preached to trees and to the wild beasts of the desert; for the wilderness of Judea was an habitable place, and had in it many cities, towns, and villages, in which we must suppose John came preaching, at least to persons which came out from thence."
