# Matthew 3:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In those days, while Jesus still dwelt in Nazareth, John the Baptist began preaching about six months before his Master. John's baptism was a significant act, distinct from the usual Jewish practice, as he declared the need for repentance and invited people to come to the Redeemer, weary and burdened. His preaching took place in the wilderness of Judea, a thinly populated area known for its pastures, where John came in close touch with nature, the rugged terrain, and those who ventured out to hear his message.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The baptism of John was of a deeper significance than that usual among the Jews in the case of proselytes, and formed an integral part of his divinely appointed office." 
2. "His whole mission, as Olsh. well observes, was calculated, in accordance with the office of the law which gives the knowledge of sin (Rom 3:20), to bring men’s minds into that state in which the Redeemer invites them (ch. Mat 11:28), as weary and heavy laden, to come to him."
3. "This tract was not strictly a desert, but thinly peopled, and abounding in pastures for flocks."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

2. "came John the Baptist, preaching—about six months before his Master."
3. "in the wilderness of Judea—the desert valley of the Jordan, thinly peopled and bare in pasture, a little north of Jerusalem."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Perhaps Matthew intended to embrace in his narrative the whole time that Jesus lived at Nazareth; and the meaning is, 'in those days while Jesus still dwelt at Nazareth,' John began to preach."
2. "Baptism, or the application of water, was a rite well known to the Jews, and practiced when they admitted proselytes to their religion from paganism."
3. "The discourses recorded in the New Testament are mostly brief, sometimes consisting only of a single sentence. They were public proclamations of some great truth."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "In those days," i.e., some time during the nearly thirty years since that settlement.
2. The verb is used in what is called the historical present, giving vividness to the narrative.
3. Not suggesting absolute barrenness but unappropriated territory affording free range for shepherds and their flocks.

### John Calvin:
1. "The ancient writers of the Church are almost unanimously agreed, that he was born fifteen years before the death of Augustus." 
2. "Hence it follows, that he did not long discharge the office of teacher, but, in a short time, gave way to Christ."
3. "Now as John, the morning-star, or dawn, was immediately followed by Christ, 'the Sun of Righteousness,' (Malachi 4:2,) there is no reason to wonder, that John disappeared, in order that Christ might shine alone in greater brightness."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "This silence of Scripture suggests lessons of obedience and reverence to parents, of patience and perseverance in the long processes of education for our life-work."
2. "John, Hebrew: Johanan (the Lord graciously gave) allied to the Phenician name Hannibal (German, Gottlieb)."
3. "Preaching should still be thus distinguished from lecturing, catechising, etc. John was emphatically a herald (comp. Matthew 3:2-3), and in the truest sense a prophet."

### John Gill:
1. "He is called by some of the Jewish writers, John the 'high priest'; his father Zacharias was a priest of the course of Abia, and he might succeed him therein, and be the head of that course, and for that reason be called a 'high' or 'chief priest'." 
2. "From his being the first administrator of the ordinance of baptism, he is called John the Baptist; and this was a well-known title and character of him."
3. "The place where he preached is mentioned, in the wilderness of Judea; not that he preached to trees and to the wild beasts of the desert; for the wilderness of Judea was an habitable place, and had in it many cities, towns, and villages, in which we must suppose John came preaching, at least to persons which came out from thence."
