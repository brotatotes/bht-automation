# Matthew 3:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Bible verse described here speaks of a impending judgment that goes beyond the destruction of Jerusalem. This judgment is directed toward those who bear no good fruit, symbolized by the image of trees being cut down. The imminent execution of God's judgment is emphasized, as the description emphasizes the sudden and certain nature of this divine retribution. Mere professions or outward appearances are not enough; true repentance and a holy life are required to escape this impending judgment.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Language so personal and individual as this can scarcely be understood of any national judgment like the approaching destruction of Jerusalem, with the breaking up of the Jewish polity and the extrusion of the chosen people from their peculiar privileges which followed it; though this would serve as the dark shadow, cast before, of a more terrible retribution to come."
2. "What a strength, too, of just indignation is in that word 'cast' or 'flung into the fire!'"
3. "This is directed against the reigning avarice and selfishness."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "A searching, trying kind of preaching has been commenced."
2. "No art, no dissimulation, will be successful: People are to be tried by their lives, not by birth or profession."
