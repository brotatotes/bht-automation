## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The present participle is used of a certain and predetermined future event; 'he that is to come.'" 
2. "The expressions therefore in all the Gospels amount to the same." 
3. "The members of comparison in this verse are strictly parallel to one another: the baptism by water, the end of which is μετάνοια, a mere transition state, a note of preparation, and the baptism by the Holy Ghost and fire, the end of which is (Mat 3:12) sanctification, the entire aim and purpose of man’s creation and renewal."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "But there cometh the Mightier than I" - This emphasizes the surpassing power and authority of the one who is to come after John the Baptist. It highlights the humility of John, recognizing his role as a servant compared to the greatness of the one who is to come.

2. "His it is, as His sole prerogative, to dispense the inward reality" - John acknowledges that he only administers the outward symbol of purification through water baptism, while the true baptism with the Holy Spirit is the work of the coming Messiah. This shows John's understanding of his limited role and the exalted position of the one who is to come.

3. "The fiery character of the Spirit's operations upon the soul" - The mention of fire in relation to the baptism with the Holy Spirit is not to be understood as a separate baptism of punishment, but rather as a metaphor for the purifying and refining work of the Spirit in the believer's life. This imagery signifies the transformative nature of the Holy Spirit's work in purging sin and refining character.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The expression in this place, therefore, denotes great humility, and John says that he was not worthy to be the servant of him who should come after him."
2. "The baptism of the Holy Spirit is the same, therefore, as the sending of his influences to convert, purify, and guide the soul."

### John Calvin:
1. "He who cometh after me is stronger than I... Christ is thus declared to be so far superior in power and rank, that, with respect to him, John must occupy a private station."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "He that cometh after me, the Messiah; assuming his speedy appearance, and that the hearers also expected him."

"I indeed baptize you; or, as Mark says, 'I have baptized you'; I have authority from God so to do; my commission reaches thus far, and no farther; I can administer, and have administered the outward ordinance to you; but the inward grace and increase of it, together with the ordinary and extraordinary gifts of the Spirit, I cannot confer."
2. "He that comes after me...is mightier than I; not only as he is the mighty God, and so infinitely mightier than he; but in his office and ministry, which was exercised with greater power and authority, and attended with mighty works and miracles, and was followed with the extraordinary gifts of the Spirit."
3. "He shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost, and with fire; referring, either to the extraordinary gifts of the Spirit, to be bestowed on the disciples on the day of Pentecost, of which the cloven tongues, like as of fire, which appeared unto them, and sat upon them, were the symbols; which was an instance of the great power and grace of Christ, and of his exaltation at the Father's right hand."
