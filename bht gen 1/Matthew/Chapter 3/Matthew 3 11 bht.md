# Matthew 3:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse being described is about the superiority of the one coming after John the Baptist, who will baptize with the Holy Spirit. John's humility is demonstrated by his recognition of his unworthiness and his willingness to take on the lowest role of a servant. The true baptism with the Holy Spirit is the work of the coming Messiah, who will ignite hearts with an unquenchable fire of love, symbolized by the visible appearance of fire on the day of Pentecost.
