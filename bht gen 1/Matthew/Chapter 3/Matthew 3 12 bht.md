# Matthew 3:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse being described speaks of the preaching of the Gospel, which serves to separate the genuine from the spiritually worthless. It highlights the cleansing and disciplinary process of winnowing, representing the judgment and purification of God. The verse refers to both the solid worth of true-hearted saints and the emptiness of those lacking genuine religious principles. It underscores the concept that the Gospel serves as a fan to separate the wheat (the elect) from the chaff (the unfaithful). Ultimately, the genuinely righteous ones will be gathered and preserved in the heavenly garner.

2. "His wheat, the fruits of the husbandry, the persons saved, hence 'His.'"
