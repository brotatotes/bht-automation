# Matthew 3:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The baptism of Jesus, greater than Moses, signifies the end of his concealed life and the beginning of his public ministry. Jesus, sinless and humble, is identified with humanity and submits to God's will. The descent of the Holy Spirit as a dove empowers and anoints Jesus. The voice from heaven affirms his unique relationship with God as the beloved Son. This event sets the stage for Jesus' mission to proclaim the kingdom of God and brings salvation to humanity, while also serving as a model for believers to publicly declare their faith and be empowered by the Holy Spirit.
