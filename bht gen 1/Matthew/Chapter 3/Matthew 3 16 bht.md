# Matthew 3:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, the Holy Spirit descends upon Jesus in the bodily shape of a dove, symbolizing purity, innocence, and the Divine presence. The opening of the heavens signifies a manifestation of heavenly glory while also revealing a cleft beyond the visible world. The dove-like descent of the Spirit marks the beginning of Jesus's official work, as the Godhead is manifested in the Trinity, representing the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. As Jesus submits to baptism, it serves as a reminder for believers to faithfully observe Divine commandments and fulfill righteousness through humble participation in sacred appointments.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The Holy Spirit descended not only in the manner of a dove, but σωματικῷ εἴδει (Luke): which I cannot understand in any but the literal sense, as THE BODILY SHAPE OF A DOVE, seen by the Baptist." 
2. "The Spirit as manifested in our Lord was gentle and benign."
3. "The whole narrative is in remarkable parallelism with that of the Transfiguration."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Can there be a doubt about the burden of that prayer; a prayer sent up, probably, while yet in the water—His blessed head suffused with the baptismal element; a prayer continued likely as He stepped out of the stream, and again stood upon the dry ground; the work before Him, the needed and expected Spirit to rest upon Him for it, and the glory He would then put upon the Father that sent Him—would not these fill His breast, and find silent vent in such form as this?" 

2. "The Scripture use of this emblem will be our best guide here. 'My dove, my undefiled is one,' says the Song of Solomon. This is chaste purity. Again, 'Be ye harmless as doves,' says Christ Himself. This is the same thing, in the form of inoffensiveness towards men. 'A conscience void of offense toward God and toward men' expresses both."

3. "But the fourth Gospel gives us one more piece of information here, on the authority of one who saw and testified of it: 'John bare record, saying, I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove, and IT ABODE UPON HIM.' And lest we should think that this was an accidental thing, he adds that this last particular was expressly given him as part of the sign by which he was to recognize and identify Him as the Son of God."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Out of the water - This shows that he had descended to the river. It literally means, 'he went up directly from the water.' The original does not imply that they had descended into the river, and it cannot be proved, therefore, from this passage, that his baptism was by immersion."
2. "The heavens were opened unto him - This was done while he was praying. The ordinances of religion will be commonly ineffectual without prayer. If in those ordinances we look to God, we may expect that he will bless us; the heavens will be opened, light will shine upon our path, and we shall meet with the approbation of God."
3. "The Spirit of God - This was the third person of the Trinity, descending upon him in the form of a dove. The dove, among the Jews, was the symbol of purity of heart, harmlessness, and gentleness. The form chosen here was doubtless an emblem of the innocence, meekness, and tenderness of the Saviour."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The dove was an ancient symbol of purity and innocence, adopted by our Lord in Matthew 10:16."
2. "In Christian art it is the symbol of the Holy Spirit, and that in his Old Testament manifestations as well as in those of the New Testament."
3. "The comparison is not between the Spirit and the dove, but between the closeness with which a dove broods over her young without touching them, and the supposed proximity of the Spirit to the lower waters without touching them."

### John Calvin:
1. "The opening of the heavens sometimes means a manifestation of heavenly glory; but here it means also a cleft, or opening, of the visible heaven, so that John could see something beyond the planets and stars."
2. "It is sufficient for us to believe, that it was a symbol of the Divine presence."
3. "Though the grace of the Spirit was bestowed on Christ in a remarkable and extraordinary manner, yet he remained at home as a private person, till he should be called to public life by the Father."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Heaven, which was closed by the first Adam, is opened again over the second."
2. "The dove symbolizes perfect gentleness, purity, fulness of life and the power of communicating it."
3. "The time had come for Him to begin His official work, that time was marked by the visible sign of the Holy Ghost."
4. "The Divine nature and eternal Sonship of Christ are obviously implied."
5. "The Godhead eternally existing as Trinity was manifested, as Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, to us and for us in this occurrence, as throughout the economy of redemption."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The Spirit of God descending as a dove" - Matthew's description of the Holy Spirit's manifestation is open to interpretation, as it is unclear whether the Spirit took the form of a dove or simply came upon Jesus like a dove descending. 

2. "Luke has it 'in bodily form as a dove'" - Luke's account suggests that the Spirit appeared in a physical form resembling a dove. 

3. "The dove in Christian art has been considered the symbol of the Holy Spirit" - Throughout Christian art, the dove has been widely recognized as a symbol of the Holy Spirit.

### John Gill:
1. "A circumstance strongly in favour of baptism by immersion: for that Christ should go down into the river, more or less deep, to the ankles, or up to the knees, in order that John should sprinkle water on his face, or pour it on his head, as is ridiculously represented in the prints, can hardly obtain any credit with persons of thought and sense."
2. "The descent of him was in a 'bodily shape', as Luke says in Luke 3:22 either in the shape of a dove, which is a very fit emblem of the Spirit of God who descended, and the fruits thereof, such as simplicity, meekness, love, c. and also of the dove-like innocence, humility, and affection of Christ, on whom he lighted."
3. "Who can read this account without thinking of Noah's dove, which brought in its mouth the olive leaf, a token of peace and reconciliation, when the waters were abated from off the earth?"

### John Wesley:
1. "Let our Lord's submitting to baptism teach us a holy exactness in the observance of those institutions which owe their obligation merely to a Divine command."
2. "Surely thus it becometh all his followers to fulfil all righteousness."
3. "And where can we expect this sacred effusion, but in an humble attendance on Divine appointments?"
