# Matthew 3:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this passage, a prayer is described as being sent up by Jesus, filled with anticipation for the work ahead and the glory that would be brought to the Father. The dove descending upon Jesus symbolizes gentleness, purity, and the power to communicate life. By submitting to baptism, Jesus teaches the importance of observing Divine commands and fulfilling righteousness, a reminder for his followers to seek the sacred effusion of the Spirit through humble attendance on Divine appointments. Ultimately, this event signifies the reopening of heaven and the manifestation of the Trinity in the economy of redemption.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Can there be a doubt about the burden of that prayer; a prayer sent up, probably, while yet in the water—His blessed head suffused with the baptismal element; a prayer continued likely as He stepped out of the stream, and again stood upon the dry ground; the work before Him, the needed and expected Spirit to rest upon Him for it, and the glory He would then put upon the Father that sent Him—would not these fill His breast, and find silent vent in such form as this?"
2. "This is chaste purity. Again, 'Be ye harmless as doves,' says Christ Himself. This is the same thing, in the form of inoffensiveness towards men. 'A conscience void of offense toward God and toward men' expresses both."
3. "But the fourth Gospel gives us one more piece of information here, on the authority of one who saw and testified of it: 'John bare record, saying, I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove, and IT ABODE UPON HIM.'"

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Heaven, which was closed by the first Adam, is opened again over the second."
2. "The dove symbolizes perfect gentleness, purity, fulness of life and the power of communicating it."
3. "The Godhead eternally existing as Trinity was manifested, as Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, to us and for us in this occurrence, as throughout the economy of redemption."

### John Wesley:
1. "Let our Lord's submitting to baptism teach us a holy exactness in the observance of those institutions which owe their obligation merely to a Divine command."
2. "Surely thus it becometh all his followers to fulfil all righteousness."
3. "And where can we expect this sacred effusion, but in an humble attendance on Divine appointments?"
