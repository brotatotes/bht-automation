# Matthew 3:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Bible verse at hand speaks of the necessity of repentance as a preparation for a spiritual kingdom. Commentators explain that repentance is not just remorse, but a turning away from sin and towards God, a seeking of refuge from the coming wrath. The phrase "kingdom of heaven" signifies the Gospel dispensation, in which a society is formed on earth, gathering subjects to God's Son. This kingdom, though in the world, is not of the world, and its true significance was gradually understood by the Jews through the teachings of John the Baptist and Christ.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Repent ye...primarily to that sense of sin which leads the sinner to flee from the wrath to come, to look for relief only from above, and eagerly to fall in with the provided remedy."
2. "This sublime phrase...being suggested by Daniel's grand vision of the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven...it was fitted at once both to meet the national expectations and to turn them into the right channel."
3. "A kingdom for which repentance was the proper preparation behooved to be essentially spiritual. Deliverance from sin, the great blessing of Christ's kingdom, can be valued by those only to whom sin is a burden."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Repent. Not mere remorse, but conversion and reformation, or turning away from sin and unto God." 
2. "The kingdom of heaven is at hand, i.e., has become and is now near in time. 'The kingdom of heaven' is equivalent to 'the kingdom of God,' and is used by this Evangelist alone."
3. "It is in the world, but not of the world, heavenly in its origin, character, and destination. It is the kingdom from heaven, for the Messiah, the King, came from heaven."

### John Wesley:
1. "The kingdom of heaven, and the kingdom of God, are but two phrases for the same thing. They mean, not barely a future happy state, in heaven, but a state to be enjoyed on earth: the proper disposition for the glory of heaven, rather than the possession of it."
2. "It properly signifies here, the Gospel dispensation, in which subjects were to be gathered to God by his Son, and a society to be formed, which was to subsist first on earth, and afterward with God in glory."
3. "Both John the Baptist and Christ took up that phrase, the kingdom of heaven, as they found it, and gradually taught the Jews (though greatly unwilling to learn) to understand it right."
