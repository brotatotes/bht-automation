# Matthew 3:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Dressed in rugged camel's hair, with a leather belt around his waist, John the Baptist embodied the spirit of the prophetic Elijah. Living in the wilderness, he subsisted on a humble diet of locusts and wild honey. These simple elements of his appearance and lifestyle reflected John's message of repentance and served as a vivid reminder of the stern days of Elijah. His uncouth figure may have been unconventional, but in the wilderness, it mattered not.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "The same John had his raiment of camel's hair - woven of it." 
2. "A leathern girdle about his loins - the prophetic dress of Elijah." 
3. "His meat was locusts - the great, well-known Eastern locust, a food of the poor." 
4. "Wild honey - made by wild bees." 
5. "This dress and diet, with the shrill cry in the wilderness, would recall the stern days of Elijah."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The dress and habits of John confirm the statement of Matthew 3:3. His dress, like that of Elijah, corresponded with his preaching."
2. "The austere dress befitted the austere preacher of repentance, whose ministry, like that of Elijah, aimed at bringing back the people to the spirit of their fathers."
3. "John came 'neither eating nor drinking,' a Nazarite. He probably did not enjoin this mode of life upon others. His position demanded it of him, and his actual self-denial had a symbolical meaning, pointing to the repentance he preached."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Matthew thus introduces the man himself and draws a vivid sketch of his dress, his habit, and his food."
2. "Would such an uncouth figure be welcome today in any pulpit in our cities? In the wilderness it did not matter."

1. "John had his raiment of camels' hair — Coarse and rough, suiting his character and doctrine."
2. "A leathern girdle — Like Elijah, in whose spirit and power he came."
3. "His food was locusts and wild honey — Locusts are ranked among clean meats, Leviticus 11:22. But these were not always to be had. So in default of those, he fed on wild honey."
