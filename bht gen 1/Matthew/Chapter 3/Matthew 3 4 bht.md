# Matthew 3:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the wilderness, there appeared a man named John, dressed simply in a rough garment made of coarse camels' hair, reminiscent of the attire of the prophet Elijah. His diet consisted of the humble sustenance of locusts and wild honey, symbolizing his ascetic lifestyle and dedication to a message of repentance. Embracing poverty and humility, John captured the attention and admiration of both the common people and the elite, shining forth as a vessel for the majesty of God.
