# Matthew 3:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This verse describes a baptism that serves as a public seal for the people's anticipation of a coming Deliverer and their openness to accept Him. It startles them, as it is a new and unfamiliar practice for Jewish converts. Baptism symbolizes a ceremonial cleansing and moral renewal, either through immersion or pouring of water. The act of confessing sins is done willingly and openly, and the baptism represents Christ's purification through the Holy Spirit and fire.
