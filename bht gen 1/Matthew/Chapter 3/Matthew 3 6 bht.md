In this Bible verse, we see that the baptism administered during the day in the River Jordan involved the immersion of the whole person. It was a solemn rite of washing, signifying cleansing from sins and preparation for the service of Yahweh. The baptism served as a public seal, indicating the need for deliverance from sin, the expectation of the coming Deliverer, and readiness to welcome Him. The baptism also called for an open confession of sins, demonstrating a genuine repentance and a desire for a new life.
