# Matthew 3:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This verse describes a confrontation between Jesus and the religious leaders of the time, specifically the Pharisees and Sadducees. These opposing parties, marked by their deceitfulness, hypocrisy, skepticism, and unbelief, are compared to a "viper brood" and a "brood of vipers." Jesus warns them of the righteous wrath to come, highlighting their sinful nature and falsehood. The phrase "fleeing from it" emphasizes the urgency of escaping this impending judgment, as one would flee from a tide of fiery wrath.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Viper brood," expressing the deadly influence of both sects alike upon the community.
2. "The wrath to come!" God's "wrath," in Scripture, is His righteous displeasure against sin, and consequently against all in whose skirts sin is found.
3. In this view of it, how striking is the word he employs to express that step - fleeing from it - as of one who, beholding a tide of fiery wrath rolling rapidly towards him, sees in instant flight his only escape!

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The Pharisees and Sadducees. Two opposing parties, here classed together in the same unworthy category. They afterwards stood together against Christ." 
2. "The Sadducees represent the opposite tendency of skepticism, rationalism, and unbelief. They rejected tradition, and probably even the later books of the Old Testament, denied the immortality of the soul, the existence of angels, etc."
3. "The phrase 'brood of vipers' characterizes them as both deceitful and malicious. John probably alludes to the expression, 'seed of the serpent' (Genesis 3:15); in spite of their descent from Abraham, he thus classes them among those over whom the seed of the woman should obtain the victory."

### John Wesley:
1. "The Pharisees were outwardly strict observers of the law, but inwardly, they were full of pride and hypocrisy."
2. "The Sadducees denied the existence of angels, the immortality of the soul, and the resurrection of the dead."
3. "Ye brood of vipers... serpents, dogs, wolves, and swine; terms which are not the random language of passion, but a judicious designation of the persons meant by them."
