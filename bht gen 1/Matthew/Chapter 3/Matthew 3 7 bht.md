# Matthew 3:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse being described is a confrontation by John the Baptist towards the Pharisees and Sadducees, who were outwardly religious but inwardly hypocritical and deceptive. The Pharisees were known for their self-righteousness and adherence to traditionalism, while the Sadducees embraced skepticism and unbelief. John's strong language of "brood of vipers" highlights their deceitful and malicious nature. These groups, though different, temporarily united in their opposition to Jesus and His teachings. Despite their outward appearance, they lacked genuine repentance and true faith.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The character of the sect as a whole was hypocrisy; the outside acknowledgment and honouring of God and his law, but inward and practical denial of Him: which rendered them the enemies of the simplicity and genuineness which characterized our Lord’s teaching."
2. "The two sects, mutually hostile, are found frequently in the Gospels united in opposition to our Lord; the Pharisees representing hypocritical superstition; the Sadducees, carnal unbelief."
3. "The reference of John’s ministry to the prophecy concerning Elias would naturally suggest to men’s minds 'the wrath to come' there also foretold. It was the general expectation of the Jews that troublous times would accompany the appearance of the Messiah."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "O generation of vipers—'Viper brood,' expressing the deadly influence of both sects alike upon the community."
2. "God's 'wrath,' in Scripture, is His righteous displeasure against sin, and consequently against all in whose skirts sin is found, arising out of the essential and eternal opposition of His nature to all moral evil."
3. "In this view of it, how striking is the word he employs to express that step—fleeing from it—as of one who, beholding a tide of fiery wrath rolling rapidly towards him, sees in instant flight his only escape!"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The Pharisees were proud, haughty, self-righteous, and held the common people in great disrespect."
2. "The Sadducees believed that there was no future state of rewards or punishments."
3. "The Essenes were generally more pure than the rest of the Jews, and appear to have been an unambitious, modest, and retiring sort of people."

### John Calvin:
1. "Nothing can be more unequal, in this respect, than a constant equality." (261)
2. "None are more stupid than hypocrites, who deceive themselves and others by the outward mask of holiness." (261)
3. "Those whose habits of uttering falsehood to God, and of deceiving themselves, lead them to hold out hypocrisy and pretension, instead of the reality, ought to be urged, with greater sharpness than other men, to true repentance." (262)

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The Pharisees and Sadducees...represented one great form of religious error, that of outward legalism and traditionalism, hence of superstition, of self-righteousness, of hypocrisy, of lifeless orthodoxy, a pernicious tendency that has continued." 
2. "The Sadducees...represent the opposite tendency of skepticism, rationalism, and unbelief. They rejected tradition...and conformed greatly to heathen customs."
3. "The phrase 'brood of vipers' characterizes them as both deceitful and malicious...appropriately applied by one who heralded the coming of Christ, to those who caused His death."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Here a strong attraction, there a strong repulsion, made them for the moment forget their differences" (McNeile).
2. "John clearly grasped the significance of this movement on the part of the Pharisees and Sadducees who had followed the crowds to the Jordan."
3. "Ye offspring of vipers" (γεννηματα εχιδνων). Jesus (Matthew 12:34; Matthew 23:33) will use the same language to the Pharisees.

### John Gill:
1. "The Pharisees, who separated themselves from the people as righteous persons, were called 'divisi, the divided.'"
2. "They were strict observers of the traditions of the elders; they owned the resurrection of the dead, and that there were angels and spirits, in which they differed from the Sadducees."
3. "The Sadducees...denied fate, and ascribed all to free will; they affirmed that there is no resurrection of the dead; that the soul dies with the body; that there is no future state after this life, and that there are neither angels nor spirits."

### John Wesley:
1. "They were outwardly strict observers of the law, fasted often, made long prayers, rigorously kept the Sabbath, and paid all tithe, even of mint, anise, and cummin. Hence they were in high esteem among the people."
2. "But inwardly, they were full of pride and hypocrisy."
3. "Ye brood of vipers — In like manner, the crafty Herod is styled a fox, and persons of insidious, ravenous, profane, or sensual dispositions, are named respectively by him who saw their hearts, serpents, dogs, wolves, and swine; terms which are not the random language of passion, but a judicious designation of the persons meant by them."
