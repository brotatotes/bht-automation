### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Flatter not yourselves with the fond delusion that God stands in need of you, to make good His promise of a seed to Abraham."
2. "Though you were all to perish, God is as able to raise up a seed to Abraham out of those stones as He was to take Abraham himself out of the rock whence he was hewn."
3. "It was clearly the calling of the Gentiles - at that time stone-dead in their sins, and quite as unconscious of it - into the room of unbelieving and disinherited Israel that he meant thus to indicate."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Do not say, nay, do not think that this is a plausible defence, even within yourselves, in your own hearts: We have Abraham to our father, or 'for a father,' i.e., we shall escape, or be saved, because we are natural heirs to the promise made to him." 

2. "God is able of (or, 'out of') these stones, i.e., lying loose on the banks of Jordan, where the words were uttered sarcastic. No figurative reference to heathen, or to monuments."

3. "God could create others to take their place as heirs of the promise. Probably a reference to the spiritual offspring of the patriarch (Romans 4:16; Galatians 3:7).
