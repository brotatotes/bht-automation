# Matthew 4:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse describes how the Spirit powerfully led Jesus into the wilderness, where He willingly allowed Himself to be tempted by the adversary. This was a test of His faith and a preparation for the work He was about to undertake. The confrontation between Jesus and the adversary, who took some bodily form, represented the clash between the kingdom of God and the kingdom of darkness. Through this victory, Jesus received encouragement and gloriously demonstrated His power over the forces of evil, foreshadowing His ultimate triumph on the cross.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "The thought thus strongly expressed is the mighty constraining impulse of the Spirit under which He went; while Matthew's more gentle expression, 'was led up,' intimates how purely voluntary on His own part this action was."
2. "The Spirit conducted Him into the wilderness simply to have His faith tried; but as the agent in this trial was to be the wicked one, whose whole object would be to seduce Him from His allegiance to God, it was a temptation in the bad sense of the term."
3. "What was the high design of this? First, as we judge, to give our Lord a taste of what lay before Him in the work He had undertaken; next, to make trial of the glorious equipment for it which He had just received; further, to give Him encouragement, by the victory now to be won, to go forward spoiling principalities and powers, until at length He should make a show of them openly, triumphing over them in His cross."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Led up by the Spirit. Not by His own spirit, but by the Holy Spirit. The words 'led up' show this."
2. "To be tempted. For this purpose. To this contest, the God-Man is impelled, not directly by his own will, but by the Spirit to fulfill the design of the Father."
3. "The personal representatives of the two kingdoms here met. As Christ was in human form, it is natural to suppose the adversary took some bodily form."
