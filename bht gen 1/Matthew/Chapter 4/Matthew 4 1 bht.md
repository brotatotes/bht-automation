# Matthew 4:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Led by the Spirit into the wilderness, Jesus faced a genuine historical conflict with the power of evil. He was brought there purposefully by the Spirit, not of His own accord, to have His faith tested and to reveal His unwavering allegiance to God. Despite the tangible presence of the devil, Jesus conquered the temptation, reflecting His role as the Son of God and providing an example for all believers, showing that our trials are not without purpose and not beyond the supervision of the Spirit.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The Spirit carried Him away" (Acts 8:39) - This highlights the agency of the Holy Spirit in Jesus' journey to the desert for the temptation.

2. "The express purpose of ἀνήχθη" - This emphasizes that Jesus was brought to the temptation as part of His conflict with the Power of Darkness, not of His own will.

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "The thought thus strongly expressed is the mighty constraining impulse of the Spirit under which He went; while Matthew's more gentle expression, 'was led up,' intimates how purely voluntary on His own part this action was."
2. "The Spirit conducted Him into the wilderness simply to have His faith tried; but as the agent in this trial was to be the wicked one, whose whole object would be to seduce Him from His allegiance to God, it was a temptation in the bad sense of the term."
3. "What was the high design of this? First, as we judge, to give our Lord a taste of what lay before Him in the work He had undertaken; next, to make trial of the glorious equipment for it which He had just received; further, to give Him encouragement, by the victory now to be won, to go forward spoiling principalities and powers, until at length He should make a show of them openly, triumphing over them in His cross."

### Albert Barnes:

3. "The word 'tempt,' in the original, means to try, to endeavor, to attempt to do a thing; then, to try the nature of a thing, as metals by fire; then, to test moral qualities by trying them, to see how they will endure."

### Marvin Vincent:

### John Calvin:
1. "Let us therefore learn that, by the guidance of the Spirit, Christ withdrew from the crowd of men, in order that he might come forth as the highest teacher of the church, as the ambassador of God, — rather as sent from heaven, than as taken from some town, and from among the common people."
2. "God intended, I have no doubt, to exhibit in the person of his Son, as in a very bright mirror, how obstinately and perseveringly Satan opposes the salvation of men."

### Philip Schaff:
