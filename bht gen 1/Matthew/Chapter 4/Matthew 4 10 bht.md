# Matthew 4:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, our Lord encounters a bold and deadly attack from Satan, who tempts Him to worship him instead of honoring God. Christ, aware of the true identity of His adversary, firmly rejects him, using Scripture as a shield against his deceitful propositions. This interaction showcases the absolute devotion that is deserving of God alone and serves as a reminder for all to serve Him and Him alone. Christ's response emphasizes the immediate dismissal of Satan's temptations and highlights the appropriate place for him - behind and subordinate to Jesus.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Our Lord at once repels him openly; not that He did not know him before, but because he had thus openly tempted Him." 

2. "He adds, for it is written, again, as Man, appealing to the Word of God." 

3. "From this time, our Lord is known by the devils, and casts them out by a word."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Our Lord no longer deals with him as a pretended friend and pious counsellor, but calls him by his right name—His knowledge of which from the outset He had carefully concealed till now—and orders him off."
2. "This is the final and conclusive evidence, as we think, that Matthew's must be the right order of the temptations."
3. "Thus does our Lord part with Satan on the rock of Scripture."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "This was a bolder attack than any which had been made before... a more decided and deadly thrust at the piety of the Saviour."
2. "It was a proposition that the Son of God should worship the devil, instead of honoring and adoring Him who made heaven and earth."
3. "Satan asked him to worship him. This was expressly forbidden, and Jesus therefore drove him from his presence."

### John Calvin:
1. "Christ simply bids him go away; and now proceeds with the same kind of defense as before, employing Scripture as a shield, not of reeds, but of brass."
2. "Christ rejects this frivolous distinction, and claims for God alone προσκύνησις, worship; by which he warns us to attend more to the matter than to expressions, when we have to do with the worship of God."
3. "Now, as religion is strictly spiritual, and the outward acknowledgment of it relates to the body, so not only the inward worship, but also the outward manifestation of it, is due to God alone."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "A single word, ‘begone,’ ‘avaunt,’ expressing abhorrence of both person and proposal."
2. "Addressed by name, having spoken in his true character as ‘adversary.’"
3. "The two clauses taken together forbid every kind of religious homage to any other than Jehovah God."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Begone" Christ says to Satan. This temptation is the limit of diabolical suggestion and argues for the logical order in Matthew.
2. The third time Jesus quotes Deuteronomy, this time Deuteronomy 6:13, and repels the infamous suggestion by Scripture quotation.
3. The words "him alone thou shalt serve" need be recalled today. Jesus will warn men against trying to serve God and mammon (Matthew 6:24).

### John Gill:
1. "He had borne his insults and temptations with great patience; he had answered him with mildness and gentleness; but now his behaviour to him was intolerable, which obliged him to show his resentment, exert his power and authority, and rid himself at once of so vile a creature." 

2. "Worship includes both an internal and external reverence of God: the word 'only' is not in the original text, but is added by our Lord; and that very justly; partly to express the emphasis which is on the word 'him'; and in perfect agreement with the context, which requires it."

3. "The meaning of our Lord in citing it is; that since the Lord God is the alone object of worship, it was horrid blasphemy in Satan to desire it might be given to him, and which could not be done without the greatest impiety."

### John Wesley:
1. "Get thee hence, Satan" - This phrase emphasizes the immediate and forceful rejection of Satan's temptations, urging him to depart without delay.
2. "Not, get thee behind me, that is, into thy proper place" - This statement highlights the distinction between Satan's position as an adversary and the appropriate place for him, which is behind and subordinate to Jesus.
3. "Speaking what was not expedient" - This phrase suggests that Jesus' response to Peter on a different occasion was not suitable or beneficial, unlike his firm and decisive response to Satan's temptations.
