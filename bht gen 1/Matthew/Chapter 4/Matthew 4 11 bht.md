# Matthew 4:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, we see that during a specific season, Jesus was tempted and tried in various ways, just as no one is exempt from temptation. However, even in the midst of these trials, Jesus was not left alone. Angels came to assist and provide for him, both physically and spiritually, congratulating his victory over temptation. This passage serves as a reminder that even in our moments of weakness, God's grace and support are available to us.
