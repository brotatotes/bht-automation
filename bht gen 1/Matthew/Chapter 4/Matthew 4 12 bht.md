# Matthew 4:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
After John the Baptist was imprisoned, Jesus embarked on a purposeful journey into Galilee. This move was not hasty, but a calculated response to the opposition from the Pharisees. It was part of Jesus' larger ministry plan, as he had previously traveled from Judea to Galilee. During this time, Jesus continued his own ministry, baptizing in Judea while John the Baptist carried out his baptisms at Enon, highlighting the parallel nature of their work.
