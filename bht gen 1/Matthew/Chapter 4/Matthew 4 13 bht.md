# Matthew 4:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Leaving behind the rejection and difficulties of Nazareth, Jesus came to dwell in Capernaum, a place of consolation and refuge. Capernaum, home to some of His closest disciples, provided a diverse community that offered freedom from the bigotry of strictly Jewish towns. Jesus' choice to settle in Capernaum demonstrates His mission to bring comfort and salvation to all, regardless of their past or societal labels. It reminds us that in times of rejection, God's plan and presence can bring solace and new beginnings.
