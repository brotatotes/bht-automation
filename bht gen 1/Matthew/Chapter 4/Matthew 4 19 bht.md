## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Follow me" - This invitation from Jesus is a call to discipleship, a call to leave behind the old way of life and follow Him. It is an invitation to walk in His footsteps, to learn from Him, and to become like Him.
2. "Come ye after Me" - This phrase emphasizes the urgency and immediacy of Jesus' call. It is not a casual invitation, but a command to leave everything and follow Him without delay.
3. "I will make you fishers of men" - Jesus promises to transform His disciples into something greater than fishermen. He will equip them to become fishers of men, to bring people into the kingdom of God. This shows that Jesus' call is not just about personal salvation, but about participating in God's mission to save others.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Fishers of men" refers to the role of ministers and preachers in spreading the gospel and bringing people to Christ.
2. This phrase implies that just as fishermen cast their nets to catch fish, ministers must actively seek out and engage with people to share the message of salvation.
3. The term "fishers of men" also suggests the importance of patience, persistence, and skill in the work of evangelism, as fishermen must wait and strategize to catch their prey.
