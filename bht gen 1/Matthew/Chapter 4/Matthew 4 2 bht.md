# Matthew 4:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, a period of forty days and nights is described, during which Jesus fasted and abstained from food. Commentators note that this fast was not a perfunctory ceremonial act, but rather a time of communion with the Father and spiritual contemplation. It is emphasized that this remarkable fasting period was not for our imitation, but to highlight the reality of Jesus' human nature, as he overcame physical weakness and hunger in our stead. This fasting, akin to those of Moses and Elijah, prepared Jesus for the subsequent temptations that awaited him.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Albert Barnes:
1. "Luke says Luke 4:2 that he ate nothing. This settles the question."
2. "Mark does not mention the time when the angels performed this office of kindness, and we are at liberty to suppose that he means to say that it was done at the close of the 40 days."
3. "There are other instances of persons fasting 40 days recorded in the Scriptures. Thus, Moses fasted 40 days, Exodus 34:28. Elijah also fasted the same length of time, 1 Kings 19:8. In these cases they were no doubt miraculously supported."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The length of the fast is not incredible. Comp. the fasts of Moses (Exodus 34:28) and Elijah (1 Kings 19:8), Absorption in intellectual pursuits, but especially in spiritual contemplation, will render any one for a time independent of ordinary food or nourishment."
2. "Our Lord was enduring for us, not prescribing fasts to us. He neither practised nor enjoined monastic habits."
3. "Even when weakest physically, when the temptation would be strongest, He overcame in our nature what enslaves our unaided nature."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "No perfunctory ceremonial fast, but of communion with the Father in complete abstention from food." 
2. "The period of the fast... was spent in a spiritual ecstasy, during which the wants of the natural body were suspended."
3. "He afterward hungered" and so at the close of the period of forty days.

### John Gill:
1. "Forty nights" as well as days, are mentioned; partly to show that these were whole entire days, consisting of twenty four hours; and partly to distinguish this fast of Christ from the common fastings of the Jews.
2. What is very surprising in this fasting of our Lord, which was made and recorded, not for our imitation, is, that during the whole time he should not be attended with hunger.
3. This detail of Jesus being hungry after the forty days of fasting serves to express the reality of his human nature, which though miraculously supported for so long a time without food, and insensible of hunger, yet at length had appetite for food.

### John Wesley:
1. "Having fasted — Whereby doubtless he received more abundant spiritual strength from God."
2. "Forty days and forty nights — As did Moses, the giver of the law, and Elijah, the great restorer of it."
3. "He was afterward hungry — And so prepared for the first temptation."
