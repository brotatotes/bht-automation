# Matthew 4:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, we see James and John, the hardworking fishermen, diligently mending their nets while their father, Zebedee, oversees their family business. Jesus, with his discernment and purpose, sees beyond their occupation and calls them in the midst of their everyday work. This highlights Jesus's ability to call people from all walks of life, and their immediate response shows their sense of loyalty and readiness to follow Him. Their involvement in mending their nets demonstrates the need for preparation and restoration in our own lives before we can fully respond to Jesus's call.
