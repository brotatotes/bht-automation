# Matthew 4:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the synagogues, our Lord taught and spread the Gospel of the kingdom, healing diseases and proclaiming the good news of salvation. Synagogues were places of worship, where the Scriptures were read, prayers were offered, and the Old Testament was expounded. Christ's ministry demonstrated the freeness and richness of God's grace, as He went about doing good and preaching the message of salvation and the reign of God. Embracing this Gospel requires a sincere and diligent pursuit, as it offers true and eternal happiness beyond the temporal joys of this world.
