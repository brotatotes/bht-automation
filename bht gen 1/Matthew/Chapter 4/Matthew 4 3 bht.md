# Matthew 4:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we encounter a subtle and uncertain temptation. The Son of God, who had just been in the wilderness for forty days, is approached by the devil, referred to as "the tempter," challenging his true identity. The devil cunningly dares Jesus, the Son of God, to exercise his power to fulfill his own needs as proof. Jesus, however, resolutely remains steadfast, responding to the temptation with powerful quotes from Scripture. This passage serves as a reminder of Jesus' unwavering nature and his openness to those who genuinely seek to know Him.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Whether the words of St. Mark, ἦν μετὰ τῶν θηρίων, allude to one kind of temptation, is uncertain."
2. "Here first we find the N.T. meaning of πειράζειν, to solicit to sin, which does not occur in the LXX, nor in the classics."
3. "In the N.T. are found three combinations of these two substantives and the article, and all with one and the same meaning, viz. THE SON OF GOD, in the highest and Messianic sense."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Thou still clingest to that vainglorious confidence that Thou art the Son of God, carried away by those illusory scenes at the Jordan."
2. "Thou wast born in a stable; but Thou art the Son of God! hurried off to Egypt for fear of Herod's wrath; but Thou art the Son of God!"
3. "Why linger for weeks in this desert, wandering among the wild beasts and craggy rocks, unhonored, unattended, unpitied, ready to starve for want of the necessaries of life? Is this befitting 'the Son of God?'"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "No temptation could have been more plausible, or more likely to succeed, than this."
2. "The circumstances were such as to make it appear plausible and proper to work this miracle."
3. "How foolish is it, then, for the Son of God, having all power, to be starving in this manner, when by a word he could show his power and relieve his wants, and when in the thing itself there could be nothing wrong!"

### John Calvin:
1. "This name, ὁ πειράζων, the tempter, is given to Satan by the Spirit for the express purpose, that believers may be more carefully on their guard against him."
2. "Hence, too, we conclude, that temptations, which solicit us to what is evil, come from him alone."
3. "The Son of God was not such an unskillful or inexperienced antagonist, as not to know how he might ward off the strokes of his adversary, or idly to present his shield on the left hand when he was attacked on the right."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "The devil is alluding to the words of the Father to Jesus at the baptism: 'This is my Son the Beloved.' He challenges this address by a condition of the first class which assumes the condition to be true and deftly calls on Jesus to exercise his power as Son of God to appease his hunger and thus prove to himself and all that he really is what the Father called him."
2. "It was all so simple, obvious, easy. It would satisfy the hunger of Christ and was quite within his power."
3. "Each time Jesus quotes Deuteronomy to repel the subtle temptation of the devil. Here it is Deuteronomy 8:3 from the Septuagint. Bread is a mere detail in man's dependence upon God."

1. "By 'the tempter', is meant the devil, so called because it is his principal work and business, to solicit men to sin."

2. "As one that desired to inquire farther into the evidences of his being the Messiah."
