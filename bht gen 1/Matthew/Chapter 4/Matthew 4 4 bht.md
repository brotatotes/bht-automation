# Matthew 4:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When facing temptation, Jesus responds by quoting the Scripture, emphasizing that man's true sustenance lies not in physical bread alone but in God's unwavering promise of providential care. Commentators note the beautiful connection between Jesus fulfilling the law by referring to it while overcoming Satan's temptation. Jesus, fully human and aware of His needs, does not rely on His divine power but conquers for us by identifying with humanity. By demonstrating unwavering faith and confidence in God, Jesus rejects the temptation to seek bread outside of God's will.
