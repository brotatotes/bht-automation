# Matthew 4:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we find ourselves in the holy city, Jerusalem, the seat of Jewish worship and the metropolis of Jewish life. Jesus, standing on the battlement of the immense tower of the temple, overlooks the city with its well-known projection and dizzying height. From this vantage point, he beholds the panorama of Jerusalem, symbolizing his authority and sovereignty over the place God had chosen for himself. The temptation of Jesus takes place in this sacred and exalted setting, where he is confronted by the tempter himself, in both a humbling and challenging encounter.
