# Matthew 4:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, Jesus is taken by Satan to the holy city, Jerusalem, and to the highest point of the temple. Moved with consent from Christ, Satan tests Him in three different ways. Jesus finds Himself on the pinnacle of the temple, a place of great authority and prominence, representing His divinity. It is from this elevated position that He is tempted to exercise His power and put God's promises to the test.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The real order is evidently that in the text; for otherwise our Lord’s final answer, Matthew 4:10, would not be in its place."
2. "The general opinion, that our Lord was placed on Herod’s royal portico, described in Jos. Antt. xv. 11. 5, is probably right."
3. "The temptation being one not of ambition, but of presumption."

Note: The commentary provided is quite lengthy and contains a lot of technical details and references. I have selected three quotes that provide insights into the order of the temptations, the location of the temptation, and the nature of the temptation itself.

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The holy city, the seat of the temple, the metropolis of all Jewish worship."
2. "Whether this refers to the highest summit of the temple, which bristled with golden spikes, or another peak on Herod's royal portico overhanging the ravine of Kedron, at the valley of Hinnom."
3. "An immense tower built on the very edge of this precipice, from the top of which one could not look to the bottom."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It means to conduct one; to lead one; to attend or accompany one; or to induce one to go."
2. "From these passages, and many more, it appears that all that is meant here is, that Satan conducted Jesus, or accompanied him; but not that this was done against the will of Jesus."
3. "The word 'pinnacle' does not quite express the force of the original. It is a word given usually to birds, and denotes wings, or anything in the form of wings, and was given to the roof of this porch because it resembled a bird dropping its wings."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The preposition para (with, by the side of), implies taketh along with himself, or conducteth."
2. "Nothing in the word compels us to infer that Christ was placed on the top of a tower or spire, which is the popular meaning of pinnacle."
3. "The word temple (iJeron, lit., sacred place) signifies the whole compass of the sacred inclosure, with its porticos, courts, and other subordinate buildings; and should be carefully distinguished from the other word, naov, also rendered temple, which means the temple itself - the 'Holy Place' and the 'Holy of Holies'."

### John Calvin:
1. "Let it suffice for us to know that Christ was tempted in three ways."
2. "There is no absurdity in supposing, that this took place by the permission of God and the voluntary subjection of Christ; provided we hold that within, — that is, in his mind and souls, — he suffered no delusion."
3. "The main question for our consideration is, what was Satan’s object in this kind of temptation? That will be best determined, as I have lately hinted, by our Lord’s reply to Satan."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The greater humiliation of being tempted by Satan included the less, that of being conducted by him."
2. "Undoubtedly Jerusalem. Some suppose Jesus of his own accord went to Jerusalem for a day, and was there met by the tempter."
3. "The roof of the temple itself was covered with spikes to prevent birds from defiling it. A portico of the temple is meant, probably that called the Royal Porch, which overlooked the valley of Hinnom at a dizzy height."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Matthew is very fond of this temporal adverb (τοτε). See already Matthew 2:7; Matthew 3:13; Matthew 4:1; Matthew 4:5. Note historic present with vivid picturesqueness."
2. "Luke puts this temptation third, the geographical order."
3. "It is not clear what place is meant by 'wing.' It may refer to Herod's royal portico which overhung the Kedron Valley and looked down some four hundred and fifty feet, a dizzy height (Josephus, Ant. XV. xi. 5)."

Note: The commentary provided is incomplete and does not contain enough information to provide a comprehensive understanding of the verse.

### John Gill:
1. "Satan, by divine permission, and with the consent of Christ, which shows his great humiliation and condescension, had power over his body, to move it from place to place."
2. "Satan frequents all sorts of places; men are no where free from his temptations; Christ himself was not in the holy city, no nor in the holy temple."
3. "In this place, the Jews set James, the brother of Christ, and from it cast him down headlong: this was the ακρον 'the summit', or 'top' of it; and intends either the roof encompassed with battlements, to keep persons from falling off; or the top of the porch before the temple, which was 120 cubits high; or the top of the royal gallery, built by Herod, which was of such an height, that if a man looked down from it, he soon became dizzy."

### John Wesley:
1. "The holy city - So Jerusalem was commonly called, being the place God had peculiarly chosen for himself."
2. "On the battlement of the temple - Probably over the king's gallery, which was of such a prodigious height, that no one could look down from the top of it without making himself giddy."
3. "Being on the battlement of the temple, Jesus was in a position of authority and prominence, symbolizing his divine authority as the Son of God."
