### Henry Alford:

2. "not as a prophecy of the Messiah" - The verse should not be interpreted solely as a prophecy of the Messiah, but rather as a broader statement about the role and duty of all servants of God.

3. "à fortiori to the Son of God" - The verse holds even more significance when applied to the Son of God, highlighting the elevated status and responsibility of Jesus in fulfilling the role of a servant of God.

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Satan himself with a Bible under his arm and a text in his mouth!"
2. "The tempter, having felt the power of God's Word in the former temptation, was eager to try the effect of it from his own mouth."
3. "Not a few good expositors have thought that this omission was intentional, to conceal the fact that this would not have been one of 'His ways,' that is, of duty."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The temptation here was, that he should at once avail himself of the protection of a promise of safety made to him, and thus demonstrate that he was the Messiah."
2. "The temptation, therefore, in this case was, that by thus establishing his claim he would avoid all the obloquy, persecution, and suffering which he must otherwise endure if he attempted to prove that he was the Son of God by a life of toil and privation."
3. "The promise, as Satan applied it, was that he should not be injured by the stones lying at the bottom of the wall or in the valley below."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "On their hands (so Rev.) is more correct." 
2. "Gives a different picture from the A. V." 
3. "Lifted on their hands, as on a litter or platform."

### John Calvin:
1. "We must observe this malice of Satan, in misapplying a quotation of Scripture, for the purpose of rendering life deadly to Christ, and of converting bread into poison."
2. "And undoubtedly the Lord grants such a permission to our adversary, that we may not remain in indolent ease, but may be more careful to keep watch."
3. "When Satan wickedly tortures Scripture, does Christ give way to him? Does he allow him to seize and carry off the Scripture, with which he formerly armed himself? On the contrary, he quotes Scripture in his turn, and boldly refutes Satan’s wicked slander."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The devil takes the weapon with which he had been already overcome. He too, ‘can cite Scripture for his purpose.’ But the result proves that Satan was but a surface reader, or rather a wilful perverter of the Scriptures."
2. "He shall give, etc. From Psalms 91:11-12."
3. "Lest haply, not ‘at any time.’ This promise to all God’s people seems specially applicable to ‘the Son of God.’ The words, ‘in all thy ways,’ are omitted here, but without altering the sense. The original is poetic. Satan uses it literally, tempting to a rash confidence, as in the first instance to distrust. It was also a temptation to avoid the appointed endurance, and by one striking exercise of power prove himself the Messiah."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The devil urged presumptuous reliance on God and quotes Scripture to support his view (Psalms 91:11)."

3. "It was a skilful thrust and would also be accepted by the populace as proof that Jesus was the Messiah if they should see him sailing down as if from heaven."

### John Gill:
1. "If, or seeing, thou art the Son of God, show thyself to be so; give proof of thy sonship before all the priests which are in and about the temple, and before all the inhabitants of Jerusalem." 
2. "Satan not only argues from his divine power, as the Son of God, that he would be safe in casting himself down; but observing the advantageous use Christ made of the scriptures, transforms himself into an angel of light, and cites scripture too, to encourage him to this action; assuring him of the protection of angels."
3. "Satan before tempted Christ to distrust the providence of God, and now he tempts him to presume upon it: in like manner he deals with men, when he argues from the doctrines of predestination and providence to the disuse of means, for their good, either for this life, or that which is to come."

### John Wesley:
1. "In their hands" signifies the careful and protective nature of God's angels, who hold us with tender love and watch over us diligently.
