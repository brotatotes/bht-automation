# Matthew 4:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In a moment of time, on an exceeding high mountain, Jesus was shown all the kingdoms of the world and their glory. The supernatural character of this vision reveals the presence of the enemy, the father of lies, tempting Jesus to seek worldly power and authority. The panorama presented to Jesus, though partially mental and fictitious, showcased the vastness and allure of human dominion. This temptation underscored the contrast between the path of humble selflessness chosen by Jesus and the shortcut to power offered by Satan.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The additional words in Luke, ἐν στιγμῇ χρόνου, are valuable as pointing out to us clearly the supernatural character of this vision."
2. "If it be objected, that in that case there was no need for the ascent of the mountain, I answer, that such natural accessories are made use of frequently in supernatural revelations."
3. "In this last temptation the enemy reveals himself openly, as the ἄρχων τοῦ κόσμου τούτου, and as the father of lies."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "That a scene was presented to our Lord's natural eye seems plainly expressed."
2. "To limit this to the most extensive scene which the natural eye could take in, is to give a sense to the expression, 'all the kingdoms of the world,' quite violent."
3. "It was permitted to the tempter to extend preternaturally for a moment our Lord's range of vision, and throw a 'glory' or glitter over the scene of vision."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The Abbe Mariti speaks of a mountain on which he was, which overlooks the mountains of Arabia, the country of Gilead, the country of the Amorites, the plains of Moab, the plains of Jericho, the River Jordan, and the whole extent of the Dead Sea." 
2. "This shows that there were mountains from which no small part of the land of Canaan could be seen; and we need not suppose that there was any miracle when they were shown to the Saviour." 
3. "The term 'world' is often used in this limited sense to denote a part or a large part of the world, particularly the land of Canaan."

### John Calvin:
1. "We must keep in mind...that it was not owing to any weakness of Christ's nature, but to a voluntary dispensation and permission, that Satan produced this effect upon his eyes."
2. "The kind of temptation here described was, that Christ should seek, in another manner than from God, the inheritance which he has promised to his children."
3. "A considerable portion of mankind disbelieve the power and authority of God over the world, and imagine that everything good is bestowed by Satan."

Note: The commentary is quite long, so I have only included three quotes that capture different aspects of the commentary.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "An exceeding high mountain. Its situation can only be conjectured; the Mount of Olives, which was relatively high; others, the mountain in the wilderness (Quarantania), Nebo, Tabor."
2. "Sheweth him. Luke adds, ‘in a moment of time,’ this may imply some supernatural extension of vision."
3. "All the kingdoms of the world; not to be restricted to Palestine, a narrower meaning which ‘world’ occasionally has, but never in such a phrase."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "This wonderful panorama had to be partially mental and imaginative, since the devil caused to pass in review 'all the kingdoms of the world and the glory of them.' But this fact does not prove that all phases of the temptations were subjective without any objective presence of the devil. Both could be true."

2. "Here again we have the vivid historical present. The devil now has Christ upon a very high mountain whether the traditional Quarantania or not."

3. "Luke says that the whole panorama was 'in a moment of time' and clearly psychological and instantaneous."

### John Gill:
1. "By 'all the kingdoms of the world' are meant, not only the Roman empire, but all the kingdoms in the whole world, which subsisted in any form, whether within or independent of the Roman empire; or whether greater or lesser."
2. "The view which Satan gave Christ of all this was not a true and real sight, but a fictitious, delusive representation."
3. "In a moment of time, in the twinkling of an eye, or 'in a point of time', the devil showed to Christ the kingdoms of this world and their glory."

### John Wesley:
1. "The phrase 'showeth him all the kingdoms of the world' suggests that Jesus was given a glimpse into the vastness and diversity of human power and authority."
2. "This vision of the kingdoms of the world highlights the allure and temptation of worldly power, as it presents a stark contrast to the humble and selfless path that Jesus chose."
3. "By showing Jesus the kingdoms of the world, Satan was essentially offering him a shortcut to achieving his mission, bypassing the suffering and sacrifice that lay ahead."
