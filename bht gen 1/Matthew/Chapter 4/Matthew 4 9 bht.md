## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Is not Satan thrice called by our Lord Himself, 'the prince of this world'... And still further, is it not said that Christ came to destroy by His death 'him that hath the power of death, that is, the devil'? No doubt these passages only express men's voluntary subjection to the rule of the wicked one while they live, and his power to surround death to them, when it comes, with all the terrors of the wages of sin."
2. "But as this is a real and terrible sway, so all Scripture represents men as righteously sold under it. In this sense he speaks what is not devoid of truth, when he says, 'All this is delivered unto me.'"
3. "Despairing of success as an angel of light, he throws off all disguise, and with a splendid bribe solicits divine honor. This again shows that we are now at the last of the temptations, and that Matthew's order is the true one."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "All these kingdoms. All these dominions Satan claimed a right to bestow on whom he pleased, and with considerable justice."
2. "Satan proposed to put him in possession of it at once, without any difficulty, if he would acknowledge him as the proper lord and disposer of that country; if he would trust to him rather than to God."
3. "So plausible are Satan’s temptations, even when they are blasphemous; and so artfully does he present his allurements to the mind."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "All these things, i.e., ‘all that renders them attractive to the love of power, pleasure, wealth, honor’ (J. A. Alexander)."
2. "His greatest weapons are his half-truths, his perversions of the truth."
3. "Satan, fallen through ambition, would ask no less for his dominion. His price is always exorbitant."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Jesus does not deny the grip of the devil on the world of men, but the condition was spurned by Jesus."
2. "The ambition of Jesus is thus appealed to at the price of recognition of the devil's primacy in the world."
3. "The temptation was threefold: to gain a temporal, not a spiritual, dominion; to gain it at once; and to gain it by an act of homage to the ruler of this world."

### John Gill:
1. "He sets up himself to be the God of this world, and the sovereign disposer of it."
