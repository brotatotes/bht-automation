# Matthew 4:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, commentators shed light on the power and influence of Satan, known as "the prince of this world." They describe his role as the one who creates voluntary subjection to his rule and surrounds death with the terrors of sin. Satan cunningly claims authority over kingdoms and offers them to those who acknowledge him. His temptations, although blasphemous, can be deceptively plausible. This verse exposes the arrogance of Satan, who desires to be worshipped and adored as God himself. Jesus explicitly addresses Satan by his name, highlighting his identity and authority.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Is not Satan thrice called by our Lord Himself, 'the prince of this world'... And still further, is it not said that Christ came to destroy by His death 'him that hath the power of death, that is, the devil'? No doubt these passages only express men's voluntary subjection to the rule of the wicked one while they live, and his power to surround death to them, when it comes, with all the terrors of the wages of sin."
2. "In this sense he speaks what is not devoid of truth, when he says, 'All this is delivered unto me.' But how does he deliver this 'to whomsoever he will?' As employing whomsoever he pleases of his willing subjects in keeping men under his power."
3. "Despairing of success as an angel of light, he throws off all disguise, and with a splendid bribe solicits divine honor. This again shows that we are now at the last of the temptations, and that Matthew's order is the true one."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "All these kingdoms. All these dominions Satan claimed a right to bestow on whom he pleased, and with considerable justice."
2. "Satan proposed to put him in possession of it at once, without any difficulty, if he would acknowledge him as the proper lord and disposer of that country; if he would trust to him rather than to God."
3. "So plausible are Satan's temptations, even when they are blasphemous; and so artfully does he present his allurements to the mind."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "All these things, i.e., 'all that renders them attractive to the love of power, pleasure, wealth, honor'." 
2. "His greatest weapons are his half-truths, his perversions of the truth." 
3. "Satan, fallen through ambition, would ask no less for his dominion. His price is always exorbitant."

### John Gill:
1. "He sets up himself to be the God of this world, and the sovereign disposer of it."
2. "Never was such monstrous arrogance expressed as this."
3. "The devil is not content to be worshipped by men, but seeks for adoration from the Son of God: this opens at once his proud, ambitious, and aspiring views, to be as God himself."

### John Wesley:
1. "Here Satan clearly shows who he was."
2. "Christ answering this suggestion, calls him by his own name, which he had not done before."
3. "Accordingly Christ answering this suggestion, calls him by his own name, which he had not done before."
