# Matthew 5:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Persecution for righteousness' sake is experienced by those who stand up for goodness and righteousness. They endure suffering and are distinguished by their religious life, which reproves and condemns the wickedness of others. Persecution can take various forms, from verbal attacks to confiscation of goods or even death. Society rejects them and their different way of life, always seeking to distance themselves from such individuals.
