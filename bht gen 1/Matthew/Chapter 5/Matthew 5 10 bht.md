# Matthew 5:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse being described is a well-known one from the Bible that speaks about the persecution faced by those who live out their faith and righteousness. Commentators emphasize that persecution is not based on crimes committed, but rather on the righteous and godly lifestyle that exposes the world's hatred. These individuals, who choose to follow Christ, endure verbal and real persecution, including mockery, reproachful language, confiscation of goods, banishment, and even death. Despite the difficulties they face, these blessed individuals are reminded that their suffering is evidence of their identity as children of God.
