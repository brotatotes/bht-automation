### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Exult... as if He would have their inward transport to overpower and absorb the sense of all these affronts and sufferings; nor will anything else do it."
2. "Great is your reward in heaven... You do but serve yourselves heirs to their character and sufferings, and the reward will be common."
3. "You do but serve yourselves heirs to their character and sufferings, and the reward will be common."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Regard it as a great privilege thus to be persecuted and to suffer - a thing not to be mourned over, but as among the chief blessings of life."
2. "To those who suffer most, God imparts the highest rewards. Hence, the crown of martyrdom has been thought to be the brightest that any of the redeemed shall wear."
3. "Nothing but the consciousness of innocence, and the presence of God, could bear up the sufferers in the midst of these trials; and the flame, therefore, kindled to consume the martyr, has also been a bright light, showing the truth and power of the gospel of Jesus."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Rejoice, etc. An exhortation based on the declaration of blessedness in Matthew 5:11, and confirming it. Needful, because the prospect of persecution is far from awakening joy."
2. "For great is your reward in heaven. The reason both for rejoicing and for the blessedness. 'Reward,' i.e., recompense; but of grace, not of debt. 'Great' implies that it would be beyond merit."
3. "For so persecuted they, i.e., the unbelieving Jews, the prophets who were before you. Not an express assertion that the disciples were prophets. It, however, puts them on the same level, establishes the connection between the Old and the New Testaments, showing that the old antagonism remains."

### John Gill:
1. "Rejoice and be exceeding glad...because of the honour put upon them, the glory they bring to Christ and his cause, by cheerfully suffering for it."
2. "Great is your reward in heaven...there is no proportion or comparison between what the saints suffer for Christ, and the glory that shall be revealed in them by him."
3. "For so persecuted they the prophets which were before you...what should befall them was no new and strange thing, but what had been the lot of the most eminent servants of God in former ages."

### John Wesley:
1. "The reward mentioned here is not merely the happiness that naturally and directly results from holiness, but something over and above that. It is the special favor and blessing that God bestows on those who diligently seek Him and strive to live according to His commandments."

2. "This reward is not limited to earthly blessings or temporal benefits, but extends to eternal life and fellowship with God in heaven. It is the ultimate fulfillment of our deepest desires and the culmination of our journey of faith."

3. "The reward is not earned or deserved by our own efforts, but is a gracious gift from God. It is a manifestation of His love and faithfulness towards those who love and obey Him."

4. "This verse reminds us that our pursuit of holiness is not in vain, but has a glorious and eternal outcome. It encourages us to persevere in our faith and obedience, knowing that our labor is not in vain and that God will abundantly reward us."
