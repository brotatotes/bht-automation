# Matthew 5:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Bible verse being described speaks of a group of people who are like salt, influencing and preserving the world from corruption. They are described as having both savory doctrines that are rooted in scripture, and an exemplary way of living that serves as an example to others. Their role is seen as crucial, as the health of the world depends on the presence of their saving elements. However, if they lose their effectiveness and no longer live up to their calling, their usefulness is lost and cannot be easily restored.

### John Gill:
1. "They might be compared to 'salt', because of the savoury doctrines they preached; as all such are, which are agreeable to the Scriptures, and are of the evangelic kind, which are full of Christ, serve to exalt him, and to magnify the grace of God."
2. "Also because of their savoury lives and conversations; whereby they recommended, and gave sanction to the doctrines they preached, were examples to the saints, and checks upon wicked men."
3. "Salt is good for nothing, but to make things savoury, and preserve from putrefacation; and when it has lost its savour, it is of no use, neither to men nor beasts...so ministers of the word, when they have dropped the savoury doctrines of the Gospel, or have quitted their former seeming savoury and exemplary conversations; as their usefulness is gone, so, generally speaking, it is never retrieved."
