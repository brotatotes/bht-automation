# Matthew 5:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Believers are described as the light of the world, entrusted with spreading the message of God's love and truth to others. Their role is to be visible and impactful, just as a city on a hill cannot be hidden. This visibility is a result of their holiness and righteousness, which cannot be concealed, but instead shine brightly for all to see. As they live out their faith in the world, believers are called to be beacons of hope and guidance to those around them, illuminating the darkness with the light of God's truth and grace.
