## BHT:
Believers are called to be the light of the world, shining with the indwelling of Christ's Spirit. As luminaries, they have a blessed influence, externally irradiating society with truth and holiness. Like a city on a hill, the Church of God cannot be hidden. Living a holy life naturally attracts attention and stands out, drawing others towards the transformative power of God's truth and righteousness.
