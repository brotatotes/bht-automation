# Matthew 5:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, various commentators highlight the importance of not hiding one's light or talents. They emphasize the need to display one's light or gifts for all to see, rather than keeping them hidden. Sharing one's light or abilities can have a significant impact on others, benefiting not just oneself but also those around them. The purpose of receiving God's light is not to hide it, but to let it shine brightly for all to see and illuminate the darkness around us.
