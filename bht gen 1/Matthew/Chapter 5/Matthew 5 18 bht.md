# Matthew 5:18 Commentary Help Text

This verse speaks of the enduring authority and significance of the law, which holds divine authority and is deeply rooted in the stability of Old Testament revelation. It emphasizes the smallest details and strokes of the Hebrew letters, highlighting the honor and vitality maintained in its requirements. The verse warns against disregarding the Old Testament, as it ultimately leads to a denial of Christ. The law achieves its purpose not only through obedience to its precepts, but also through the rewards and punishments it entails, and it remains effective until all its requirements are fulfilled.
