# Matthew 5:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, Jesus teaches about the significance of obeying even the least of God's commandments. He warns against breaking or teaching others to break even the seemingly insignificant parts of the law. Society may overlook those who are considered least, but God values their obedience and faithfulness. Those who honor and teach the fullness of God's commands are regarded as great in His kingdom, while those who dismiss or undermine the importance of the law are seen as least worthy.
