# Matthew 5:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, Jesus addresses prevailing misconceptions regarding the Mosaic law and its interpretation by the Jewish teachers. He does not challenge the law itself but exposes the false and pernicious interpretations prevalent at the time. Jesus emphasizes that the true intent of the law is spiritual, extending beyond external actions to encompass thoughts and feelings. He seeks to contrast His teaching with the inadequate exposition of the law given by the ancients, bringing a better and deeper righteousness as the fulfillment and glorification of the law.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The contrasts here are not between the law misunderstood and the law rightly understood, but between the law and its ancient exposition, which in their letter, and as given, were κενά, and the same as spiritualized, πεπληρωμένα, by Christ."
2. "The above remarks comprise a brief answer to the important but somewhat misapprehended question, whether our Lord impugned the Mosaic law itself, or only its inadequate interpretation by the Jewish teachers?"
3. "There is no inconsistency in the above view with the assertion in Matthew 5:19: the just and holy and true law was necessarily restricted in meaning and degraded in position, until He came, whose office it was to fulfil and glorify it."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Nearly all who would translate 'to the ancients' take the speaker of the words quoted to be Moses in the law; 'the ancients' to be the people to whom Moses gave the law; and the intention of our Lord here to be to contrast His own teaching, more or less, with that of Moses; either as opposed to it—as some go the length of affirming—or at least as modifying, enlarging, elevating it."
2. "To us it seems as plain as possible that our Lord's one object is to contrast the traditional perversions of the law with the true sense of it as expounded by Himself."
3. "Thou shall not kill:—that is, This being all that the law requires, whosoever has imbrued his hands in his brother's blood, but he only, is guilty of a breach of this commandment."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Jesus proceeds here to comment on some prevailing opinions among the Jews; to show that the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees was defective; and that people needed a better righteousness, or they could not be saved."
2. "He did not set himself against the law of Moses, but against the false and pernicious interpretations of the law prevalent in his time."
3. "The comment of our Saviour shows that it was spiritual, and was designed to extend to the thoughts and feelings as well as the external act."

### John Calvin:
1. "It is a mistake, however, to suppose that this is an ἐπανόρθωσις, or correction of the Law, and that Christ raises his disciples to a higher degree of perfection, than Christ could raise a gross and carnal nation, which was scarcely able to learn first principles."
2. "But as the law had been corrupted by false expositions, and turned to a profane meaning, Christ vindicates it against such corruptions, and points out its true meaning, from which the Jews had departed."
3. "That Christ, on the other hand, intended to make no correction in the precepts of the law, is very clear from other passages: for to those who desire to enter into life by their good works, he gives no other injunction, than to keep the commandments of the law."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "As the passage is from the law, the indefinite phrase, ‘it was said,’ cannot be referred to a false teacher or author of tradition."
2. "Thou shalt not kill. From the Decalogue, the sixth commandment (Exodus 20:13), the first of the second table; the fifth belongs rather to the first table, containing duties to God."
3. "Whosoever shall kill, commit actual murder, shall be in danger of the judgment, i.e., subject to trial by an earthly court, probably the one in the place he lived."

### John Gill:
1. "To 'hear' was along with the recital of the text, to receive by tradition, the sense the elders had given of it." 
2. "Their rules for the judgment of such persons were these: 'everyone that kills his neighbour with his hand... such an one must be put to death by the house of judgment, or the sanhedrim.'"
3. "The phrase 'in danger of judgment' is the same as 'guilty of judgment', or deserves condemnation."

### John Wesley:
1. "Thou shalt do no murder - And they interpreted this, as all the other commandments, barely of the outward act." 
2. "The Jews had in every city a court of twenty-three men, who could sentence a criminal to be strangled."
3. "But the sanhedrim only (the great council which sat at Jerusalem, consisting of seventy-two men,) could sentence to the more terrible death of stoning."
