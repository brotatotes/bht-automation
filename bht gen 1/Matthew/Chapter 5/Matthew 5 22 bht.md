# Matthew 5:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, Jesus speaks with authority as the one lawgiver, surpassing the customs and traditions of the Pharisees. He emphasizes the importance of treating others with love and refraining from anger without a just reason. Jesus warns against the deadly consequences of unrighteous anger, comparing it to the punishment inflicted in the Valley of Hinnom, symbolizing the place of future punishment for the wicked. The verse calls for restraint in both actions and words, urging believers to cast aside hateful thoughts and treat every person as a brother.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The most important thing to keep in mind is, that there is no distinction of kind between these punishments, only of degree."
2. "All the punishments are spiritual; all result in eternal death; but with various degrees, as the degrees of guilt have been."
3. "The words here mentioned must not be superstitiously supposed to have any damning power in themselves, but to represent states of anger and hostility, for which an awful account hereafter must be given."

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "It is unreasonable to deny, as ALEXANDER does, that three degrees of punishment are here meant to be expressed, and to say that it is but a threefold expression of one and the same thing."
2. "All three clearly refer to divine retribution, and that alone, for breaches of this commandment; though this is expressed by an allusion to Jewish tribunals."
3. "Every age and every country has its modes of expressing such things; and no doubt our Lord seized on the then current phraseology of unholy disrespect and contempt, merely to express and condemn the different degrees of such feeling when brought out in words."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Jesus being God as well as man...had a right to expound [the law] or change it as he pleased...He therefore spoke here and elsewhere as having authority, and not as the scribes."
2. "Anger, or that feeling which we have when we are injured, is a natural feeling, given to us...What he condemns here is anger without a cause; that is, unjustly, rashly, hastily, where no offence has been given or intended."
3. "The word 'brother' here refers not merely to one to whom we are nearly related...but includes also a neighbor, or perhaps anyone with whom we may be associated...every man should be regarded and treated as a brother."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The word Gehenna, rendered hell, occurs outside of the Gospels only at James 3:6. It is the Greek representative of the Hebrew Ge - Hinnom, or Valley of Hinnom, a deep, narrow glen to the south of Jerusalem."
2. "From its depth and narrowness, and its fire and ascending smoke, it became the symbol of the place of the future punishment of the wicked."
3. "It should be carefully distinguished from Hades [αδης], which is never used for the place of punishment, but for the place of departed spirits, without reference to their moral condition."

### John Calvin:
1. "Now, as the Pharisees boasted of antiquity, Christ reminds the people of his authority, to which all antiquity ought justly to give way. Hence we conclude, that truth is of greater weight than custom or the number of years."
2. "He who shall say to his brother Christ assigns three degrees of condemnation besides the violence of the hands; which implies, that this precept of the law restrains not only the hands, but all affections that are opposed to brotherly love."
3. "Though Christ adjudges to the hell of fire none but those who break out into open reproach, we must not suppose, that he declares anger to be free from a similar punishment; but, alluding to earthly judgments, he assures them that God will judge and punish even concealed anger."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "But I say unto you. This implies equal authority with Him who gave the Decalogue, greater authority than those who expounded it."
2. "Thou fool. The Greek word implies 'stupid fool.' It may be a Hebrew expression (‘moreh’) containing a charge of wickedness and great impiety."
3. "General sense: murderous feelings and words are deemed a proper ground of condemnation in Christ’s kingdom."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Jesus thus assumes a tone of superiority over the Mosaic regulations and proves it in each of the six examples."
2. "Gehenna is the Valley of Hinnom where the fire burned continually. Here idolatrous Jews once offered their children to Molech."
3. "Jesus finds one cause of murder to be abusive language."

### John Gill:
1. "You say, that if one man kills another himself, he is to be put to death by the sanhedrim; and if he does it by proxy, he is to be left to the judgment of God, so wholly restraining the law to actual murder; but I affirm, that whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause, shall be in danger of judgment."
2. "By 'brother' is meant, not in a religious sense, one that is of the same faith, or in the same church state; nor, in a strict natural sense, one that is so in the bonds of consanguinity; but in a large sense, any man, of whatsoever country or nation: for we are to be angry with no man; that is, as is rightly added, without a cause."
3. "Calling a man by such names was not allowed of by the Jews themselves, whose rules are: 'he that calls his neighbour a servant, let him be excommunicated; a bastard, let him be beaten with forty stripes; "a wicked man", let him descend with him into his life or livelihood.'"
4. "The word γεεννα, here used, and which is often used in the New Testament for 'hell', is but the Hebrew גיא הנם, 'Ge-Hinnom', the valley of Hinnom, where the children were caused to pass through the fire to Moloch. This place, the Jewish writers say, 'Was a place well known, near to Jerusalem, a valley, whose fire was never quenched; and in which they burned the bones of anything that was unclean, and dead carcasses, and other pollutions.' Hence the word came to be used among them, as might be shown in innumerable instances, to express the place and state of the damned; and very fitly describes it."

### John Wesley:
1. "Who hath authority to use this language, but the one lawgiver, who is able to save and to destroy."
2. "We ought not, for any cause, to be angry at the person of the sinner, but at his sins only."
3. "Hell fire... a fit emblem of hell. It must here signify a degree of future punishment, as much more dreadful than those incurred in the two former cases."
