# Matthew 5:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, different commentators bring depth to the understanding of the passage. They discuss the severity of the punishment expressed in three degrees, emphasizing the divine retribution for breaking the commandment. The verse highlights Christ's authority to give these teachings, surpassing even those who explain the law. The commentators also emphasize the importance of not being angry at the person but rather at their sins. The mention of "hell fire" serves as a powerful symbol of the terrifying punishment awaiting those who break the commandment.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "It is unreasonable to deny, as ALEXANDER does, that three degrees of punishment are here meant to be expressed, and to say that it is but a threefold expression of one and the same thing."
2. "All three clearly refer to divine retribution, and that alone, for breaches of this commandment; though this is expressed by an allusion to Jewish tribunals."
3. "The spirit, then, of the whole statement may be thus given: 'For ages ye have been taught that the sixth commandment, for example, is broken only by the murderer... But I say unto you that it is broken even by causeless anger, which is but hatred in the bud, as hatred is incipient murder.'"

### Philip Schaff:
1. "But I say unto you. This implies equal authority with Him who gave the Decalogue, greater authority than those who expounded it."
2. "Thou fool. The Greek word implies 'stupid fool.' It may be a Hebrew expression containing a charge of wickedness and great impiety."
3. "General sense: murderous feelings and words are deemed a proper ground of condemnation in Christ's kingdom."

Note: The commentary is quite lengthy, so I had to condense it significantly to fit within the word limit.

### John Wesley:
1. "Who hath authority to use this language, but the one lawgiver, who is able to save and to destroy."
2. "We ought not, for any cause, to be angry at the person of the sinner, but at his sins only."
3. "Hell fire... a fit emblem of hell. It must here signify a degree of future punishment, as much more dreadful than those incurred in the two former cases, as burning alive is more dreadful than either strangling or stoning."
