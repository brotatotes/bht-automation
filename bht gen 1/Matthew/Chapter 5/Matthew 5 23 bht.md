# Matthew 5:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the importance of reconciliation is emphasized, as even acts of worship can be incomplete if there are unresolved conflicts with others. It is not enough to simply bring offerings before God, for true worship involves actively seeking reconciliation and peace with our brothers and sisters. Our relationships with others are intertwined with our relationship with God, and love should be the foundation for our interactions, as we strive to address grievances and make amends. It is through this process of reconciliation that true worship is achieved, where both vertical and horizontal reconciliation take place.
