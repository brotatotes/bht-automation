# Matthew 5:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we are urged to prioritize reconciliation with our brothers and sisters over any acts of worship or sacrifice. The commentators emphasize that seeking forgiveness and resolving conflicts is essential before presenting our offerings to God. They emphasize that acts of love and friendship are paramount, and that our gifts and prayers hold no value without a foundation of love. Reconciliation is the key to making our worship pleasing and meaningful in the eyes of God.

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The meaning evidently is—not, 'dismiss from thine own breast all ill feeling,' but 'get thy brother to dismiss from his mind all grudge against thee.'" 
2. "It is at this solemn moment, when about to cast himself upon divine mercy, and seek in his offering a seal of divine forgiveness, that the offerer is supposed, all at once, to remember that some brother has a just cause of complaint against him through breach of this commandment." 
3. "Before another step is taken—even before the offering is presented—this reconciliation is to be sought, though the gift have to be left unoffered before the altar."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "First be reconciled (πρωτον διαλλαγηθ). Second aorist passive imperative. Get reconciled (ingressive aorist, take the initiative)."
2. "The verb denotes mutual concession after mutual hostility, an idea absent from καταλλασσω."
3. "The boy is a poor speller, but with a broken heart he uses the identical form that Jesus does."

### John Gill:
1. "This shows, that acts of love and friendship are preferable to sacrifices; and that sacrifices offered up in wrath, and whilst unreconciled to others, are unacceptable to God, and of no avail."
2. "The day of atonement does not expiate any transgressions, but those that are between a man and God, as when one eats anything that is forbidden, and lies with anything that is forbidden, or the like; but transgressions which are between a man and his neighbour, as he that hurts his neighbour, or curses his neighbour, or steals from him, and the like, are never forgiven, until he has given his neighbour what he owed him, and has 'reconciled' him."
3. "He was to use all means to obtain a reconciliation, even bringing three friends to entreat the neighbor to forgive him."

### John Wesley:
1. "Neither thy gift nor thy prayer will atone for thy want of love."
2. "Love is the essential quality that gives true meaning and value to our offerings and prayers."
3. "Without love, our gifts and prayers become empty and meaningless in the eyes of God."
