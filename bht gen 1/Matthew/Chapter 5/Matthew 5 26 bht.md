## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "These words...amount to a negation of it, because the debt can never be discharged."
2. "ὑπηρέτης...must represent the chief of those who...are hinted at by βασανισταί, viz. the great enemy, the minister of the divine wrath."
3. "κοδράντην, quadrantem, a Latin word (= λεπτόν in Luke), the fourth part of an as."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "In expounding the sixth commandment, I have spoken of offenses between man and man reminding you that the offender has another party to deal with besides him whom he has wronged on earth, and assuring you that all worship offered to the Searcher of hearts by one who knows that a brother has just cause of complaint against him, and yet takes no steps to remove it, is vain."
2. "But I cannot pass from this subject without reminding you of One whose cause of complaint against you is far more deadly than any that man can have against man: and since with that Adversary you are already on the way to judgment, it will be your wisdom to make up the quarrel without delay, lest sentence of condemnation be pronounced upon you."
3. "The unending duration of future punishment—elsewhere so clearly and awfully expressed by our Lord Himself, as in Matthew 5:29; Matthew 5:30; Mark 9:43; Mark 9:48—is the only doctrine with which His language here quite naturally and fully accords."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Reconciliation with an offended brother in this life is absolutely necessary before his wrong cry against us to the Great Judge, and we be cast into eternal condemnation." (Alford) - This quote highlights the importance of seeking reconciliation with others before facing judgment.

2. "The warning against law-suits is evident enough, but is not the principal thought." - This quote suggests that the primary message of the verse is not about avoiding legal disputes, but rather about the consequences of unresolved conflicts.

3. "The main idea is the inexorable rigor of divine justice against the impenitent sinner." - This quote emphasizes the unwavering and strict nature of divine justice towards those who remain unrepentant.

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "The last farthing" is a vivid picture of inevitable punishment for debt.

2. "For ever, since thou canst never do this" - This quote highlights the impossibility of fully rectifying our wrongdoings on our own. It reminds us of our need for divine grace and mercy, as we are incapable of completely making amends for our sins.
