## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "In expounding the sixth commandment, I have spoken of offenses between man and man reminding you that the offender has another party to deal with besides him whom he has wronged on earth, and assuring you that all worship offered to the Searcher of hearts by one who knows that a brother has just cause of complaint against him, and yet takes no steps to remove it, is vain." 
2. "But I cannot pass from this subject without reminding you of One whose cause of complaint against you is far more deadly than any that man can have against man: and since with that Adversary you are already on the way to judgment, it will be your wisdom to make up the quarrel without delay, lest sentence of condemnation be pronounced upon you, and then will execution straightway follow, from the effects of which you shall never escape as long as any remnant of the offense remains unexpiated."
3. "The unending duration of future punishment is the only doctrine with which His language here quite naturally and fully accords."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Reconciliation with an offended brother in this life is absolutely necessary before his wrong cry against us to the Great Judge, and we be cast into eternal condemnation." (Alford)
2. "The warning against law-suits is evident enough, but is not the principal thought." 
3. "The main idea is the inexorable rigor of divine justice against the impenitent sinner."

### John Gill:
1. "Verily, I say unto thee,.... This may be depended upon, you may assure yourself of it." 
2. "that thou shalt by no means come out thence, from prison." 
3. "till thou hast paid the uttermost farthing, or 'last farthing'; which seems to express the inexorableness of the creditor, and the impossibility of the debtor's release."

### John Wesley:
1. "Till thou hast paid the last farthing" - This phrase implies that the debt of sin can never truly be repaid, emphasizing the eternal consequences of our actions.
2. "For ever, since thou canst never do this" - This highlights the impossibility of fully atoning for our sins on our own, underscoring our need for divine grace and forgiveness.
3. "What follows, to purity of heart" - This suggests that after addressing meekness, the focus shifts to the importance of cultivating a pure and sincere heart, which is essential for a deep and genuine relationship with God.
