## BHT:
In this verse, it is warned that anyone who looks at another person with the intention to lust is, in their heart, committing a sinful act. This commandment extends to all forms of impurity, addressing both the married and unmarried. While it may refer specifically to a wife, the scope of the verse can be understood more broadly. The heart's involvement in such sins is emphasized, highlighting that even inward desires can have damaging effects.

2. "The expressions, 'whosoever looketh,' and 'looketh upon a woman,' seem clearly to extend the range of this commandment to all forms of impurity."

3. "The counsels which follow—as they most certainly were intended for all, whether married or unmarried—seem to confirm this."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Our Lord declares, not that such an one shall be condemned, but that in his heart he has committed the sin."
