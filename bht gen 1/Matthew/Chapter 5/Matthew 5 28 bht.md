## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Our Lord is speaking of the sin of adultery, and therefore, however the saying may undoubtedly apply by implication to cases where this sin is out of the question e.g. to the impure beholding of an unmarried woman with a view to fornication...yet the direct assertion in this verse must be understood as applying to the cases where this sin is in question." 
2. "The gazing with a view to feed that desire (for so πρὸς τό with an inf. must mean)." 
3. "The man who can do this viz. ‘gaze with a view to feed unlawful desire’ has already in his heart passed the barrier of criminal intention; made up his mind, stifled his conscience; in thought, committed the deed."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The expressions, 'whosoever looketh,' and 'looketh upon a woman,' seem clearly to extend the range of this commandment to all forms of impurity."
2. "The counsels which follow—as they most certainly were intended for all, whether married or unmarried—seem to confirm this."
3. "As in dealing with the sixth commandment our Lord first expounds it, and then in the four following verses applies His exposition, so here He first expounds the seventh commandment, and then in the four following verses applies His exposition."

### John Calvin:
1. "The design of Christ was to condemn generally the lust of the flesh."
2. "This teaches us also, that not only those who form a deliberate purpose of fornication, but those who admit any polluted thoughts, are reckoned adulterers before God."
3. "The hypocrisy of the Papists, therefore, is too gross and stupid, when they affirm that lust is not a sin, until it gain the full consent of the heart."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Our Lord declares, not that such an one shall be condemned, but that in his heart he has committed the sin." 
2. "Adultery of the heart, and of the eye, desecrate the temple of the Holy Spirit; how much more adultery in deed." 
3. "A woman may mean a ‘wife,’ but the widest sense is not inappropriate."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "In his heart (εν τη καρδια αυτου). Not just the centre of the blood circulation though it means that. Not just the emotional part of man's nature, but here the inner man including the intellect, the affections, the will."

2. "Jesus locates adultery in the eye and heart before the outward act."

3. "Passions lodge only in him who sees."

### John Gill:

2. "A good thought, they allow, is reckoned as if done; but an evil thought, the holy blessed God does not account of it as if done."
3. "Some of them have gone so far as to say that 'everyone that looks upon a woman with intention, it is all one as if he lay with her.'"
