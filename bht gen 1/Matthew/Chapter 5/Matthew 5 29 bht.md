# Matthew 5:29 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we are given a powerful admonition to resist and overcome the first springs of evil desires, even if it means sacrificing what is most precious and dear to us. We are called to exercise self-denial and self-control, cutting off anything that causes us to stumble or become ensnared in sin. By rejecting anything that hinders our pursuit of God and submitting ourselves to His commandments, we show our true understanding of self-interest and ultimate gain in eternal life.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "An admonition, arising out of the truth announced in the last verse, to withstand the first springs and occasions of evil desire, even by the sacrifice of what is most useful and dear to us."
2. "He [Philo Judæus] had heard ἀπὸ θεσπεσίων ἀνδρῶν an interpretation of Deuteronomy 25:12, singularly agreeing with this verse: εἰκότως οὖν τὴν … χεῖρα.… ἀποκόπτειν διείρηται συμβολικῶς, οὐχ ὅπως ἀκρωτηριάζηται τὸ σῶμα στερόμενον ἀναγκαιοτάτου μέρους, ἀλλʼ ὑπὲρ τοῦ πάντας τῆς ψυχῆς ἀθέους τέμνειν λογισμούς."
3. "We may observe here, that our Lord grounds His precept of the most rigid and decisive self-denial on the considerations of the truest self-interest, συμφέρελ σοι."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "And if thy right eye—the readier and the dearer of the two. offend thee—be a 'trap spring,' or as in the New Testament, be 'an occasion of stumbling' to thee. pluck it out and cast it from thee—implying a certain indignant promptitude, heedless of whatever cost to feeling the act may involve."
2. "For as one might put out his eyes without in the least quenching the lust to which they ministered, so, 'if thine eye be single, thy whole body shall be full of light,' and, when directed by a holy mind, becomes an 'instrument of righteousness unto God.'"
3. "He who despises the warning to cast from him, with indignant promptitude, an offending member, will find his whole body 'cast,' with a retributive promptitude of indignation, 'into hell.'"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "An evil eye denotes sometimes envy... and sometimes an evil passion, or sin in general."
2. "The right eye and hand are mentioned, because they are of most use to us, and denote that, however strong the passion may be, or difficult to part with, yet that we should do it."
3. "His design was to teach that the dearest objects, if they cause us to sin, are to be abandoned; that by all sacrifices and self-denials we must overcome the evil propensities of our nature, and resist our wanton imaginations."
4. "It is better to deny yourself the gratification of an evil passion here, however much it may cost you, than to go down to hell forever."
5. "The sinner will be sent there as he is, with every evil desire, every unsubdued propensity, every wicked and troublesome passion, and yet with no possibility of gratification."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The Rev., by restoring the picture in the word, restores its true meaning, causeth to stumble."
2. "The kindred noun is skandalon, a later form of skandalhqron, the stick in a trap on which the bait is place, and which springs up and shuts the trap at the touch of an animal."
3. "Christ's meaning here is: 'If your eye or your hand serve as an obstacle or trap to ensnare or make you fall in your moral walk.'"

### John Calvin:
1. "However difficult, or severe, or troublesome, or harsh, any commandment of God may be, yet no excuse ought to be pleaded on those grounds, because the justice of God ought to stand higher in our estimation, than all that we reckon most precious and valuable."
2. "You have no right to object to me, that you can scarcely turn your eyes in any direction, without being suddenly drawn away by some temptation: for you ought rather to part with your eyes, than to depart from the commandments of God."
3. "Whatever hinders us from yielding that obedience to God which he requires in his law, ought to be cut off."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "We should resist ‘the first springs and occasions of evil desire, even by the sacrifice of what is most useful and dear to us.’"
2. "The surgeon does not hesitate to amputate a limb, if he hopes thereby to save a life; no earthly sacrifice is too great where eternal life is concerned."
3. "Such self-denial is true self-interest, as all virtue is, could we but so understand it. However ‘profitable,’ the overcoming of sin is painful."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Causeth thee to stumble (σκανδαλιζε σε). This is far better than the Authorized Version 'Offend thee.' Braid Scots has it rightly 'ensnare ye.' It is not the notion of giving offence or provoking, but of setting a trap or snare for one."
2. "Pluck out the eye when it is a snare, cut off the hand, even the right hand. These vivid pictures are not to be taken literally, but powerfully plead for self-mastery."
3. "It is not mutilating of the body that Christ enjoins, but control of the body against sin. The man who plays with fire will get burnt."

### John Gill:
1. "Our Lord has no regard here to near and dear relations seeking to alienate us from God and Christ, and hinder us in the pursuit of divine things; whose solicitations are to be rejected with the utmost indignation, and they themselves to be parted with, and forsaken, rather than complied with."
2. "The eye is often the instrument of ensnaring the heart this way: hence the Jews have a saying, 'whoever looks upon women, at the end comes into the hands of transgression.'"
3. "Persons should make a covenant with their eyes, as Job did; and turn them away from beholding such objects, which may tend to excite impure thoughts and desires; deny themselves the gratification of the sense of seeing, or feeding the eyes with such sights, as are graceful to the flesh."
