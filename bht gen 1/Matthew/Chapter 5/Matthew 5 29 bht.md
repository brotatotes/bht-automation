# Matthew 5:29 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, our Lord emphasizes the importance of having a pure and holy mind, for it determines the way we perceive and act in the world. He warns of the severe consequences of holding onto sinful habits and urges us to take drastic measures to avoid them. We should not only remove the external temptations but also address the sinful desires within us. By resisting the first springs and occasions of evil desire, even through sacrificing what is most useful and dear to us, we are truly pursuing self-interest and eternal life.
