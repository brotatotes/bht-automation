# Matthew 5:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Bible verse being described emphasizes the blessedness of those who are poor in spirit, not in material wealth. According to commentators, being poor in spirit means having a humble opinion of oneself, acknowledging one's spiritual needs and dependency on God's grace. It signifies recognizing our universal destitution and casting ourselves upon God's compassion. This verse contrasts the idea of happiness achieved through worldly success with the concept of true blessedness, which comes from a deep awareness of our spiritual poverty and reliance on God.
