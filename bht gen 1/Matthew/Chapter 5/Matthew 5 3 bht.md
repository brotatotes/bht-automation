# Matthew 5:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Blessed are those who, in their deepest consciousness, realize their entire need and submit themselves wholly to God, acknowledging their spiritual poverty and emptiness. Their humility and awareness of their need for God's provision lays the foundation for all spiritual excellence. These individuals, though lacking in worldly riches, possess the kingdom of heaven, for the very sense of their poverty is already a form of riches. Their self-emptying conviction leads to the hope of eternal life and a place in the heavenly kingdom.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "The poor in spirit...are those who in their deepest consciousness realize their entire need."
2. "This self-emptying conviction, that 'before God we are void of everything,' lies at the foundation of all spiritual excellence."
3. "The poor in spirit not only shall have - they already have - the kingdom. The very sense of their poverty is begun riches."

Note: The commentary is quite lengthy, so I have chosen three quotes that capture the essence of the author's explanation of the phrase "poor in spirit."

### John Calvin:
1. "Christ pronounces those to be happy who, chastened and subdued by afflictions, submit themselves wholly to God, and, with inward humility, betake themselves to him for protection."
2. "Others explain the poor in spirit to be those who claim nothing for themselves, and are even so completely emptied of confidence in the flesh, that they acknowledge their poverty."
3. "We see that Christ does not swell the minds of his own people by any unfounded belief, or harden them by unfeeling obstinacy, as the Stoics do, but leads them to entertain the hope of eternal life, and animates them to patience by assuring them, that in this way they will pass into the heavenly kingdom of God."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The poor in spirit, not 'in body,' nor 'in mind.' The humble, those conscious of their spiritual needs, and thus prepared to be filled with the riches of the gospel."
2. "The fruit of the law and the germ of the gospel. The Jews with their carnal hopes were not 'poor in spirit,' hence the appropriateness of the introduction."
3. "Pride is always the first and great hindrance to obtaining a part in the kingdom."
4. "For theirs is. It belongs to them."
5. "The kingdom of heaven. See notes on chap. Matthew 3:2; comp. chap. 13. Both the habits of the Teacher and the expectations of the audience made this a familiar thought."

### John Gill:
1. "Blessed are the poor in spirit, not the poor in purse, or who are so with respect to things temporal."
2. "All mankind are spiritually poor; they have nothing to eat that is fit and proper; nor any clothes to wear, but rags; nor are they able to purchase either; they have no money to buy with."
3. "Now these are the persons intended in this place; who are not only 'poor', but are poor 'in spirit'; in their own spirits, in their own sense, apprehension, and judgment."
