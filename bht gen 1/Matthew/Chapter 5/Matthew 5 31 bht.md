# Matthew 5:31 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse being described emphasizes the seriousness and solemnity of divorce, which was intended as a last resort, according to commentator John Wesley. The distortion of the law by the scribes and Pharisees allowed for trivial reasons for divorce, undermining the sanctity of marriage, as pointed out by Wesley. Upholding the sacredness of marriage and the commitment it entails is a key message, reminding us that divorce should not be taken lightly but approached with careful consideration and understanding of its impact on individuals and families.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "The law of divorce—according to its strictness or laxity—has so intimate a bearing upon purity in the married life, that nothing could be more natural than to pass from the seventh commandment to the loose views on that subject then current."
2. "The one legitimate ground of divorce allowed by the enactment just quoted was 'some uncleanness'—in other words, conjugal infidelity."
3. "But while one school of interpreters (that of SHAMMAI) explained this quite correctly, as prohibiting divorce in every case save that of adultery, another school (that of HILLEL) stretched the expression so far as to include everything in the wife offensive or disagreeable to the husband—a view of the law too well fitted to minister to caprice and depraved inclination not to find extensive favor."

### John Calvin:
1. "Divorces, which husbands were wont to give to their wives, had not been prohibited by Moses as to external order, but only, for the sake of restraining lewdness, he had ordered that 'a bill of divorcement' should be given to the wives who were put away." 

2. "Hence proceeded the error, that there was nothing wrong in such putting away, provided that the forms of law were observed. But they did wrong in viewing as a matter of civil law, the rule which had been given them for a devout and holy life." 

3. "Christ, therefore, admonishes us not to conclude, that what is allowed by the national law of Moses is, on that account, lawful in the sight of God. That man, (says he,) who puts away his wife, and gives her a bill of divorcement, shelters himself under the pretense of the law: but the bond of marriage is too sacred to be dissolved at the will, or rather at the licentious pleasure, of men."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Loose notions about divorce indicate and increase unchastity."
2. "Our Lord says...that even this precept was owing to the hardness of their hearts."
3. "The writing of divorcement, designed not to encourage divorce, but to render it more difficult, was in effect a protection of the repudiated wife."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "A writing of divorcement, 'a divorce certificate,' 'a written notice of divorce'... The written notice (βιβλιον) was a protection to the wife against an angry whim of the husband who might send her away with no paper to show for it."

2. "The Greek is an abbreviation of βιβλιον αποστασιου... The papyri use συγγραφη αποστασιου in commercial transactions as 'a bond of release.'"

3. "The written notice (βιβλιον) was a protection to the wife against an angry whim of the husband who might send her away with no paper to show for it."

### John Gill:
1. "The case of divorce was not any law of Moses, or of God by him; but only a permission, because of the hardness of the hearts of the Jews."
2. "The controversy about the causes of divorce...was a new thing, just started in the time of Christ."
3. "The form of a writing of divorcement...was by giving her a bill...filled up in proper form."

### John Wesley:
1. "The act of giving a writing of divorce was not intended to be a casual or trivial matter, but rather a serious and solemn decision. It was meant to be a last resort, a legal document that would dissolve the marriage and protect the rights of both parties involved." 

2. "The scribes and Pharisees had distorted the original intent of the law, allowing men to divorce their wives for any trivial reason. This undermined the sanctity of marriage and disregarded the emotional and relational consequences of such actions." 

3. "The verse highlights the importance of upholding the sacredness of marriage and the commitment that it entails. It serves as a reminder that divorce should not be taken lightly, but rather approached with careful consideration and a genuine understanding of the impact it has on individuals and families."
