## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "The law of divorce - according to its strictness or laxity - has so intimate a bearing upon purity in the married life, that nothing could be more natural than to pass from the seventh commandment to the loose views on that subject then current."
2. "The one legitimate ground of divorce allowed by the enactment just quoted was 'some uncleanness' - in other words, conjugal infidelity."
3. "But while one school of interpreters explained this quite correctly, as prohibiting divorce in every case save that of adultery, another school stretched the expression so far as to include everything in the wife offensive or disagreeable to the husband - a view of the law too well fitted to minister to caprice and depraved inclination not to find extensive favor."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Loose notions about divorce indicate and increase unchastity."
2. "Our Lord says elsewhere...that even this precept was owing to the hardness of their hearts."
3. "The writing of divorcement, designed not to encourage divorce, but to render it more difficult, was in effect a protection of the repudiated wife."

### John Gill:
1. "The case of divorce was not any law of Moses, or of God by him; but only a permission, because of the hardness of the hearts of the Jews."
2. "The controversy about the causes of divorce was a new thing, just started in the time of Christ."
3. "The form of a writing of divorcement was a bill that allowed a husband to dismiss and divorce his wife, giving her the freedom to marry any other man she pleased."

### John Wesley:
1. "The writing of divorce was a legal document that allowed men to dissolve their marriages on any trivial grounds, as permitted by the scribes and Pharisees." 

2. "This verse highlights the ease with which divorce was granted in that time, emphasizing the need for a deeper understanding of the commitment and sanctity of marriage." 

3. "By mentioning the permission granted by the scribes and Pharisees, the verse implies a critique of their lax interpretation of the law and their disregard for the sacredness of marriage."
