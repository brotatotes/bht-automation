# Matthew 5:34 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This verse emphasizes the solemnity and certainty of the speaker's words, suggesting a strong affirmation or oath. It prohibits all forms of profanity, including swearing by heaven, as it is considered to be sitting on God's throne. While it does not completely prohibit all oaths, it cautions against unnecessary swearing, as there are other ways of taking the name of God in vain. It is a violation of divine majesty to swear by anything other than God Himself and to involve Him in thoughtless and rash oaths.

### John Calvin:
1. "The Jews had circuitous or indirect ways of swearing: and when they swore by heaven, or by earth, or by the altar, they reckoned it to be next to nothing; and, as one vice springs from another, they defended, under this pretense, any profanation of the name of God that was not openly avowed."
2. "His statement amounts to this, that there are other ways of 'taking the name of God in vain,' besides perjury; and, therefore, that we ought to refrain from allowing ourselves the liberty of unnecessary swearing: for, when there are just reasons to demand it, the law not only permits, but expressly commands us to swear."
3. "It is a corruption allied to idolatry, when we appeal to them either as having a right to judge, or authority to prove testimony: for we must look at the object of swearing. It is an appeal which men make to God to revenge falsehood, and to uphold truth. This honor cannot be transferred to another, without committing an outrage on the divine majesty."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The prohibition is absolute for private and social life, and also for the kingdom of heaven, for which alone Christ legislates here."

2. "The reason why it is forbidden by Christ to swear by heaven is, for it is God's throne; referring to Isaiah 66:1 where he sits, the glory of his majesty shines forth, and is itself glorious and excellent, and not to be mentioned in a vain way."
3. "They doubly sinned, first, by openly swearing by that which is God's creature; and then, by tacitly bringing God into their rash and vain oaths."
