# Matthew 5:35 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This Bible verse emphasizes the transcendence of God and the importance of worshiping Him rather than earthly things or places. It reminds us that the earth is merely a physical manifestation of God's power and presence, symbolized by it being His footstool. Likewise, while Jerusalem holds religious significance, our devotion should ultimately be directed towards God as the supreme authority. The mention of Jerusalem in oaths adds solemnity due to its association with the great King, but our commitment should be to God alone.
