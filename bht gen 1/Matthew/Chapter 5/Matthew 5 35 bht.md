# Matthew 5:35 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
These verses remind us that true worship is not rooted in physical locations or objects, but rather in recognizing and honoring the greatness and authority of God. The earth, though a physical manifestation of His presence and power, should not be worshipped. Likewise, Jerusalem, as the city of the great King and a symbol of God's sovereignty, should not be worshipped. Instead, our worship should be directed towards God Himself, acknowledging His greatness and authority. The significance of an oath is derived from the relationship of the earth to God, and turning towards Jerusalem adds to its solemnity.
