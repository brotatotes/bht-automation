## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:

2. "Thou swearest then by a creature of God, whose destinies and changes are in God’s hand."
3. "Every oath is an appeal to God."

These quotes highlight the lack of control we have over certain aspects of our lives, the recognition of God's sovereignty over all things, and the significance of oaths as appeals to God.

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Neither shalt thou swear by thy head, because thou canst not make one hair white or black." - This quote highlights the futility of swearing by one's own head, emphasizing that we have no control over even the smallest details of our appearance.

2. "God's name was profaned quite as really as if His name had been uttered." - This quote explains that even though God's name may not be explicitly mentioned, swearing by His creations or attributes still profanes His name.

3. "The objection lies in their being 'beyond our control' and therefore profanely assumed to have a stability which they have not." - This quote points out that swearing by things beyond our control, like our own head, falsely assumes a stability and authority that they do not possess.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "To swear by the head was the same as to swear by the life; or to say, I will forfeit my life if what I say is not true."
2. "God is the Author of the life, and to swear by that, therefore, is the same as to swear by him."
3. "You have no control or right over your own life. You cannot even change one single hair. God has all that control; and it is therefore improper and profane to pledge what is God’s gift and God’s property; and it is the same as swearing by God himself."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "No man can create a hair of his head, or even transform its color; what solemnity, then, in such an oath."
2. "To swear by what is under God’s control alone, is to swear by Him, and that in a very roundabout and senseless way."

### John Wesley:
1. "Thou canst not make one hair white or black" - This verse highlights the limited power of humans in altering their physical appearance. It reminds us that our control over our lives is ultimately subject to the sovereignty of God.

2. "Whereby it appears, that this also is not thine but God's" - This statement emphasizes the divine authority over every aspect of our existence, including our physical attributes. It humbles us and reminds us of our dependence on God for all things.
