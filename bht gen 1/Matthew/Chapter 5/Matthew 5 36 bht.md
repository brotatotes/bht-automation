1. "Neither shalt thou swear by thy head, because thou canst not make one hair white or black" - This verse reminds us that we have no control over the color of our hair, highlighting the futility of making oaths by something beyond our control.
2. "God's name was profaned quite as really as if His name had been uttered" - The commentary emphasizes that even though God's name may not be directly mentioned, using other terms related to Him still profanes His name.

2. "God is the Author of the life, and to swear by that, therefore, is the same as to swear by him."
