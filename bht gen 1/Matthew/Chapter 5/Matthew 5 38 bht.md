# Matthew 5:38 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, various commentators shed light on the principle of "an eye for an eye" or "jus talionis" found in the Old Testament. They explain that this principle was meant to deter unchecked vengeance and establish fair compensation for injuries. However, they note that it had been perverted in different ways, from allowing private revenge to excessive monetary compensation. Ultimately, these commentators emphasize that Jesus, in his teachings, calls for a different approach of meekness, love, and patient endurance in the face of persecution.
