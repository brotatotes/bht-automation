# Matthew 5:38 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, Jesus addresses the misunderstood concept of "an eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth" from the Old Testament law. Commentators emphasize that this principle originally served as a judicial guideline to limit vengeance and promote just compensation. However, over time, it became distorted, allowing for excessive retaliation and personal retribution. Jesus corrects this misinterpretation by teaching that His followers should exhibit meekness, love, and patience, even when faced with persecution or harm. He emphasizes the importance of seeking reconciliation and avoiding an attitude of bitter revenge.

2. "Now our Lord here, does not find fault with the law of retaliation, as delivered by Moses, but with the false gloss of the Scribes and Pharisees; who, as they interpreted it of pecuniary mulcts, as a compensation for the loss of a member, which sometimes exceeded all just and due bounds; so they applied it to private revenge, and in favour of it."
