# Matthew 5:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Blessed are those who mourn, for their spiritual poverty compels them to grieve over sin and its effects. This mourning is not a superficial sorrow, but a deep and sincere lamentation that acknowledges the power of sin and longs for forgiveness and redemption. In this state of mourning, they find comfort through the gospel, which offers forgiveness and hope for a better world. This promise of comfort comes not from ourselves, but from God, who wipes away every tear and grants us the peace that surpasses all understanding.
