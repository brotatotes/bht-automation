# Matthew 5:40 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the principle of generosity is highlighted, as it encourages going above and beyond in giving, even when faced with legal disputes. The commandment to give one's cloak in addition to their coat reveals a sacrificial nature of giving, emphasized by the fact that the cloak is the more costly and valuable outer garment. The verse also urges against a vindictive spirit, emphasizing the importance of not engaging in quarrels or wrangling, but instead willingly yielding, even to the point of being stripped naked, rather than becoming involved in a litigious broil.
