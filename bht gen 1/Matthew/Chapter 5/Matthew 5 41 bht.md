# Matthew 5:41 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we are urged to go a step further, even if compelled to do so, to show a willingness to submit to unreasonable demands. Commentators mention how this practice references the Roman and Persian custom of pressing people and beasts into service. It is emphasized that enduring double hardship, even in unjust situations, is valuable for the sake of peace. The advice to comply rather than quarrel is seen as an admirable approach, even acknowledged in a blasphemous Jewish text.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "And whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile, go with him twain—an allusion, probably, to the practice of the Romans and some Eastern nations, who, when government despatches had to be forwarded, obliged the people not only to furnish horses and carriages, but to give personal attendance, often at great inconvenience, when required." 

2. "But the thing here demanded is a readiness to submit to unreasonable demands of whatever kind, rather than raise quarrels, with all the evils resulting from them." 

3. "What follows is a beautiful extension of this precept."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "This word throws the whole injunction into a picture which is entirely lost to the English reader."
2. "A man is travelling, and about to pass a post-station, where horses and messengers are kept in order to forward royal missives as quickly as possible."
3. "The word is of Persian origin, and denotes the impressment into service, which officials were empowered to make of any available persons or beasts on the great lines of road where the royal mails were carried by relays of riders."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Impress thee. The word is borrowed from the Persian, and refers to couriers pressing men and beasts into the public service, a matter very obnoxious to the Jews; it includes also the quartering of soldiers, and military requisitions, etc." 
2. "A mile, a thousand Roman paces, about 1,520 yards (less than an English mile), but the proportion, one to two, is the main point." 
3. "Endure double hardship, even when it seems most unjust, rather than angrily refuse."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The word is of Persian origin and means public couriers or mounted messengers (αγγαρο) who were stationed by the King of Persia at fixed localities, with horses ready for use, to send royal messages from one to another."
2. "So if a man is passing such a post-station, an official may rush out and compel him to go back to another station to do an errand for the king."
3. "This very thing was done to Simon of Cyrene who was thus compelled to carry the cross of Christ."

### John Gill:
1. "Christ advises, rather than to contend and quarrel with such a person, that obliges to go with him a mile, to go with him twain: his meaning is, not to dispute such a matter, though it may be somewhat laborious and disagreeable, but comply, for the sake of peace."
2. "The Jews, in their blasphemous book of the birth of Christ, own that he gave advice in such words as these."
3. "Can a Jew find fault with this advice?"
