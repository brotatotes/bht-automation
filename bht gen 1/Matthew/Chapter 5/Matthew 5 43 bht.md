# Matthew 5:43 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, Jesus challenges the prevailing belief that one should love their neighbor but hate their enemy, denouncing the addition made by corrupt teachers. He expands the concept of neighborly love to encompass all mankind, emphasizing the need to separate from those in rebellion against God. This command, rooted in Leviticus, extends beyond those who are kind or deserving, embracing all individuals as neighbors. Jesus' teachings contradict the rabbinical inference of hating enemies, urging instead to show kindness and pray for them, exemplifying love even towards persecutors.
