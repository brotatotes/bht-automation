# Matthew 5:43 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse being described is a combination of God's commandment to love our neighbor and an addition made by the scribes, who interpreted it as a license to hate our enemies. This misinterpretation led to a corrupted understanding of neighborly love and a breeding of hatred against enemies. However, Jesus, in his teaching and example, opposed this interpretation and emphasized the broader sense of neighborly love that extends to all mankind. This verse serves as a reminder to focus on the core message of love for our neighbors and to discern between God's true commandments and human additions.
