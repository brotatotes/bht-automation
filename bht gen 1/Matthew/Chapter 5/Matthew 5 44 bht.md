# Matthew 5:44 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we are called to love even our enemies. Commentators explain that this love extends beyond personal affection and encompasses a moral love for the well-being of others. It challenges us to refrain from seeking revenge, but rather to respond with blessings and good deeds towards those who mistreat us. The verse serves as a reminder of the example set by Jesus, who exemplified these teachings in his own life. It prompts us to show love not only through our words, but also through our actions, seeking the good of our enemies and promoting peace and reconciliation.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The word here used denotes moral love, as distinguished from the other word, which expresses personal affection."
2. "Usually, the former denotes 'complacency in the character' of the person loved; but here it denotes the benignant, compassionate outgoings of desire for another's good."
3. "The best commentary on these matchless counsels is the bright example of Him who gave them."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It is impossible to love the conduct of a person who curses and reviles us, who injures our person or property, or who violates all the laws of God; but, though we may hate his conduct, and suffer keenly when we are affected by it, yet we may still wish well to the person; we may pity his madness and folly; we may speak kindly of him and to him; we may return good for evil; we may aid him in the time of trial; we may seek to do him good here and to promote his eternal welfare hereafter." 

2. "The word 'bless' here means to 'speak well of' or 'speak well to:' - not to curse again or to slander, but to speak of those things which we can commend in an enemy; or, if there is nothing that we can commend, to say nothing about him."

3. "The word thus translated means, first, to injure by prosecution in law; then, wantonly and unjustly to accuse, and to injure in any way. This seems to be its meaning here."

### John Calvin:
1. "Love your enemies. This single point includes the whole of the former doctrine: for he who shall bring his mind to love those who hate him, will naturally refrain from all revenge, will patiently endure evils, will be much more prone to assist the wretched."
2. "We learn from these words, how far believers ought to be removed from every kind of revenge: for they are not only forbidden to ask it from God, but are commanded to banish and efface it from their minds so completely, as to bless their enemies."
3. "It is very difficult, indeed, and altogether contrary to the disposition of the flesh, to render good for evil. But our vices and weakness ought not to be pleaded as an apology. We ought simply to inquire, what is demanded by the law of charity: for, if we rely on the heavenly power of the Spirit, we shall encounter successfully all that is opposed to it in our feelings."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The controlling principle, literally and universally applicable."
2. "The law of love, once deemed applicable only to those of the same nation, is now declared valid towards all men, even personal enemies."
3. "By his very hatred our enemy becomes our neighbor; his hatred tempts to retaliation, leaving us no choice but to fall or else defend ourselves with the weapons of love."

### John Gill:
1. "All men, even enemies, are to be loved with a natural love, as men; though they cannot be loved with a spiritual affection, as brethren in Christ."
2. "When wicked men curse you, as Shimei cursed David, do not 'render evil for evil, or railing for railing, but contrariwise, blessing'; give good words, use kind language, mild and soft expressions."
3. "Do not make returns in the same way, but on the contrary, do them all the good you can; perform all the kind offices that lie in your power; let them partake of your bounty and liberality."

### John Wesley:
1. "Bless them that curse you" - This verse encourages us to respond to those who speak evil of us with words of blessing and kindness, rather than retaliating with more negativity. It challenges us to rise above the hatred and show love even to those who mistreat us.

2. "Repay love in thought, word, and deed, to those who hate you" - This quote emphasizes the importance of not only thinking and speaking positively about our enemies, but also taking actions that demonstrate love towards them. It reminds us that love is not just a feeling, but a choice we make in our thoughts, words, and actions.

3. "Show it both in word and deed" - This phrase highlights the need for consistency in our expression of love towards those who hate us. It reminds us that our words alone are not enough; we must also back them up with tangible acts of kindness and forgiveness.
