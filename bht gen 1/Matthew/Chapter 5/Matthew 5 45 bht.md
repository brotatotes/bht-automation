# Matthew 5:45 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse encourages us to rise above the world's view of revenge and exclusive dealing, imitating the righteous Judge who blesses even the ungrateful and evil. By showing kindness to enemies, we resemble God and reveal ourselves to be His children. It is not enough to claim sonship; we must prove it by our actions. Just as God freely gives His blessings to all, regardless of their character, we should give benefits even to the unthankful.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The more we lift ourselves above the world’s view of the duty and expediency of revenge and exclusive dealing, into the mind with which the ‘righteous Judge, strong and patient, who is provoked every day,’ yet does good to the unthankful and evil, the more firmly shall we assure, and the more nobly illustrate, our place as sons in His family." 
2. "Do not hate the one who does evil to you, as he is the cause of so much good to you and brings you such honor. Do not curse the one who provokes you, for you have endured the pain and been deprived of the fruit. You will bear the loss, but lose the reward, which is the ultimate folly, to endure the greater hardship and not bear the lesser." 
3. "If you imitate the gods, give benefits even to the ungrateful, for the sun rises on the wicked and the seas are open to pirates."
