# Matthew 5:46 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the commentators shed light on the significance of loving those who love us. They explain that simply loving those who love us is not commendable, as it is a selfish and natural response. The commentators provide insight into the context of the publicans, who were tax collectors seen as oppressors and despised by the Jews. These publicans had a reputation for extortion, cruelty, and a dissolute lifestyle. The verse challenges the Pharisees' limited love and calls for a higher love that extends beyond self-interest.
