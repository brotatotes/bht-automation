# Matthew 5:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, commentators emphasize that the meekness Jesus describes goes beyond mere lowliness or outward humility. It is a quality born out of a renewed nature and a sense of humility before God. Meekness requires patience and the ability to receive injuries without seeking revenge. It is a gentle and mild disposition, yet rooted in strength and poise. The promise of inheriting the earth is not limited to worldly possessions, but extends to enjoying all that God provides, both in this life and in the future.
