# Matthew 5:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Blessed are those who possess meekness, a gentle and humble disposition, as they inherit not only the earth, but also the promised land of Canaan, which symbolizes true and lasting blessings. Meekness is not merely a moral virtue but a Christian grace, pleasing to God. Holding their passions and affections in balance, the meek find rest and soul satisfaction in Christ, as they are comforted, directed, and rewarded by God's abundant grace and future glory. They shall have all they need for life and godliness, both in this present age and in the new earth to come.

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "It is impossible, indeed, that 'the poor in spirit' and 'the mourners' in Zion should not at the same time be 'meek'; that is to say, persons of a lowly and gentle carriage."
2. "But He who had no such affecting reasons for manifesting this beautiful carriage, said, nevertheless, of Himself, 'Take My yoke upon you, and learn of Me for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls.'"
3. "The earth' which the meek are to inherit might be rendered 'the land'—bringing out the more immediate reference to Canaan as the promised land, the secure possession of which was to the Old Testament saints the evidence and manifestation of God's favor resting on them, and the ideal of all true and abiding blessedness."

### Philip Schaff:

2. "Meekness is to be considered, not as a moral virtue, but as a Christian grace, a fruit of the Spirit of God."
3. "Such who are possessed of [meekness], and exercise it, are well pleasing to God; when disconsolate, he comforts them; when hungry, he satisfies them; when they want direction, he gives it to them; when wronged, he will do them right; he gives them more grace here, and glory hereafter."
