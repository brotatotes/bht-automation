# Matthew 5:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Blessed are those who passionately seek righteousness and holiness, craving spiritual blessings and a deep longing for God's approval and conformity to His will. This hunger and thirst arise from a sense of spiritual need, a recognition of our lack of righteousness. Those who earnestly pursue this righteousness will not be disappointed, for they will be abundantly satisfied and filled with the righteousness they desire and all other good things that come as a result.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "From this verse," says THOLUCK, "the reference to the Old Testament background ceases." Surprising! On the contrary, none of these beatitudes is more manifestly dug out of the rich mine of the Old Testament.
2. But what is the precise meaning of "righteousness" here? ... it is clearly to be taken—as in 2 Corinthians 5:21- : also—in a much wider sense, as denoting that spiritual and entire conformity to the law of God, under the want of which the saints groan, and the possession of which constitutes the only true saintship.
3. As hunger and thirst are the keenest of our appetites, our Lord, by employing this figure here, plainly means "those whose deepest cravings are after spiritual blessings." And in the Old Testament we find this craving variously expressed.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Nothing would better express the strong desire which we ought to feel to obtain righteousness than hunger and thirst."
2. "An ardent desire for anything is often represented in the Scriptures by hunger and thirst."
3. "Those who are perishing for want of righteousness; those who feel that they are lost sinners and strongly desire to be holy, shall be thus satisfied."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The righteousness, i.e., God's; something without us, given to us, not merely imputed to us, though that is included, but made ours, part of our life, as food is assimilated."
2. "A still stronger representation of the sense of spiritual need, advancing to positive longing, for a blessing, known to be the one needed, namely, God's approval conformity to the will of God."
3. "Those thus hungering are blessed, for they shall be filled, shall get in abundance what they want."

### John Gill:
1. "Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst, not after the riches, honours, and pleasures of this world, but after righteousness."
2. "To 'hunger and thirst' after this, supposes a want of righteousness, which is the case of all men; a sense of want of it, which is only perceived by persons spiritually enlightened."
3. "Happy souls are these, for they shall be filled: with that righteousness, and with all other good things, in consequence of it."
