# Matthew 5:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Blessed are those who show compassion and kindness towards others, especially those in need or suffering. By imitating God's character of mercy and compassion, we reflect His love to the world. This reciprocal nature of mercy means that those who show mercy will receive mercy in return, not only from God but also from those around them. As we extend mercy to others, we can expect to receive abundant grace and mercy in our own lives, both from God and from our fellow human beings.
