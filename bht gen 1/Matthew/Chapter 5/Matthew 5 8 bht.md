# Matthew 5:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Bible verse being described speaks of the importance of purity of heart and the joy that comes from experiencing God's presence. Commentators emphasize how inward purity, beyond outer appearance, is valued by God. They explain that this purity leads to a clear vision of God and a transformation into God's likeness. The verse encourages us to seek holiness, for without it, we cannot fully experience the Lord or enjoy the Beatific Vision.
