# Matthew 5:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Bible verse being described speaks about the blessedness of peacemakers. These individuals not only seek peace themselves but also work to reconcile others and promote harmony among all. They strive to settle differences, advise others to live at peace, and take away the causes of discord. Though their efforts may not always be appreciated by others, they are acknowledged as children of God, spreading the Gospel of peace and embodying the likeness of God Himself. In a world where war often receives praise, these peacemakers are esteemed in the kingdom of the Messiah.

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Blessed are the peacemakers—who not only study peace, but diffuse it." 
2. "Of all these beatitudes this is the only one which could hardly be expected to find its definite ground in the Old Testament; for that most glorious character of God, the likeness of which appears in the peacemakers, had yet to be revealed."
3. "When this reconciliation actually takes place, and one has 'peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ'—even 'the peace of God which passeth all understanding'—the peace-receivers become transformed into peace-diffusers."

### John Calvin:
1. "By peacemakers he means those who not only seek peace and avoid quarrels, as far as lies in their power, but who also labor to settle differences among others, who advise all men to live at peace, and take away every occasion of hatred and strife."
2. "As it is a laborious and irksome employment to reconcile those who are at variance, persons of a mild disposition, who study to promote peace, are compelled to endure the indignity of hearing reproaches, complaints, and remonstrances on all sides."
3. "That we may not depend on the favor of men, Christ bids us look up to the judgment of his Father, who is the God of peace, and who accounts us his children, while we cultivate peace, though our endeavors may not be acceptable to men: for to be called means To Be Accounted the children of God."

### Philip Schaff:

2. "We must refer it to those who proclaim and further the Gospel of peace."

2. "They shall be called the children of God — Shall be acknowledged such by God and man." 
3. "One would imagine a person of this amiable temper and behaviour would be the darling of mankind. But our Lord well knew it would not be so, as long as Satan was the prince of this world."
