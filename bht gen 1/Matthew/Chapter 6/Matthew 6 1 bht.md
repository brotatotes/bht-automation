In this verse, the commentators shed light on the concept of righteousness and almsgiving. They explain that the verse addresses the importance of performing righteous actions, such as giving alms, with the right motives. The commentators emphasize that obeying this precept may be difficult but crucial. They caution against making a display of righteousness for self-glorification and highlight the significance of performing good works with the glory of God as the chief end. The verse also underscores that the reward for these actions may come from men, but not from God.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "The subject of the second verse being 'almsgiving' that word—so like the other in Greek—might easily be substituted for it by the copyist: whereas the opposite would not be so likely." 
2. "By 'righteousness,' in this case, we are to understand that same righteousness of the kingdom of heaven, whose leading features—in opposition to traditional perversions of it—it is the great object of this discourse to open up."
3. "True, He had required them to let their light so shine before men that they might see their good works, and glorify their Father which is in heaven. But this is quite consistent with not making a display of our righteousness for self-glorification."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Obedience to this precept difficult as well as important."
2. "Hiding from men only necessary to prevent the praise of men from becoming the motive."
3. "The reward may (usually does) come from men, but not from God."

### John Gill:
1. "Alms was so called, because it is a righteous action, which ought to be performed; and to withhold from the poor what is meet, is to deal unrighteously."
2. "They further affirm that 'giving of alms and beneficence are equal to the whole law'; or, it is all one as if a man performed the whole law."
3. "When a man's self, and not the glory of God, is the chief end of any action, that cannot be called a good work, nor will it have any reward."
