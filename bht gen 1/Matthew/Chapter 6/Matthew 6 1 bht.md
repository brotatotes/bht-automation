# Matthew 6:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this passage, Jesus transitions from addressing actions to motives. He warns against the ostentation and self-glorification that can occur when performing acts of righteousness. The righteousness He speaks of aligns with the true nature of the kingdom of heaven. He encourages His disciples to sincerely devote themselves to good works, focusing on doing what is right before God rather than seeking praise from others. Jesus emphasizes the importance of genuine motives and hidden acts of righteousness, rather than displays of self-glorification. The passage also speaks of how God, as the ultimate observer, rewards actions done for the right reasons.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The discourse of our Lord now passes from actions to motives; not that He has not spoken to the heart before, but then it was only by inference, now directly."
2. "The words 'πρὸς τὸ θεαθῆναι' clearly define the course of action objected to: not the open benevolence of the Christian who lets his light shine that men may glorify God, but the ostentation of him whose object is the praise and glory coming from man."
3. "εἰ δὲ μήγε does not apply to προσέχετε, so as to mean, 'if ye do not take heed;' but to μὴ ποιεῖν, and means, if ye do."

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "By 'righteousness,' in this case, we are to understand that same righteousness of the kingdom of heaven, whose leading features - in opposition to traditional perversions of it - it is the great object of this discourse to open up."
2. "To 'do' this righteousness, was an old and well-understood expression. Thus, 'Blessed is he that doeth righteousness at all times.' It refers to the actings of righteousness in the life - the outgoings of the gracious nature."
3. "True, He had required them to let their light so shine before men that they might see their good works, and glorify their Father which is in heaven. But this is quite consistent with not making a display of our righteousness for self-glorification. In fact, the doing of the former necessarily implies our not doing the latter."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The word 'alms' here denotes liberality to the poor and needy."

3. "To a person who is disposed to do good from a right motive, it matters little whether it be in public or in private."

### John Calvin:
1. "Christ exhorts his people to devote themselves sincerely to good works; that is, to endeavor, with simplicity, to do what is right before God, and not to make a parade before men."
2. "In all virtues the entrance of ambition is to be dreaded, and there is no work so laudable, as not to be in many instances corrupted and polluted by it."
3. "The design is to correct the disease of ambition, when, in doing what is right, we seek glory from men."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Obedience to this precept difficult as well as important."
2. "Hiding from men only necessary to prevent the praise of men from becoming the motive."
3. "The reward may (usually does) come from men, but not from God."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Take heed" (προσεχετε) includes the idea of holding the mind on a matter, emphasizing the importance of paying careful attention and taking pains to understand.

3. "Giving of alms and beneficence are equal to the whole law; it is all one as if a man performed the whole law."
