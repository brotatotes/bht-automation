## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Philip Schaff:
1. "The Messiah's kingdom, which in organized form had not yet come, but was proclaimed by the Lord Himself, as at hand."
2. "It did speedily come, as opposed to the Old Testament theocracy; but in its fulness, including the triumph of Christ's kingdom over the kingdom of darkness, it has not yet come."
3. "Thy will be done as in heaven, so on earth. 'Heaven' and 'earth,' put for their inhabitants. As by pure angels, so by men. The idea of human doing is prominent, our will subordinate to God's will."
