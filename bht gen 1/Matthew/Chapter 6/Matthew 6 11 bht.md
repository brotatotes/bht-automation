## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "ἐπιούσιον has been very variously explained." 
2. "Returning then to the derivation from εἶναι, which has in its favour the authority of the Greek fathers, especially of Origen, and of the Peschito (indigentiæ nostræ), Tholuck thinks it most probable that it is formed after the analogy of περιούσιος, from the substantive οὐσία."
3. "To explain ἐπιούσιος (as Orig [73] Cyr.-jer [74]), ὁ ἐπὶ τὴν οὐσίαν τῆς ψυχῆς κατατασσόμενος, and understand the expression of the Eucharist primarily, or even of spiritual feeding on Christ, is to miss the plain reference of the petition to our daily physical wants."

### John Calvin:
1. "When we pray, therefore, we must never turn away our eyes from that object."
2. "Though the forgiveness of sins is to be preferred to food, yet our Lord commenced with bread and the supports of an earthly life, that from such a beginning he might carry us higher."
3. "We are first commanded to pray, that God would protect and cherish the life which he has given to us in the world, and, as we need many supports, that he would supply us with every thing that he knows to be needful."

### Philip Schaff:
1) "‘Bread,’ food in general; the form in the Greek hints that it is ‘ours,’ i.e., created for our use."
2) "‘this day,’ shows that we are to pray daily and to ask neither for riches nor poverty, but, with contentment and thankfulness for the day’s portion only."
3) "The word translated ‘daily’ has occasioned a great deal of discussion...the primary sense must be that of actual bodily food."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The effort has been made to derive it from επ and ων (ουσα). It clearly comes from επ and ιων (επ and ειμ) like τη επιουση ("on the coming day," "the next day," Acts 16:12)."
2. "The opinion here expressed has been confirmed by A. Debrunner's discovery (Theol. Lit. Ztg. 1925, Col. 119) of επιουσιος in an ancient housekeeping book."
3. "The meaning, in view of the kindred participle (επιουση) in Acts 16:12, seems to be 'for the coming day,' a daily prayer for the needs of the next day as every housekeeper understands like the housekeeping book discovered by Debrunner."

### John Gill:
1. "This reading and sense seem to be contradicted by Christ, Matthew 6:34 were it not that it may be observed, that this signifies the whole subsequent time of life, and so furnishes us with a very commodious sense of this petition."
2. "The meaning of it is, that God would give us, for the present time, such food as we stand in need of; is suitable to us, to our nature and constitution, state and condition, and is sufficient and convenient for us."
3. "By 'bread' is meant all the necessaries of life, and for the support of it: it is called 'our's'; not that we have a right unto it, much less deserve it, but to distinguish it from that of beasts."
