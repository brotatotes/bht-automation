## BHT:
In understanding this Bible verse, commentators shed light on its meaning. They emphasize that the mention of bread signifies food created for our use, tying it to our daily sustenance. Furthermore, the verse encourages us to pray daily, asking for neither excessive wealth nor lack, but rather for contentment and gratitude for what we receive each day. One specific word in the verse, 'daily,' is debated, with some suggesting it refers primarily to physical nourishment.
