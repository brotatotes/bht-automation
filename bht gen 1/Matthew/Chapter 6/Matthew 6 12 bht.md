# Matthew 6:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, sin is depicted as a debt that we owe, requiring satisfaction and forgiveness from God. The concept of debts is used metaphorically to describe sins, as it signifies our moral obligations unfulfilled. The petition for God's forgiveness emphasizes the acknowledgment of our own sinfulness, the need for God's mercy, and the importance of our readiness to forgive others as evidence of our own forgiveness. This verse highlights the connection between our indebtedness to God and our willingness to extend forgiveness to those who have wronged us.

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Sin is pictured as a debt, and the sinner as a debtor." 
2. "The word represents sin both as a wrong and as requiring satisfaction." 
3. "Christ assumes that he who prays for the remission of his own debts has already forgiven those indebted to him."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Debts, undoubtedly, moral obligations unfulfilled, i.e., sins."
2. "The spirit of forgiveness, which God implants, gives a better assurance of His forgiveness."
3. "Our debtors, like 'debts,' is to be taken in the moral sense. We are sinners, always needing forgiveness; forgiveness and readiness to forgive cannot be separated, the latter being the evidence of the former."

### John Gill:
1. "These are called 'debts'; not because they are so in themselves, for then it would be right to do them; debts should be paid; they are not debts we owe to God, but are so called, because on account of them we owe satisfaction to the law and justice of God."
2. "This petition supposes a sense, acknowledgment, and confession of sin, and of inability to make satisfaction for it; and that God only can forgive it, who does, for Christ's sake, and on account of his blood, sacrifice, and satisfaction."
3. "The argument, or reason used, is, as we forgive our debtors; which is to be understood not so much of pecuniary debtors, though they are to be forgiven, when poor and unable to pay; but of such who have offended, or done real injuries to others, either by word or deed."
