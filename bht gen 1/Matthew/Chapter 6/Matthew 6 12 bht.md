# Matthew 6:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, sins are portrayed as debts that we owe to God. These sins result from our human weaknesses and transgressions against God's moral obligations. The act of asking for the forgiveness of our sins is not only an essential part of our relationship with God, but it also serves as a testimony against the notion of a completely sinless state. Just as we ask for forgiveness, we are reminded of the importance of forgiving others, as our forgiveness of others serves as evidence of our own forgiven state.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "sins, short-comings, and therefore ‘debts’ = παραπτώματα" 
2. "‘Quod utique non de illis peccatis dicitur quæ in baptismi regeneratione dimissa sunt, sed de iis quæ quotidie de seculi amarissimis fructibus humanæ vitæ infirmitas contrahit.’"
3. "‘Augustine uses the testimony of this prayer against all proud Pelagian notions of an absolutely sinless state in this life’"

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Sin is pictured as a debt, and the sinner as a debtor...the word represents sin both as a wrong and as requiring satisfaction."
2. "In contrast with the prayer, 'Forgive us our debts,' Tholuck quotes the prayer of Apollonius of Tyana, 'O ye gods, give me the things which are owing to me.'"
3. "Christ assumes that he who prays for the remission of his own debts has already forgiven those indebted to him."

### John Calvin:
1. "We ought always, therefore, to begin with the forgiveness of sins: for the first hope of being heard by God beams upon us, when we obtain his favor; and there is no way in which he is 'pacified toward us,' but by freely pardoning our sins."
2. "Christ has included in two petitions all that related to the eternal salvation of the soul, and to the spiritual life: for these are the two leading points of the divine covenant, in which all our salvation consists."
3. "This condition is added, that no one may presume to approach God and ask forgiveness, who is not pure and free from all resentment. And yet the forgiveness, which we ask that God would give us, does not depend on the forgiveness which we grant to others: but the design of Christ was, to exhort us, in this manner, to forgive the offenses which have been committed against us."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "‘Debts,’ undoubtedly, moral obligations unfulfilled, i.e., sins."
2. "The spirit of forgiveness, which God implants, gives a better assurance of His forgiveness."
3. "Our debtors, like ‘debts,’ is to be taken in the moral sense. We are sinners, always needing forgiveness; forgiveness and readiness to forgive cannot be separated, the latter being the evidence of the former."

### John Gill:
1. "These are called 'debts'; not because they are so in themselves, for then it would be right to do them; debts should be paid; they are not debts we owe to God, but are so called, because on account of them we owe satisfaction to the law and justice of God."
2. "This petition supposes a sense, acknowledgment, and confession of sin, and of inability to make satisfaction for it; and that God only can forgive it, who does, for Christ's sake, and on account of his blood, sacrifice, and satisfaction."
3. "The argument, or reason used, is, as we forgive our debtors; which is to be understood not so much of pecuniary debtors, though they are to be forgiven, when poor and unable to pay; but of such who have offended, or done real injuries to others, either by word or deed: the injuries of enemies, the unkindness of friends, all sorts of offences, are to be forgiven by us; and not only so, but we are to pray to God to forgive them also."
