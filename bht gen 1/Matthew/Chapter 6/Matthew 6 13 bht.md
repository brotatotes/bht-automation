# Matthew 6:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Bible verse discusses the concept of temptation and its role in our spiritual journey. It emphasizes that although God does not tempt us, He allows us to face trials and challenges that test our character. These trials can expose us to evil, but the key to overcoming them lies in placing our trust in Christ. By relying on His grace, we can find deliverance from temptation, leading us towards our ultimate redemption in heaven, where all our needs will be fulfilled.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Philip Schaff:
1. "God cannot tempt us... but 'temptation' means also a trial of our moral character; these trials are under God's control, and His Providence may lead us into them, may even permit us to be solicited by evil." 
2. "In view of the many temptations... there is no help and safety for us, but in the personal trust in Christ which underlies the proper offering up of this petition."
3. "Entire deliverance by God's grace from evil (or from the evil one) is entire freedom from temptation, and looks toward that final redemption in heaven where all our wants shall be satisfied and our prayers, as petitions, be lost in never-ceasing thanksgiving and praise."
