## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The sentiment is not in any way inconsistent with the Christianâ€™s joy when he falls into various trials." 
2. "The leading into temptation must be understood in its plain literal sense."
3. "These words form a seventh and most affecting petition, reaching far beyond the last. They are the expression of the yearning for redemption of the sons of God."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "It is a mistake to define this word as only solicitation to evil. It means trial of any kind, without reference to its moral quality."
2. "Here, generally of all situations and circumstances which furnish an occasion for sin."
3. "We cannot pray God not to tempt us to sin," for God cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempteth he any man."

### John Calvin:
1. "We are conscious Of our own weakness, and desire to enjoy the protection of God, that we may remain impregnable against all the assaults of Satan."
2. "Whoever implores the assistance of God to overcome temptations, acknowledges that, unless God deliver him, he will be constantly falling."
3. "There is no necessity for raising a debate on this point: for the meaning remains nearly the same, that we are in danger from the devil and from sin, if the Lord does not protect and deliver us."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "God cannot tempt us... but 'temptation' means also a trial of our moral character; these trials are under God's control, and His Providence may lead us into them, may even permit us to be solicited by evil. This petition asks to be preserved from these, and by implication, to be shown a way of escape."

2. "In view of the many temptations... there is no help and safety for us, but in the personal trust in Christ which underlies the proper offering up of this petition. We should never seek temptation, but flee from it; or if we cannot avoid it, meet it with the weapon of prayer wielded in that faith which overcomes the world."

3. "Entire deliverance by God's grace from evil (or from the evil one) is entire freedom from temptation, and looks toward that final redemption in heaven where all our wants shall be satisfied and our prayers, as petitions, be lost in never-ceasing thanksgiving and praise."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Bring" or "lead" bothers many people. It seems to present God as an active agent in subjecting us to temptation, a thing specifically denied in James 1:13.
2. The word here translated "temptation" means originally "trial" or "test" as in James 1:2. But God does test or sift us, though he does not tempt us to evil.
3. The idea is then: "Do not allow us to be led into temptation." There is a way out, but it is a terrible risk.

### John Gill:
1. "We are not here taught to pray against temptations at all, or in any sense, for they are sometimes needful and useful; but that they may not have the power over us, and destroy us."
2. "In this petition, the children of God pray, that they may be kept from every occasion and object of sinning; from those sins they are most inclined to; that God would not leave them to Satan, and their own corrupt hearts; nor suffer them to sink under the weight of temptations of any sort; but that, in the issue, they might have a way to escape, and be victorious over all."
3. "To be delivered from [the evil one], is to be rescued out of his hands, preserved from his snares, and delivered from his temptations."
