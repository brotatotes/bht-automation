# Matthew 6:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Forgiveness is a continuous process of releasing the offender and letting go of anger, resentment, and desire for revenge. It is not about condoning the wrongs done to us, but about freeing ourselves from bitterness and resentment. When we forgive others, we imitate the love and mercy of God, experiencing freedom, peace, and joy, and allowing healing and restoration in our relationships. Through forgiveness, we entrust justice to God, allowing Him to manifest His forgiving love and grant us a delightful sense of His pardoning grace.
