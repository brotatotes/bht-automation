# Matthew 6:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Forgiveness is a continual choice to release others from their debts and seek reconciliation. It is necessary for our own growth and well-being, reflecting God's grace towards us. Forgiveness involves letting go, not excusing or denying, the impact of wrongs done to us. It is a powerful spiritual practice that opens the door to healing, transforms us, and allows divine blessings to flow freely. Through forgiveness, we demonstrate trust in God's ability to bring justice and restoration, while releasing the burden of anger and resentment.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Forgiveness is not just a one-time act, but a continual choice to release others from the debts they owe us. It is a deliberate decision to let go of resentment and seek reconciliation instead."

2. "When we choose to forgive, we are not excusing the wrong or denying its impact. Rather, we are choosing to free ourselves from the burden of carrying that offense, and allowing God to be the ultimate judge and healer."

3. "Forgiveness is not easy, but it is necessary for our own spiritual growth and well-being. It is a reflection of God's grace and mercy towards us, and a demonstration of our trust in His ability to bring about justice and restoration."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The Lord here uses another word for sins, and still another appears in Luke's version of the prayer, though he also says, 'every one that is indebted to us.' There is no difficulty in supposing that Christ, contemplating sins in general, should represent them by different terms expressive of different aspects of wrong-doing."
2. "This word is derived from parapiptw, to fall or thrown one's self beside. Thus it has a sense somewhat akin to aJmartia, of going beside a mark, missing."
3. "Unlike parabasiv (transgression), which contemplates merely the objective violation of law, it carries the thought of sin as affecting the sinner, and hence is found associated with expressions which indicate the consequences and the remedy of sin."

### John Calvin:
1. "God will not be ready to hear us, unless we also show ourselves ready to grant forgiveness to those who have offended us."
2. "If we are not harder than iron, this exhortation ought to soften us, and render us disposed to forgive offenses."
3. "Those who refuse to forget the injuries which have been done to them, devote themselves willingly and deliberately to destruction, and knowingly prevent God from forgiving them."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The word 'trespass' is literally 'falling to one side,' a lapse or deviation from truth or uprightness."
2. "The ancients sometimes used it of intentional falling or attack upon one's enemy."
3. "Παραβασις (Romans 5:14) is a positive violation, a transgression, conscious stepping aside or across."

### John Gill:
1. "Christ presses it upon them closely to 'forgive men their trespasses'; all sorts of injuries done them, or offences given them, whether by word or deed; and that fully, freely, from the heart; forgetting, as well as forgiving; not upbraiding them with former offences; and even without asking pardon, and though there might be no appearance of repentance."

2. "Now to this he encourages by saying, your heavenly Father will also forgive you; will hear your prayers, and manifest his forgiving love to you."

3. "Not that the forgiveness of others is the procuring cause of forgiveness with God, which is the blood of Christ; or of the manifestation and application of it, that is, the advocacy of Christ; nor the moving cause of it, that is, the free grace of God: but this enters into the character, and is descriptive of the persons, to whom God is pleased to make a comfortable discovery, and give a delightful sense of his pardoning grace; such persons, so disposed and assisted by his grace, may expect it of him."

### John Wesley:
1. "Forgiveness is not just a nice sentiment, but a powerful spiritual practice that opens the door to healing and transformation."
2. "When we hold onto grudges and refuse to forgive, we create barriers that hinder our own spiritual growth and block the flow of divine blessings."
3. "Forgiveness is not about condoning or excusing the wrongs done to us, but about releasing the burden of anger and resentment that weighs us down."
