# Matthew 6:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, Jesus condemns the hypocrisy of those who fast for the sake of receiving recognition and praise from others. He warns against the external display of fasting in order to gain attention, emphasizing that genuine fasting should be done with a sincere heart and not for self-glorification. These commentators highlight the focus on external appearances, the desire for reputation, and the absence of genuine spirituality behind the actions of the hypocrites. Jesus declares that their desired reward is the attention from others, and they will receive no further reward from God.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Fasting as an aid to prayer and meditation, and a wholesome discipline, is a religious duty, and has a place in Christian practice."
2. "Stated fasts are likely to become formal; public fasts are almost sure to become Pharisaical, but there are circumstances in the life of every Christian which make days of private abstinence appropriate."
