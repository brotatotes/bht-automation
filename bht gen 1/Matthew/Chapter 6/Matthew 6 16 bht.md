# Matthew 6:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this passage, Jesus addresses the issue of fasting and warns against the hypocrisy displayed by some. Commentators explain that fasting can be a genuine expression of grief or a means of humbling oneself and redirecting thoughts towards the divine. However, hypocrisy arises when individuals disfigure their faces and conceal their true intentions in order to seek recognition from others. Jesus emphasizes that the true reward for fasting is not in earthly acclaim, but in God's approval of genuine acts of piety.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The meaning of ἀφανίζουσιν in this passage is to disfigure or deform, as shown in many examples cited by Le Clerc."
2. "The allusion is not to covering the face, but to the squalor of the uncleansed face and hair of the head and beard."
3. "The verb may just as well signify covering or plastering over as disfiguring."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Moreover, when ye fast—referring, probably, to private and voluntary fasting, which was to be regulated by each individual for himself; though in spirit it would apply to any fast."
2. "be not, as the hypocrites, of a sad countenance: for they disfigure their faces—literally, 'make unseen'; very well rendered 'disfigure.' They went about with a slovenly appearance, and ashes sprinkled on their head."
3. "It was not the deed, but reputation for the deed which they sought; and with this view those hypocrites multiplied their fasts."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Whenever ye may be fasting." - The present tense indicates that fasting is an ongoing action, not a one-time event.
2. "Expressing the downcast look of settled grief, pain, or displeasure." - The word "sad countenance" describes the outward expression of deep sorrow or unhappiness.

2. "Prayer holds the first rank among the antics of piety: but fasting is a doubtful operation, and does not, like alms, belong to the class of those actions which God requires and approves."
3. "The meaning of Christ’s words is: 'God will one day show that he was pleased with those good works, which appeared to be lost, because they were concealed from the eyes of men.'"

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Fasting as an aid to prayer and meditation, and a wholesome discipline, is a religious duty, and has a place in Christian practice."
