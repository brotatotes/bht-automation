# Matthew 6:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we are cautioned against the temptation of hoarding earthly treasures, which are both precarious and perishable. Various commentators emphasize that it is not wealth itself that is forbidden, but rather the improper desire and love for riches. We are reminded that earthly treasures, regardless of their kind or collection, lack the enduring value and should not be our ultimate treasure. Instead, we are exhorted to guard against making anything on earth our treasure and to focus on purity of intention rather than the pursuit of material wealth.
