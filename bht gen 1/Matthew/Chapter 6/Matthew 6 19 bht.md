# Matthew 6:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we are reminded not to place too much value on earthly possessions and wealth. We are warned against the transient nature of material possessions, as they can be destroyed by various means such as rust, moths, or even theft. The verse urges us to prioritize heavenly treasures and guard our hearts against the allure of earthly riches. Ultimately, true security and fulfillment come from investing in eternal treasures rather than temporary wealth.

2. "When we speak of 'wealth,' we think at once of gold, and silver, and lands, and houses. When a Hebrew or an Orientalist spoke of wealth, he thought first of what would make a 'display;' and included, as an essential part, splendid articles of dress."
3. "The 'moth' is a small insect that finds its way to clothes and garments, and destroys them. The 'moth' would destroy their apparel, the 'rust' their silver and gold; thus all their treasure would waste away."

### Marvin Vincent:

2. "What is more unreasonable than to place their property, where it may perish of itself, or be carried off by men?"
3. "They are blind and destitute of sound judgment, who give themselves so much toil and uneasiness in amassing wealth, which is liable to putrefaction, or robbery, or a thousand other accidents."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Earthly treasures are not forbidden in themselves, but the earthly storing up, the earthly desire manifesting itself in the common striving after wealth."
2. "It is no sin to be rich, but it is a sin to love riches, which the poorest may do; while the rich man may glorify God and benefit man by his wealth."
3. "The verse exhibits in general the variety of all earthly treasures, which are earthly in their ‘place,’ their ‘kind,’ and ‘the manner of their collection.’ Not likely to be understood too literally."

### Archibald T Robertson:

### John Gill:
1. "Christ here dissuades from covetousness, and worldly mindedness; an anxious care and concern, to hoard up plenty of worldly things for themselves, for time to come, making no use of them at present for the good of others."
2. "The word translated rust, does not here signify the rust of metals, as gold and silver by which there is not so much damage done, so as to destroy them, and make them useless; but whatever corrupts and consumes things eatable, as blasting and mildew in corn, or any sort of vermin in granaries."
3. "So that no sort of worldly riches and treasure is safe, and to be depended on; and therefore it is a great folly and vanity to lay it up, and trust in it."

### John Wesley:
1. "Our Lord here makes a transition from religious to common actions, and warns us of another snare, the love of money, as inconsistent with purity of intention as the love of praise."
2. "Where rust and moth consume — Where all things are perishable and transient."
3. "He may likewise have a farther view in these words, even to guard us against making any thing on earth our treasure. For then a thing properly becomes our treasure, when we set our affections upon it."
