# Matthew 6:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this passage, the Bible warns against the hypocritical practice of publicly displaying acts of charity in order to receive recognition and praise from others. The use of figurative language, such as sounding a trumpet or gathering the poor together, highlights the deceptive nature of these actions. The commentators emphasize that the reward received by the hypocrites is solely the applause of men, while the favor of God is denied to them. This serves as a caution to act with genuine humility and sincerity, seeking the approval of God rather than seeking the praise of others.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Therefore, when thou doest thine alms, do not sound a trumpet before thee" - The expression is to be taken figuratively for blazoning it. Hence our expression to "trumpet."
2. "This word - of such frequent occurrence in Scripture, signifying primarily 'one who acts a part' - denotes one who either pretends to be what he is not (as here), or dissembles what he really is."
3. "They have their reward - All they wanted was human applause, and they have it - and with it, all they will ever get."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "There seems to be no trace of any such custom on the part of almsgivers, so that the expression must be taken as a figurative one for making a display."
2. "It is just possible that the figure may have been suggested by the 'trumpets' of the temple treasury - thirteen trumpet-shaped chests to receive the contributions of worshippers."
3. "The preposition ajpo indicates receipt in full. Rev. renders they have received, so that there is nothing more to receive. So Wyc., They have received their need."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Do not sound a trumpet before thee, etc. It would be impossible to blow a trumpet in the synagogues, where the alms were regularly collected, or even in the streets, where the giver would be accosted by the beggar, and hardly carry a trumpet with him for such casual occurrences. The language is figurative: a trumpet was sounded before official personages to call attention to them; hence self-laudation and display are meant."
2. "Hypocrites. The Pharisees are not named, but, as a class, deserved this epithet."
3. "They have received their reward; already in full, and will get no more. They have the applause of men; the favor of God is denied by Matthew 6:1. Their 'due' reward is not spoken of."

### John Wesley:
1. "As the hypocrites do" - This phrase refers to the actions of the scribes and Pharisees who would publicly display their acts of charity to gain recognition and praise from others. It highlights the insincerity and self-centeredness of their actions.

2. "Under a pretence of calling the poor together" - This statement reveals the deceptive nature of the scribes and Pharisees' actions. They would gather the poor under the guise of helping them, but their true intention was to draw attention to themselves and boost their own reputation.

3. "They have their reward" - This phrase emphasizes that the recognition and praise the hypocrites receive from others is the only reward they will receive. It implies that their actions lack genuine righteousness and will not be rewarded by God.

Overall, these quotes shed light on the hypocritical behavior of the scribes and Pharisees, exposing their insincerity and self-seeking motives. It serves as a cautionary reminder to act with genuine humility and sincerity in our own acts of charity and righteousness.
