# Matthew 6:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, Jesus warns against the hypocrisy of those who perform acts of righteousness solely for the sake of receiving praise and admiration from others. The commentators explain that the figurative expression of "sounding a trumpet" refers to the behavior of making a public display of one's good works. While the hypocrites sought the glory of men, their actions lacked sincerity and genuine compassion for the poor. Jesus teaches that those who seek earthly recognition have already received their reward, leaving no room for receiving God's approval or further blessings.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "A proverbial expression, not implying any such custom of the hypocrites of that day, but the habit of self-laudation, and display of good works in general."
2. "Many Commentators, among whom are Calvin and Bengel, think that the words are to be taken literally; and Euthym mentions this view: 'They say that some hypocrites at that time called those who were in need by means of a trumpet.'"
3. "The synagogues, as afterwards the Christian churches, were the regular places for the collection of alms."
4. "They have in full, exhaust: not have their due reward."

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Therefore, when thou doest thine alms, do not sound a trumpet before thee—The expression is to be taken figuratively for blazoning it. Hence our expression to 'trumpet.'" 
2. "as the hypocrites do—This word—of such frequent occurrence in Scripture, signifying primarily 'one who acts a part'—denotes one who either pretends to be what he is not (as here), or dissembles what he really is (as in Luke 12:1; Luke 12:2)."
3. "that they may have glory of men. Verily I say unto you—In such august expressions, it is the Lawgiver and Judge Himself that we hear speaking to us. They have their reward—All they wanted was human applause, and they have it—and with it, all they will ever get."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The word 'hypocrite' is taken from 'stage-players,' who act the part of others, or speak not their own sentiments, but the sentiments of others."
2. "It means here, and in the New Testament generally, those who 'dissemble' or hide their real sentiments, and assume or express other feelings than their own - those who, for purposes of ostentation, gain, or applause, put on the appearance of religion."
3. "They obtain the applause they seek, the reputation of being charitable; and as this applause was all they wished, there is, of course, no further reward to be looked for or obtained."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "There seems to be no trace of any such custom on the part of almsgivers, so that the expression must be taken as a figurative one for making a display."
2. "It is just possible that the figure may have been suggested by the 'trumpets' of the temple treasury - thirteen trumpet-shaped chests to receive the contributions of worshippers."
3. "The preposition ajpo indicates receipt in full. Rev. renders they have received, so that there is nothing more to receive. So Wyc., They have received their need."

### John Calvin:
1. "When our service is rendered to the eyes of men, we do not submit our life to the judgment and approbation of God." 
2. "All who are desirous of vain-glory are called hypocrites."
3. "Others do good, not from a desire to do what is right, nor on account of the glory of God, but only to obtain for themselves fame and a reputation for holiness."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Do not sound a trumpet before thee, etc. It would be impossible to blow a trumpet in the synagogues, where the alms were regularly collected, or even in the streets, where the giver would be accosted by the beggar, and hardly carry a trumpet with him for such casual occurrences. The language is figurative: a trumpet was sounded before official personages to call attention to them; hence self-laudation and display are meant."

2. "Hypocrites. The Pharisees are not named, but, as a class, deserved this epithet."

3. "They have received their reward; already in full, and will get no more. They have the applause of men; the favor of God is denied by Matthew 6:1. Their 'due' reward is not spoken of."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Certainly it was in keeping with their love of praise. And Jesus expressly says that 'the hypocrites' do this very thing." 
2. "This is the hardest word that Jesus has for any class of people and he employs it for these pious pretenders who pose as perfect."
3. "They have their receipt in full, all the reward that they will get, this public notoriety."

### John Gill:
1. "The persons Christ has reference to were the Scribes and Pharisees, who did all they did to be seen of men; whom he calls 'hypocrites'; as he often does, because they put on an appearance of religion and holiness, but inwardly, and otherwise, were very wicked men."
2. "When they did their alms, they chose public places for it, such as the 'synagogues', where was a large concourse of people met together for religious worship; or the open 'streets' of the city, where people were continually walking to and fro, so that nothing could be done in this way, but what must be seen and observed."
3. "They took care, either by themselves, or others, to proclaim their good actions, that they might 'have glory of men'; not only of the poor, or the collectors for them, but of the spectators."

### John Wesley:
1. "Many of the scribes and Pharisees did this, under a pretence of calling the poor together."
2. "They have their reward - All they will have; for they shall have none from God."
3. "The hypocrites' actions were driven by selfish motives, seeking recognition and praise from others rather than genuine compassion for the poor."
