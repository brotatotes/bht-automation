# Matthew 6:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Sell your possessions, give to the needy, and store up treasures in heaven that are imperishable and unassailable. These treasures, existing in the highest and spiritual sense, are eternal and collected in a heavenly manner. It is not solely about a future reward or accumulating good works, but about embracing the unknown realm where God dwells and reveals His glory, untouched by corruption or theft.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Sell that ye have, and give alms; provide yourselves bags which wax not old, a treasure in the heavens that faileth not." 
2. "Treasures these, imperishable and unassailable!"
3. "Lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor steal."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Heaven’ sometimes means the atmospheric heaven (Matthew 6:26), sometimes the starry heavens (Hebrews 11:12); here it is used in the highest and spiritual sense of the unknown region where God has His throne and reveals His glory." 
2. "This is the ‘place’ where the treasures are laid up; the ‘character’ of the treasures, is therefore, eternal; they are to be collected in a heavenly ‘manner.’"
3. "Hence the reference is not exclusively to a future locality; nor is there a thought of purchasing a future and heavenly reward by laying up a store of good works."
