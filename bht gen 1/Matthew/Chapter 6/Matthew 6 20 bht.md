# Matthew 6:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we are instructed to invest in eternal rewards rather than earthly possessions. We are urged to store up treasures in heaven, which are everlasting and immune to decay. By prioritizing spiritual wealth over material wealth, we secure imperishable and unassailable treasures that are safe in the hands of God. This reminds us of the fleeting nature of material possessions and encourages us to focus on the eternal, as treasures in heaven are of greater value and secure a future of eternal life, glory, and happiness.
