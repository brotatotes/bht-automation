# Matthew 6:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This verse teaches that the eye serves as a light for the body, symbolizing the conscience or intention of the soul. If one's eye is single and focused solely on God, it brings clarity and purity to the soul, leading to holiness and happiness. However, if the eye is divided, seeking other desires or goals, it brings darkness and leads the soul away from its true purpose.

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Single [απλους]. The picture underlying this adjective is that of a piece of cloth or other material, neatly folded once, and without a variety of complicated folds. Hence the idea of simplicity or singleness."
