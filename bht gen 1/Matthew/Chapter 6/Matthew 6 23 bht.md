# Matthew 6:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, the commentators paint a vivid picture of a divided heart and mind, engulfed in darkness and blind to the light. The verse describes the consequences of straying from a single and supreme dedication to God. It warns that a heart consumed by worldly desires and sinful temptations will be filled with darkness, obscuring one's ability to discern what is right and just. The commentators emphasize the importance of maintaining spiritual clarity amidst the darkness of earthly distractions, or else one risks being lost in a state of eternal darkness.
