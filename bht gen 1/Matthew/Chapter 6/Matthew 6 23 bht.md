# Matthew 6:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we are warned about the perils of a divided heart and a distorted mindset. The commentators describe the consequences of being consumed by earthly desires, emphasizing the darkness that engulfs one's whole being. They caution that such a condition hinders our ability to see truth and discern what is right. Ultimately, they paint a grim picture of a heart devoid of dedication and the dire outcome it may lead to.
