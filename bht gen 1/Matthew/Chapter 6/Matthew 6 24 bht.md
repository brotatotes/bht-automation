### Albert Barnes:
1. "His affections and obedience would be divided, and he would fail altogether in his duty to one or the other."
2. "The supreme affections can be fixed on only one object."
3. "The servant of God cannot at the same time obey him and be avaricious, or seek treasures supremely on earth."

### Philip Schaff:
1) "A still plainer illustration, to prove that man cannot be thus divided, must be one, light or dark, servant of God or of Mammon."
2) "The suppositions the reverse of each other, with no particular difference between the two sets of verbs: ‘He will either hate A and love B, or cleave to A and despise B.’"
