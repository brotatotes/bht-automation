# Matthew 6:25 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, commentators emphasize that Jesus' command to "take no thought" is not a condemnation of all care and thoughtfulness, but rather a warning against excessive worry and anxiety. They highlight that God, who has given the greater gift of life, will surely provide for our basic needs. The commentators stress the importance of trusting in God's providence, casting our anxieties upon Him, and finding contentment in His provisions. They caution against being consumed by worldly cares, reminding us that serving God involves relying on Him rather than being preoccupied with material concerns.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The E. V., 'Take no thought,' does not express the sense, but gives rather an exaggeration of the command, and thus makes it unreal and nugatory."
2. "Be not anxious, would be far better."
3. "τοῦτο εἶπε δηλῶν ὅτι ὁ τὸ πλεῖον δοὺς ἡμῖν καὶ τὸ ἔλαττον δώσει."

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Thought or forethought, for temporal things—in the sense of reflection, consideration—is required alike by Scripture and common sense. It is that anxious solicitude, that oppressive care, which springs from unbelieving doubts and misgivings, which alone is here condemned."
2. "When 'careful (or 'full of care') about nothing,' but committing all in prayer and supplication with thanksgiving unto God, the apostle assures us that 'the peace of God, which passeth all understanding, shall keep our hearts and minds in Christ Jesus.'"
3. "If God, then, gives and keeps up the greater—the life, the body—will He withhold the less, food to sustain life and raiment to clothe the body?"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Is not the life more than meat, and the body than raiment?" - Jesus emphasizes the greater value of life and the body compared to material needs, highlighting the importance of trusting in God's providence.
2. "Shall not he who has conferred the 'greater' blessing be willing to confer the 'less'?" - The commentary highlights the logic that if God has given the gift of life, He will surely provide for our basic needs such as food and clothing.
3. "The word 'thought,' when the Bible was translated, meant 'anxiety'... The word 'anxiety' would now exactly express the sense, and is precisely the thing against which the Saviour would guard us." - The commentary clarifies that Jesus is cautioning against excessive worry and anxiety about the future, rather than reasonable planning and consideration.


### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Take no thought" may include the ideas of worry and anxiety, but not necessarily. It can also carry the common notion of earnest thoughtfulness, as seen in other passages of Scripture (1 Corinthians 7:32, 1 Corinthians 12:25, Philippians 2:20).
2. The word "thought" in this passage used to be understood as equivalent to anxiety or solicitude, as seen in older literature and writings. However, its meaning has evolved over time.
3. The phrase "be not anxious" is a more accurate translation of the original Greek, as it captures the essence of uneasiness and worry about the future that Jesus condemns in this passage. This is further emphasized in 1 Peter 5:7, where believers are encouraged to cast their anxieties upon God, who cares for them with a fatherly and provident care.

### John Calvin:
1. "When he forbids them to be anxious, this is not to be taken literally, as if he intended to take away from his people all care."
2. "Immoderate care is condemned for two reasons: either because in so doing men tease and vex themselves to no purpose, by carrying their anxiety farther than is proper or than their calling demands; or because they claim more for themselves than they have a right to do, and place such a reliance on their own industry, that they neglect to call upon God."
3. "He argues from the greater to the less. He had forbidden them to be excessively anxious about the way in which life might be supported; and he now assigns the reason. The Lord, who has given life itself, will not suffer us to want what is necessary for its support."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Anxiety, which is distrust of God, is the source of avarice."
2. "Living to God is the proper life, and it relieves from care, because we trust Him for what we need."
3. "When thought about temporal things becomes anxiety, it has become distrust of God."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "The verb μεριμναω is from μερισ, μεριζω, because care or anxiety distracts and divides."
2. "The command not to have the habit of petulant worry about food and clothing, a source of anxiety to many housewives, a word for women especially as the command not to worship mammon may be called a word for men."
3. "Here ψυχη stands for the life principle common to man and beast, which is embodied in the σωμα: the former needs food, the latter clothing."

### John Gill:
1. "Christ does not forbid labour to maintain, support, and preserve, this animal life; nor does he forbid all thought and care about it, but all anxious, immoderate, perplexing, and distressing thoughts and cares."
2. "Eating and drinking are necessary to preserve life; and raiment, to cover and defend the body, from the injuries of the heavens: and having these, men have everything necessary, and ought herewith to be content."
3. "God has given these without man's thought: and since these are better, and much more excellent, than food and raiment, as all must and will acknowledge; and God has given these the greater gifts, it may be depended upon, that he will give the lesser."

### John Wesley:
1. "If you serve God, you need be careful for nothing." 
2. "Beware of worldly cares; for these are as inconsistent with the true service of God as worldly desires." 
3. "Is not the life more than meat? And if God give the greater gift, will he deny the smaller?"
