# Matthew 6:25 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, commentators emphasize the need to trust in God and not worry anxiously about worldly cares. They explain that anxiety comes from a lack of faith and leads to avarice and a distrust of God's provisions. The commentators urge believers to commit their concerns to God through prayer and thanksgiving, finding peace that surpasses understanding. They remind us that if God provides and sustains our very lives, He will surely provide for our basic needs. Serving God should alleviate worry, as we trust in Him and find contentment in His provisions.
