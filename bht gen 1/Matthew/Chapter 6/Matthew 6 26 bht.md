# Matthew 6:26 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Behold the wisdom of the fowls of the air and learn from their freedom, for they rely on their heavenly Father to sustain them without any worry or effort. Just as the birds do not sow or reap, yet are never left hungry, so too shall God provide for His own children. In this verse, Jesus reminds us to have faith in the Universal Parent who attends to the needs of the birds and will surely supply our own needs as well. We are urged to put our confidence in Him, relinquishing our earthly cares and embracing a higher trust.
