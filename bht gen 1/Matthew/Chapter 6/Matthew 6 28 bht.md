# Matthew 6:28 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Consider the beauty of the wild flowers, such as lilies, anemones, poppies, gladioli, and irises, that grow in the fields without any human care. They serve as a symbol of God's provision and care for His creation, reminding us to trust in His providence. Just as these flowers grow so beautifully and thrive without worrying about their needs, we too should not be anxious about our material needs, but instead rely on God's care and provision.
