# Matthew 6:30 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we are reminded that the splendor of the flowers in the fields is fleeting, as they wither quickly and are cast into the oven. However, God, who adorns these transient wildflowers, will surely provide for His children who are dear to Him and have an everlasting life. By comparing the temporary beauty of flowers to human grandeur, we are encouraged to trust in God's provision and care, knowing that He sees even the smallest details of our lives, like every microscopic aspect of a flower.
