# Matthew 6:30 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the commentators emphasize the transient nature of human existence by comparing it to the grass of the field. They highlight the temporary beauty of wildflowers, which are cut down and wither away, serving as fuel for fires. The commentators further emphasize the contrast between the fleeting nature of grass and the eternal nature of God's kingdom. They also point out that if God clothes the lilies in such splendor, He will surely provide for His children, who are destined for greater purposes.
