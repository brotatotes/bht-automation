# Matthew 6:34 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we are reminded not to be consumed by anxious thoughts about the future. Instead, we are encouraged to focus on the present moment, trusting that the future will take care of itself. Each day brings its own set of challenges, and worrying about tomorrow only serves to increase our burden. Troubles and challenges, though they may seem daunting, are opportunities for growth and serve a greater purpose in our lives. Even though we may not fully understand it, all the troubles we face ultimately contribute to our spiritual development.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Take therefore no thoughtâ€”anxious care. for the morrow: for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself." 
2. "Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof." 
3. "Every day brings its own cares; and to anticipate is only to double them."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The first view accords better with the reason given and would presuppose the other lessons; the latter is favored by the position of the verse immediately after the general precept of Matthew 6:33, and finds a place more easily in a logical analysis of the discourse. It is suspicious for that reason."
2. "For the morrow will be anxious for itself. Not 'take care of itself,' but 'bring its own cares and anxieties,' do not foolishly increase those of today by borrowing from the morrow."
3. "Sufficient unto the day, or for the day, is the evil thereof. 'Evil' may mean natural or moral evil, suffering, or sin. The latter sense is the more usual one, the former suits the context better. Perhaps both may be included, the sin being the want of trust under the suffering. A hint that we never fully obey the precepts just uttered, because our dedication to God is so imperfect."

### John Gill:
1. "A man cannot promise or assure himself, that he shall have a morrow, and therefore it is great weakness and folly to be anxiously thoughtful about it."
2. "Perhaps tomorrow may not be, and thou wilt be found distressing thyself, for the time which is nothing to thee."
3. "Every day brings along with it fresh care and thought, being attended with fresh wants and troubles; and therefore, it is very unadvisable, to bring the cares and troubles of two days upon one."

### John Wesley:
1. "The morrow shall take thought for itself" - Be present in the present moment and trust that the future will take care of itself.
2. "The evil thereof" - Troubles and challenges are opportunities for growth and learning, ultimately serving a greater purpose in our lives.
3. "All trouble is, upon the whole, a real good" - Even though it may not seem like it at the time, difficulties are blessings in disguise, providing us with the necessary medicine for our spiritual growth.
