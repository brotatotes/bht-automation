# Matthew 6:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, Jesus condemns the practice of praying in ostentatious and public areas like synagogues and street corners, which was commonly done by the hypocrites to gain recognition. The commentators explain that these locations were typical places of worship and gathering, emphasizing how the Pharisees would assume a prayerful posture to display their piety and gain the attention of others. However, the focus should not be on outward appearance or location, but on the spirit and motive behind prayer. Jesus highlights the importance of genuine devotion to God, rather than seeking validation from others.
