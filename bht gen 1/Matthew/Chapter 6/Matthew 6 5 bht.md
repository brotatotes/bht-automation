# Matthew 6:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the commentators shed light on the cultural context and practices of prayer during that time. The synagogues were significant places for public prayer, teaching, and communal gatherings, serving as centers of religious and community life. The commentators also emphasize that Jesus is not condemning the act of praying in these synagogues or in public places. Instead, He is cautioning against hypocritical motives and seeking attention from others while praying. It is not the posture or the place that matters, but the sincerity of the heart and the spirit in which one approaches God in prayer.
