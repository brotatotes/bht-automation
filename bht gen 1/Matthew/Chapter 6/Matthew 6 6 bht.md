## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "What then? Shall we not pray in the church? Yes, indeed, but with such a disposition. For everywhere God seeks the purpose of what is done. For even if you enter into the treasury and, having locked it, work there to display it, there is no benefit to you from the doors." 
2. "See then how exact the distinction he has made, saying, 'so that they may appear to men.' Therefore, even if you close the doors, he wants to accomplish this before the closing of the doors, and to close the doors of the mind."
3. "It is not enough to enter into the chambers if the door is open to the impudent, through which door they wickedly immerse themselves in what is outside and seek our innermost being."

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Enter into thy closet—a place of retirement."
2. "It is the retiring character of true prayer which is here taught."
3. "It may be offered in any circumstances, however open, if not prompted by the spirit of ostentation, but dictated by the great ends of prayer itself."

### Albert Barnes:

### John Gill:

2. "Pray to thy Father, which is in secret; who is invisible; not to be seen with the eyes of the body, but to be approached with a true heart, in faith and fear, through his Son Jesus Christ, the only mediator between God and man."
