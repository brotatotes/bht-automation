# Matthew 6:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the commentators emphasize the significance of private and sincere prayer. They mention that while public prayer is not condemned, finding a secluded place for prayer allows for a more focused and intimate connection with God. They highlight the need for humility, avoiding ostentation or seeking attention from others. Ultimately, praying in secret provides an opportunity for vulnerability and authenticity in our communication with God, free from distractions and pretense.
