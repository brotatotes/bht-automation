# Matthew 6:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, Jesus warns against the empty and senseless repetition of words in prayer, a practice associated with pagan worship. He encourages fervent, sincere prayer that comes from the heart rather than long, monotonous prayers. Jesus emphasizes that the power of prayer lies not in the abundance of words, but in the genuine desires and affections of the heart. Therefore, it is important to pray with sincerity and meaning rather than relying on superficial repetitions or lengthy words that lack true devotion.
