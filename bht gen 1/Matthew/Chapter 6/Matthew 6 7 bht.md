# Matthew 6:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, the commentators warn against mindless and repetitive prayers that lack sincerity and understanding. They caution against the senseless multiplication of words and the practice of repeating the same formula many times. While Jesus Himself prayed using the same words, the emphasis is on avoiding empty repetition and seeking to gain merit before God. The commentators highlight the need for heartfelt prayers that express genuine desires rather than vainly babbling without meaning.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Babble not" would be a better rendering, both for the form of the word—which in both languages is intended to imitate the sound—and for the sense, which expresses not so much the repetition of the same words as a senseless multiplication of them.
2. With the Jews, says LIGHTFOOT, it was a maxim, that "Every one who multiplies prayer is heard."
3. But praying much, and using at times the same words, is not here condemned, and has the example of our Lord Himself in its favor.

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Use vain repetitions [βατταλογησητε]. A word formed in imitation of the sound, battalogein: properly, to stammer; then to babble or prate, to repeat the same formula many times..."
2. "...as the worshippers of Baal and of Diana of Ephesus (1 Kings 18:26; Acts 19:34) and the Romanists with their paternosters and aves."
3. "The warning here is against mindless and repetitive prayers that lack sincerity and understanding."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The correct sense of the Greek word (lit, 'to speak stammeringly') is given in our English version, although all senseless and irrelevant expressions are included."
2. "There may be 'vain repetitions' of the Lord's Prayer, which immediately follows. Hence Luther calls it 'the greatest martyr.' 'What is forbidden here is not much praying, not praying in the same words (the Lord did both); but the making number and length a point of observance.'" 
3. "A second error; the first seeking to gain merit before men; this, attempting to gain merit before God. Prayer, not a magical charm, but a reasonable service."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Used of stammerers who repeat the words, then mere babbling or chattering, empty repetition."
2. "Certainly Jesus does not mean to condemn all repetition in prayer since he himself prayed three times in Gethsemane 'saying the same words again' (Matthew 26:44)."
3. "The Pagans thought that by endless repetitions and many words they would inform their gods as to their needs and weary them ('fatigare deos') into granting their requests."

### John Gill:
1. "Saying the same things over and over again, as the Heathens do, as the worshippers of Baal, from morning till noon." 
2. "This our Lord observes, to dissuade from such practices, because the Gentiles, who were odious to the Jews, used them, and the Jews were guilty of the same."
3. "For they think they shall be heard for their much speaking; as did the Jews, who, under pretence of 'long prayers', devoured widows' houses."

### John Wesley:
1. "To repeat any words without meaning them, is certainly a vain repetition."
2. "We should be extremely careful in all our prayers to mean what we say; and to say only what we mean from the bottom of our hearts."
3. "Indeed all the words in the world are not equivalent to one holy desire."
