# Matthew 6:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Prayer is not about informing God of our needs, but about humbling ourselves and familiarizing ourselves with constant conversation with Him. It is an act that calms and purifies our hearts, making us more receptive to divine gifts and enlarging our capacity to receive blessings. While God already knows our needs, He encourages us to pray, linking His promised supplies to our petitions and inviting us to draw near and keep near to Him.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:

2. "The act of prayer calms and purifies our hearts, making them more receptive to the divine gifts that are poured out upon us spiritually." (August. de Serm. Dom. ii. 3 (14))
3. "Prayer enlarges our capacity to receive the blessings that God wants to bestow upon us." (Chrys. Hom. xix. 4, p. 249)

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Your Father knoweth what things ye have need of before ye ask him—and so needs not to be informed of our wants, any more than to be roused to attend to them by our incessant speaking." 
2. "What a view of God is here given, in sharp contrast with the gods of the heathen!"
3. "He will have His children pray to Him, and links all His promised supplies to their petitions for them; thus encouraging us to draw near and keep near to Him, to talk and walk with Him, to open our every case to Him."

### John Calvin:
1. "Whoever is convinced, that God not only cares for us, but knows all our wants, and anticipates our wishes and anxieties before we have stated them, will leave out vain repetitions."
2. "Believers do not pray, with the view of informing God about things unknown to him, or of exciting him to do his duty, or of urging him as though he were reluctant. On the contrary, they pray, in order that they may arouse themselves to seek him, that they may exercise their faith in meditating on his promises, that they may relieve themselves from their anxieties by pouring them into his bosom."
3. "God himself, on the other hand, has purposed freely, and without being asked, to bestow blessings upon us; but he promises that he will grant them to our prayers."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Therefore, because these things are heathen; the temptation to adopt or retain heathen worship will arise."
2. "Our prayers do not tell ‘our Father’ of our needs, but simply confess our consciousness of them, and our trust that He can and will supply them."
3. "Both of these feelings must precede answer to prayer. Hence the reason holds good against vain repetitions, not against childlike petitions."

### John Gill:
1. "Do not be imitators of them, and follow their ways, who have only the dim light of nature to guide them; it would be shameful in you to do as they do, when you have a divine revelation for your direction."
2. "Your Father knoweth what things ye have need of before ye ask him; and therefore have no need to make use of many words, or much speaking, or long prayers."
3. "The omniscience of God is a considerable argument, and a great encouragement to prayer; he knows our persons and our wants beforehand; and as he is able to help us, we have reason to believe he will; especially since he stands in the relation of a Father to us."

### John Wesley:
1. "We do not pray to inform God of our wants. Omniscient as he is, he cannot be informed of any thing which he knew not before."
2. "The chief thing wanting is, a fit disposition on our part to receive his grace and blessing."
3. "Consequently, one great office of prayer is, to produce such a disposition in us: to exercise our dependence on God; to increase our desire of the things we ask for; to us so sensible of our wants, that we may never cease wrestling till we have prevailed for the blessing."
