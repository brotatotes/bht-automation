### John Calvin:
1. "Whoever is convinced, that God not only cares for us, but knows all our wants, and anticipates our wishes and anxieties before we have stated them, will leave out vain repetitions."
2. "Believers do not pray, with the view of informing God about things unknown to him, or of exciting him to do his duty, or of urging him as though he were reluctant. On the contrary, they pray, in order that they may arouse themselves to seek him, that they may exercise their faith in meditating on his promises."
3. "We must, therefore, maintain both of these truths, that He freely anticipates our wishes, and yet that we obtain by prayer what we ask."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Therefore, because these things are heathen; the temptation to adopt or retain heathen worship will arise." 
2. "Our prayers do not tell 'our Father' of our needs, but simply confess our consciousness of them, and our trust that He can and will supply them." 
3. "Both of these feelings must precede answer to prayer. Hence the reason holds good against vain repetitions, not against childlike petitions."

2. "The chief thing wanting is, a fit disposition on our part to receive his grace and blessing."
3. "Consequently, one great office of prayer is, to produce such a disposition in us: to exercise our dependence on God; to increase our desire of the things we ask for; to us so sensible of our wants, that we may never cease wrestling till we have prevailed for the blessing."
