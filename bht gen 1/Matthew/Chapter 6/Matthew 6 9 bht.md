## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The whole passage, Matthew 6:7-15, is digressive from the subject of the first part of this chapter, which is the discouragement of the performance of religious duties to be seen of men, and is resumed at Matthew 6:16."
2. "This strikes at the root of all pantheistic error, which regards the spirit of man as identical with the Spirit of God, and at the root of all Deism; testifying as it does our relation to and covenant dependence on our Heavenly Father."
3. "God’s Name is not merely His appellation, which we speak with the mouth, but also and principally the idea which we attach to it, His Being, as far as it is confessed, revealed, or known."
