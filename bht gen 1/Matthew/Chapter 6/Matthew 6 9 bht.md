# Matthew 6:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This verse captures the essence of the Lord's Prayer, which is characterized by its unity, completeness, and the all-encompassing spirit it contains. It addresses the essential desires of a praying heart, encompassing both divine promises and human sorrows and wants. By recognizing a personal God who is our Father through Christ, it rejects atheism, pantheism, and deism. This prayer, as dictated by Christ himself, serves as a universal and perfect model for how we ought to pray, with a deep desire for God to be known, honored, and loved by all intelligent beings in heaven and on earth.
