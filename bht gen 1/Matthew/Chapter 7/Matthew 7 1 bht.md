# Matthew 7:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Bible verse being described emphasizes the importance of refraining from harsh and unkind judgment, a disposition that leads to unjust and unlovely judgments upon others, violating the law of love. It is not intended to discard all distinction between good and evil but rather to warn against a spirit of criticism that delights in sifting out the faults of others. In light of God's more strict judgment, it is wise to reflect on the consequences of one's own judgment before passing sentence on others.

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "The thing here condemned is that disposition to look unfavorably on the character and actions of others, which leads invariably to the pronouncing of rash, unjust, and unlovely judgments upon them."
2. "No doubt it is the judgments so pronounced which are here spoken of; but what our Lord aims at is the spirit out of which they spring."
3. "It is the violation of the law of love involved in the exercise of a censorious disposition which alone is here condemned."

### John Calvin:
1. "This passage is altogether misapplied by those persons who would desire to make that moderation, which Christ recommends, a pretence for setting aside all distinction between good and evil."
2. "We are not only permitted, but are even bound, to condemn all sins; unless we choose to rebel against God himself, â€” nay, to repeal his laws, to reverse his decisions, and to overturn his judgment-seat."
3. "He denounces a punishment against those severe judges, who take so much delight in sifting the faults of others. They will not be treated by others with greater kindness, but will experience, in their turn, the same severity which they had exercised towards others."

1. "Judge not. This refers to harsh, unkind judgment, not to the mere formation of private opinion, or to judicial sentences."

### John Gill:
1. "This is not to be understood of any sort of judgment; not of judgment in the civil courts of judicature, by proper magistrates, which ought to be made and pass, according to the nature of the case."
2. "But of rash judgment, interpreting men's words and deeds to the worst sense, and censuring them in a very severe manner; even passing sentence on them, with respect to their eternal state and condition."
3. "It would be well, if persons subject to a censorious spirit, would put themselves in the case and circumstances the persons are in they judge; and then consider, what judgment they would choose others should pass on them."
