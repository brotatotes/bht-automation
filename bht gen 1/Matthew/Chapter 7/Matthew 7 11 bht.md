# Matthew 7:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
If we, as fallen humans, know how to give good gifts to our children, how much more will our Father in heaven, who is omniscient and omnipotent, provide for us? This argument from the lesser to the greater assures us that God, our Father, knows our needs and is able to supply all our needs. Not only does He provide for our physical needs, but He also lavishes us with every spiritual blessing. As His children, our responsibility is to imitate the goodness and love of our Heavenly Father.
