## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "This is the substance of all relative duty; all Scripture in a nutshell." 
2. "It is true that similar maxims are found floating in the writings of the cultivated Greeks and Romans, and naturally enough in the Rabbinical writings. But so expressed as it is here—in immediate connection with, and as the sum of such duties as has been just enjoined, and such principles as had been before taught—it is to be found nowhere else."
3. "The righteousness of the kingdom," so amply described, both in principle and in detail, would be seen to involve self-sacrifice at every step. Multitudes would never face this. But it must be faced, else the consequences will be fatal."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Not, 'do these things,' as the order of the common version suggests; but, 'after this manner do ye also.' Not, do to others what we would have them do to us (this might become mere barter); but, do to them what we think they would wish to have done to them."

2. "The Golden Rule, though not without parallels in heathen ethics (in a negative form), is distinctively Christian. (1) It presents God's benevolence as the guide of duty. (2) Hence it is positive (Do all the good you can to your neighbor), not negative (as the Rabbinical sentence: 'Do not to your neighbor what is odious to you, for this is the whole law'). (3) It is taught by One who wrought as well as taught 'righteousness,' who died that we might 'even so do also.'"

3. "The powerless teacher of correct ethics makes our case the more hopeless (comp. Romans 3:19; Romans 7:7-14); but Christ is 'the Power of God,' as well as 'the Wisdom of God' (1 Corinthians 1:24)."

### John Wesley:
1. "This verse is often referred to as the 'Golden Rule' and serves as a foundational principle for ethical behavior. It calls for treating others with the same kindness, respect, and fairness that we desire for ourselves."

2. "Luke 6:31 challenges us to go beyond mere tolerance and actively seek the well-being of others. It encourages us to put ourselves in someone else's shoes and consider how our actions might impact them."

3. "The beauty of this verse lies in its simplicity. It reminds us that our interactions with others should be guided by love and empathy, transcending differences and promoting unity."
