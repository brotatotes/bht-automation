## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Enter ye in at the strait gate—as if hardly wide enough to admit one at all. This expresses the difficulty of the first right step in religion, involving, as it does, a triumph over all our natural inclinations."
2. "Hence the still stronger expression in Luke ( :-), 'Strive to enter in at the strait gate.'"
3. "For wide is the gate—easily entered. And broad is the way—easily trodden. That leadeth to destruction, and thus lured 'many there be which go in thereat.'"

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Strait gate [στενης πυλης] . Rev., narrow."
2. "Seest thou not, then, a little door, and a way before the door, which is not much crowded, but very few travel it? This is the way which leadeth into true culture."
3. "Note that the gate is not at the end, but at the beginning of the road."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The 'gate' is mentioned first; the way afterwards. It is the entrance gate at the beginning of the journey of life (the way), not the gate of heaven at the close."
2. "More attractive, more easy to find, and to follow. A reason ('for') why we must be exhorted to enter in by the narrow gate. To follow our natural tendencies is to pursue the broad way."
3. "The way leads to this; in one sense it is this already. Carnal Judaism led to the destruction of Jerusalem. Carnal Christianity passes on to similar judgment."

### John Gill:
1. "By the 'strait gate' is meant Christ himself; who elsewhere calls himself 'the door'... as there will be hereafter an abundant entrance into the kingdom and glory of God, through his blood and righteousness."
2. "Entering in at it is by faith, and making a profession of it: hence it follows, that faith is not the gate itself, but the grace, by which men enter in at the right door, and walk on in Christ, as they begin with him."
3. "There is no difficulty in finding out, or entering in at, or walking in the way of sin, which leads to eternal ruin... but its end is destruction."

### John Wesley:
1. "The strait gate - The holiness described in the foregoing chapters. And this is the narrow way." This quote highlights that the "strait gate" refers to the path of holiness described in the previous chapters, emphasizing the importance of living a righteous life.

2. "Wide is the gate, and many there are that go in through it - They need not seek for this; they come to it of course." This quote suggests that the wide gate represents the easy and popular path that many people naturally follow without seeking it, indicating the allure of worldly pleasures and temptations.

3. "Many go in through it because strait is the other gate - Therefore they do not care for it; they like a wider gate." This quote explains that people choose the wide gate because they perceive the narrow gate as difficult and restrictive, showing their preference for an easier and more comfortable path.
