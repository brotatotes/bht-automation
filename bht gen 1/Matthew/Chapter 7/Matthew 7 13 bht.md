# Matthew 7:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse being described is about the strait gate and the broad way. Commentators highlight the difficulty of entering the strait gate, which represents the first step in religion and requires a triumph over natural inclinations. It is a narrow and compressed entrance at the beginning of the journey of life. In contrast, the wide gate is easily entered and represents indulgence in carnal desires and worldly pleasures. Many choose this broad way, which accommodates their desires and leads to destruction. The verse emphasizes the choice between the challenging path of righteousness and the easier path of self-gratification.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Enter ye in at the strait gate—as if hardly wide enough to admit one at all. This expresses the difficulty of the first right step in religion, involving, as it does, a triumph over all our natural inclinations." 
2. "Hence the still stronger expression in Luke, 'Strive to enter in at the strait gate.'" 
3. "For wide is the gate—easily entered. And broad is the way—easily trodden. That leadeth to destruction, and thus lured 'many there be which go in thereat.'"

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Strait gate [στενης πυλης] . Rev., narrow."
2. "Seest thou not, then, a little door, and a way before the door, which is not much crowded, but very few travel it? This is the way which leadeth into true culture."
3. "Note that the gate is not at the end, but at the beginning of the road."

### John Calvin:
1. "As nothing is more opposed to the flesh than the doctrine of Christ, no man will ever make great proficiency in it who has not learned to confine his senses and feelings, so as to keep them within those boundaries, which our heavenly Teacher prescribes for curbing our wantonness."
2. "But as it is difficult to restrain our desires from wicked licentiousness and disorder, he soothes this bitterness by a joyful remuneration, when he tells us, that the narrow gate, and the narrow road, lead to life."
3. "For whence does it arise, that each of them knowingly and wilfully rushes headlong, but because, while they are ruined in the midst of a vast crowd, they do not believe that they are ruined?"

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The ‘gate’ is mentioned first; the way afterwards. It is the entrance gate at the beginning of the journey of life (the way), not the gate of heaven at the close."
2. "Repentance, faith, humility, self-denial, poverty in spirit, the righteousness of Christ; the last is probably the best sense, in contrast with the self-righteousness of the Pharisees."
3. "To follow our natural tendencies is to pursue the broad way. Destruction. The way leads to this; in one sense it is this already."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "The narrow gate" is repeated in verse Matthew 7:14 and straitened the way (τεθλιμμενη η οδος) added. The way is "compressed," narrowed as in a defile between high rocks, a tight place like στενοχωρια in Romans 8:35.
2. "The way that leads to life involves straits and afflictions" (McNeile).
3. "The broad way" (ευρυχωρος) is in every city, town, village, with the glaring white lights that lure to destruction.

### John Gill:
1. "By the 'strait gate' is meant Christ himself; who elsewhere calls himself 'the door'... as there will be hereafter an abundant entrance into the kingdom and glory of God, through his blood and righteousness."
2. "This is called 'strait'; because faith in Christ, a profession of it, and a life and conversation agreeable to it, are attended with many afflictions, temptations, reproaches, and persecutions."
3. "For wide is the gate, and broad is the way, that leadeth to destruction... The gate of carnal lusts, and worldly pleasures, stands wide open, and many there be which go in thereat; even all men in a state of nature; the way of the ungodly is 'broad', smooth, easy, and every way agreeable to the flesh; it takes in a large compass of vices, and has in it abundance of company; but its end is destruction."

### John Wesley:
1. "The strait gate represents the path of holiness and righteousness that is described in the preceding chapters. It is a narrow way, not easily found or followed." 

2. "The wide gate, on the other hand, is easily accessible and attracts many people. It requires no effort or seeking, as it is the default choice for those who do not value the narrow path of righteousness." 

3. "The fact that many choose the wide gate is a reflection of their indifference towards the strait gate. They prefer a broader path that accommodates their desires and allows for a more comfortable journey."
