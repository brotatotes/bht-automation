# Matthew 7:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Bible verse describes two paths: one narrow and difficult, leading to life; and one broad and easy, leading to destruction. The narrow path involves self-denial and constant conflict, but it is the way to eternal life. Many neglect this path, preferring the broad way which offers ease and company, but ultimately leads to destruction. Despite its hardships, the narrow path is a recommendation from God, who desires all to come to the knowledge of truth but laments that so few will come to Christ to have life.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The reason why so many perish is not that it is so ordained by God, who will have all to come to the knowledge of the truth, but because so few will come to Christ, that they may have life."
2. "The reason why the way to destruction is so broad, is because so few find their way into the narrow path of life."
3. "The reading τί (adopted by Lachmann, Tregelles, Meyer, De Wette) will not bear the signification commonly assigned to it, ‘How narrow is the gate?’ And the interrogative meaning (Meyer) is inconsistent with ὀλίγοι εἰσίν, which follows."

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "The recommendation of the broad way is the ease with which it is trodden and the abundance of company to be found in it."
2. "The one disadvantage of this course is its end—it 'leadeth to destruction.'"
3. "The disadvantage of [the narrow way] lies in its narrowness and solicitude. Its very first step involves a revolution in all our purposes and plans for life, and a surrender of all that is dear to natural inclination."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Straitened (lit, ‘pressed together’) is the way." 
2. "The Christian course continues difficult, is a constant conflict and self-denial, but it leadeth unto life." 
3. "The way to destruction is broad ‘because’ it is used by so many."

### John Gill:
1. "The way is unpleasant to the flesh to walk in, being hedged up on each side with afflictions and tribulations."
2. "The great encouragement to walk on in it is, because it is that way which leadeth unto life: unto eternal life."
3. "The gate is strait; small and little, and so unobserved: there is but one way to heaven, and the generality of men neglect it."
