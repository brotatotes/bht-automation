# Matthew 7:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, commentators describe two contrasting paths. One commentator speaks of the attractiveness and popularity of the broad way, highlighting how easy it is to follow and the abundance of companionship. However, they also point out that this path leads to destruction. Another commentator emphasizes the narrowness and challenges of the narrow way, requiring a change in one's entire life and surrendering personal inclinations. Yet, this path leads to life. Additionally, they note that few find this path, not due to its difficulty, but because it is not desired by many.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "The recommendation of the broad way is the ease with which it is trodden and the abundance of company to be found in it."
2. "The one disadvantage of this course is its end—it 'leadeth to destruction.'"
3. "The disadvantage of [the narrow way] lies in its narrowness and solicitude. Its very first step involves a revolution in all our purposes and plans for life, and a surrender of all that is dear to natural inclination, while all that follows is but a repetition of the first great act of self-sacrifice."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Straitened is the way. Even after we pass through the gate the Christian course continues difficult, is a constant conflict and self-denial, but it leadeth unto life." 
2. "The way to destruction is broad 'because' it is used by so many." 
3. "Few are they that find the straitened way. It is not even discovered by most, much less entered upon. This not because God has made it so 'strait,' but because so few desire to find it."
