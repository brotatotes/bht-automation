# Matthew 7:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Beware of those who come as guides, but are wolves in sheep's clothing. False prophets and teachers, appearing sanctimonious on the outside, but inwardly driven by greed and self-interest. They deceive by assuming the appearance of holiness while leading others astray from the true path. Stay vigilant and be cautious of those who twist the true teachings and seek to devour the flock for their own ends. Guard your faith and follow the guidance of faithful ministers.
