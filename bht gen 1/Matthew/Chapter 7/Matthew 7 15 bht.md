# Matthew 7:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Beware of the danger posed by false prophets who come with an outward appearance of gentleness and righteousness but inwardly are intent on misleading and exploiting. These teachers, though claiming to guide towards salvation, bring false doctrines and seek personal gain. They target the disciples of Christ with their deceptive teachings, masquerading as messengers of truth while feeding on the innocence and trust of the unsuspecting. Remain vigilant to discern and reject their harmful influence, for they offer a wide path that leads away from the narrow way of God.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Beware of false prophets - that is, of teachers coming as authorized expounders of the mind of God and guides to heaven."
2. "They come to you in sheep's clothing - with a bland, gentle, plausible exterior; persuading you that the gate is not strait nor the way narrow."
3. "But inwardly they are ravening wolves - bent on devouring the flock for their own ends."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "A false prophet is a teacher of incorrect doctrine, or one falsely and unjustly laying claims to divine inspiration."
2. "To come in sheep's clothing is to assume the appearance of sanctity and innocence, when the heart is evil."
3. "Ravening wolves... means that they assumed the appearance of holiness in order that they might the more readily get the property of the people."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Not only is the way straitened, but those who might leave the 'many' to find it are in danger from false teachers, such as would prevent them from finding it."
2. "'False prophets' are defined as those who come 'to you,' to the professed disciples of Christ; more anxious to proselyte and pervert in the Church than to convert in the world, more meddlesome than missionary in their activity."
3. "No allusion to the dress of the prophets, but referring to the harmless exterior, or to the external connection with God's flock."

### John Wesley:
1. "Beware of false prophets... it is their prophesying, their teaching the broad way, rather than their walking in it themselves, that is here chiefly spoken of."
2. "All those are false prophets, who teach any other way than that our Lord hath here marked out."
3. "In sheep's clothing... With outside religion and fair professions of love: Wolves - Not feeding, but destroying souls."
