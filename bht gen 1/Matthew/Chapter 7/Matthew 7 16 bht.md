# Matthew 7:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
By observing the fruits of someone's actions and teachings, we can discern their true character. This requires looking beyond mere words and focusing on the tangible outcomes produced. The importance of genuine repentance and transformation is emphasized as the true test of a prophet's authenticity. False prophets may contain elements of truth in their words, but they lack the authority and anointing of the Holy Spirit. Their intentions are not aligned with turning people towards God.

"When doctrines are contrary to the perfections of God, repugnant to the Scriptures of truth, tend to depreciate the person and offices, blood, righteousness, and sacrifice of Christ, to lessen the glory of God's grace, to exalt the creature, and to fill men's minds with notions of the purity, self-sufficiency, and ability of human nature; when they are calculated to feed the pride and vanity of men, to get money, and gain applause, to serve their own interests, and gratify men's lusts and passions, they may be easily discerned who they are, and from whence they come."
3. "The meaning of our Lord is, that from the false doctrines of men comes no good fruit of faith, holiness, joy, peace, and comfort.
