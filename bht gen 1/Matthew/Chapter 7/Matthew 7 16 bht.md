# Matthew 7:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
By their fruits ye shall know them. This simple rule allows even those with limited understanding to discern between true and false prophets. It emphasizes the importance of the actions and impact of individuals rather than relying solely on deep reasoning or intellectual prowess. True prophets convert sinners to God, bringing about genuine transformation in the lives of those they minister to. On the other hand, false prophets lack the power to bring about meaningful change or spiritual growth in individuals, failing to turn people away from the influence of Satan and towards God.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Ye shall know them by their fruits—not their doctrines—as many of the elder interpreters and some later ones explain it—for that corresponds to the tree itself; but the practical effect of their teaching, which is the proper fruit of the tree." 
2. "Do men gather grapes of thorns—any kind of prickly plant. or figs of thistles?—a three-pronged variety." 
3. "The general sense is obvious—Every tree bears its own fruit."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Ye shall know [επιγνωσεσθε] . The compound verb indicates full knowledge."
2. "Character is satisfactorily tested by its fruits."

These quotes emphasize the idea that true knowledge goes beyond mere understanding and involves a deep, experiential knowledge. It suggests that knowledge is not just intellectual, but also practical and transformative.

3. "Character is satisfactorily tested by its fruits."

This quote highlights the importance of actions and outcomes as indicators of one's character. It implies that true knowledge should lead to positive and fruitful results in one's life.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "By their fruits ye shall know them. This order is more emphatic."
2. "From teachers we are to look for valuable fruit; but false teachers can only bear after their kind."
3. "The main point is, however, the impossibility of getting good fruit from 'fruitless and forbidding plants.'"

### John Wesley:
1. "By their fruits ye shall know them" - This simple rule allows even those with limited understanding to discern between true and false prophets. It emphasizes the importance of the actions and impact of individuals rather than relying solely on deep reasoning or intellectual prowess.

2. "True prophets convert sinners to God" - The true measure of a prophet's authenticity lies in their ability to bring about genuine transformation in the lives of those they minister to. Their words and actions should lead people to a deeper relationship with God.

3. "False prophets do not" - On the other hand, false prophets lack the power to bring about meaningful change or spiritual growth in individuals. Even if their words may contain elements of truth, their lack of genuine spiritual authority is evident in their inability to turn people away from the influence of Satan and towards God.
