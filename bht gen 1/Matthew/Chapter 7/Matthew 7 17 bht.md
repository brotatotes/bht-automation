# Matthew 7:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This verse teaches us that the character of a tree determines the quality of its fruit. Just as a corrupt tree cannot produce good fruit, a good tree consistently produces good fruit. Our actions are a reflection of our character, and the fruit we bear reveals our true nature. The emphasis is on the inherent nature and moral results of our actions, which are manifestations of our character. As the tree is, so is its fruit, and this principle holds true in the moral world.
