# Matthew 7:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we are reminded of the consequences of our judgment towards others. Harsh judgment not only invites judgment upon ourselves in the future, but it also results in social isolation in the present. Our own judgments become the measure by which God will judge us, reflecting the idea that we choose whether God's judgment will be severe or merciful. Those who show mercy will receive mercy, while those who lack mercy will face judgment without mercy. These words serve as a solemn reminder of the importance of kindness and compassion in our interactions with others.
