### Philip Schaff:
1. "Fruits, If in this case not 'actions,' as usually, the actions of the false teachers were decisive as to their character, there would be little danger of their deceiving others." 
2. "Acts seemingly virtuous are often nothing more than the sheep's clothing in which the wolf wraps himself in order that he may deceive and devour the sheep." 
3. "Their influence, the moral effect of their teaching, is meant. Their acts may be included, and also the influence exerted upon the doctrinal belief of others; not their own doctrines, however, which form the tree in a certain sense."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "The fruit of a tree is the true test of its nature. In the same way, the actions and behavior of a person reveal their true character. Good actions are the fruit of a good heart, while bad actions are the fruit of a corrupt heart."

1. "The sum of the whole is, that ordinarily, and generally speaking, as men are, so are the doctrines they preach, and by them they may be known, and judged to be what they are."
2. "Christ here, and in the preceding verses, is speaking not of men of bad lives and conversations, who take upon them to teach others; for there is not so much reason to caution good men against these; they are easily detected, and generally discarded."
3. "But of men that put on sheep's clothing, who pretended to much holiness of life and conversation, and strictness of religion; and under that disguise delivered out the most corrupt and unwholesome doctrines; which tended greatly to depreciate him and his grace, and to do damage to the souls of men."
