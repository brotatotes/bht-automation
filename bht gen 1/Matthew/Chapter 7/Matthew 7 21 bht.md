# Matthew 7:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, there is a distinction made between mere talk and genuine action in relation to one's faith. It emphasizes that a mere profession of faith is not enough, but rather, true discipleship is shown through obeying the will of God. Those who call themselves followers of Christ should not only acknowledge Him as Lord, but also live in submission to His authority and do His will. This verse exposes the danger of empty words and highlights the importance of genuine, obedient discipleship.
