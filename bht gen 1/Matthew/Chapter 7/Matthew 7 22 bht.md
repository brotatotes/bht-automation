# Matthew 7:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In a future moment, individuals claiming to be prophets or pious will be tested, as their true nature will be revealed. The verse describes the self-conceit and self-deception of these pretenders, who will beg for help and defend themselves by pointing to their supposed prophesying and performing of miracles, though these external displays do not guarantee salvation. Ultimately, on the day of judgment, many will disown the Lord, realizing they had no real claim on Him, despite their outward acts and declarations.

1. "Many of them 'will say to me'; to Christ, who will appear then as the judge of quick and dead, to which he is ordained by his Father, Lord, Lord; not 'my Lord, my Lord', as the Syriac version reads it; for they will not be able to claim any interest in him, though they will be obliged to own his dominion, power, and authority over them."
2. "Their pleas follow; have we not prophesied in thy name? This may be understood either of foretelling things to come; which gift wicked men may have, who have never had any experience of the grace of God, as Balaam, and Caiaphas, and others; or rather of preaching the word, which is sometimes called prophesying, Romans 12:6 and which may be done in the name of Christ, pretending mission and authority from him, and to be preachers of him, and yet be no better than 'sounding brass', or 'a tinkling cymbal'; yea, nothing at all as to true grace, or spiritual experience."
3. "An awful consideration it is, that men should be able to cast out devils, and at last be cast to the devil. And in thy name done many wonderful works? that is, many miracles; not one, or a few only, but many; such as speaking with tongues, removing mountains, treading on serpents and scorpions, and drinking any deadly thing without hurt, and healing all manner of diseases and sicknesses."

### John Wesley:
1. "We have prophesied - We have declared the mysteries of thy kingdom, wrote books; preached excellent sermons." 
2. "In thy name done many wonderful works - So that even the working of miracles is no proof that a man has saving faith." 
3. "Even the most impressive outward displays of faith, such as prophesying and performing miracles, do not guarantee a person's salvation."
