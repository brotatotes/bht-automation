# Matthew 7:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, Jesus speaks of a future day of judgment, when individuals will come before Him and make claims pertaining to their religious deeds and supernatural abilities. Some will boast about prophesying and performing miracles in His name, while others will emphasize their devotion. However, Jesus exposes the self-deception and arrogance behind these claims, warning that genuine righteousness cannot be determined solely by outward actions or gifts. This passage teaches us that true faith and righteousness are not based on the quantity of religious activities or supernatural experiences, but rather on a sincere and authentic relationship with Christ.

2. "Their pleas follow; have we not prophesied in thy name? This may be understood either of foretelling things to come; which gift wicked men may have, who have never had any experience of the grace of God, as Balaam, and Caiaphas, and others; or rather of preaching the word, which is sometimes called prophesying, Romans 12:6 and which may be done in the name of Christ, pretending mission and authority from him, and to be preachers of him, and yet be no better than 'sounding brass', or 'a tinkling cymbal'; yea, nothing at all as to true grace, or spiritual experience."
3. "An awful consideration it is, that men should be able to cast out devils, and at last be cast to the devil. And in thy name done many wonderful works? that is, many miracles; not one, or a few only, but many; such as speaking with tongues, removing mountains, treading on serpents and scorpions, and drinking any deadly thing without hurt, and healing all manner of diseases and sicknesses."
