# Matthew 7:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse being described is a powerful warning from Jesus, wherein He denies any knowledge of those claiming intimacy with Him and commands them to depart. Commentators remark on the significance of these words, emphasizing that these individuals were never truly known by Christ and that their claims of familiarity were empty.

The verse serves as a reminder to examine our hearts and ensure that our faith is not merely superficial, but rooted in true repentance and transformation.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "I never knew you" - What they claimed - intimacy with Christ - is just what He repudiates, and with a certain scornful dignity. "Our acquaintance was not broken off - there never was any."

2. "Depart from me" - The connection here gives these words an awful significance. They claimed intimacy with Christ, and in the corresponding passage, Matthew 25:41, are represented as having gone out and in with Him on familiar terms. "So much the worse for you," He replies: "I bore with that long enough; but now - begone!"

3. "Ye that work iniquity" - They are represented as fresh from the scenes and acts of it as they stand before the Judge. That the apostle alludes to these very words in Matthew 25:41, there can hardly be any doubt - "Nevertheless the foundation of God standeth sure, having this seal, The Lord knoweth them that are His. And, Let everyone that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "I never knew you - That is, I never approved of your conduct; never loved you; never regarded you as my friends."
2. "This proves that, with all their pretensions, they had never been true followers of Christ."
3. "Whatever might have been their pretended joys, their raptures, their hopes, their self-confidence, their visions, their zeal, they had never been regarded by the Saviour as his true friends."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Profess [ομολογησω]. The word which is used elsewhere of open confession of Christ before men (Matthew 10:32; Romans 10:9); of John's public declaration that he was not the Christ (John 1:20); of Herod 's promise to Salome in the presence of his guests (Matthew 14:7). Hence, therefore, of Christ 's open, public declaration as Judge of the world." 
2. "The picture is not of two men deliberately selecting foundations, but it contrasts one who carefully chooses and prepares his foundation with one who builds at hap - hazard."
3. "The abrupt style of ver. 25 pictures the sudden coming of the storm which sweeps away the house on the sand: 'Descended the rain, and came the floods, and blew the winds.'"

### Philip Schaff:
1. "They make false professions, but 'I will tell them the plain truth.'"
2. "They had not fallen away, they had never been called by Christ, though called by His name, and calling on His name. Intimate knowledge of persons implies sympathy and similarity."
3. "The seeming success of a hypocrite is habitual and heightened iniquity. Important for self-examinations."

### John Wesley:
1. "I never knew you" - This phrase implies that there was never a genuine relationship or intimacy between the individuals and God. It suggests that mere religious activity or outward appearances are not enough to secure salvation.

2. "There never was a time that I approved of you" - This statement emphasizes that God's approval is not based on works alone, but on a personal and authentic connection with Him. It highlights the importance of a heart transformed by faith and obedience.

3. "As many souls as they had saved, they were themselves never saved from their sins" - This phrase highlights the danger of focusing solely on outward acts of service without addressing one's own spiritual condition. It reminds us that true salvation involves personal repentance and deliverance from sin.
