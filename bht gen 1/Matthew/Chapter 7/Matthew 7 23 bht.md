# Matthew 7:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, Jesus exposes the deceptive claims of certain individuals who professed allegiance to Him. Their mere confession of faith without a genuine relationship with Him is rebuked. Despite their outward displays of religious acts, miracles, and preaching, they were not truly His disciples. Jesus, as the omniscient Judge, sees through their false profession and declares that He never had an intimate knowledge of or affection for them. Their departure from His presence and their destiny of everlasting punishment serve as a solemn reminder of the importance of sincere devotion and true transformation in one's relationship with God.

1. "Profess [ομολογησω] . The word which is used elsewhere of open confession of Christ before men (Matthew 10:32; Romans 10:9); of John's public declaration that he was not the Christ (John 1:20); of Herod 's promise to Salome in the presence of his guests (Matthew 14:7).

It reminds us that true salvation involves a personal encounter with God that leads to a genuine change of heart and a turning away from sin.
