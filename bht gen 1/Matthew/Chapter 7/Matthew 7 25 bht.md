# Matthew 7:25 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the vivid imagery of rain, floods, and winds symbolize the many trials and challenges that believers face in life. The solid foundation, represented by the rock, refers to the importance of having a strong faith in God. These commentators also suggest that the temptations of Satan, the persecutions of the world, and the corruptions of one's own heart can be seen as the rain, floods, and winds that beat upon believers. Despite these trials, those who have a firm foundation in their faith can withstand them and remain steadfast.

### John Gill:
1. "These several metaphors of 'rain', 'floods', 'stream', and 'winds', may design the temptations of Satan, the persecutions of the world, the corruptions of a man's own heart, and the errors and false doctrines of men." 

2. "He shall be made able to bear the whole force of it; the gates of hell cannot prevail against him; the floods of persecution may be cast after him, but shall not carry him away; the stream of corruption may run strong against him, yet shall not overset him; and the wind of divers and strange doctrines may blow hard upon him, but not cast him down." 

3. "He may be shaken by them, but not so as to be removed off of the foundation, on which he is laid; yea, he may fail from some degree of the steadfastness of his faith, but not so as to fail totally and finally."
