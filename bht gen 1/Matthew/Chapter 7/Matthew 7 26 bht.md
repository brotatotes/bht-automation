# Matthew 7:26 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, we are reminded that true wisdom lies not only in hearing the teachings of Jesus, but in actively living them out. It cautions against building our faith on a weak foundation, likened to a house built on sand, which symbolizes superficiality and externalities. Instead, it calls for a genuine, transformative relationship with God, one that goes beyond empty professions and outward rituals. This verse teaches us that true salvation is found in the solid rock of Christ, rather than the shifting sands of human accomplishments.
