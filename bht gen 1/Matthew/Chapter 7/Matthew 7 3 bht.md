# Matthew 7:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we are reminded not to be quick to judge or condemn others for their imperfections. Instead, we should first examine our own lives and address our own shortcomings. The metaphor of a mote in our brother's eye represents the small faults or shortcomings that we tend to focus on and criticize in others, while the beam in our own eye symbolizes the larger faults or sins that we often overlook in ourselves. This verse challenges us to practice self-reflection, humility, and grace when approaching others, rather than adopting a critical and judgmental attitude.
