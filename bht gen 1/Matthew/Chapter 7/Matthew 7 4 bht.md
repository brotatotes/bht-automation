1. "With what face canst thou say to thy friend or neighbour, let me pull out the mote out of thine eye? Give me leave to rebuke thee sharply for thy sin, as it deserves, and behold a beam is in thine own eye; thou art guilty of a far greater iniquity: astonishing impudence!"
2. "Art thou so blind, as not to see and observe thy viler wickedness? Or which, if conscious of, how canst thou prevail upon thyself to take upon thee to reprove and censure others?"
