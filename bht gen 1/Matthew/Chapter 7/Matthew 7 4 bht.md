## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "This verse highlights the hypocrisy of judging others while being blind to our own faults. It reminds us to examine ourselves before pointing out the flaws in others."
2. "The imagery of a mote and a beam emphasizes the drastic difference in scale between the speck in someone else's eye and the log in our own. It urges us to focus on our own shortcomings rather than being quick to criticize others."
3. "By using this analogy, Jesus teaches us the importance of humility and self-reflection. It encourages us to approach others with grace and understanding, recognizing that we too are imperfect and in need of forgiveness."

### John Gill:
1. "With what face canst thou say to thy friend or neighbour, let me pull out the mote out of thine eye? Give me leave to rebuke thee sharply for thy sin, as it deserves, and behold a beam is in thine own eye; thou art guilty of a far greater iniquity: astonishing impudence!"
2. "Art thou so blind, as not to see and observe thy viler wickedness? Or which, if conscious of, how canst thou prevail upon thyself to take upon thee to reprove and censure others?"
3. "Dost thou think thy brother cannot see thy beam? And may he not justly retort thine iniquities upon thee, which exceed his? And then what success canst thou promise thyself?"

### John Wesley:
1. "This question from the Pharisees challenges the authority of Jesus and questions his ability to perform miracles. It reveals their skepticism and disbelief in his power."
2. "By asking 'With what face?' the Pharisees are essentially asking Jesus to provide proof or evidence of his authority. They are demanding a sign that will validate his claims."
3. "This question also exposes the Pharisees' lack of faith. They are not open to the possibility of Jesus being the Messiah and are looking for reasons to discredit him."
