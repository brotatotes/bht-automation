# Matthew 7:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, Jesus admonishes against hypocrisy and urges self-reflection before offering correction to others. Commentators note that the hypocrite is like a doctor who seizes a position of authority but neglects to tend to the patient's condition. They emphasize the importance of removing the beam from one's own eye before attempting to help others with their faults. The goal is not just to detect faults, but to offer genuine correction through love, friendship, and a purified lens of self-awareness. By addressing our own shortcomings, we can then see clearly and effectively assist others in their growth.
