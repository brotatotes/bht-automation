## BHT:
The verse emphasizes the hypocrisy in appearing zealous for others' improvement while ignoring our own faults. It warns against judging others without first examining ourselves and removing our own flaws.

It underscores the significance of personal growth before engaging in the correction of others.

1. "The 'hypocrisy' which, not without indignation, He charges it with, consists in the pretense of a zealous and compassionate charity, which cannot possibly be real in one who suffers worse faults to lie uncorrected in himself."
2. "He only is fit to be a reprover of others who jealously and severely judges himself."
3. "Such persons will not only be slow to undertake the office of censor on their neighbors, but, when constrained in faithfulness to deal with them, will make it evident that they do it with reluctance and not satisfaction, with moderation and not exaggeration, with love and not harshness."

### Marvin Vincent:

3. "To cast out [εκβαλειν] . The Lord 's words assume that the object of scrutiny is not only nor mainly detection, but correction. Hence thou shalt see clearly, not the mote, but to cast out the mote."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Such action is hypocrisy before God and before the conscience also."
