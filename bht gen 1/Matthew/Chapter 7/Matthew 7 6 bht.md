## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:

### Albert Barnes:
1. "By some the word 'holy' has been supposed to mean 'flesh offered in sacrifice,' made holy, or separated to a sacred use; but it probably means here 'anything connected with religion' - admonition, precept, or doctrine."
2. "'Dogs' signify people who spurn, oppose, and abuse that doctrine; people of special sourness and malignity of temper, who meet it like growling and quarrelsome curs."
3. "'Swine' denote those who would trample the precepts underfoot; people of impurity of life; those who are corrupt, polluted, profane, obscene, and sensual; those who would not know the value of the gospel, and who would tread it down as swine would pearls."

### Marvin Vincent:

### John Calvin:
1. "Christ reminds the Apostles, and, through them, all the teachers of the Gospel, to reserve the treasure of heavenly wisdom for the children of God alone, and not to expose it to unworthy and profane despisers of his word."

2. "Charity forbids that such persons should be immediately pronounced to be desperate. It ought to be understood, that dogs and swine are names given not to every kind of debauched men, or to those who are destitute of the fear of God and of true godliness, but to those who, by clear evidences, have manifested a hardened contempt of God, so that their disease appears to be incurable."

3. "There are two reasons, why Christ forbade that the Gospel should be offered to lost despisers. It is an open profanation of the mysteries of God to expose them to the taunts of wicked men. Another reason is, that Christ intended to comfort his disciples, that they might not cease to bestow their labors on the elect of God in teaching the Gospel, though they saw it wantonly rejected by wicked and ungodly men."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Harsh judgment and unwise correction of others were reproved...now comes a warning against laxity of judgment, childish ignorance of men." 
2. "The dogs and the swine were both unclean, the former probably represent what is 'low, unclean, heretical; the latter what is hostile, stubborn, and savage.'"
3. "The main reason urged is the defilement of what is precious; but the other danger follows. 'Even saving truth must be withheld from those who would surely reject it with contempt and savage hatred'."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "It is not that the dogs would not eat it, for it would be welcome to them; but that it would be a profanation to give it to them, thus to make it a skubalon, Exodus 22:31."
2. "Dogs are kin to wolves and infest the streets of oriental cities."
3. "Pearls look a bit like peas or acorns and would deceive the hogs until they discovered the deception."

### John Gill:
1. "Do not deliver or communicate the holy word of God, and the truths of the Gospel, to persons notoriously vile and sinful: to men... compared to 'dogs'; or to such... compared to swine." 

2. "Men should be cautious and prudent in rebuking and admonishing such persons for their sins, in whom there is no appearance or hope of success; yea, where there is danger of sustaining loss."

3. "Do not cast pearls before swine, nor deliver wisdom to him who knows not the excellency of it; for wisdom is better than pearls, and he that does not seek after it is worse than a swine."

### John Wesley:
1. "Give not - to dogs - lest turning they rend you: Cast not - to swine - lest they trample them under foot." 
2. "Talk not of the deep things of God to those whom you know to be wallowing in sin."
