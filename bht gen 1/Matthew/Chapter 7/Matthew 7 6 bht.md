# Matthew 7:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we are reminded not to share sacred and valuable truths with those who completely reject and despise them. We are cautioned against casting pearls, the priceless gems of Christianity, before those who are unable to appreciate their worth. Instead, we should exercise discernment and withhold the truths of God's word from those who would trample them underfoot and potentially turn against us. It is wise to refrain from sharing the deep things of God with those who persist in sin and are hostile towards the faith, as it may invite contempt and ridicule upon religion itself.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Give not that which is holy unto the dogs—savage or snarling haters of truth and righteousness. Neither cast ye your pearls before swine—the impure or coarse, who are incapable of appreciating the priceless jewels of Christianity." 
2. "Lest they trample them under their feet—as swine do. And turn again and rend you—as dogs do." 
3. "Religion is brought into contempt, and its professors insulted, when it is forced upon those who cannot value it and will not have it."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The two extremes often meet. The latter, no less than censoriousness, is an unwise attempt at the correction of others, and will be avoided by those who 'see clearly.'" 
2. "The dogs' and 'the swine' were both unclean, the former probably represent what is 'low, unclean, heretical; the latter what is hostile, stubborn, and savage.'"
3. "Even saving truth must be withheld from those who would surely reject it with contempt and savage hatred."

### John Gill:
1. "Do not deliver or communicate the holy word of God, and the truths of the Gospel, comparable to pearls, to persons notoriously vile and sinful."
2. "Men should be cautious and prudent in rebuking and admonishing such persons for their sins, in whom there is no appearance or hope of success."
3. "There is danger of sustaining loss if they trample the admonitions and reproofs given and turn again and rend you."

### John Wesley:
1. "Give not - to dogs - lest turning they rend you: Cast not - to swine - lest they trample them under foot." 
2. "Talk not of the deep things of God to those whom you know to be wallowing in sin." 
3. "Neither declare the great things God hath done for your soul to the profane, furious, persecuting wretches."
