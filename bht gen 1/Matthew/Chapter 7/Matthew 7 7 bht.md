# Matthew 7:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, there is a progression in our approach to prayer, from asking to seeking to knocking. Each action represents different aspects of our desires and needs. We are encouraged to have a full conviction that our prayers will be heard. Our prayers should be accompanied by faith and trust in God's grace. We should pray according to God's will, seeking His face and favor, and persevering with diligence and importunity.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The three similitudes are all to be understood of prayer." 
2. "They form a climax: ἀπὸ δὲ τοῦ κρούειν τὸ μετὰ σφοδρὀτητος προσιέναι καὶ μετὰ θερμῆς διανοίας ἐδήλωσε." 
3. "Chrys. Hom, xxiii. 4, p. 289."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you." - This verse presents a progression in our approach to God, from asking to seeking to knocking. Each action represents a different aspect of our desires and needs.

2. "We ask for what we wish; we seek for what we miss; we knock for that from which we feel ourselves shut out." - The commentary highlights that each action of asking, seeking, and knocking represents a different perspective on our relationship with God. We ask for what we desire, seek for what we lack, and knock for what we feel excluded from.

3. "To meet this, our Lord repeats the triple assurance He had just given, but in such a form as to silence every such complaint." - Jesus reassures us with a triple assurance of success in our efforts to approach God. This repetition serves to silence any doubts or complaints we may have about our relationship with Him.

### John Calvin:
1. "Nothing is better adapted to excite us to prayer than a full conviction that we shall be heard."
2. "Those who doubt can only pray in an indifferent manner; and prayer, unaccompanied by faith, is an idle and unmeaning ceremony."
3. "Each of us, trusting to the grace of Christ, will thus attain confidence in prayer, and will venture freely to call upon God."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The objection to connecting this verse with chap. Matthew 5:34, is that it must then refer to temporal things. At the same time it shows that the trust there spoken of is a prayerful trust."
2. "'Ask,' 'seek,' 'knock,' refer to prayer, forming a climax. The first implies simple petition, the second earnest desire, the third perseverance."
3. "'To ask, indicates the want of an object, which can only be obtained by free gift; to seek, that it has been lost; to knock, that it has been shut up hence this prayer, which is both the work of life and the evidence of life.'"

### John Gill:
1. "Such, who ask according to the will of God, in the name of Christ, and under the direction, guidance, and influence of the Spirit, who ask in faith and fear, and with submission to the divine will, shall have what they ask for; not as what they deserve, but as a free gift."
2. "Seek, and ye shall find. This is still meant of prayer, and of seeking God, his face and favour: which such shall find, who seek in a right way, by Christ, and with their whole hearts, diligently."
3. "Knock and it shall be opened unto you as beggars do, who use much importunity for relief and assistance. So men should stand and knock at the door of mercy, which will not always be shut against them."

### John Wesley:
1. "Pray for them, as well as for yourselves: in this there can be no such danger." 
2. "Add your own diligent endeavors to your asking." 
3. "Persevere importunately in that diligence."
