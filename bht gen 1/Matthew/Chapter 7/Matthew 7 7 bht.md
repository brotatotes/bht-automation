### Philip Schaff:
1. "The objection to connecting this verse with chap. Matthew 5:34, is that it must then refer to temporal things." 
2. "'Ask,' 'seek,' 'knock,' refer to prayer, forming a climax. The first implies simple petition, the second earnest desire, the third perseverance."
3. "'To ask, indicates the want of an object, which can only be obtained by free gift; to seek, that it has been lost; to knock, that it has been shut up hence this prayer, which is both the work of life and the evidence of life.'"

### John Gill:
1. "Such, who ask according to the will of God, in the name of Christ, and under the direction, guidance, and influence of the Spirit, who ask in faith and fear, and with submission to the divine will, shall have what they ask for; not as what they deserve, but as a free gift."
2. "This is still meant of prayer, and of seeking God, his face and favour: which such shall find, who seek in a right way, by Christ, and with their whole hearts, diligently."
3. "Faith in prayer is a key that opens this door, when a poor soul finds grace and mercy to help it in time of need."

### John Wesley:
1. "Pray for them, as well as for yourselves: in this there can be no such danger." 
2. "Add your own diligent endeavors to your asking." 
3. "Persevere importunately in that diligence."
