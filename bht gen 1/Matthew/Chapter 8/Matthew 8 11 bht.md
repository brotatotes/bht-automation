# Matthew 8:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we are presented with a vivid image of a banquet, where both Jews and Gentiles recline at table, symbolizing relaxation, fellowship, and the spread of faith. Through this, it is revealed that the Gentiles, represented as guests coming from the farthest parts of the earth, will partake in the same salvation as the faithful of the Old and New Testament. This passage also signifies the universal acceptance of the Gospel, closing off those who reject it and emphasizing the blessings granted to believers both in the present and the future.
