# Matthew 8:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, Jesus uses the faith of a Roman centurion as a means to declare that numerous pagans, representing the entire world, will be converted to the Gospel. This conversion will be akin to the belief and salvation of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. The description of these conversions mirrors the imagery of a joyful banquet in heaven, where both Jews and Gentiles, reclining together, partake in the blessings and eternal happiness of faith.
