# Matthew 8:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we are presented with a vivid depiction of exclusion and separation. The Jews, who were expected to be a part of the feast, are instead cast out from their ancestral home. This expulsion brings forth weeping, gnashing of teeth, and a future state of punishment. The mention of "outer darkness" emphasizes the consequences of rejecting God, a place of darkness and isolation, contrasting with the joy and fellowship found in His kingdom. Through this analogy, we see the urgency of responding to Jesus' message and avoiding the consequences of unbelief and rejection.
