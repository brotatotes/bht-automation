# Matthew 8:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, it is depicted that the natural heirs, who have rebelled, are disinherited and cast out into the outer darkness. They are the children of the kingdom, but they will be excluded from the feast or home of their patriarchal ancestors. This outer darkness is a place of weeping, gnashing of teeth, and thick blackness, representing the anguish and wretchedness of a future state of punishment. The Jews, who expected to enter the kingdom, will be driven out, making way for the admission of the Gentiles into the same body.
