2. "The disease in the text may have been an attack of tetanus, which the ancient physicians included under paralysis."
3. "It could hardly have been apoplexy, which usually bereaves of sensation."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "This showed decisively the goodness and power of Jesus. No miracle could be more complete. There could be no imposition or deception."
2. "To a plain reader, however, the narratives appear to be the same. They agree in the character of the person, the place, and apparently the time; in the same substantial structure of the account; in the expression of similar feelings, the same answers, and the same result."
3. "It should never be forgotten that 'the sacred narrative of an event is what it is stated to be by all the sacred writers; as the testimony in a court in which a case is decided is what is stated by all the credible witnesses, though one may have stated one circumstance and another another.'"
