# Matthew 8:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Where Christ tends, he heals. It is evident how graciously Christ pours out his grace when he finds the vessel of faith open. The faith of the master resulted in the healing of the servant. As Christ said, "let him be healed," the servant was healed, just as God said, "let there be light, and there was light." This cure was not only for the servant's sake but also for the master's benefit.
