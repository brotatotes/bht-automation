# Matthew 8:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, a woman is mentioned who is lying sick with a fever. Commentators describe her condition using words and phrases such as "burning or fiery illness," "severe," "sudden and severe attack," "raging and furious," and "very great height." This emphasizes the seriousness and intensity of her sickness. Additionally, the mention of Peter's wife's mother provides insights into the personal lives of the apostles and highlights Jesus' compassion and authority over sickness, as he heals not only those directly following him but also their loved ones.
