# Matthew 8:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse being described is a powerful and compassionate act of healing by Jesus. He often used outward signs to demonstrate His willingness and ability to heal, responding to faith. In this particular instance, He touches the hand of the one in need, showing His loving sympathy as the Great Physician. The healing not only restored physical health but also brought about gratitude and a desire to serve the Lord. Such miracles of healing had important reasons and served as a testament to Jesus' authority over diseases, just as He had authority over the elements.
