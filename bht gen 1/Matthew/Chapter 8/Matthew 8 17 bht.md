# Matthew 8:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, it is described how Jesus, through His suffering and compassion, took upon Himself the burden of our sins and diseases. The commentators emphasize that the word "took away" should be understood as "bore" and "carried," highlighting the sacrificial nature of Jesus' redemptive work. They also point out that the healing of physical ailments is connected to the spiritual healing brought about by Christ's atonement. By fulfilling these words in both a higher and lower sense, Jesus demonstrated His deep understanding of our struggles and His desire to bring complete restoration to our lives.
