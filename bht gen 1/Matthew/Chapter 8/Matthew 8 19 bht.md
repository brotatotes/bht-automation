### Henry Alford:

2. "Every such difficulty... is a valuable index and guide to the humble searcher after truth."
3. "It is one of those cases where the attempts of the Harmonists do violence to every principle of sound historical criticism."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "This scribe, like many others, was attracted to Jesus and desired to become his disciple. He expressed his willingness to follow Jesus wherever he went, indicating a strong commitment and dedication to the cause of Christ."

2. "However, Jesus knew the heart of this scribe and understood that his commitment might not be as genuine as it appeared. Jesus responded with a cautionary statement, reminding the scribe of the sacrifices and challenges that come with following him."

3. "Jesus wanted the scribe to understand that being a disciple meant more than just physical proximity to him. It required a complete surrender of one's will, desires, and ambitions to the will of God. Jesus wanted the scribe to count the cost and be fully aware of the commitment he was making."

4. "Jesus' response to the scribe serves as a reminder to all believers that following Christ is not a casual decision or a mere affiliation. It is a life-altering commitment that demands our wholehearted devotion and obedience."

### John Calvin:
1. "Whence arose the great readiness of the scribe to prepare himself immediately to accompany Christ, but from his not having at all considered the hard and wretched condition of his followers?"
2. "He wishes indeed to follow Christ, but dreams of an easy and agreeable life, and of dwellings filled with every convenience; whereas the disciples of Christ must walk among thorns, and march to the cross amidst uninterrupted afflictions."
3. "Let us therefore look upon ourselves as warned, in his person, not to boast lightly and at ease, that we will be the disciples of Christ, while we are taking no thought of the cross, or of afflictions."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "'One' is emphatic; either one disciple (Matthew 8:21) who was a scribe, or 'one scribe,' suggesting that it was rare for one of that class to be among his followers."
2. "Master, i.e., teacher, an important confession on the part of a scribe."
3. "I will follow thee, etc. Probably suggested by the fact that our Lord was about to 'depart.' But the proposal is to follow Jesus as a teacher and to faithfully adhere to Him."

### Archibald T Robertson:

### John Gill:
1. "One would have thought, that this man desired in good earnest to be a disciple of Christ, were it not for Christ's answer to him, who knew his heart."
2. "He, seeing the miracles which Christ wrought, and observing the fame of him among the people, began to think that he would be generally received as the Messiah; and by joining himself to him, promised himself much ease, honour, and wealth."
3. "He did not wait to be called to follow Christ, as the other disciples were, but offers himself to be one; that is, to be one of his intimates, one of his apostles; and besides, he rashly promises to do that, which he knew nothing of, and which in some cases is impossible to be done."

### John Wesley:
1. "Jesus' response to the man who declared his willingness to follow him wherever he went reveals the true cost of discipleship. Jesus does not sugarcoat the difficulties and sacrifices that come with following him. He challenges us to count the cost and be prepared to give up everything for the sake of the kingdom."

2. "The phrase 'foxes have dens and birds have nests, but the Son of Man has no place to lay his head' highlights the radical nature of Jesus' ministry. He lived a life of homelessness and dependence on God, showing us that true discipleship requires a willingness to let go of worldly comforts and security."

3. "Jesus' call to another man to 'follow me' is met with a request to first bury his father. Jesus' response, 'Let the dead bury their own dead, but you go and proclaim the kingdom of God,' emphasizes the urgency and priority of the kingdom over earthly obligations. It challenges us to prioritize our commitment to Christ above all else."
