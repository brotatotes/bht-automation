# Matthew 8:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we encounter a vivid portrayal of a loathsome, diffusive, and incurable disease that served as a poignant symbol of sin. The ceremonial rituals surrounding its detection and cleansing foreshadowed a coming remedy for sin and uncleanness. The encounter with the leper invites us to ponder the remarkable willingness of Jesus to heal, as the leper's worshipful display revealed. Furthermore, the command to remain silent about this miraculous encounter aimed to temper excitement and hostility, while shedding light on the complex interplay between miraculous power and miraculous love.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "All that needs be said here is that it was a cutaneous disease, of a loathsome, diffusive, and, there is reason to believe, when thoroughly pronounced, incurable character; that though in its distinctive features it is still found in several countries—as Arabia, Egypt, and South Africa—it prevailed, in the form of what is called white leprosy, to an unusual extent, and from a very early period, among the Hebrews; and that it thus furnished to the whole nation a familiar and affecting symbol of SIN, considered as (1) loathsome, (2) spreading, (3) incurable."
2. "And while the ceremonial ordinances for detection and cleansing prescribed in this case by the law of Moses held forth a coming remedy 'for sin and for uncleanness,' the numerous cases of leprosy with which our Lord came in contact, and the glorious cures of them which He wrought, were a fitting manifestation of the work which He came to accomplish."
3. "But of Christ's willingness to heal him he was not so sure. It needed more knowledge of Jesus than he could be supposed to have to assure him of that. But one thing he was sure of, that He had but to 'will' it. This shows with what 'worship' of Christ this leper fell on his face before Him."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Men more easily believe in miraculous power than in miraculous love" (Bruce).
2. "This is a condition of the third class (undetermined, but with prospect of being determined), a hopeful doubt at any rate."
3. "The command to 'tell no one' was to suppress excitement and prevent hostility."

### John Gill:
1. "He was a very lively emblem of a poor vile sinner, full of sin and iniquity, who is brought to see himself all over covered with sin, when he comes to Christ for pardon and cleansing; and is so considered by Christ the high priest, when he applies his justifying righteousness and sin purging blood to his conscience."
2. "This man came of his own accord, having heard of the fame of Christ; and worshipped him in a civil and respectful way, showing great reverence to him as a man; which he did by falling down on his knees, and on his face; prostrating himself before him, in a very humble and submissive manner."
3. "He was fully assured of his power, that he could make him clean, entirely rid him of his leprosy, which the priest could not do; who could only, according to the law, pronounce him clean, so that he might be admitted to company, but could not heal him of his disease."
