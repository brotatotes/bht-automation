# Matthew 8:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Bible verse being described is focused on the theme of leprosy and its symbolic representation of sin. Commentators highlight how leprosy was a loathsome and incurable disease, serving as a reminder of the defilement of sin upon humanity. Jesus encountered lepers and His ability to heal them was seen as a manifestation of His divine work. The desperate plea for healing from a leper demonstrates both his recognition of Christ's power and his uncertainty of His willingness to heal. While the leper displayed reverence, his doubt regarding Christ's will remained until Jesus expressed His willingness to heal.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The whole ordinances relating to leprosy were symbolical and typical...to represent the effect of the defilement of sin upon the once pure and holy body of man."
2. "The leper was the type of one dead in sin...imported the perpetual exclusion of the abominable and polluted from the true city of God."
3. "When Miriam was a leper, ἐβόησε Μωυσῆς πρὸς κύριον, λέγων Ὁ θεός, δέομαί σου, ἴασαι αὐτήν."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "All that needs be said here is that it was a cutaneous disease, of a loathsome, diffusive, and, there is reason to believe, when thoroughly pronounced, incurable character; that though in its distinctive features it is still found in several countries—as Arabia, Egypt, and South Africa—it prevailed, in the form of what is called white leprosy, to an unusual extent, and from a very early period, among the Hebrews; and that it thus furnished to the whole nation a familiar and affecting symbol of SIN, considered as (1) loathsome, (2) spreading, (3) incurable."
2. "The numerous cases of leprosy with which our Lord came in contact, and the glorious cures of them which He wrought, were a fitting manifestation of the work which He came to accomplish."
3. "But of Christ's willingness to heal him he was not so sure. It needed more knowledge of Jesus than he could be supposed to have to assure him of that. But one thing he was sure of, that He had but to 'will' it."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "No disease with which the human family has been afflicted has been more dreadful than that which is often mentioned in the Bible 'as the leprosy.'"
2. "A leprous person may live twenty, or thirty, or even fifty years, if he received the disease at his birth, but they will be years of indescribable misery."
3. "It is matter of profound gratitude to a benignant God that this scourge has been permitted but once to visit the New World."

(Note: The commentary was quite long, so I selected the quotes that provide a general understanding of the severity and impact of leprosy as well as the gratitude for its limited occurrence.)

### John Calvin:
1. "The outward gesture of kneeling was exhibited by the leper as a token of reverence."
2. "By these words he declared, that he acknowledged a divine power in Christ: and when Christ replies, I am willing, he shows that he claimed more for himself than belongs to man."
3. "He only declares, that he is so fully convinced of the power of Christ, as to entertain no doubt that it is in his power to cure leprosy; and then presents himself to be healed, but uncertain as to the result, because he did not yet know the will of Christ."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Men more easily believe in miraculous power than in miraculous love" (Bruce).
2. "This is a condition of the third class (undetermined, but with prospect of being determined), a hopeful doubt at any rate."
3. "The command to 'tell no one' was to suppress excitement and prevent hostility."

### John Gill:
1. "He was a very lively emblem of a poor vile sinner, full of sin and iniquity, who is brought to see himself all over covered with sin, when he comes to Christ for pardon and cleansing."
2. "This man came of his own accord, having heard of the fame of Christ; and worshipped him in a civil and respectful way, showing great reverence to him as a man."
3. "He was fully assured of his power, that he could make him clean, entirely rid him of his leprosy, which the priest could not do."
