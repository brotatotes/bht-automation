# Matthew 8:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Bible verse being described is a reflection of Jesus' identity as the Son of Man. This title signifies his role as the Messiah, the Son of God manifested in human form. It represents both his divinity and humanity, highlighting his capacity for suffering and humiliation. Jesus describes himself as lacking a permanent dwelling, unlike the foxes who have their holes and the birds who have their nests. This emphasizes his humble and selfless nature, demonstrating that following him requires a willingness to let go of worldly desires.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The Son of Man is the name by which the Lord designates Himself as the Messiah, the Son of God manifested in the flesh of man, the second Adam."
2. "The Jews understood the Son of Man to mean the Messiah."
3. "The Son of Man encompasses all the conditions of humiliation, suffering, and exaltation that the Messiah must go through."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Wilt thou?" replies the Lord Jesus. "Knowest thou whom thou art pledging thyself to follow, and whither haply He may lead thee? No warm home, no downy pillow has He for thee: He has them not for Himself. The foxes are not without their holes, nor do the birds of the air lack their nests; but the Son of man has to depend on the hospitality of others, and borrow the pillow whereon He lays His head." 
2. "Let the dead bury their dead: but go thou and preach the kingdom of God." Like all the other paradoxical sayings of our Lord, the key to it is the different senses—a higher and a lower—in which the same word "dead" is used: There are two kingdoms of God in existence upon earth; the kingdom of nature, and the kingdom of grace: To the one kingdom all the children of this world, even the most ungodly, are fully alive; to the other, only the children of light.
3. "No man, having put his hand to the plough, and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God." The figure of putting one's hand to the plough and looking back is an exceedingly vivid one, and to an agricultural people most impressive. As ploughing requires an eye intent on the furrow to be made, and is marred the instant one turns about, so will they come short of salvation who prosecute the work of God with a distracted attention, a divided heart.

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The word, derived from skhnh, a tent, has the more general meaning of shelter or habitation."
2. "The nest is not to the bird what the hole is to the fox, a permanent dwelling-place."
3. "The bird frequents the nest only during incubation."

### John Calvin:
1. "The Son of God describes by these words what was his condition while he lived on the earth, but, at the same time, informs his disciples what sort of life they must be prepared to expect."
2. "Christ should say, that he had not a foot of earth on which he could lay his head, while there were many godly and benevolent persons, who would willingly receive him into their houses."
3. "But this was spoken, it ought to be observed, as a warning to the scribe, not to expect an abundant and rich hire, as if he had a wealthy master, while the master himself receives a precarious subsistence in borrowed houses."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The answer alone reveals an improper motive in the proposal."
2. "The thought here is of His real humanity, His capability of suffering and privation, in opposition to the carnal expectation of the Jews."
3. "He who as 'Son of man' was 'the crown of creation,' did not possess what the humbler animals claim, a home."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The Son of man. This remarkable expression, applied to himself by Jesus so often, appears here for the first time. There is a considerable modern literature devoted to it." 
2. "Often it means the Representative Man. It may sometimes stand for the Aramaic barnasha, the man, but in most instances that idea will not suit. Jesus uses it as a concealed Messianic title." 
3. "Jesus in his early ministry, except at the very start in Matthew 8:4, abstains from calling himself Messiah. This term suited his purpose exactly to get the people used to his special claim as Messiah when he is ready to make it openly."

### John Gill:
1. "The foxes have holes in the earth, where they hide themselves from danger, take their rest, and secure their whelps; and the birds of the air have nests, where they sit, lay, and hatch their eggs, and bring up their young; but the son of man has not where to lay his head." 

2. "When Christ styles himself 'the son of man', it is no contradiction to his being God; nor any objection to trust and confidence in him, as the Jew suggests; for he is truly and properly God, as well as really man, having two natures, human and divine, united in his person."

3. "It may be replied, that it is very true, that the whole world is his, nor could he be in want of anything, as God; but yet, as man, for our sakes he became 'poor', that we 'might be rich'."

### John Wesley:
1. "The Son of man - The expression is borrowed from Daniel 7:13, and is the appellation which Christ generally gives himself: which he seems to do out of humility, as having some relation to his mean appearance in this world."
2. "Hath not where to lay his head - Therefore do not follow me from any view of temporal advantage."
3. "Christ's identification as the Son of man reflects his humility and his willingness to identify with the lowly and humble aspects of human existence."
