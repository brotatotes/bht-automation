# Matthew 8:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, a disciple of Jesus expresses his desire to bury his father before following Jesus. Commentators suggest that the disciple may have been hesitant due to a sense of duty towards his deceased father or a reluctance to leave him in his old age. Jesus, however, emphasizes the urgency of following him, highlighting the importance of putting God's commands above earthly obligations. This verse teaches us the primacy of our relationship with God and the need to prioritize our spiritual duties.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "A tradition of this nature was hardly likely to be wrong; so that perhaps the words ἀκολούθει μοι are to be taken as an admonition occasioned by some slackness or symptom of decadence on the part of the Apostle."
2. "The attempt to evade the strong words of our Lord’s command by supposing that θάψαι τὸν πατέρα means, ‘to reside with my father till his death’ (Theophylact), is evidently futile."
3. "The reason of our Lord’s rebuke was the peremptory and all-superseding nature of the command ἀκολούθει μοι."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The word 'disciple' properly signifies 'learner,' and was given to the followers of Jesus because they received him as their teacher."
2. "It does not of necessity mean that a 'disciple' was a pious man, but only one of the multitude, who, for various causes, might attend on his instructions."
3. "The first duty of man is religion, and everything else should be made subordinate to that."

### John Calvin:
1. "The person whom Christ retains had an opposite fault. He was prevented from immediately obeying the call of Christ by the weakness of thinking it a hardship to leave his father."
2. "From Christ’s reply we learn, that children should discharge their duty to their parents in such a manner that, whenever God calls them to another employment, they should lay this aside, and assign the first place to the command of God."
3. "All ought to consider what God requires from them as individuals, and what is demanded by their particular calling, that earthly parents may not prevent the claims of the highest and only Father of all from remaining entire."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "It is by no means certain that the father was dead."
2. "The probability is that this disciple means that, after his father is dead and buried, he will then be free to follow Jesus."
3. "Jesus wanted first things first. But even if his father was not actually dead, service to Christ comes first."

### John Gill:
1. "Lord, suffer me first to go and bury my father: for it seems, according to Luke, that Christ had bid him 'follow' him: he had given him a call to be his disciple, and to go and preach the Gospel, which he did not refuse; but desires leave 'first' to attend his father's funeral, who was now dead; as his requests, and Christ's answer, both suppose."
2. "This may seem very reasonable, since burying the dead was reckoned by the Jews, not only an act of kindness and respect to the deceased, but an act of piety and religion; and in which, men are followers of God, and imitate him, who himself buried the body of Moses."
3. "And though this man was called to preach the Gospel, yet he might think he would be easily excused for the present, on this account; since, according to the Jewish canons, such whose dead lay before them, who were as yet unburied, were excused reading the Shema, they were free from performing the duty of prayer, and were not obliged to wear their phylacteries."

### John Wesley:
1. "I will follow thee without any such view."
2. "I must mind my business first."
3. "Perhaps his son desired to stay with him, being very old, till his death."
