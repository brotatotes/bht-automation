# Matthew 8:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, we find a powerful reminder about the importance of obedience to God and the dangers of being entangled in worldly affairs. The commentators emphasize that those who are not fully devoted to God are essentially dead, occupied with pursuits that have no real meaning. However, for those who respond to God's call, there is an invitation to prioritize their spiritual journey and leave behind the concerns of the world. It serves as a challenge for us to reevaluate our own priorities and ensure that we are living in alignment with God's will.
