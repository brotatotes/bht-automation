# Matthew 8:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This Bible verse depicts a powerful scene on the Sea of Galilee, where Jesus and His disciples face a fierce storm. The storm serves as a metaphor for the storms of life, highlighting the overwhelming circumstances we can find ourselves in. Jesus' response to the storm demonstrates His ability to bring peace and rest even amidst chaos. The disciples' fear and lack of faith serve as a reminder of our own tendency to lose sight of God's presence and power when consumed by fear and doubt, yet Jesus teaches us to trust Him and have faith in challenging times.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Philip Schaff:
1. "The boat mentioned in Matthew 8:23 is the same boat from which Jesus had been teaching, as mentioned in Mark 4:36." 
2. "The disciples referred to in this verse are likely the Twelve, although there were others who followed Jesus in other boats." 
3. "The omission of the definite article in the phrase 'a boat' suggests that it is not a specific boat, but rather a general reference to a boat."

### John Gill:
1. "Christ took this method; and being desirous also of trying the faith of his disciples, he ordered it so, that they should be alone with him."
2. "His disciples followed him into the ship, and they only; for as for the men hereafter mentioned, they were the men that belonged to the ship, and had the management of it."
3. "The multitude were dismissed, and in order to be clear of them, Christ took this method."

These quotes highlight the purpose behind Jesus entering the ship with his disciples - to test their faith and to separate themselves from the multitude.

### John Wesley:
1. "The storm on the Sea of Galilee is a vivid picture of the storms of life that we all face. Just as the disciples were caught in a fierce storm, we too can find ourselves in the midst of overwhelming circumstances." 

2. "Jesus' response to the storm is a powerful reminder that even in the midst of chaos and uncertainty, we can find peace and rest in Him. He is not only with us in the storm, but He has the power to calm the storm and bring us to safety."

3. "The disciples' fear and lack of faith in the face of the storm is a common human response. It serves as a reminder that we too can easily lose sight of God's presence and power when we are consumed by fear and doubt. Yet, Jesus patiently teaches us to trust Him and have faith, even in the most challenging circumstances."
