# Matthew 8:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the midst of a picturesque scene on the Sea of Galilee, the disciples found themselves in danger as the violent storm arose suddenly. The waves crashed into their boat, covering it and putting them at the brink of sinking. Yet, amidst the chaos, Jesus peacefully slept, demonstrating his trust in God's providence. This tempest was not by chance, but by divine providence, giving Jesus an opportunity to reveal his deity and test the disciples' faith. In this moment of desperation, they learned that man's extremity is truly God's opportunity.
