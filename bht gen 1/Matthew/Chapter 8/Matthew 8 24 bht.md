# Matthew 8:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In a picturesque scene on the Sea of Galilee, a sudden and violent storm descends like an earthquake, causing the ship to be covered with waves. The disciples, caught off guard by this unexpected tempest, find themselves in a state of distress. Yet even in their extremity, God uses this situation to reveal His power and teach a profound lesson - that He works in mysterious ways, and that even in the midst of chaos, His purposes are ultimately fulfilled.
