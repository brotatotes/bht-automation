## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "They were of little faith, in that they were afraid of perishing while they had on board the slumbering Saviour: they were not faithless, for they had recourse to that Saviour to help them."
2. "Therefore He acknowledges the faith which they had; answers the prayer of faith, by working a perfect calm: but rebukes them for not having the stronger, firmer faith, to trust Him even when He seemed insensible to their danger."
3. "The symbolic application of this occurrence is too striking to have escaped general notice. The Saviour with the company of His disciples in the ship tossed on the waves, seemed a typical reproduction of the Ark bearing mankind on the flood, and a foreshadowing of the Church tossed by the tempests of this world, but having Him with her always."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "You should have remembered that the Son of God, the Messiah, was on board. You should not have forgotten that he had power to save, and that with him you are safe."
2. "So Christians should never fear danger, disease, or death. With Jesus they are safe."
3. "His word awed the tempest and allayed the storm! There is not anywhere a sublimer description of a display of power."

2. "You professed but just now to believe in me, is your faith gone already?"
