# Matthew 8:27 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we witness the awe-inspiring power and majesty of Jesus as he commands the winds and the sea to obey him. This miraculous event not only demonstrates his divine authority over nature but also prompts profound questions about his true nature. The astonishing display of power compels one to consider whether Jesus is more than a mere man, perhaps even the mighty God himself. Those who deny the deity of Christ are challenged by this remarkable account.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### John Calvin:
1. "It applies, however, more properly to others, who had not yet known Christ."
2. "If any one shall suppose that it is the apostles who speak, the meaning of the words will be, that his divine power was sufficiently proved by the fact that the wind and the sea obey him."
3. "The Evangelists show that the miracle made such an impression on their minds, as to produce a certain reverence for Christ which prepared them for believing on him."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "What manner of man is this. An expression of astonishment. It neither means, What country does he come from; nor, Is he more than man? The latter idea is suggested to those now reading the passage."
2. "Even the wind and the sea, or, 'the winds and the sea too.' The latter sense suggests that His power over other things had been witnessed; the former intimates that this was the highest display of power."
3. "The symbolic application of this occurrence is too striking to have escaped general notice. The Saviour, with the company of His disciples in the ship tossed on the waves, seemed a typical reproduction of the Ark bearing mankind on the flood, and a foreshadowing of the Church tossed by the tempests of this world, but having Him with her always."

### John Gill:
1. "There was such a shine of majesty, such a lustre of divine power appeared in this affair."
