# Matthew 8:28 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In a perplexing event, the verse describes Jesus encountering two possessed individuals coming from the tombs. The location is identified as the Gergesenes, an area near Gergesa and Gadara, possibly known for casting out demons. Commentators debate the specific details, with disagreements over the number of possessed individuals and the proximity of a swine herd and the lake. The possessed individuals, described as intractable and without clothes, unexpectedly encounter Jesus, as if Satan himself was unaware of Christ's arrival.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The situation and name of the place where the event happened are not the least [of the difficulties]."
2. "There is nothing in any of the three accounts to imply that the city was close to the scene of the miracle, or the scene of the miracle close to the herd of swine, or the herd of swine, at the time of their possession, close to the lake."
3. "The dæmoniac was without clothes, which though related only by St. Luke, yet, with remarkable consistency, appears from St. Mark’s narrative, where he is described as sitting, clothed, and in his right mind, at Jesus’s feet, after his cure."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The Levitical uncleanness of the tombs would insure the wretches the solitude which they sought."
2. "A propensity to take up the abode in the tombs is mentioned by ancient physicians as a characteristic of mad-men."
3. "Fierce [χαλεποι]. Originally, difficult, hard. Hence hard to manage; intractable."

### John Calvin:
1. "The error of those who think that Mark and Luke relate a different miracle from this, has been already refuted."
2. "Who then will believe that the same things, so fully coincident at all points, happened at different times?"
3. "Commentators have been led into the error of separating Matthew’s narrative from that of the others by this single difference, that he mentions two, while the others mention but one."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The name 'Gergesenes' is then to be regarded as derived from the old 'Girgashites,' who lived there before the conquest of the Israelites."
2. "Two possessed with demons...Matthew is always more particular as to numbers, as Mark is regarding looks and gestures."
3. "Coming from out of the tombs...their abode, chosen 'from a morbid craving for the terrible.'"

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Dr. Thomson discovered by the lake the ruins of Khersa (Gerasa). This village is in the district of the city of Gadara some miles southeastward so that it can be called after Gerasa or Gadara." 
2. "So Matthew speaks of 'two demoniacs' while Mark and Luke mention only one, the leading one."
3. "On the eastern side of the lake the precipitous cliffs are of limestone formation and full of caves. It is one of the proofs that one is a maniac that he haunts the tombs."

### John Gill:
1. "Gergesa is interpreted, 'the habitation of those that cast out'; being called so perhaps prophetically, for what the inhabitants of those places did to the Saviour, beseeching him to depart out of their coasts."
2. "Their coemeteria, or burying places, were at some distance from towns or cities; wherefore Luke says, the possessed met him 'out of the city', a good way off from it."
3. "These possessed men met him, not purposely, or with design, but accidentally to them, and unawares to Satan too; for though he knows much, he is not omniscient: had he been aware of Christ's coming that way, and what he was about to do, he would have took care to have had the possessed out of the way."

### John Wesley:
1. "The country of the Gergesenes - Gergesa and Gadara were towns near each other. Hence the country between them took its name, sometimes from the one, sometimes from the other."
2. "There met him two demoniacs - St. Mark and St. Luke mention only one, who was probably the fiercer of the two, and the person who spoke to our Lord first. But this is no way inconsistent with the account which St. Matthew gives."
3. "The tombs - Doubtless those malevolent spirits love such tokens of death and destruction. Tombs were usually in those days in desert places, at a distance from towns, and were often made in the sides of caves, in the rocks and mountains."
