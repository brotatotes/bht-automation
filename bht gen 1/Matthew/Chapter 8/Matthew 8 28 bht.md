# Matthew 8:28 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In a land between towns named Gergesa and Gadara, there were tombs, shunned by the living due to their association with uncleanness and madness. It was in this eerie silence that Jesus encountered two demon-possessed men, perhaps each with their own level of ferocity. It is said that the spirits, drawn to death and destruction, found solace in these tombs, which were often located in desolate places, hidden within caves in the rocks and mountains.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The Levitical uncleanness of the tombs would insure the wretches the solitude which they sought."
2. "A propensity to take up the abode in the tombs is mentioned by ancient physicians as a characteristic of mad-men."
3. "The silence of night was not broken by fierce yells and howling, which I discovered proceeded from a naked maniac who was fighting with some wild dogs for a bone."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The best established reading in Matthew: 'Gadarenes;' Mark: 'Gerasenes;' Luke: 'Gergesenes;' though there are variations in all three." 
2. "The name 'Gergesenes' is then to be regarded as derived from the old 'Girgashites,' who lived there before the conquest of the Israelites." 
3. "Two possessed with demons. Mark and Luke speak of but one, although the former gives the most detailed account."

### John Wesley:
1. "The country of the Gergesenes - Or of the Gadarenes - Gergesa and Gadara were towns near each other. Hence the country between them took its name, sometimes from the one, sometimes from the other." 

2. "There met him two demoniacs - St. Mark and St. Luke mention only one, who was probably the fiercer of the two, and the person who spoke to our Lord first. But this is no way inconsistent with the account which St. Matthew gives." 

3. "The tombs - Doubtless those malevolent spirits love such tokens of death and destruction. Tombs were usually in those days in desert places, at a distance from towns, and were often made in the sides of caves, in the rocks and mountains."
