# Matthew 8:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, Jesus demonstrates both his authority and compassion. With a touch, he fulfills the law and supersedes ceremonial restrictions. The act of touching the leper symbolizes Jesus taking on our nature and laying hold of our humanity. Jesus' touch not only physically heals but also restores the social and religious standing of the leper. It is an act of infinite grace, overcoming defilement and disease, and providing immediate hope and cleansing to those who approach him in faith.

3. "How majestic those two words! By not assuring the man of His power to heal him, He delightfully sets His seal to the man's previous confession of that power; and by assuring him of the one thing of which he had any doubt, and for which he waited—His will to do it—He makes a claim as divine as the cure which immediately followed it."
