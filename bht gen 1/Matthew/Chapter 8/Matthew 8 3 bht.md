# Matthew 8:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we see Jesus moved with compassion as he heals a man touched by leprosy. Despite the ceremonial defilement, Christ transcends the regulations to show his divine power and will. His touch overcomes the defilement and removes the disease, a wonderful display of grace and goodness. This interaction serves as an encouragement for sinners to approach Christ with their guilt and filth, for he readily receives them and reveals his power and grace to them.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "And Jesus...moved with compassion" - a precious addition (Mark 1:41). 
2. "Such a touch occasioned ceremonial defilement...But as the man's faith told him there would be no case for such regulations if the cure he hoped to experience should be accomplished, so He who had healing in His wings transcended all such statutes." 
3. "How majestic those two words! By not assuring the man of His power to heal him, He delightfully sets His seal to the man's previous confession of that power; and by assuring him of the one thing of which he had any doubt, and for which he waited—His will to do it—He makes a claim as divine as the cure which immediately followed it."

### John Calvin:
1. "As Christ possesses such purity as to repel all filth and defilement, he does not, by touching, either pollute himself with leprosy, or become a transgressor of the law."
2. "He was united to one and the same body with ourselves, that we might be flesh of his flesh."
3. "The stretching out of his hand was therefore an expression and token of infinite grace and goodness."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Such touch was forbidden. Despite the consequent healing, it may have been regarded by the Pharisees as rendering Jesus unclean."
2. "I will; be thou made clean, in direct correspondence with the leper's expression of faith."
3. "The touch of a leper defiled, carried contagion, but the touch of our Lord overcame the defilement and contagion, removing the disease."

### John Gill:
1. "This is a wonderful instance both of the grace and goodness of Christ, in touching this loathsome creature."
2. "A great encouragement this, for poor sensible sinners to betake themselves to Christ, under a sense of their guilt and filth."
3. "He readily receives such, in no wise casts them out, but gives immediate discoveries of his power and grace unto them."
