# Matthew 8:30 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In a remarkable scene on the hills, a vast herd of forbidden swine is seen grazing, tended by herdsmen. The number of swine, reaching up to two thousand, accentuates the magnitude of the miracle that was about to take place. This incident raises questions about why such a large herd of forbidden animals would be kept in Israel. Nevertheless, the swine's destruction serves as a reminder of the consequences that result from disobedience to God's laws. It is a powerful demonstration of Jesus's authority over the forces of evil and a visual representation of the economic impact on those involved.

### John Gill:
1. "Since swine's flesh was forbidden the Jews to eat, it may be asked, how came it to pass, that there should be any number of these creatures, or that such a herd of them should be kept in the land of Israel?"
2. "But the chief reason given by the Gemafists for this prohibition, was the fact following: 'When the Hasmonean family, or Maccabees, were at war with one another, Hyrcanus was within (Jerusalem), and Aristobulus without, and every day they let down to them money in a box; and they sent up to them the daily sacrifices: there was one old man who understood the wisdom of the Greeks, and he said unto them, as long as they employ themselves in the service (of God), they will not be delivered into your hands: on the morrow they let down their money, and they sent them up a hog; and when it came to the middle of the wall, he fixed his hoofs in the wall, and the land of Israel shook.'"
3. "And nothing was more infamous and reproachful among them, than a keeper of these creatures: when therefore they had a mind to cast contempt upon a man, they would call him 'a breeder of hogs', or 'a hog herd'."
