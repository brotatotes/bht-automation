# Matthew 8:31 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we see how the demons, filled with enmity and malicious intentions, recognize the superior power and authority of Christ. They beg not to be sent out of the country or into the deep, showing their desire to continue their work of opposition. Despite their request, Christ grants them permission, emphasizing the importance of free will and allowing them to choose their destination. This passage reveals the weakness of the demons and highlights the wretched malignity in their nature, as they resort to setting the people against Christ and hindering His usefulness among them.
