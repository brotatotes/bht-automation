# Matthew 8:31 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the disciples make a plea to Jesus, expressing their fear of leaving their familiar surroundings and facing uncertainty. Their request reveals a reluctance to be cast into a place of suffering and torment. Recognizing the disruption that being sent out of the land would bring, the disciples show their attachment to the familiar and their aversion to change. The demons' request, on the other hand, reflects their malicious intent to remain on earth, continuing their work of opposition. This verse also highlights God's respect for our free will, giving us the freedom to choose and make decisions.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The disciples' request to Jesus to not be sent out of the land can be understood as a plea to remain in their familiar and comfortable surroundings, rather than being cast into the abyss. This highlights their fear and desire for stability and security." 

2. "The concept of the abyss, or the ἄβυσσος, represents a place of torment and suffering. The disciples' request reveals their understanding of the potential consequences of being sent out of the land, emphasizing their reluctance to face such a fate." 

3. "The disciples' plea to Jesus reflects their recognition that being sent out of the land would disrupt their established lives and routines. It underscores their attachment to the familiar and their aversion to change and uncertainty."

### John Calvin:
1. "They wished to attack the swine, because they are filled with enmity to all God's creatures."
2. "It is certain that they had a more remote object in view, to excite the inhabitants of that country to curse God on account of the loss of the swine."
3. "This passage shows also the foolish trifling of some irreligious men, who imagine that the devils are not actually existing spirits, but merely the depraved affections of men."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The demons besought him...The former speaks of their begging not to be sent 'out of the country,' the latter, 'into the deep.' The latter phrase suggests that 'before the time' (Matthew 8:29), refers to a time of banishment from earth 'to their own place.'" 

2. "They recognized His power, yet clung to the present habitation."

3. "The request was malicious; that they might remain on earth, and continue their work of opposition."

### John Gill:
1. "This request shows the weakness of the infernal spirits, they are not able to do anything without leave, and the superior power of Christ over them, and their acknowledgment of it."
2. "The wretched malignity of their nature, who must be doing mischief, if not to the bodies and souls of men, yet to their property and goods."
3. "Many reasons have been thought of, why the devils should desire to go into the herd of swine; as because of the filthiness of these creatures, these impure spirits delighting in what is impure; or out of pure hatred to the inhabitants of this country, who, because they could no longer hurt their persons, would destroy their goods; or that by so doing, they might set the people against Christ, and so prevent his usefulness among them."

### John Wesley:
1. "A word of permission only, not command."

2. "God gives us the freedom to choose and make decisions."

3. "This verse reminds us that God respects our free will and allows us to make choices."
