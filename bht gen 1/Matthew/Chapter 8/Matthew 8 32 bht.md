# Matthew 8:32 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we witness a remarkable demonstration of Jesus' authority over evil spirits. The possessed individuals were under the control of these demonic forces, just as the swine were. Although some may question why Jesus allowed the demons to enter the herd of swine, it can be seen as a just punishment for the owners' disobedience to God's law. This incident serves to expose the true nature of these evil spirits and highlight the power and authority of Christ over them and all possessions of mankind.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Philip Schaff:
1. "The fact of the possession of the swine is stated. It is not more improbable than that the human body could be under demoniacal control."
2. "The simultaneous rush of the whole herd was not a natural movement, but due to the possessed, since few gregarious animals are so marked by individual stubbornness as swine."
3. "The permission given by our Lord to enter the herd of swine can be readily justified. It suggests the above warning, it helped to rid the men of the demons; there may have been other reasons growing out of the Mosaic law, which make the loss of property a just punishment; and after all it was but a permission."

### John Gill:
1. "Without divine permission, these evil spirits cannot do anything to the bodies, souls, or estates of men."
2. "It may be asked, why did Christ suffer the devils to enter the herd of swine, and destroy them, which was a considerable loss to the proprietors? To which may be answered, that if the owners were Jews, and these creatures were brought up by them for food, it was a just punishment of their breach of the law of God."
3. "This was suffered to show the malice of the evil spirits, under whose influence they were, and who would, if they had but leave, serve them as they did the swine; and to display the power of Christ over the devils, and his sovereign right to, and disposal of the goods and properties of men."
