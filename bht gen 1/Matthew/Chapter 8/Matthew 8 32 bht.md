# Matthew 8:32 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In a remarkable display of his power over evil spirits, Jesus permitted them to leave the possessed men and enter a herd of swine, as affirmed by the Gospel narratives. This resulted in a frenzied rush of the swine, careening down a steep, almost perpendicular declivity, in which there was not enough space for them to recover. While some may question the destruction of the swine, it can be seen as a just punishment and a demonstration of the reality of evil spirits and possessions. This incident highlights the authority of Christ over both the spiritual and physical realms.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The Gospel narratives are distinctly pledged to the historic truth of these occurrences."
2. "The personality and presence of the dæmons is distinctly implied."
3. "The dæmoniac was one whose being was strangely interpenetrated by one or more of those fallen spirits."
4. "The assumption contained in the objection above must not be thus unreservedly granted."
5. "The destruction of the swine is not for a moment to be thought of in the matter, as if that were an act repugnant to the merciful character of our Lord’s miracles."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Not an overhanging precipice, but a steep, almost perpendicular declivity." This quote clarifies the nature of the steep place, emphasizing that it was not a sheer drop but a steep slope.

2. "In which there was not room for the swine to recover from their headlong rush." This quote explains why the swine were unable to escape the steep place, highlighting the lack of space for them to regain their footing.

3. "The herd might have recovered and recoiled from the lake." This quote suggests that if the steep place had been located farther south, the swine might have been able to escape and retreat from the lake.

These quotes provide insights into the physical characteristics of the steep place and the reasons behind the swine's inability to escape, enhancing the reader's understanding of the verse.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The fact of the possession of the swine is stated. It is not more improbable than that the human body could be under demoniacal control."
2. "The simultaneous rush of the whole herd was not a natural movement, but due to the possessed, since few gregarious animals are so marked by individual stubbornness as swine."
3. "The permission given by our Lord to enter the herd of swine can be readily justified. It suggests the above warning, it helped to rid the men of the demons; there may have been other reasons growing out of the Mosaic law, which make the loss of property a just punishment; and after all it was but a permission."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "The influence of mind on matter is now understood better than formerly, but we have the mastery of the mind of the Master on the minds of the maniacs, the power of Christ over the demons, over the herd of hogs."
2. "Difficulties in plenty exist for those who see only folk-lore and legend, but plain enough if we take Jesus to be really Lord and Saviour."
3. "The incidental destruction of the hogs need not trouble us when we are so familiar with nature's tragedies which we cannot comprehend."

### John Gill:
1. "Without divine permission, these evil spirits cannot do anything to the bodies, souls, or estates of men."
2. "It may be asked, why did Christ suffer the devils to enter the herd of swine, and destroy them, which was a considerable loss to the proprietors? To which may be answered, that if the owners were Jews, and these creatures were brought up by them for food, it was a just punishment of their breach of the law of God."
3. "And when they were come out of the men that had been possessed by them, they went into the herd of swine; which shows the real existence of these spirits, the truth of possessions and dispossessions."
