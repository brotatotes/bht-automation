1. "The hog herds, men of very low life, and whose employment was very infamous and reproachful, as has been observed."
2. "In their fright and distress, some ran one way, and some another; some went into the city, others into the country, and so spread the affair far and near, and the fame of Christ, which was designed by this miracle."
3. "After they had told every circumstance of the affair, next they gave a narrative of what was befallen to the possessed of the devils, and which was the occasion of the loss of their swine; how subject the devils, that were in them, were to Christ; how easily he dispossessed them by a word of command; how they entreated they might have leave to go into the herd of swine, which was granted; and how perfectly whole, and in health, both in body and mind, the men were."
