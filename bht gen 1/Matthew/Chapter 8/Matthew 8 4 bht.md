# Matthew 8:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This verse tells of a leper who, upon being cleansed by Jesus, is instructed to immediately go show himself to the priest as a testimony of the healing. Jesus, in His wisdom, urged the leper to not make a public spectacle of the miracle, but instead follow the proper protocol prescribed by the law of Moses. By doing so, Jesus sought to display the glory of God, to fulfill prophecy, and to avoid unnecessary conflict with the religious authorities. The leper was obedient and went on his way, humbly seeking the testimony of the priest.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Our Lord almost uniformly repressed the fame of His miracles, for the reason given in ch. Matthew 12:15-21, that, in accordance with prophetic truth, He might be known as the Messiah not by wonder-working power, but by the great result of his work upon earth."
2. "Christ alone is the cleanser. 'Ut Dominus ostenderet, quod non sacerdotali judicio, sed largitate divinæ gratiæ peccato emundatur, leprosum tangendo mundavit, et postea sacerdoti sacrificium ex lege offerre præcepit.'"
3. "It is satisfactory to observe this drawing of parallels between the Levitical and (popularly so called) Christian priesthood, thus completely shewing the fallacy and untenableness of the whole system; all those priests being types, not of future human priests, but of Him, who abideth a Priest for ever in an unchangeable priesthood, and in Whom not a class of Christians, but all Christians, are priests unto God."

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "A hard condition this would seem to a grateful heart, whose natural language, in such a case, is 'Come, hear, all ye that fear God, and I will declare what He hath done for my soul'." 
2. "What the sequel was, our Evangelist Matthew does not say; but Mark thus gives it: 'But he went out, and began to publish it much, and to blaze abroad the matter, insomuch that Jesus could no more openly enter into the city, but was without in desert places: and they came to Him from every quarter'." 
3. "And He withdrew Himself...into the secret place of the Most High, and thus coming forth as dew upon the mown grass, and as showers that water the earth."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It was his duty to hasten to him immediately Leviticus 14:2; not to delay by talking about it, but, as the first thing, to obey the laws of God, and make proper acknowledgments to him by an offering."
2. "Perhaps, also, Christ was apprehensive that the report would go 'before' the man if he delayed, and the priest, through opposition to Jesus, might pronounce it an imposition."
3. "Show thyself to the priest, and get his testimony to the reality of the cure, as a proof to the people that the healing is genuine."

### John Calvin:
1. "The leper was so far from deserving praise for the disorderly exhibition of his regard, that he ought, in my opinion, to be condemned for not obeying Christ’s injunction."
2. "This example shows us, that those who allow themselves to be guided by inconsiderate zeal act improperly, because the more eager they are to please God, the greater progress do they make in rebellion to his commands."
3. "Christ, therefore, by sending the leper to the priest, proves that he had no other object in view than to display the glory of God."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The telling was forbidden until this duty was fulfilled."
2. "Our Lord adds: for a testimony to them; i.e., a testimony to the people that the cleansing had taken place."
3. "The command also implies a caution against making too much of the external miraculous acts of our Lord; a kind of materialism, no less than the denial of the possibility of such miracles."

### John Gill:
1. "Not that this fact could be concealed, if it was done publicly, before the multitude nor was it Christ's design that it should be; only it was his counsel to this man, that whilst he was on the road to Jerusalem, and when he was come there, that he would speak of it to no man, before he came to the priest, or priests."
2. "The man was now in one of the cities of Galilee; from hence Christ orders him to make the best of his way, directly to Jerusalem; and present himself to one of the priests, by him to be examined, whether he was free of his leprosy; and then offer what was ordered by the law of Moses in such cases."
3. "Now these were the things which, as the other evangelists say, this leper was ordered to offer for his cleansing, 'for a testimony unto them'; meaning either to the priests; for the Syriac and Persic versions read the former clause, 'show thyself to the priests', in Luke 17:14 that they being satisfied of the healing and cleansing of this man, and accordingly pronouncing him clean, and accepting his offerings, this might be either a convincing testimony to them, that Jesus was the Son of God, and true Messiah, and that he did not deny or oppose the law given by Moses; or might be a standing testimony against them, should they continue in unbelief; or else to the Jews, who saw the miracle, and heard the orders Christ gave to the man after he had healed him; or to the lepers that they were cleansed; or this law of Moses was for a testimony or statute to be always observed by them in such cases."

### John Wesley:
1. "Not till thou hast showed thyself to the priest-who was appointed to inquire into the case of leprosy."
2. "To prevent the multitude from thronging him, in the manner related Mark 1:45."
3. "To fulfil the prophecy, Isaiah 42:1, that he would not be vain or ostentatious."
4. "That he might not enrage the chief priests, scribes, and Pharisees, who were the most bitter against him."
5. "A captain of a hundred Roman soldiers. Probably he came a little way toward him, and then went back. He thought himself not worthy to come in person."
