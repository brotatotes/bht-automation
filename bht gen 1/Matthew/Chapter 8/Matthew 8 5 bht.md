# Matthew 8:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, we encounter a Gentile centurion who shows deep attachment to the Jews and their religion. He may have been a proselyte or someone influenced by their faith, and despite being a pagan by birth, he submits willingly to the God of Israel. The centurion's act of seeking Jesus' help for his servant demonstrates the perfect agreement between the two Gospel accounts and the inclusive nature of Jesus' ministry, which extends to both Jews and Gentiles.
