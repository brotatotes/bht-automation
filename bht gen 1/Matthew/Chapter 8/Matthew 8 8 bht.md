### Henry Alford:
1. "The centurion heard that the Lord was coming" - This shows the centurion's awareness and recognition of Jesus as someone of great importance and authority.

2. "He knew and felt himself, as a heathen, to be out of the fold of God" - The centurion's humility is evident in his understanding of his own position as a non-Jew and his recognition of his unworthiness to receive Jesus.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "This was an expression of great humility."
2. "It refers, doubtless, to his view of his 'personal' unworthiness."
3. "It was the expression of a conviction of the great dignity and power of the Saviour."

These quotes highlight the humility and deep sense of unworthiness that the speaker feels in the presence of the Savior. They emphasize the recognition of the vast difference between the speaker and the Son of God, which leads to a feeling of unsuitability for the Savior's presence. This commentary sheds light on the appropriate response of a penitent sinner when approaching Christ.

### John Calvin:
1. "There was astonishing humility in exalting so highly above himself a man who belonged to a conquered and enslaved nation."
2. "He simply acknowledged in him the power of God. Something, too, he had undoubtedly heard about the promised Redeemer."
3. "He believes that by a word alone he can heal his servant...he is satisfied with the word, from which he believes such a power to proceed."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "This humility sprang out of his consciousness that he was a heathen, as well as his esteem of our Lord."
2. "This means one word of command, as Matthew 8:9 shows."
3. "'Humility and faith always go hand in hand.'"

### John Gill:
1. "Lord, I am not worthy that thou shouldst come under my roof. This is not said as rejecting and despising the presence and company of Christ; but is expressive of his great modesty and humility, and of his consciousness of his own vileness, and unworthiness of having so great a person in his house."
2. "And if such a man was unworthy...how much more unworthy are poor sinful creatures (and sensible sinners see themselves to be so unworthy), that Christ should come into their hearts, and dwell there by faith, as he does, in all true believers, however vile and sinful they have been?"
3. "But speak the word only, and my servant shall be healed...he signifies that if he would but speak a word, the least word whatever; or, as Luke has it, 'say in a word'; let but a word come out of thy mouth, and it will be done."

### John Wesley:
1. "The centurion's response reveals his humility and faith. Instead of demanding Jesus to come to his house, he recognizes his own unworthiness and acknowledges Jesus' authority and power."

2. "The centurion's faith is demonstrated by his understanding of Jesus' authority. He recognizes that just as he has soldiers under his command, Jesus has authority over sickness and disease."

3. "The centurion's response also highlights his trust in Jesus' ability to heal from a distance. He believes that Jesus only needs to speak the word, and his servant will be healed."

4. "This interaction between Jesus and the centurion serves as a powerful example of the kind of faith that pleases God. The centurion's humility, recognition of Jesus' authority, and unwavering trust in His power are qualities that we should strive to emulate in our own lives."
