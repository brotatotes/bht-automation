## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The centurion...sent friends to Him with this second and still humbler message."
2. "He knew and felt himself, as a heathen, to be out of the fold of God, a stranger to the commonwealth of Israel."
3. "Therefore unworthy to receive under his roof the Redeemer of Israel."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "This humility sprang out of his consciousness that he was a heathen, as well as his esteem of our Lord."
2. "This means one word of command, as Matthew 8:9 shows."
3. "'Humility and faith always go hand in hand.'"

### John Gill:
1. "Lord, I am not worthy that thou shouldst come under my roof... how much more unworthy are poor sinful creatures... that Christ should come into their hearts, and dwell there by faith." 
2. "But speak the word only, and my servant shall be healed... which is ascribing omnipotence to him; such power as was put forth in creation, by the all commanding word of God."
3. "He signifies that if he would but speak a word, the least word whatever... let but a word come out of thy mouth, and it will be done."

### John Wesley:
1. "The centurion's response demonstrates his humility and faith. Instead of seeking Jesus directly, he sends messengers to relay his request. This shows his recognition of Jesus' authority and his belief that Jesus can heal his servant."

2. "The centurion's statement, 'Lord, I am not worthy to have you come under my roof,' reveals his deep understanding of Jesus' power and authority. He recognizes that Jesus doesn't need to physically be present to heal his servant, but that a simple command from Jesus would be enough."

3. "The centurion's faith is commended by Jesus himself, who says, 'I tell you, not even in Israel have I found such faith.' This highlights the extraordinary nature of the centurion's belief, as he is a Gentile and not part of the chosen people of Israel. It serves as a reminder that faith knows no boundaries and can be found in unexpected places."
