# Matthew 8:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, a centurion expresses his faith in Jesus' authority and power by comparing it to his own experience as a military leader. He recognizes that just as soldiers under his command obediently follow his orders, Jesus has even greater authority over diseases and can simply command them to obey.
