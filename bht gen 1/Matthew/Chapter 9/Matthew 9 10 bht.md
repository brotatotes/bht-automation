## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The narrative in our text is so closely identical with that in Mark, that it is impossible to suppose, with Greswell, that a different feast is intended."
2. "Surely the article might be used without any such significance, or designating any particular house, as would be very likely if Matthew himself is here the narrator."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

2. "Whether this feast was made now, or not till afterwards, is a point of some importance in the order of events, and not agreed among harmonists."

2. "It thus illustrates the command of the Saviour, as recorded by himself, Matthew 6:1-4."
