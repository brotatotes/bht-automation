# Matthew 9:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we see the gathering of sinners and tax collectors with Jesus, representing his kindness and desire for their conversion. The arrangement of Matthew's narrative highlights the powerful impression made by the healing of the paralytic, which led to the call of the tax collector. Jesus gladly embraced every opportunity to show wondrous grace and do good to the souls of even the worst of men. Through this feast, Jesus extended his love and compassion, offering the opportunity for these notorious sinners to hear his gracious words.

3. "We conclude, therefore, that the feast was not made in the novelty of his discipleship, but after Matthew had had time to be somewhat established in the faith when returning to Capernaum, his compassion for old friends, of his own calling and character, led him to gather them together that they might have an opportunity of hearing the gracious words which proceeded out of His Master's mouth, if haply they might experience a like change."

### Philip Schaff:
