# Matthew 9:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This Bible verse describes Jesus as the compassionate physician of both body and soul, attending to the needs of social outcasts and sin-sick souls. He came to heal the broken hearts, bind up the wounded, and save sinners. As the infallible and free physician, he knows the nature of our soul's diseases, offers the perfect cure, and ensures that none who come to him perish. His mission is not for the self-righteous, but for those who recognize their need for him.
