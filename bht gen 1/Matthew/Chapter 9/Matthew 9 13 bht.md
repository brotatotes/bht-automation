## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Sacrifice, the chief part of the ceremonial law, is here put for a religion of literal adherence to mere rules; while 'mercy' expresses such compassion for the fallen as seeks to lift them up."
2. "The duty of keeping aloof from the polluted, in the sense of 'having no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness,' is obvious enough; but to understand this as prohibiting such intercourse with them as is necessary to their recovery, is to abuse it."
3. "When Christ 'called' the sinners, it was to heal them of their spiritual maladies, or save their souls: 'The righteous,' like those miserable self-satisfied Pharisees, 'He sent empty away.'"

### John Calvin:
1. "He declares that God has no delight in sacrifices, when their minds are destitute of piety, and when their conduct is at variance with uprightness and righteousness."
2. "We ought to hold, that faith and spiritual worship are in themselves pleasing to God, and that charity and the duties of humanity towards our neighbors are in themselves required; but that sacrifices are but appendages, so to speak, which are of no value or estimation, where substantial truth is not found."
3. "We are reminded that the grace of Christ is of no advantage to us, unless when, conscious of our sins, and groaning under their load, we approach to him with humility."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "You are students of the Scriptures, yet do not know the meaning of the passage I quote; instead of finding fault, go and learn what you ought to know already."
2. "God prefers mercy to sacrifice, and rejects the latter if it conflicts with the former. This the Pharisees had forgotten in their criticism of His conduct."
3. "The righteous, are those thinking themselves so, sinners, those convinced of their sin; not those actually righteous and sinful. The former view corresponds better with Matthew 9:12, gives a more direct reply to the Pharisees, and enforces the great lesson of the whole passage; sense of need is the first step toward Christ."
