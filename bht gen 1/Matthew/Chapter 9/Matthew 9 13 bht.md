## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "πορευθέντες μάθετε answers to an expression frequent in the Talmud, צא ולמד." 
2. "ἔλεος θέλ." 
3. "The whole of this discourse, with the exception of the citation, is almost verbatim in Mark, and (with ὑγιαίνοντες = ἰσχύοντες , ἐλήλυθα = ἦλθον , and the addition of εἰς μετάνοιαν ) Luke also."

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Sacrifice," the chief part of the ceremonial law, is here put for a religion of literal adherence to mere rules; while "mercy" expresses such compassion for the fallen as seeks to lift them up.
2. The duty of keeping aloof from the polluted, in the sense of "having no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness," is obvious enough; but to understand this as prohibiting such intercourse with them as is necessary to their recovery, is to abuse it.
3. When Christ "called" the latter, as He did Matthew, and probably some of those publicans and sinners whom he had invited to meet Him, it was to heal them of their spiritual maladies, or save their souls: "The righteous," like those miserable self-satisfied Pharisees, "He sent empty away."

### John Calvin:
1. "He declares that God has no delight in sacrifices, when their minds are destitute of piety, and when their conduct is at variance with uprightness and righteousness."
2.

3. "The righteous are those thinking themselves so, sinners, those convinced of their sin; not those actually righteous and sinful. The former view corresponds better with Matthew 9:12, gives a more direct reply to the Pharisees, and enforces the great lesson of the whole passage; sense of need is the first step toward Christ."
