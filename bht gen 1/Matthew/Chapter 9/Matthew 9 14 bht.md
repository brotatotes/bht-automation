### Henry Alford:
1. "This is one of those instances where the three accounts imply and confirm one another, and the hints incidentally dropped by one Evangelist form the prominent assertions of the other."
2. "The fasting often of the disciples of John must not be understood as done in mourning for their master’s imprisonment, but as belonging to the asceticism which John, as a preacher of repentance, inculcated."

"When we read that the disciples of John were caught by these snares of Satan, let us first learn not to place holiness in outward and indifferent matters, and at the same time to restrain ourselves by moderation and equity, that we may not desire to restrict others to what we approve, but may allow every one to retain his freedom."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The complaint also implies: ‘if you are a teacher from God, why does your teaching result in leading your followers away from old-established forms and customs, confirmed by the example of our own teacher, John.’" 

2. "A demand for a compromise between the old and the new, as Matthew 9:16 shows."

### John Gill:
1. "The fastings here referred to are not the public fasts enjoined by the law of Moses, or in any writings of the Old Testament; but private fasts, which were enjoined by John to his disciples, and by the Pharisees to their's; or which were, according to the traditions of the elders, or of their own appointing, and which were very 'often' indeed."
2. "Fasts were kept also on account of many other evils, as pestilence, famine, war, sieges, inundations, or any other calamity; sometimes for trifling things, as for dreams, that they might have good ones, or know how to interpret them, or avoid any ill omen by them."
3. "This may serve to illustrate and prove the frequency of the Jewish fastings."

### John Wesley:
1. "The phrase 'while he was at table' suggests that Jesus was engaged in a communal meal, a setting where people would gather to eat and share in fellowship. This context is important because it highlights the significance of Jesus' response to the question posed to him." 

2. "Jesus' response challenges the religious leaders' understanding of fasting and righteousness. He emphasizes that fasting should not be a mere external practice but a reflection of a transformed heart and a genuine desire to seek God."

3. "Jesus uses the analogy of a wedding feast to illustrate his point. Just as it would be inappropriate for the wedding guests to fast while the bridegroom is with them, it would be equally inappropriate for his disciples to fast while he, the bridegroom, is present. This highlights the joy and celebration that comes with the presence of Jesus."
