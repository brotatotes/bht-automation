# Matthew 9:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the commentators shed light on the contrasting attitudes towards fasting and religious rituals. The disciples of John the Baptist and the Pharisees were known for their strict asceticism, fasting regularly and adhering to old-established practices. However, Jesus challenges these traditions and emphasizes the joy and freedom that come with his ministry. Rather than burdening his followers with religious obligations, Jesus invites them into a personal relationship with him, one that is centered on love, grace, and embracing a new way of thinking and living.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "This is one of those instances where the three accounts imply and confirm one another, and the hints incidentally dropped by one Evangelist form the prominent assertions of the other."
2. "The fasting often of the disciples of John must not be understood as done in mourning for their master's imprisonment, but as belonging to the asceticism which John, as a preacher of repentance, inculcated."
3. "On the fasts of the Pharisees, see Light-foot in loc."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The Pharisees, it is supposed, fasted twice in the week (Luke 18:12); the remnant of John’s disciples would be led to a similar practice, by his austere life." 
2. "The complaint also implies: ‘if you are a teacher from God, why does your teaching result in leading your followers away from old-established forms and customs, confirmed by the example of our own teacher, John.’" 
3. "A demand for a compromise between the old and the new, as Matthew 9:16 shows."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "One is surprised to find disciples of the Baptist in the role of critics of Christ along with the Pharisees."
2. "John was languishing in prison and they perhaps were blaming Jesus for doing nothing about it."
3. "The strict asceticism of the Baptist and of the Pharisaic rabbis was imitated by their disciples."

### John Wesley:
1. "This verse highlights the contrast between Jesus and the religious leaders of his time. While the Pharisees and disciples of John were fasting and practicing religious rituals, Jesus was feasting and enjoying the company of sinners. It shows that Jesus came to bring joy and freedom, not to burden people with religious obligations." 

2. "Jesus uses the metaphor of a wedding feast to explain his presence among sinners. Just as it would be inappropriate for the wedding guests to fast while the bridegroom is with them, it is inappropriate for Jesus' disciples to fast while he is present. This emphasizes the unique and joyful nature of Jesus' ministry." 

3. "Jesus' response challenges the religious traditions and legalistic mindset of the Pharisees. He emphasizes that his mission is not about conforming to external rituals, but about experiencing a personal relationship with him. Jesus is inviting his disciples and all who follow him to embrace a new way of thinking and living, one that is centered on love, grace, and freedom."
