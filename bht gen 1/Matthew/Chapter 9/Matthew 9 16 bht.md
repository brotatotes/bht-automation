# Matthew 9:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse being described in the commentaries focuses on the idea of not mixing the old with the new. There is a caution against trying to incorporate the new and complete gospel with the outdated and worn-out system of rituals and works. The imagery of patching an old garment with a piece of unfulled cloth is used to illustrate that such an attempt would only result in a worse tear and division. The call is to embrace the all-new, all-consistent robe of Christ's righteousness, which needs no additions or subtractions.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The complete and beautiful whole of Gospel light and liberty must not be engrafted as a mere addition on the worn out system of ceremonies."
2. "The new patch, by its weight and its strength, pulls away the neighboring weak and loose threads by which it holds to the old garment, and a worse rent is made."
3. "The robe must be all new, all consistent: old things, old types, old ceremonies, old burdens, sacrifices, priests, sabbaths, and holy days, all are passed away: behold all things are become new."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Jesus thus pictures the combination of the old forms of piety peculiar to John and his disciples with the new religious life emanating from himself."
2. "The patching of an old garment with a piece of unfulled cloth, which would stretch and tear loose from the old fabric."
3. "Make a worse rent than before."

### John Calvin:
1. "The comparison is beautifully adapted to the matter in hand, if we explain it as referring to the weak and tender disciples of Christ, and to a discipline more strict than they were able to bear."
2. "The amount of the statement is, that all must not be compelled indiscriminately to live in the same manner, for there is a diversity of natural character, and all things are not suitable to all."
3. "We ought to spare the weak, that they may not be broken by violence, or crushed by the weight of the burden."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The patch of cloth that would shrink, placed on a worn garment, would tear the weaker fibre; and a worse rent takes place, since the new rent is all round the patch that covered the old one." 
2. "What is antiquated cannot be patched up with what is fresh." 
3. "The worn out system of fasting for fastingâ€™s sake cannot be patched up with a piece from the new, fresh, complete gospel."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "An unfulled, raw piece of woollen cloth that will shrink when wet and tear a bigger hole than ever." This quote vividly describes the nature of the undressed cloth, highlighting its potential for causing more damage than before.
2. "A worse rent. Our word 'schism.'" This quote draws a parallel between the concept of a worse rent and the word "schism," emphasizing the destructive nature of division and discord.
3. "The 'patch' thus does more harm than good." This quote suggests that attempting to fix or cover up a problem with a patch can often exacerbate the issue, leading to more harm than good.

### John Gill:
1. "The true reason why they were not required of them, was not their weakness, or danger of falling off, and perishing, of which there were none; but because it was unsuitable to their present situation, the bridegroom being with them."
2. "Their old garment of their own works, in obedience to the laws of God, moral and ceremonial, was full bad enough of itself; but became abundantly worse, by joining this new piece of men's own devising to it; for that which is put in to fill it up, taketh from the garment, and the rent is made worse."
3. "Much such a foolish part do those men under the Gospel dispensation act, who join the righteousness of Christ, or a part of it, with their own, in order to make up a justifying righteousness before God; for Christ's righteousness is the only justifying righteousness; it is whole and perfect, and needs nothing to be added to it, nor can it be parted, any more than his seamless coat was."

### John Wesley:
1. "It is not a proper time for them to fast."
2. "They are not ripe for it."
3. "New cloth...will tear away the edges to which it is sewed."
