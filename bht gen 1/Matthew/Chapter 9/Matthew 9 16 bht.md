# Matthew 9:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, Jesus uses a vivid analogy to illustrate the incompatibility of the old religious practices with the new life that He brings. Commentators explain that the combination of old forms of piety with the new religious life is like patching an old garment with unfulled cloth or joining an antiquated system with the fresh, complete Gospel. This joining only results in a worse tear, as the new piece tears away from the old fabric. Additionally, commentators emphasize that the disciples were not required to fast at that time because the bridegroom, Jesus Himself, was with them.
