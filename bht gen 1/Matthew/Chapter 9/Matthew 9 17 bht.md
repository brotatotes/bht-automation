# Matthew 9:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we find an image of wine-skins or bottles that carry significant symbolism. These containers, traditionally made of leather, represent the old and fragile forms of the previous covenant. As one commentator notes, the wine-skins can burst under the pressure of fermentation, symbolizing the limitations and eventual destruction of the old form. However, a new covenant requires new means, and as another commentator emphasizes, God appoints a fresh and different outward form to contain the new life. This verse encourages us to embrace the new, while recognizing the need to preserve both the life and the form.
