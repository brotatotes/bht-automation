# Matthew 9:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, commentators highlight the idea of a transformative and incompatible encounter between the old and the new. The old bottles symbolize the rigid and self-righteous religious practices, incapable of containing the living spirit of the New Covenant. As the new wine, representing the love of God and the Gospel, ferments and expands, it breaks the old containers and must be poured into fresh vessels. This verse reminds us that the transformative power of God's grace requires openness and flexibility to embrace the new and leave behind the old.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The former parable respected the outward freedom and simple truthfulness of the New Covenant; this regards its inner spirit, its pervading principle."
2. "The new wine is something too living and strong for so weak a moral frame; it shatters the fair outside of ceremonial seeming; and the spirit is lost, the man is neither a blameless Jew nor a faithful Christian; both are spoiled."
3. "It was and is the custom in the East to carry their wine on a journey in leather bottles, generally of goats’ skin, sometimes of asses’ or camels’ skin."

(Note: The commentary is quite lengthy, so I have selected three quotes that provide a concise and insightful understanding of the verse.)

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Bottles [ασκους] . Rev., rightly, wine - skins, though our word bottle originally carried the true meaning, being a bottle of leather."
2. "In Spain wine is still brought to market in pig - skins."
3. "When old, they break under the fermentation of the wine."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The living principle of the new covenant, if we attempt to enclose it in the old ceremonial man, is lost, the wine runneth out, and the skin perish; even the form is destroyed."
2. "New emergencies require new means. In this case, God had appointed the new means."
3. "The new life assumes an outward form, differing from the antiquated form, and we must seek to preserve both life and form: both are preserved together."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Old wineskins (ασκους παλαιους). Not glass 'bottles' but wineskins used as bottles as is true in Palestine yet, goatskins with the rough part inside." 
2. "The new wine will ferment and crack the dried-up old skins."
3. "The wine is spilled (εκχειτα), poured out."

### John Gill:
1. "By 'old bottles' are meant, the Scribes and Pharisees... in whom the old man was predominant, were mere formal professors of religion, and self-righteous persons."
2. "By 'new wine' is meant... the love and favour of God... the Gospel... the blessings of grace which spring from the love of God."
3. "By 'new bottles' are meant sinners, whom Christ calls by his grace, and the Spirit regenerates and renews, who are made new creatures in Christ."

These quotes highlight the contrast between the old and the new - the old bottles representing the self-righteous and the new bottles representing those who have been transformed by God's grace. They emphasize that the love of God, the Gospel, and the blessings of grace cannot be received by those who cling to their old ways, but are embraced and preserved by those who have been made new in Christ.

### John Wesley:
1. "Fermenting wine will soon burst those bottles, the leather of which is almost worn out." 
2. "The word properly means vessels made of goats' skins, wherein they formerly put wine, (and do in some countries to this day) to convey it from place to place." 
3. "Put new wine into new bottles — Give harsh doctrines to such as have strength to receive them."
