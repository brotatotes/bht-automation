## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "These words are common to the three Evangelists, as also ἀφέωνταί σου (or σοι ) αἱ ἁμ."

3. "The perseverance they had manifested was the evidence of their faith or confidence in his power to heal the sick man."

1. "They brought (προσεφερον). Imperfect, 'were bringing,' graphic picture made very vivid by the details in Mark 2:1-4 and Luke 5:17."
2. "Lying on a bed (stretched on a couch), perfect passive participle, a little bed or couch (κλινιδιον) in Luke 5:19, 'a pallet' (κραβατος) in Mark 2:4; Mark 2:9; Mark 2:11."
3. "Thy sins are forgiven (αφιεντα). Present passive indicative (aoristic present). Luke (Luke 5:21) has αφεωντα, Doric and Ionic perfect passive indicative for the Attic αφειντα, one of the dialectical forms appearing in the Koine."

### John Gill:
1. "And Jesus seeing their faith; the faith of the bearers of him, his friends, who brought out a man to be healed, who was otherwise incurable; and though they could not, for the multitude, bring him directly to Christ, they were not discouraged, but took the pains to carry him to the top of the house, and there let him down through the roof, or tiling; as both Mark and Luke say; and then set him down before him, believing he was able to cure him."
2. "He calls him son, either meaning by it no more than 'man'; see Luke 5:20 or using it as a kind, tender, and endearing appellation; or as considering him in the grace of adoption, as one that God had put among the children, had given to him as such, and whom he should bring to glory."
3. "He bids him 'be of good cheer', whose animal spirits were fainting through the disease that was upon him, and the fatigue he had underwent in being brought to him; and his soul more distressed and dejected, under a sense of his sins and transgressions; which Jesus knowing, very pertinently says, 'thy sins be forgiven thee'; than which, nothing could be more cheering and reviving to him."

### John Wesley:

It emphasizes that not only the faith of the paralytic but also the faith of those who brought him played a significant role in the healing that took place.

2. "Son - A title of tenderness and condescension." This quote sheds light on the compassionate nature of Jesus. By addressing the paralytic as "son," Jesus demonstrates his love and care for him, showing a tender and humble attitude towards those in need.

3. "Mark 2:3; Luke 5:18." This quote references other biblical passages where similar events are described. It suggests that the story of the paralytic being brought to Jesus is not an isolated incident but is found in multiple accounts, further emphasizing its significance and relevance in the biblical narrative.
