# Matthew 9:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, a timid yet determined woman has been suffering for twelve years and has sought help from various sources, but to no avail. She believes that if she can just touch a part of Jesus' clothing, she will be healed. Her conviction and reasoning are influenced by the Spirit of God, and even though she may have had some doubts or hoped for a magical cure, her faith in Jesus remains firm. Despite her desperation, she thinks it through and firmly believes in the power of a simple touch.
