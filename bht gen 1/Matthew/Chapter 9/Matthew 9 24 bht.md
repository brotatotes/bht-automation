# Matthew 9:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, commentators emphasize the temporary nature of death, comparing it to sleep. Both commentators note that the young girl is not truly dead, but rather "sleeping" until she is raised again. They highlight that Jesus' power extends beyond death, as seen in His resurrection and promise to raise believers. Although some may ridicule His words, the commentators emphasize the faith required to truly understand the nature of death as a transitional state rather than an ultimate end.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Philip Schaff:
1. "For the damsel is not dead, but sleepeth. A direct reference to the miracle, which He was about to perform. She did not die, as others die; but she is as one who sleepeth, for I am about to raise her, as one is wakened from a sleep." 

2. "The same words were used of Lazarus, in whose case the actual raising from actual death is distinctly affirmed. There is also a deeper and more general meaning; for Christ has, by His own resurrection and His promise to raise believers, declared death to be but a sleep."

3. "And they laughed him to scorn. They laughed Him down, not sharing the father's faith."

### John Wesley:
1. "Withdraw - There is no need of you now."
2. "For the maid is not dead - Her life is not at an end."
3. "But sleepeth - This is only a temporary suspension of sense and motion, which should rather be termed sleep than death."
