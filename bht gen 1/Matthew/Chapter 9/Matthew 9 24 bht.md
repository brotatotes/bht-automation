# Matthew 9:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, Jesus assures the mourners that the girl is not dead, but merely sleeping. This statement challenges the notion of death as finality and emphasizes Jesus' power to restore life. The commentators highlight that Jesus' words signify a temporary state, comparable to sleep, and not a definitive end. The reactions of the mourners, who scorned and mocked Jesus, further emphasize the disbelief in His ability to bring the dead back to life.
