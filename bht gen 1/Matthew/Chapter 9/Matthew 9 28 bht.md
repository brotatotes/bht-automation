# Matthew 9:28 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, Jesus is being followed by two blind men who are desperate for a cure. He initially seems to ignore their cries, entering a house without acknowledging them, to test and deepen their faith. Despite this, the blind men persist in their pursuit, demonstrating their determination to receive what they ask for. Their unwavering faith is key, as they trust in Jesus' power and acknowledge him as the Messiah, which ultimately leads to their healing. Jesus grants their request while also drawing out and strengthening their faith through this process.

2. "Faith embraces the mercy and fatherly love of God along with his power, and the generous design of Christ along with his ability to save."

2. "This question is put, not as being ignorant of, or as doubting their faith in him, which they had expressed, in calling him the son of David; and had shown the firmness and constancy of it, by following him, though he took no notice of them." 
3. "They firmly believed he had power to do it, they had not the least doubt and hesitation in their minds about it; for though their bodily eyes were at present dark, the eyes of their understandings were enlightened, to see and know Jesus to be the true Messiah, David's Son, and Lord."
