# Matthew 9:28 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In a house in Capernaum, Jesus was approached by two blind men crying out for mercy. He tested their faith and patience with his silence along the way. To deepen their faith and expectation, he asked them if they believed in his ability to heal, to which they confessed their unwavering belief. Through their simple profession of faith, Jesus granted them the miracle they sought, impressing upon them his divine power. Both their determination and acknowledgment of his authority were duly rewarded.
