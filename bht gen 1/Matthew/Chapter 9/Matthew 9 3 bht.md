# Matthew 9:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the midst of an audience comprised of influential religious figures, there arose skepticism and malice. The man's audacious claims, which implicated him in blasphemy, instigated their discontent. By daring to assume a divine authority and asserting a power that is solely God's, he unveiled his arrogance and presumption. The gravity of his words, ascribing to himself what belongs exclusively to God, left the scribes with no choice but to conclude that he was guilty of sacrilege.
