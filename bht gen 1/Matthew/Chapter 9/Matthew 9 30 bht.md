## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The purpose of our Lord’s earnestness appears to have been twofold: (1) that He might not be so occupied and over-pressed with applications as to have neither time nor strength for the preaching of the Gospel: (2) to prevent the already-excited people from taking some public measure of recognition, and thus arousing the malice of the Pharisees before His hour was come."
2. "No doubt the two men were guilty of an act of disobedience in thus breaking the Lord’s solemn injunction: for obedience is better than sacrifice; the humble observance of the word of the Lord, than the most laborious and wide-spread will-worship after man’s own mind and invention."
3. "Trench (Miracles, p. 197) well remarks, that the fact of almost all the Romish interpreters having applauded this act, is 'very characteristic, and rests on very deep differences.'"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

### John Calvin:
1. "Either he wished to have other persons as witnesses of the miracle, or to delay the publication of it till another time."
2. "Their conduct in immediately proclaiming it everywhere is worthy of blame."
3. "There was, no doubt, some reason for forbidding it, which is unknown to us; and those men, through inconsiderate zeal, spread the rumor before the proper time."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "And their eyes were opened. A figurative but natural expression for restoration to sight."
2. "And Jesus solemnly charged them, almost equivalent to ‘sternly threatened them.’"
3. "These men had already shouted their belief in His Messiahship, in the public street, and their over-ready zeal might provoke over-ready opposition."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Strictly charged them (ενεβριμηθη αυτοις). A difficult word, compound of εν and βριμαομα (to be moved with anger). It is used of horses snorting (Aeschylus, Theb. 461), of men fretting or being angry (Daniel 11:30)."
2. "The word describes rather a rush of deep feeling which in the synoptic passages showed itself in a vehement injunctive and in John 11:33 in look and manner" (McNeile).
3. "Looked severely, contracting His eyebrows, and shaking His head at them as they are wont to do who wish to make sure that secrets will be kept."

### John Gill:
1. "Their sight was perfectly restored to them; and they had a clear, full, and true sight of objects, as men have, whose vision faculty is in its full strength and rigour, and their eyes open."
2. "This was a very strict charge, and according to the signification of the word here used, it was given with great austerity of countenance, and severity of expression, in a very rough and threatening manner."
3. "The reasons for concealing the miracle are not very obvious; it seems likely, that with the same view he took no notice of these blind men in the street, but went into an house, and cured them; which seems to be, to shun all appearance of vain glory, or seeking popular applause, that he gave these orders."
