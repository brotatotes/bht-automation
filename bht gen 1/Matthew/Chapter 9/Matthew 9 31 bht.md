# Matthew 9:31 Commentary Help Text

In this verse, we see the spreading fame of Jesus after his miraculous healing, revealing his power as the Son of God.

Despite their disobedience, the healing of the demoniac showcased Jesus' compassion and desire to free people from spiritual bondage. However, their overzealous actions illustrate the importance of following Christ's will over our own inclinations.
