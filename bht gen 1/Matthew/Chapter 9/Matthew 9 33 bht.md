# Matthew 9:33 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse being described highlights the instantaneous and complete restoration of someone's natural faculties, which was a result that had never been seen before. This miraculous healing power displayed by Christ evoked awe and astonishment among the people. Despite witnessing such extraordinary wonders, the people of Israel, known for their familiarity with God's works, still wrestled with doubt and unbelief. This serves as a sobering reminder that even when we have experienced God's faithfulness in the past, we must continually cultivate a heart of trust and reliance on Him.
