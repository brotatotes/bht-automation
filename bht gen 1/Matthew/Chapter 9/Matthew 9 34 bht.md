# Matthew 9:34 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we see a contrast between the Pharisees' rejection and the people's acknowledgment of Jesus' divine power. The Pharisees, in their stubbornness, attribute Jesus' miracles to evil forces, displaying their refusal to accept him as the Messiah. However, the people confess the uniqueness of Jesus' authority and recognize the divine glory that accompanies his miraculous works. Jesus, in response, exposes the fallacy of the Pharisees' argument and demonstrates his authority over the demonic realm. Despite the evidence before them, the Pharisees, blinded by wickedness, pervert the work of God and seek to defame Jesus.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "This seems to be the first muttering of a theory of such miracles which soon became a fixed mode of calumniating them." 
2. "A theory which would be ridiculous if it were not melancholy as an outburst of the darkest malignity."
3. "As the Mission of the Twelve supposes the previous choice of them... it is introduced here out of its proper place."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The Pharisees acknowledged the reality of the miracle and the facts in the case, but they twisted the source of Jesus' power, attributing it to Beelzebub. This reveals their stubbornness and refusal to accept Jesus as the Messiah." 

2. "Their accusation implies that Jesus is in league with the devil, which is a grave insult and a rejection of his divine authority. It shows their unwillingness to recognize the true power and identity of Jesus." 

3. "Jesus, in response to their reasoning, refutes their claims and exposes the fallacy of their argument. He demonstrates his authority over the demonic realm and reveals that it is by the Spirit of God that he casts out demons."

### John Calvin:
1. "We ought to observe the contrast between the applause of the people and the blasphemy of those men."
2. "The saying of the people, that nothing like it ever happened in Israel, is a confession arising from a sense of the divine glory."
3. "We learn from it also, that, when wickedness has reached the height of blindness, there is no work of God, however evident, which it will not pervert."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Many of them were probably attracted by the fact that Jairus had called upon Jesus for help."
2. "Their state was even worse than that of the dumb demoniac; they used their power of speaking to blaspheme one who cast out demons, as if the cause of the latter were their own."
3. "If they had understood the saying mentioned in the last verse, as referring to the Messiah, it would provoke some such expression as is here recorded."

### John Gill:
1. "These men could not bear, that so much honour and glory should be given to Christ."
2. "They could not deny matter of fact, that he had cast out a devil; nor could they say he had done an ill thing in so doing."
3. "To fix a mark of infamy upon him, foolishly impute it to a diabolical influence, as if one devil would eject another."
