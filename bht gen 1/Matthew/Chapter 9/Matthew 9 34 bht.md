# Matthew 9:34 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we see the Pharisees' desperate attempts to undermine Jesus and discredit His power. They acknowledge the reality of the miracles, but their response is fueled by dark malignity and stubborn refusal to accept Jesus as the true source of power. Their accusation not only questions His authority, but also seeks to tarnish His character and delegitimize His ministry. Jesus exposes the flawed logic of the Pharisees, revealing the absurdity of their claim and demonstrating that their blasphemy stems from a state of blindness and wickedness.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "This seems to be the first muttering of a theory of such miracles which soon became a fixed mode of calumniating them—a theory which would be ridiculous if it were not melancholy as an outburst of the darkest malignity."
2. "As the Mission of the Twelve supposes the previous choice of them—of which our Evangelist gives no account, and which did not take place till a later stage of our Lord's public life—it is introduced here out of its proper place."
3. "Third Galilean Circuit (Matthew 9:1- :) —and probably the last."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The Pharisees acknowledged the reality of the miracle, but their response reveals their stubborn refusal to accept Jesus as the true source of power. They attributed His works to Beelzebub, the prince of the devils, suggesting a malicious alliance between Jesus and the forces of evil." 

2. "Their accusation not only questioned Jesus' authority, but also sought to undermine His character and discredit His ministry. It was a desperate attempt to delegitimize His miraculous works and turn the people against Him."

2. "Their state was even worse than that of the dumb demoniac; they used their power of speaking to blaspheme one who cast out demons, as if the cause of the latter were their own."
3. "If they had understood the saying mentioned in the last verse, as referring to the Messiah, it would provoke some such expression as is here recorded."
