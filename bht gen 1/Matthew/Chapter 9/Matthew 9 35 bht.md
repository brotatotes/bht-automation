## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The language here is so identical with that used in describing the first circuit, that we may presume the work done on both occasions was much the same. It was just a further preparation of the soil, and a fresh sowing of the precious seed." 

2. "To these fruitful journeyings of the Redeemer, 'with healing in His wings,' Peter no doubt alludes, when, in his address to the household of Cornelius, he spoke of 'How God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and with power: who went about doing good, and healing all that were oppressed of the devil: for God was with Him' (Acts 10:38)."

3. "After a whole night spent in prayer, He had called His more immediate disciples, and from them had solemnly chosen the twelve; then, coming down from the mountain, on which this was transacted, to the multitudes that waited for Him below, He had addressed to them—as we take it—that discourse which bears so strong a resemblance to the Sermon on the Mount that many critics take it to be the same."

### John Calvin:

2. "The gospel of the kingdom... God gathered to himself a people sadly scattered, that he might reign in the midst of them; and, indeed, he erected his throne for the express purpose of bestowing on all his people perfect happiness."
