2. "To these fruitful journeyings of the Redeemer, 'with healing in His wings,' Peter no doubt alludes, when, in his address to the household of Cornelius, he spoke of 'How God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and with power: who went about doing good, and healing all that were oppressed of the devil: for God was with Him' (Acts 10:38)."
3. "Soon after this, it should seem, the multitudes still hanging on Him, Jesus is touched with their wretched and helpless condition, and acts as is now to be described."
