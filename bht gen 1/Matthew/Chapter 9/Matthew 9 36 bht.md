# Matthew 9:36 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse described portrays a scene where Jesus, filled with compassion, looks upon the crowds in different cities who are burdened, wearied, and scattered. These people, reminiscent of sheep without a shepherd, are oppressed by the religious leaders' heavy burdens and traditions. Jesus, seeing their distressed and neglected state, yearns for their well-being and longs to gather and shepherd them, providing the care and spiritual nourishment they lack. In their wandering, they find themselves lacking competent spiritual leaders and teachers, and are in danger of losing their souls.
