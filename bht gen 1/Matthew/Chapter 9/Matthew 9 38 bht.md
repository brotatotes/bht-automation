# Matthew 9:38 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we are encouraged to pray to the Lord of the harvest, who is the great Lord and Proprietor of all. The word "send forth" implies a sense of urgency and necessity in forcefully propelling or expelling laborers for the harvest. Through this prayer, we acknowledge that God is the one who raises up and equips sincere and faithful ministers of the Gospel, and that we need to be bold and assertive in fulfilling our mission even in the face of resistance.
