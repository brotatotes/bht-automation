# Matthew 9:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse in question portrays Jesus displaying his spiritual power by perceiving the secret thoughts and reasoning of others, which serves as a clear proof of his omniscience and divinity. It rebukes the opposition to Christ's power to forgive sins, challenging the wicked rejection of God. This knowledge of hearts, which reveals divine insight, should have been sufficient to prove Jesus as the true Messiah, but his understanding exceeds any testimony of men. This instance is a glaring demonstration of his extraordinary ability to intimately know what is within the hearts of humanity.
