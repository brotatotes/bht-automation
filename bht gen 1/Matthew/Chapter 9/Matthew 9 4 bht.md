# Matthew 9:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, we see Jesus revealing his divine nature by demonstrating his knowledge of the thoughts and intentions hidden in the hearts of men. This serves as a rebuke to those who oppose his power and authority to forgive sins, which is deemed wicked according to one commentator. Despite the evidence provided, Jesus was not dependent on human testimony to validate his authority, as he had an inherent understanding of mankind's thoughts and motives.
