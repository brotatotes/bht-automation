1. "In our Lord’s argument it must be carefully noted, that He does not ask, which is easiest, to forgive sins, or to raise a sick man...but, which is easiest, to claim this power or that, to say Thy sins be forgiven thee, or to say, Arise and walk?"
2. "That (i.e. the former) is easiest, and I will now prove my right to say it, by saying with effect and with an outward consequence setting its seal to my truth, the harder word, Arise and walk."
