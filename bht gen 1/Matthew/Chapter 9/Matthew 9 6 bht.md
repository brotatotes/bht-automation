# Matthew 9:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, the speaker, who is simultaneously divine and human, demonstrates both authority and grace. They offer visible proof of their dual nature by forgiving sins in their own person. Through their incarnation, they bring the power and authority of God to earth, showing that forgiveness and redemption should be sought in their presence. They not only heal physical ailments but also restore the spiritual well-being of individuals, leaving no doubt about their divine and human interconnection.
