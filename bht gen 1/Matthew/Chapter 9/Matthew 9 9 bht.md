# Matthew 9:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, a man named Matthew is called by Jesus to become one of His disciples. Matthew, also known as Levi, was a tax collector sitting at the receipt of custom, which was a place where taxes were collected. Despite the despised nature of his occupation, Matthew's readiness to obey and leave everything behind demonstrates the divine power of Jesus' word and the grace of God in choosing him as an apostle. The mention of Matthew's name emphasizes his identity as the author of the Gospel and the significance of his calling and conversion.
