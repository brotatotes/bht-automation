# Matthew 9:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, a man named Matthew, also known as Levi, is seen sitting at the receipt of custom, which refers to the custom house where taxes were collected. Matthew, a tax collector, had an occupation despised by the Jews, but Jesus saw his potential for transformation and redemption beyond his occupation. Matthew, in his modesty, referred to himself as Matthew, while the other evangelists used his more honorable name, Levi.
