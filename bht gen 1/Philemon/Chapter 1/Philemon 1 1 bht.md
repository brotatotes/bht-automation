# choicest prompt v1 X bht prompt v3; ['Henry Alford', 'Jamieson Fausset Brown', 'Albert Barnes', 'Marvin Vincent', 'John Calvin', 'Philip Schaff', 'Archibald T Robertson', 'Adam Clarke']

## Henry Alford:
1. "He does not designate himself as ἀπόστολος, or the like, as writing familiarly, and not authoritatively."
2. "To what grade in the ministry he belonged, it is idle to enquire: nor does Col 4:17 furnish us with any data."
3. "Meyer remarks the tact of the Apostle in associating with Philemon those connected with his house, but not going beyond the limits of the house."

## Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Prisoner of Jesus Christ - one whom Christ's cause has made a prisoner." This quote highlights the idea that the writer sees themselves as being bound to the cause of Christ, willingly surrendering their freedom for the sake of spreading the Gospel.

2. "He does not call himself... 'Paul an apostle,' as he is writing familiarly, not authoritatively." This quote suggests that the writer is adopting a more personal and intimate tone in this particular letter, emphasizing a sense of closeness and camaraderie with the recipients.

3. "...fellow labourer - in building up the Church at Colosse." This quote indicates that the writer sees themselves as a partner in the work of establishing and strengthening the church in Colosse, emphasizing their shared efforts and commitment to the same cause.

## Albert Barnes:
1. "Paul, a prisoner of Jesus Christ - A prisoner at Rome in the cause of Jesus Christ." 
2. "Timothy our brother - Timothy, it seems, had come to him agreeably to his request."
3. "Unto Philemon our dearly beloved, and fellow-laborer - It means a co-worker, or helper, and doubtless here means that he was a helper or fellow-worker in the great cause to which Paul had devoted his life."

## Marvin Vincent:
1. "A prisoner for Christ's sake."
2. "Timothy, our brother."
3. "Philemon, an inhabitant, and possibly a native of Colossae in Phrygia."

## John Calvin:
1. "Sending back a runaway slave and thief, he supplicates pardon for him. But in pleading this cause, he discourses about Christian forbearance with such ability, that he appears to speak about the interests of the whole Church rather than the private affairs of a single individual."
2. "In behalf of a man of the lowest condition, he demeans himself so modestly and humbly, that nowhere else is the meekness of his temper painted in a more lively manner."
3. "In the same sense in which he elsewhere calls himself an Apostle of Christ, or a minister of Christ, he now calls himself 'a prisoner of Christ;' because the chains by which he was bound on account of the gospel, were the ornaments or badges of that embassy which he exercised for Christ."

## Philip Schaff:
1. "As the matter on which the apostle is about to write is rather personal and social in its character, he does not style himself an apostle in his address, but employs a word which should challenge sympathy more than make a claim to obedience."
2. "The sacrifices which Philemon was making for the church at Colossæ, by receiving the congregation into his house, entitles him to this name. And the man who did so much for Christ’s cause, we may be sure was ready to do more."
3. "From the close proximity in which this name stands to Philemon’s, it is natural to suppose that she was some relative, wife or sister, though in the apostle’s estimate it is her best title that, like Philemon, she is a Christian."

## Archibald T Robertson:
1. "A prisoner of Christ Jesus" - This phrase emphasizes Paul's commitment to Christ, even in his imprisonment. It shows that Paul sees himself as bound to Christ, willingly submitting to His authority and purpose.

2. "More touching occasion of pride as Paul writes with his manacled right hand" - This statement highlights the personal sacrifice and dedication of Paul, who writes this letter while in chains. It adds depth to the significance of his words and the urgency of his plea to Philemon.

3. "He was active in the church in Colossae and was beloved by Paul" - This reveals the close relationship between Paul and Philemon, indicating that their bond goes beyond mere acquaintance. It suggests that Paul's appeal to Philemon is based on a deep sense of love and mutual respect.

## Adam Clarke:
1. "Paul, a prisoner of Jesus Christ... bound with a chain: this is certainly its meaning; and it shows us in some measure his circumstances - one arm was bound with a chain to the arm of the soldier to whose custody he had been delivered." 
2. "There is a peculiarity in the use of proper names in this epistle which is not found in any other part of St. Paul's writings." 
3. "PHILEMON, φιλημων. Affectionate or beloved, from φιλημα, a kiss; this led the apostle to say: To Philemon our DEARLY BELOVED."
