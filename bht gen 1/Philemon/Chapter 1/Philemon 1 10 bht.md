# choicest prompt v1 X bht prompt v3; ['Henry Alford', 'Jamieson Fausset Brown', 'Albert Barnes', 'Marvin Vincent', 'John Calvin', 'Philip Schaff', 'Archibald T Robertson', 'Adam Clarke']

## Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "In the Greek, the name 'Onesimus' is skillfully put last, he puts first a favorable description of him before he mentions the name that had fallen into so bad repute with Philemon."
2. "Scripture does not sanction slavery, but at the same time does not begin a political crusade against it."
3. "It sets forth principles of love to our fellow men which were sure (as they have done) in due time to undermine and overthrow it, without violently convulsing the then existing political fabric, by stirring up slaves against their masters."

## Albert Barnes:
1. "The phrase 'my son' makes the way easy for the mention of his name, for he had already found the way to his heart before his eye lighted on his name, by the mention of the relation which he sustained to himself."
2. "Who could refuse to such a man as Paul - a laborious servant of Christ - an aged man, exhausted with his many sufferings and toils - and a prisoner - a request which he made for one whom he regarded as his son?"
3. "Was there ever more delicacy evinced in preparing the way for disarming one of prejudice, and carrying an appeal to his heart?"

## Marvin Vincent:
1. "Onesimus was a runaway Phrygian slave, who had committed some crime and therefore had fled from his master and hidden himself in Rome."
2. "Under Roman law the slave was a chattel. The master's power was unlimited. He might mutilate, torture, or kill the slave at his pleasure."
3. "Tracking fugitive slaves was a trade. Recovered slaves were branded on the forehead, condemned to double labor, and sometimes thrown to the beasts in the amphitheater."

## John Calvin:
1. "Paul shows that Onesimus is so closely related to him as to afford a good reason for supplicating in his behalf."
2. "Here it is of importance to consider how deep is his condescension, when he gives the name of 'son' to a slave, and a runaway, and a thief."
3. "To renew a soul of man and form it anew to the image of God â€” is not a human work, and it is of this spiritual regeneration that he now speaks."

## Philip Schaff:
1. "He puts the tenderest word in the forefront of his petition, and speaks of the fugitive slave as his child, before he mentions him by name."
2. "Conversion is so often spoken of in the New Testament as a new birth, that it is not surprising that the apostle employs the figure in speaking of one who had been won to Christ by his ministry."
3. "The Jews, as may be seen all through the Old Testament, were specially regardful of the meaning of names, so we need not wonder that when he writes the name, the sense which it had, and how aforetime the bearer of it had not corresponded to it in his character, should at once come into his mind, and furnish the thought which follows in the next verse."

## Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Tender and affectionate reference to Onesimus as his spiritual child." 
2. "Paul is evidently proud of winning Onesimus to Christ though a prisoner himself." 
3. "Paul is proud of winning Onesimus to Christ."

## Adam Clarke:
1. "Onesimus was converted by St. Paul while he was a prisoner at Rome." 
2. "It is evident that Onesimus's conversion was a significant event, as Paul refers to him as 'my son.'" 
3. "The timing of Onesimus's conversion, just before Paul wrote this epistle, suggests the transformative power of the Gospel even in the midst of challenging circumstances."
