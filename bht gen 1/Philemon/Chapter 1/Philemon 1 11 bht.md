# choicest prompt v1 X bht prompt v3; ['Henry Alford', 'Jamieson Fausset Brown', 'Albert Barnes', 'Marvin Vincent', 'John Calvin', 'Philip Schaff', 'Archibald T Robertson', 'Adam Clarke']

## Henry Alford:
1. "He had been ἄχρηστος in having run away, and apparently (Phm 1:18) defrauded his master as well."
2. "On account of the σοὶ καὶ ἐμοί, εὔχρηστον must not be limited to the sense of outward profit, but extended to a spiritual meaning as well."
3. "Profitable to me, as the fruit of my ministry, to thee as a servant, and also as a Christian brother (Phm 1:16)."

## Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Not only was he 'unprofitable,' but positively injurious, having 'wronged' his master." 
2. "Without godliness a man has no station." 
3. "Profitable in spiritual, as well as in temporal things."

## Albert Barnes:
1. "It is possible that there may be an allusion here to the meaning of the name 'Onesimus,' which denotes 'profitable'... that now he would be found to do so." 

2. "The Greek here is εὔχρηστον euchrēston, but the meaning is about the same as that of the word Onesimus. It denotes very useful."

3. "Paul had doubtless found him useful to him as Christian brother in his bonds, and it is easy to conceive that, in his circumstances, he would greatly desire to retain him with him."

## Marvin Vincent:
1. "Christianity knows nothing of hopeless cases. It professes its ability to take the most crooked stick and bring it straight, to flash a new power into the blackest carbon, which will turn it into a diamond." 
2. "A strong appeal to Philem. lies in the fact that Paul is to reap benefit from Onesimus in his new attitude as a christian brother."
3. "The words are ingeniously thrown in as an afterthought."

## Philip Schaff:
1. "Alluding not only to the loss which Philemon had suffered by his slave absconding, but also to the bad service which a disaffected slave, ready to run away as soon as an opportunity offered, would have rendered to his master for a long time before."
2. "The returning runaway would come back in the spirit which St. Paul inculcates elsewhere, teaching that Christian slaves should count their own masters worthy of all honour."
3. "Men were a long while in learning the lesson against slavery, even good men finding no wrong in it, provided slaves were well cared for."

## Archibald T Robertson:
1. "The word is from ονησις (profit) and that from ονινημ, to profit, to help." 
2. "Play (pun) on the meaning of the name Onesimus (ονησιμος, useful) as once 'useless' (αχρηστος, verbal adjective, α privative and χραομα, to use)." 
3. "Still further play on the name Onesimus by ευχρηστον (verbal adjective from ευ and χραομα, to use)."

## Adam Clarke:
1. "Alluding to the meaning of Onesimus's name, as has been already noted." 
2. "The apostle uses a different Greek word to express the same idea." 
3. "The word 'unprofitable' highlights the transformation that has taken place in Onesimus's life through his encounter with the gospel."


# BHT:
In this Bible verse, there is a reference to Onesimus, who was once unprofitable and had wronged his master. The commentators note that his name, which means "profitable," is now fitting due to the transformation in his life through the power of Christianity. The verse also emphasizes the spiritual and outward benefits that Onesimus now brings as a Christian brother and servant.
