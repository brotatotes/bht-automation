# Philemon 11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, the individual being described was once considered unprofitable, having run away and wronged his master. However, through their transformation to becoming a Christian brother, they have become useful and valuable. The name itself holds significance, as it means profitable, and it is through the power of grace and godliness that this individual is able to bring profit and benefit not only to themselves but also to others in the capacity of their ministry.
