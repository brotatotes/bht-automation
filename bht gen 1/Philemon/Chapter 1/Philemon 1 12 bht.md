# choicest prompt v1 X bht prompt v3; ['Henry Alford', 'Jamieson Fausset Brown', 'Albert Barnes', 'Marvin Vincent', 'John Calvin', 'Philip Schaff', 'Archibald T Robertson', 'Adam Clarke']

## Henry Alford:
1. "There does not appear to be any allusion to the fact of sonship in τὰ ἐμὰ σπλἁγχνα, as Chrys., Thdrt. (ἐμός ἐστιν υἱός, ἐκ τῶν ἐμῶν γεγέννηται σπλάγχνων), al.: for thus the spiritual similitude would be confused, being here introduced materially."
2. "But the expression more probably means, mine own heart 'as dear to me as mine own heart.'"
3. "The construction (see var. readd.) is an anacoluthon: the Apostle goes off into the relative clause, and loses sight, as so often, of the construction with which he began: taking it up again at Philemon 1:17."

## Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "As dear to me as my own heart [Alford]." 
2. "The object of my most intense affection as that of a parent for a child." 
3. "As myself."

## Albert Barnes:
1. "Paul had no power to send Onesimus back to his master unless he chose to go."
2. "There may have been many reasons why Onesimus desired to return to Colosse."
3. "The passage shows that it is right to aid a servant of any kind to return to his master, if he desires it."

## Marvin Vincent:
1. "The epistolary aorist, see on 1 Peter 5:12."
2. "That Onesimus accompanied the letter appears from Colossians 4:7-9."
3. "Render aujton him as Rev., in his own person; his very self."

## John Calvin:
1. "Nothing could have been more powerful for assuaging the wrath of Philemon; for if he had refused to forgive his slave, he would thus have used cruelty against 'the bowels' of Paul."
2. "This is remarkable kindness displayed by Paul, that he did not hesitate to receive, as it were into his bowels, a contemptible slave, and thief, and runaway, so as to defend him from the indignation of his master."
3. "And, indeed, if the conversion of a man to God were estimated by us, at its proper value, we too would embrace, in the same manner, those who should give evidence that they had truly and sincerely repented."

## Philip Schaff:
1. "The discipline of Onesimus’ return was food both for master and slave, to the latter that he might have an opportunity of making some amends for his previous wrongdoing, and might show that his Christianity was worth the name and was already fruitful in ripe actions." 

2. "To Philemon also it was a benefit that he should be called on to exercise forgiveness for a serious wrong, while the more tender conduct which would be shown towards Onesimus in the future, would do something, if not much, toward loosening the bonds of any other slaves among the congregation at Colossæ."

3. "St. Paul everywhere else uses the word rendered ‘bowels’ for the seat of the feelings and emotions, so that it is better to interpret the words here as an expression of deep affection."

## Archibald T Robertson:
1. "In his own person (αυτον). 'Himself,' intensive pronoun with ον (whom)." - This quote highlights the personal nature of Onesimus's arrival, emphasizing that he is coming in person rather than through a messenger or letter.
2. "My very heart (τα εμα σπλαγχνα). As in verse Philemon 1:7." - This quote suggests that Paul has a deep emotional connection with Onesimus, comparing his love for him to the love he has for his own son.
3. "He almost loves Onesimus as his own son." - This quote further emphasizes the strong affection and care that Paul has for Onesimus, comparing it to the love a father has for his child.

## Adam Clarke:
1. "The Christian religion never cancels any civil relations; a slave, on being converted, and becoming a free man of Christ, has no right to claim, on that ground, emancipation from the service of his master."
2. "Justice, therefore, required St. Paul to send back Onesimus to his master, and conscience obliged Onesimus to agree in the propriety of the measure."
3. "But love to the servant induced the apostle to write this conciliating letter to the master."


# BHT:
In this verse, we see a deep and complex relationship between Paul, Onesimus, and Philemon. Paul's affection for Onesimus is compared to the love of a parent for their child. Though Onesimus may have desired to return to Colosse for various reasons, Paul recognizes the importance of justice and the need for Onesimus to be reconciled with his master. The letter serves as a plea for Philemon's forgiveness and highlights the power of love in restoring broken relationships.
