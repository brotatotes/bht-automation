## Henry Alford:

2. "For, wert thou here, thou wouldst minister to me." - This quote suggests that if the person being addressed were present, they would serve or assist the speaker.
3. "explained well by Thdrt., ὀφείλεις μοι διακονίαν ὡς μαθητὴς διδασκάλῳ" - This quote refers to the obligation of the person being addressed to serve the speaker as a disciple to a teacher.

## Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "I had such implicit trust in him as to desire to keep him with me for his services."
2. "I would have retained him in your stead - that he might supply in your place all the services to me which you, if you were here, would render in virtue of the love you bear to me."
3. "My bonds endured for the Gospel's sake."

## Albert Barnes:
1. "That he might render me the service which I know you would if you were here."
2. "What he should do for Paul might be regarded as done by Philemon himself."
3. "He might have rendered me assistance, to wit, in such a way as one who was in bonds would need."

## Marvin Vincent:
1. "A beautiful specimen of Christian courtesy and tact; assuming that Philemon would have desired to render these services in person."
2. "A delicate hint at his sufferings is blended with an intimation of the authority which attaches to his appeal as a prisoner of Christ."
3. "This language of Paul is imitated by Ignatius. 'My bonds exhort you' (Tralles, 12.). 'He (Jesus Christ) is my witness, in whom I am bound' (Philadelphia, 7.). 'In whom I bear about my bonds as spiritual pearls' (Ephesians, 11.). 'In the bonds which I bear about, I sing the praises of the churches' (Magnesians, 1.)."

## John Calvin:
1. "It would have been extreme cruelty, to disdain so strong affection manifested by Paul."
2. "Paul himself, through modesty, was unwilling to deprive Philemon of his right."
3. "If exile, imprisonment stripes, blows, and violent seizing of our property, are believed by us to belong to the gospel, as Paul here calls them, whoever refuses to share and partake of them separates himself even from Christ."

## Philip Schaff:
1. "I personally would have liked to do this."
2. "The spiritual father had become much bound unto his child in Christ, and the parting was not acceptable."
3. "The apostle feels sure that if Philemon himself could have been near, there would have been no lack of zeal in him to do whatever might be needed for his father in the faith."

## Archibald T Robertson:
1. "I would fain have kept" - The commentator expresses a strong desire to hold back or keep someone or something. This suggests a sense of attachment or reluctance to let go.

2. "In thy behalf" - The phrase implies that someone is acting or serving on behalf of another person. It suggests a sense of substitution or representation.

3. "He might minister" - This phrase highlights the purpose or intention of someone to continue serving or ministering. It suggests an ongoing and dedicated commitment to fulfilling a specific role or duty.

## Adam Clarke:
1. "Philemon was one of Paul's converts, he became thereby his spiritual father, and had a right to his services when in need."
2. "This was a strong argument, not only to induce Philemon to forgive his servant, but to send him back to the apostle."
3. "That he might minister to him in his master's stead."
