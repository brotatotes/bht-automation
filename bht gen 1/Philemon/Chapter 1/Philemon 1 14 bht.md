# choicest prompt v1 X bht prompt v3; ['Henry Alford', 'Jamieson Fausset Brown', 'Albert Barnes', 'Marvin Vincent', 'John Calvin', 'Philip Schaff', 'Archibald T Robertson', 'Adam Clarke']

## Henry Alford:
1. "Without thy decision... I was willing to do nothing."
2. "That thy good might be not as of necessity, but of free will."
3. "The particular case would serve as an example of it."

## Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Consent should not be as a matter of necessity, but of free will."
2. "Had Paul kept Onesimus, however willing to gratify Paul Philemon might be, he would have no opportunity given him of showing he was so, his leave not having been asked."
3. "Paul's decision to send Onesimus back to Philemon allowed Philemon to demonstrate his willingness to forgive and reconcile with Onesimus."

## Albert Barnes:
1. "He would not retain Onesimus in his service, much as he needed his assistance, without the cordial consent of Philemon."
2. "He preferred to let him return to his master, and to plead for him that he might have a kind reception."
3. "Paul would even then have felt that he was in fact receiving a 'good' at the expense of Philemon, but it would not be a voluntary favor on his part."

## Marvin Vincent:
1. "The aorist tense and the verb meaning to will denote a single, decisive resolution." 
2. "As it were, marks the appearance of necessity." 
3. "Philemon's kindly reception of Onesimus must not even seem to be constrained."

## John Calvin:
1. "No sacrifices are acceptable to God but those which are freely offered."
2. "Willingness is contrasted with constraint, when there is no other opportunity of putting to the test a generous and cheerful act of the will."
3. "That duty which is generously performed, and not through influence exercised by others, is alone entitled to full praise."

## Philip Schaff:
1. "The consent of Philemon should first be gained, and St. Paul will not so far influence his Judgment in the matter, as to write while Onesimus is with him, and ask that he may remain, for then it would appear as if he put some constraint upon the master."
2. "He had done Philemon the service of persuading his slave to go back to him, but of that he says nothing. To found a claim on his own labours was the last thing in his mind."
3. "Once more by his language St. Paul implies that he is sure of the love of Philemon. He knows that he would be ready to do him any kind act, but to the eye of the world, if St. Paul had kept Onesimus in Rome, and merely written to announce what he had done, it would have seemed as though no choice was left to the master as to what he should do. It would be as it were of necessity."

## Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Without thy mind (χωρις της σης γνωμης). Judgment, purpose." 
2. "I would do nothing (ουδεν ηθελησα ποιησα). First aorist active indicative of θελω, I decided, I wished, decision reached." 
3. "But of free will (αλλα κατα εκουσιον). According to what is voluntary."

## Adam Clarke:
1. "The benefit thus conceded might have lost much of its real worth by the consideration that, had he been at Colosse, Philemon would not have sent him to Rome."
2. "Being there and in the apostle's service, he could not with propriety order him home."
3. "The apostle, therefore, by sending him back again, gave Philemon the opportunity to do all as if self-moved to it."


# BHT:
In this Bible verse, we see the Apostle Paul's careful consideration of Philemon's consent in the matter regarding his slave, Onesimus. Paul emphasizes the importance of freedom in decision-making, wanting Philemon's response to be voluntary and sincere rather than coerced. By sending Onesimus back to his master, Paul allows Philemon the chance to demonstrate his willingness to forgive and reconcile. Paul wants the act of kindness to be genuine and not influenced by external pressure.
