# choicest prompt v1 X bht prompt v3; ['Henry Alford', 'Jamieson Fausset Brown', 'Albert Barnes', 'Marvin Vincent', 'John Calvin', 'Philip Schaff', 'Archibald T Robertson', 'Adam Clarke']

## Henry Alford:
1. "τάχα is delicately said, to conciliate Philemon" - This quote highlights the use of the word "τάχα" to soften the request and appeal to Philemon's goodwill.

2. "ἐχωρίσθη] εὐφήμως καὶ τὴν φυγὴν χωρισμὸν καλεῖ" - This quote explains that the word "ἐχωρίσθη" is used to refer to the separation of Onesimus, avoiding any offense to Philemon.

3. "ἀπέχῃς" - This quote suggests that the word "ἀπέχῃς" implies possessing someone fully and entirely, emphasizing the desired outcome for Philemon.

## Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "God’s Providence probably overruled the past evil to ultimately greater good to him."
2. "This thought would soften Philemon’s indignation at Onesimus’ past offense."
3. "Onesimus’ time of absence, however long, was but a short 'hour' compared with the everlasting devotion henceforth binding him to his master."

## Albert Barnes:
1. "It was possible that this was permitted in the Providence of God in order that Onesimus might be brought under the influence of the gospel." 
2. "What appeared to Philemon, therefore, to be a calamity, and what seemed to him to be wrong on the part of Onesimus, might have been permitted to occur in order that he might receive a higher benefit." 
3. "That thou shouldest receive him for ever - That is, in the higher relation of a Christian friend and brother; that he might be united to thee in eternal affection."

## Marvin Vincent:
1. "A humble 'perhaps' often grows into a 'verily, verily' - and a hasty, over-confident 'verily, verily' often dwindles to a hesitating 'perhaps.'" 
2. "Let us not be in too great a hurry to make sure that we have the key of the cabinet where God keeps his purposes, but content ourselves with 'perhaps' when we are interpreting the often questionable ways of His providence."
3. "He also uses the passive voice, not the middle, separated himself, as an intimation that Onesimus' flight was divinely ordered for good."

## John Calvin:
1. "A joyful result may be regarded as a remedy for evils, which is held out to us by the hand of God for blotting out offenses."
2. "Paul therefore reminds Philemon that he ought not to be so greatly offended at the flight of his slave, for it was the cause of a benefit not to be regretted."
3. "He says, therefore, that he was a wanderer for a little time, that, by changing his place, he might be converted and become a new man."

## Philip Schaff:
1. "St. Paul sees in the whole event something more than chance, something guided by God for good."
2. "He by this word seems to lighten somewhat the gravity of the offence, and to represent Onesimus as more worthy of forgiveness."
3. "Onesimus should no longer be the chattel for which so much money had been paid, and from whom a due return was sought, but should be invested with a new interest as a brother in Christ, a partaker of the same grace with his master."

## Archibald T Robertson:
1. "That thou shouldst have him (ινα αυτον απεχηις). Final clause with ινα and present active subjunctive of απεχω, to have back, 'that thou might keep on having him back.'" 

2. "For ever (αιωνιον). 'Eternal,' here and hereafter." 

3. "Surely a noble thing for Paul to say and a word that would touch the best in Philemon."

## Adam Clarke:
1. "He departed for a season - This is another most delicate stroke. He departed thy slave, thy unfaithful slave; he departed for a short time; but so has the mercy of God operated in his behalf, and the providence of God in thine, that he now returns, not an unfaithful slave, in whom thou couldst repose no confidence, but as a brother, a beloved brother in the Lord, to be in the same heavenly family with thee for ever."
2. "Thou hast, therefore, reason to be thankful to God that he did depart, that he might be restored to thee again infinitely better than he was when be left thee."
3. "God has permitted his unfaithfulness, and overruled the whole both to his advantage and thine."


# BHT:
In this Bible verse, a delicate appeal is made to Philemon through the use of specific words and explanations. The past offenses and separation of Onesimus are acknowledged, yet the commentators highlight the possibility that it was all part of God's plan. The verse emphasizes the transformation of Onesimus from a slave to a beloved brother in Christ, encouraging Philemon to receive him forever with gratitude. The commentators suggest that this experience, though initially perceived as an offense, can ultimately lead to a higher benefit for both Philemon and Onesimus.
