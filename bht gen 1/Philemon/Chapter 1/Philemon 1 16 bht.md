## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "οὐκέτι ὡς δοῦλον does not imply his manumission; rather the contrary: the stress is on ὡς and ὑπέρ ‘no longer as a slave (though he be one), but above a slave.’"
2. "μάλιστα, ‘of all other men,’ of all those without thy house, with whom he has been connected."
3. "πόσῳ μᾶλλον σοί, with whom he stands in so near and lasting a relation."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "No longer as a mere servant or slave (though still he is that), but above a servant, so that thou shalt derive from him not merely the services of a slave, but higher benefits."
2. "A servant 'in the flesh,' he is a brother 'in the Lord.'"
3. "Lest Philemon should dislike Onesimus being called 'brother,' Paul first recognizes him as a brother, being the spiritual son of the same God."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The word does not necessarily mean slave, nor can it be proved from this passage, or from any other part of the Epistle, that he was at any time a slave... The word denotes servant of any kind, and it should never be assumed that those to whom it was applied were slaves."
2. "Paul did not send him back in order that he might be a slave, or with a view that the shackles of servitude should be riveted on him... It cannot be shown that the motive for sending him back was in the slightest degree that he should be a slave."
3. "This passage, therefore, may be regarded as full proof that it is not right to send a slave back, against his will, to his former master, to be a slave... If, with his own consent, and by his own wish, we can send a slave back to his master, to be treated as a Christian and as a man, the example of Paul may show that it would be right to do it, but it does not go beyond that."

### Marvin Vincent:

### John Calvin:
1. "He next brings forward another advantage of the flight, that Onesimus has not only been corrected by means of it, so as to become a useful slave, but that he has become the 'brother' of his master." 
2. "Here we behold the uncommon modesty of Paul, who bestows on a worthless slave the title of a brother, and even calls him a dearly beloved brother to himself." 
3. "We must hold it to be an undoubted truth, that Paul does not rashly or lightly (as many people do) answer for a man of whom he knows little, or extol his faith before he has ascertained it by strong proofs, and therefore in the person of Onesimus there is exhibited a memorable example of repentance."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "He could no more be looked on as the mere slave, as before... having been called in the Lord, he has become, though a bond-servant, the Lord’s freeman. And this is to be free indeed."
2. "The Christian master was to render to his slaves under all circumstances that which was just and equal... but now that Onesimus had become a believer, he was lifted, in the eyes of the apostle, to a higher level."
3. "For St. Paul has already called him not ‘brother,’ but by the tenderer name of ‘child.’"
