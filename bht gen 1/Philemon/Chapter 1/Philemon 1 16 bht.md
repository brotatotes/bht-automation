# choicest prompt v1 X bht prompt v3; ['Henry Alford', 'Jamieson Fausset Brown', 'Albert Barnes', 'Marvin Vincent', 'John Calvin', 'Philip Schaff', 'Archibald T Robertson', 'Adam Clarke']

## Henry Alford:
1. "οὐκέτι ὡς δοῦλον does not imply his manumission; rather the contrary: the stress is on ὡς and ὑπέρ ‘no longer as a slave (though he be one), but above a slave.’"
2. "μάλιστα, ‘of all other men,’ of all those without thy house, with whom he has been connected."
3. "πόσῳ μᾶλλον σοί, with whom he stands in so near and lasting a relation."

## Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "No longer as a mere servant or slave (though still he is that), but above a servant, so that thou shalt derive from him not merely the services of a slave, but higher benefits."
2. "A servant 'in the flesh,' he is a brother 'in the Lord.'"
3. "Lest Philemon should dislike Onesimus being called 'brother,' Paul first recognizes him as a brother, being the spiritual son of the same God."

## Albert Barnes:
1. "The word does not necessarily mean slave, nor can it be proved from this passage, or from any other part of the Epistle, that he was at any time a slave... The word denotes servant of any kind, and it should never be assumed that those to whom it was applied were slaves."
2. "Paul did not send him back in order that he might be a slave, or with a view that the shackles of servitude should be riveted on him... It cannot be shown that the motive for sending him back was in the slightest degree that he should be a slave."
3. "This passage, therefore, may be regarded as full proof that it is not right to send a slave back, against his will, to his former master, to be a slave... If, with his own consent, and by his own wish, we can send a slave back to his master, to be treated as a Christian and as a man, the example of Paul may show that it would be right to do it, but it does not go beyond that."

## Marvin Vincent:
1. "No longer as a slave" - The negative adverb emphasizes the absolute fact that Onesimus is no longer in bondage, highlighting his newfound freedom. 

2. "More than a slave - a whole man" - This phrase emphasizes the transformation that has taken place in Onesimus, going beyond his previous status as a slave and recognizing his inherent worth and dignity as a human being. 

3. "Beloved most to Paul, how much more than most to Philemon" - This comparison highlights the deep affection and special bond that Paul shares with Onesimus, suggesting that Philemon should also view him with love and acceptance, considering their shared connection as Christian brothers.

## John Calvin:
1. "He next brings forward another advantage of the flight, that Onesimus has not only been corrected by means of it, so as to become a useful slave, but that he has become the 'brother' of his master." 
2. "Here we behold the uncommon modesty of Paul, who bestows on a worthless slave the title of a brother, and even calls him a dearly beloved brother to himself." 
3. "We must hold it to be an undoubted truth, that Paul does not rashly or lightly (as many people do) answer for a man of whom he knows little, or extol his faith before he has ascertained it by strong proofs, and therefore in the person of Onesimus there is exhibited a memorable example of repentance."

## Philip Schaff:
1. "He could no more be looked on as the mere slave, as before... having been called in the Lord, he has become, though a bond-servant, the Lord’s freeman. And this is to be free indeed."
2. "The Christian master was to render to his slaves under all circumstances that which was just and equal... but now that Onesimus had become a believer, he was lifted, in the eyes of the apostle, to a higher level."
3. "For St. Paul has already called him not ‘brother,’ but by the tenderer name of ‘child.’"

## Archibald T Robertson:
1. "No longer as a slave." - Paul expects Philemon to treat Onesimus as a brother in Christ, not as a slave.
2. "But beyond a slave." - Paul emphasizes that Onesimus is now more than just a servant, but a brother in Christ.
3. "In the flesh Philemon had the brother for a slave; in the Lord he had the slave for a brother." - Meyer highlights the transformation that has taken place in Onesimus and urges Philemon to recognize this change and treat him accordingly.

## Adam Clarke:
1. "Do not receive him merely as thy slave, nor treat him according to that condition; but as a brother - as a genuine Christian, and particularly dear to me."
2. "He was a part of his property and of his family; as a slave, this was his condition; but he now stood in a twofold relation to Philemon: 1. According to the flesh, as above explained, he was one of his family. 2. In the Lord; he was now also a member of the heavenly family, and of the Church at Philemon's house."
3. "Philemon's interest in him was now doubled, in consequence of his conversion to Christianity."


# BHT:
Onesimus, once a slave, has experienced a profound change. No longer shackled by the title of servant, he now stands as more than just a slave. Recognized as a brother in Christ, Onesimus's status has been elevated, urging Philemon to treat him not as a slave, but as a beloved and valued Christian companion. Through his transformation, Onesimus has become a part of Philemon's spiritual family, demonstrating the impact of his conversion on their relationship.
