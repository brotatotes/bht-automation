# choicest prompt v1 X bht prompt v3; ['Henry Alford', 'Jamieson Fausset Brown', 'Albert Barnes', 'Marvin Vincent', 'John Calvin', 'Philip Schaff', 'Archibald T Robertson', 'Adam Clarke']

## Henry Alford:
1. "The κοινωνία referred to is that shewn by the ἀγάπη of him, common to both, mentioned in the last verse: but extending far wider than it, even to the community of faith, and hope, and love between them as Christian men." 

2. "Not that of goods, as Bengel: ‘ut tua sint mea et mea tua.’" 

3. "The κοινωνία referred to is that shewn by the ἀγάπη of him, common to both, mentioned in the last verse: but extending far wider than it, even to the community of faith, and hope, and love between them as Christian men."

## Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "A partner in the Christian fellowship of faith, hope, and love."
2. "Receive him as myself."
3. "Resuming 'receive him that is mine own bowels.'"

## Albert Barnes:
1. "The word rendered 'partner' (κοινωνὸς koinōnos, means 'a partaker, a companion.' The idea in the word is that of having something in common."
2. "It may be applied to those who hold the same principles of religion, and who have the same hope of heaven, the same views of things, etc."
3. "His receiving Onesimus would be interpreted by Paul as proof that he regarded him as a partaker of the hopes of the gospel, and as a companion and friend."

## Marvin Vincent:
1. "Then [ουν] . Resumptive from ver. 12." 
2. "Thou count [εχεις] . Lit., hold, which is often used in this sense."
3. "Partner. More than an intimate friend. One in Christian fellowship."

## John Calvin:
1. "He reckoned it to be of vast importance that Onesimus should have a mild and gentle master, that immoderate severity might not drive him to despair."
2. "That is the object which Paul toils so earnestly to accomplish."
3. "And his example warns us how affectionately we ought to aid a sinner who has given us proof of his repentance."

## Philip Schaff:
1. "It has been usually accepted that the apostle uses 'partner' here in the same way in which he speaks of Titus as his partner and fellow-labourer in the mission to the Corinthians: a sharer in the same Christian privileges, and a helper in the same Christian work."
2. "There occur in this passage so many words which savour of mercantile language, that it seems not unlikely that St. Paul...had held some business relation towards Philemon, and that there were money dealings between them, a debtor and creditor account."
3. "The verb in classical Greek is not uncommonly used of the acceptance of any one as a colleague or partner, and so St. Paul would be asking that Onesimus should be put on the same footing as himself, having previously been taken by the apostle as a 'child' of his own."

## Archibald T Robertson:
1. "These words sound the death-knell of human slavery wherever the spirit of Christ is allowed to have its way."
2. "It has been a long and hard fight to break the shackles of human bondage even in Christian countries."
3. "Paul wrote these words with wisdom and courage and sincerity."

## Adam Clarke:
1. "If thou count me therefore a partner — If thou dost consider me as a friend; if I have still the place of a friend in thy affection, receive him as myself." 
2. "For, as I feel him as my own soul, in receiving him thou receivest me." 
3. "There is a fine model of recommending a friend to the attention of a great man in the epistle of Horace to Claudius Nero, in behalf of his friend Septimius, Epistolar. lib. i., Ep. 9, which contains several strokes not unlike some of those in the Epistle to Philemon."


# BHT:
In this Bible verse, the writer encourages Philemon to receive Onesimus, not just as a slave, but as a beloved brother in Christ, highlighting the deep bond of Christian fellowship between them. The commentator remarks on the significance of this fellowship, extending beyond mere material possessions, to encompass the shared faith, hope, and love of believers. This plea for acceptance resonates with the wider struggle against human slavery, indicating the transformative power of the Christian message. Paul, in making this request, demonstrates wisdom, courage, and sincerity, while also drawing from examples of friendship and endorsement found in other writings.
