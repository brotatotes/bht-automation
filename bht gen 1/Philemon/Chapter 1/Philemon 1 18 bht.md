# Philemon 18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, someone named Onesimus is confessing and taking responsibility for his wrongdoing. The commentators suggest that Onesimus may have committed theft, acted as an unjust steward, or wronged his master in various ways. However, Paul, displaying Christ-like love and forgiveness, offers to take the blame upon himself and pay any debts or damages. This verse highlights the themes of confession, accountability, and the willingness to bear the consequences of one's actions.
