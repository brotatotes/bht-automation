# choicest prompt v1 X bht prompt v3; ['Henry Alford', 'Jamieson Fausset Brown', 'Albert Barnes', 'Marvin Vincent', 'John Calvin', 'Philip Schaff', 'Archibald T Robertson', 'Adam Clarke']

## Henry Alford:
1. "The inference from this is, that the whole Epistle was autographic: for it would be most unnatural to suppose the Apostle to break off his amanuensis here, and write this engagement with his own hand."
2. "ἵνα μὴ λέγω: 'est σχῆμα παρασιωπήσεως sive reticentiæ, cum dicimus nos omittere velle, quod maxime dicimus,' Grot."
3. "καὶ σεαυτόν: οὐ τὰ σαυτοῦ μόνον, Chr. διʼ ἐμοῦ γάρ, φησί, τῆς σωτηρίας ἀπήλαυσας · καὶ ἐντεῦθεν δῆλον, ὡς τῆς ἀποστολικῆς διδασκαλίας ἠξιώθη ὁ Φιλήμων, Thdrt."

## Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Mine own hand - not employing an amanuensis, as in other Epistles: a special compliment to Philemon which he ought to show his appreciation of by granting Paul’s request."
2. "Thou owest ... even thine own self - not merely thy possessions. For to my instrumentality thou owest thy salvation."
3. "So the debt which 'he oweth thee' being transferred upon me (I making myself responsible for it) is cancelled."

## Albert Barnes:
1. "Paul wrote this entire Epistle with his own hand, though this was contrary to his usual practice."
2. "He undoubtedly meant to refer to this as a mark of special favor toward Philemon."
3. "Paul had doubtless been the means of the conversion of Philemon, and whatever hope he cherished of eternal life, was to be traced to his instrumentality."

## Marvin Vincent:
1. "The mention of his autograph here, rather than at the end of the letter, may indicate that he wrote the whole epistle with his own hand, contrary to his usual custom of employing an amanuensis."
2. "I thus give my note of hand that I may avoid saying that thou owest, etc."
3. "I have laid you under obligation, not only for an amount equal to that due from Onesimus, but for yourself as made a Christian through my ministry."

## John Calvin:
1. "There is nothing that thou couldest refuse to give me, even though I should demand thyself."
2. "Paul beseeches Philemon not to ask anything back from his slave."
3. "I wish that thou shouldest not contend with thy slave, unless thou choosest to have me for thy debtor in his stead."

## Philip Schaff:
1. "Up to this point, the apostle had probably used his amanuensis; but that the transaction may be formal and secure, he attaches his own signature to what has been written, and so transforms the Epistle into a bond."
2. "St. Paul would at once by his own payment set Onesimus free from such debt."
3. "He might have urged the larger debt which Philemon owed to him for his conversion to the faith of Christ, should be held to far outbalance the loss inflicted by Onesimus."

## Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Epistolary aorist. With mine hand. Instrumental case and a note of hand that can be collected." 
2. "I will repay it. Future active indicative of αποτινω (αποτιω) to pay back, to pay off. The more usual word was αποδωσω. This is Paul's promissory note."
3. "Thou owest to me even thine own self besides. Old verb, only here in N.T., Paul using the verb οφειλω of verse Philemon 1:18 with προς added. He used every available argument to bring Philemon to see the higher ground of brotherhood in Christ about Onesimus."

## Adam Clarke:
1. "It is likely that the whole of the letter was written by St. Paul himself, which was not his usual custom."
2. "But by thus speaking he bound Philemon to do what he requested, as an act of common civility, if he could not feel a higher motive from what he had already urged."
3. "I ask thee to do this thing to oblige me, though I will not say how much thou owest unto me; even thine own self, as having been the means of thy conversion."


# BHT:
In this epistle, the apostle Paul breaks from his usual practice of using an amanuensis and personally writes the entire letter. By attaching his own signature to the letter, Paul transforms it into a formal and binding document. He appeals to Philemon's sense of appreciation and obligation, emphasizing that he owes not solely material possessions but also his own self to Paul as the instrument of his conversion. Through various arguments, Paul seeks to persuade Philemon to demonstrate kindness towards Onesimus as an act of brotherhood in Christ, appealing to their shared faith and common civility.
