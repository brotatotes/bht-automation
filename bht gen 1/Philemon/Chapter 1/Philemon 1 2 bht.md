# choicest prompt v1 X bht prompt v3; ['Henry Alford', 'Jamieson Fausset Brown', 'Albert Barnes', 'Marvin Vincent', 'John Calvin', 'Philip Schaff', 'Archibald T Robertson', 'Adam Clarke']

## Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Apphia, either the wife or some close relative of Philemon, would not have been included in the address of a letter on a domestic matter if they had not belonged to his family."
2. "Archippus, a minister of the Colossian Church, is mentioned as a fellow soldier."
3. "In the absence of a regular church building, the houses of particular saints were used for that purpose, and Paul tactfully associates with Philemon those associated by kindred or Christian brotherhood with his house."

## Albert Barnes:
1. "And to our beloved Apphia - This was a female (Greek ἀγαπητῇ agapētē), and was probably the wife of Philemon." 
2. "On the term 'fellow-soldier,' see the notes at Philippians 2:25. It is applied here to one who was a minister of the gospel, and who is spoken of in connection with Paul as enlisted under the banners of the Captain of salvation, and waging a warfare with the wickedness of the world."
3. "That Archippus was a minister of the gospel, is clear from Colossians 4:17."

## Marvin Vincent:
1. "The word is not the common Roman name Appia, but is a Phrygian name, occurring frequently in Phrygian inscriptions."
2. "Archippus...would appear to have held some important office in the church, either at Colossae or at Laodicaea."
3. "Fellow-soldier...in Christian warfare. Perhaps at Ephesus."

## John Calvin:
1. "Although the condition of a soldier belongs to all Christians universally, yet because teachers may be regarded as standardbearers in the warfare, they ought to be ready more than all others to fight, and Satan usually gives them greater annoyance."
2. "By employing these terms, he bestows the highest praise on the family of Philemon. And certainly it is no small praise of a householder, that he regulates his family in such a manner as to be an image of the Church, and to discharge also the duty of a pastor within the walls of his dwelling."
3. "Nor must we forget to mention that this good man had a wife of the same character; for she, too, not without reason, is commended by Paul."

## Philip Schaff:
1. "It is clear from the way in which Archippus is addressed...that he occupied some ministerial office in the Colossian church." 
2. "St. Paul is extremely fond of the figure of a battle in describing the labours of himself and his fellow-preachers of the Gospel." 
3. "The first congregations were formed so speedily after the preaching of the apostles at Pentecost...the richer members of the congregations provided rooms in their own homes for the religious meetings of their brethren."

## Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Sister" is in the Christian sense. 
2. It is uncertain whether he is the son of Philemon or not. 
3. Before the third century there is no certain evidence of special church buildings for worship.

## Adam Clarke:
1. "Appha is the affectionate address of a brother or sister; or the diminutive of a brother and sister, used to express kindness and affection." 
2. "Archippus our FELLOW SOLDIER." 
3. "The import of this name led the apostle to play upon the word thus: I beseech thee for any son Onesimus - which in time past was to thee UNPROFITABLE, but now PROFITABLE to thee and me."


# BHT:
In this Bible verse, we find a letter addressed to Philemon and his close family. Among them is Apphia, who is believed to be Philemon's wife or a close relative. Archippus, a minister in the Colossian Church, is also mentioned, highlighting his role as a fellow soldier in the Christian battle. The early Christian meetings were held in the homes of believers, with wealthier members providing spaces for worship. The verse points to the significance of family, Christian fellowship, and the impact of a transformed life.
