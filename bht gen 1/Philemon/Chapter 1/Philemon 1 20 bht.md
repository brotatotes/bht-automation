# choicest prompt v1 X bht prompt v3; ['Henry Alford', 'Jamieson Fausset Brown', 'Albert Barnes', 'Marvin Vincent', 'John Calvin', 'Philip Schaff', 'Archibald T Robertson', 'Adam Clarke']

## Henry Alford:
1. "The sentiment itself is a reference to σεαυτόν μοι προσοφείλεις: this being so, let me have profit of thee."
2. "ἐν κυρίῳ, not in worldly gain, but in the Lord in thine increase and richness in the graces of His Spirit."
3. "refresh (viz. by acceding to my request) my heart (as above the seat of the affections. τὰ σπλάγχνα μου must not for a moment be imagined, with Jer., Est., Schrader, al., to designate Onesimus, who was so called in Philemon 1:12; which would be most unnatural) in Christ (as ἐν κυρίῳ above)."

## Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Let me have profit (so Greek 'for joy,' onainen, referring to the name Onesimus, 'profitable') from thee, as thou shouldst have had from Onesimus"; for "thou owest thine ownself to me."
2. "Not in worldly gain, but in thine increase in the graces of the Lord's Spirit."
3. "Gratify my feelings by granting this request."

## Albert Barnes:
1. "The phrase 'in the Lord,' here seems to mean that, if this request was granted, he would recognize the hand of the Lord in it, and would receive it as a favor from him."
2. "The 'bowels,' in the Scriptures, are uniformly spoken of as the seat of the affections - meaning commonly the upper viscera, embracing the heart and the lungs."
3. "The idea here is, that Paul had such a tender affection for Onesimus as to give him great concern and uneasiness."

## Marvin Vincent:
1. "A confirmatory particle, gathering up the whole previous intercession for Onesimus."
2. "Let me have joy. Or help. Lit., may I profit. Again a play upon the name Onesimus."
3. "The verb is frequently used with reference to filial duties."

Note: The commentary is quite short, so there are only three quotes that meet the requirements.

## John Calvin:
1. "Now shall it be clearly proved that there hath been no variance between thee and me, but that, on the contrary, thou art sincerely attached to me, and that all that thou hadst is at my disposal, if thou pardon offenses and receive into favor him who is so closely related to me."
2. "The faith of the gospel does not overturn civil government, or set aside the power and authority which masters have over slaves."
3. "When Paul pleads so humbly in behalf of another, we are reminded how far distant they are from true repentance who obstinately excuse their vices, or who, without shame and without tokens of humility, acknowledge indeed that they have sinned, but in such a manner as if they had never sinned."

## Philip Schaff:
1. "Onesimus is now about really to deserve to be called 'profitable.' He owes much, and by his loving service he will make payment."
2. "Thou also art greatly my debtor, be thou to me an Onesimus, and let me have profit from thy love."
3. "Christian love to him will be counted as of equal value with those kind services which his riches enabled Philemon to perform towards his fellow-Christians."

## Archibald T Robertson:
1. "May I get profit from thee in the Lord."
2. "Refresh my heart in Christ."
3. "αναπαυσον μου τα σπλαγχνα εν Χριστω" (Refresh my heart in Christ).

## Adam Clarke:
1. "Let me have joy of thee, in forgiving Onesimus, and receiving him into thy favour." 
2. "In the words εγε σου οναιμην, which we should translate, let me have PROFIT of thee, there is an evident paronomasia, or play on the name of Onesimus." 
3. "Refresh my bowels — Gratify the earnest longing of my soul in this. I ask neither thy money nor goods; I ask what will enrich, not impoverish, thee to give."
