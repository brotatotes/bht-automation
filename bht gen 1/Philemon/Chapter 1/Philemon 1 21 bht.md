# choicest prompt v1 X bht prompt v3; ['Henry Alford', 'Jamieson Fausset Brown', 'Albert Barnes', 'Marvin Vincent', 'John Calvin', 'Philip Schaff', 'Archibald T Robertson', 'Adam Clarke']

## Henry Alford:
1. "Serves to put Philemon in mind of the apostolic authority with which he writes."
2. "Hints delicately at the manumission of Onesimus, which he has not yet requested."
3. "Also, besides doing what I say."

## Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Having confidence in thy obedience" - The commentary emphasizes the trust and confidence the author has in the reader's willingness to obey their request. This highlights the importance of obedience in the context of the verse.

2. "Preferring to beseech thee for it as a favor" - The commentary highlights the author's choice to appeal to the reader's sense of kindness and favor rather than imposing their authority. This suggests a gentle and respectful approach in addressing the request.

3. "Thou will also do more" - The commentary suggests that by granting the request, the reader will not only fulfill their obligation but also go above and beyond in their actions. This implies that there is an opportunity for the reader to show generosity and kindness towards Onesimus.

## Albert Barnes:
1. "Having confidence in thy obedience - That you would comply with all my expressed desires."
2. "Knowing that thou wilt also do more than I say - In all the respects which he had mentioned - in receiving Onesimus, and in his kind treatment of him."
3. "He had asked a great favor of him, but he knew that he would go even beyond what he had asked."

## Marvin Vincent:
1. "More than I say [υπερ]": This phrase suggests that there is a deeper meaning or significance beyond what is explicitly stated in the verse. It implies that there may be hidden truths or layers of understanding that can be uncovered through further exploration.

2. "Beyond": This word indicates that there is something beyond the surface level of the verse. It implies that there is a greater depth or breadth of meaning that can be discovered by delving deeper into the context, historical background, and literary devices used in the verse.

3. "Possibly hinting at manumission": This phrase suggests that the verse may allude to the concept of manumission, which is the act of freeing a slave. It implies that there may be a symbolic or metaphorical message related to liberation or freedom that can be inferred from the verse.

## Philip Schaff:
1. "In the use of the word obedience, he once more implies that he had the right to command, though he does not use it." 
2. "Had he commanded, Philemon would have obeyed; what will he not do, when the apostle’s language takes the form of a request?" 
3. "Such is the service of love, specially of Christian love, which after the example of Christ gives itself freely to serve the beloved."

## Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Compliance" seems less harsh to us in the light of Philemon 1:9.
2. Epistolary aorist again.
3. Paul has been criticized for not denouncing slavery in plain terms. But, when one considers the actual conditions in the Roman empire, he is a wise man who can suggest a better plan than the one pursued here for the ultimate overthrow of slavery.

## Adam Clarke:
1. "Having confidence in thy obedience — I know that it will please thee thus to oblige thy friend." 
2. "I know that thou wilt do more than I request, because thou feelest the affection of a son to thy spiritual father." 
3. "Some think that the apostle hints to Philemon that he should manumit Onesimus."
