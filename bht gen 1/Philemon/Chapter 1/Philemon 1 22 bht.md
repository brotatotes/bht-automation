# choicest prompt v1 X bht prompt v3; ['Henry Alford', 'Jamieson Fausset Brown', 'Albert Barnes', 'Marvin Vincent', 'John Calvin', 'Philip Schaff', 'Archibald T Robertson', 'Adam Clarke']

## Henry Alford:
1. "But at the same time (as thou fulfillest my request), also." 
2. "We may, perhaps, take this direction as serving to secure the favourable reception of Onesimus."
3. "Philemon was not to consider the Epistle as a mere petition for Onesimus, but as containing special messages on other matters to himself."

## Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "This prospect of Paul’s visiting Colosse would tend to secure a kindly reception for Onesimus, as Paul would know in person how he had been treated."
2. "The same expectation is expressed by him, written in the same imprisonment."
3. "The same expectation is expressed by him."

## Albert Barnes:
1. "While you are granting this favor, do me also another by preparing a lodging for me."
2. "Philemon had been accustomed to show kindness to the saints."
3. "Paul had some hope of being released - an event which probably occurred."

## Marvin Vincent:
1. "Simultaneously with the fulfillment of my request."
2. "There is a gentle compulsion in this mention of a personal visit to Colossae."
3. "A beautiful assumption of his correspondent's affection for him, in that his visit to them will be a gracious gift."

## John Calvin:
1. "This confidence must have powerfully excited and moved Philemon."
2. "He had no confident hope of his release, further than if it pleased God."
3. "Everything that believers obtain 'through their prayers,' is 'given' to them; for hence we infer that our prayers, though they are not unsuccessful, yet have no power through their own merit."

## Philip Schaff:
1. "It must have appeared to the apostle that his release was near at hand when he wrote these words."
2. "Prayer was from the first the Church's resource when Christ's messengers were cast into prison."
3. "So he ascribes his expected release already to the grace of God."

## Archibald T Robertson:
1. "But withal (αμα δε). Along with your kindly reception of Onesimus." 
2. "A lodging (ξενιαν). Old word from ξενος, stranger." 
3. "I shall be granted unto you (χαρισθησομα υμιν). First future passive of χαριζομα. Used either as a favour as here and Acts 3:14 or for destruction (Acts 25:11)."

## Adam Clarke:
1. "But withal prepare me also a lodging — Does not the apostle mention this as conferring an obligation on Philemon?" 
2. "I will begin to repay thee by taking up my abode at thy house, as soon as I shall be enlarged from prison." 
3. "For I trust that through your prayers — It is very likely that this epistle was written a short time before the liberation of the apostle from his first imprisonment at Rome."


# BHT:
This verse, filled with requests and anticipations, expresses Paul's hope for a warm reception for Onesimus and his longing for a place to stay, evoking a sense of gratitude and obligation. The mention of prayers and future release suggests that Paul wrote this letter with the belief that God's grace would play a significant role in their circumstances. Paul's request for a lodging not only serves as a practical need but also deepens the bond between him and Philemon.
