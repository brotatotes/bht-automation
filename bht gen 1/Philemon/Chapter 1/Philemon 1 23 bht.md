# choicest prompt v1 X bht prompt v3; ['Henry Alford', 'Jamieson Fausset Brown', 'Albert Barnes', 'Marvin Vincent', 'John Calvin', 'Philip Schaff', 'Archibald T Robertson', 'Adam Clarke']

## Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Epaphras, my fellow prisoner - He had been sent by the Colossian Church to inquire after, and minister to, Paul, and possibly was cast into prison by the Roman authorities on suspicion."
2. "However, he is not mentioned as a prisoner in Colossians 4:12, so that 'fellow prisoner' here may mean merely one who was a faithful companion to Paul in his imprisonment, and by his society put himself in the position of a prisoner."
3. "Benson conjectures the meaning to be that on some former occasion these two were Paulâ€™s 'fellow prisoners,' not at the time."

## Albert Barnes:
1. "The same persons who are here mentioned as greeting Philemon, are mentioned in the close of the Epistle to the Colossians - furnishing a high degree of evidence that Philemon resided at Colosse."
2. "Epaphras was a member of the church there."
3. "My fellow-prisoner in Christ Jesus - In the cause of Christ."

## Marvin Vincent:
1. "Epaphras is mentioned Colossians 1:7; Colossians 4:12. Some identify him with Epaphroditus, but without sufficient reason."
2. "The names, however, are the same, Epaphras being a contraction."
3. "It is disputed whether fellow-prisoner is to be taken in a literal or in a spiritual sense."

Note: The commentary provided is quite lengthy, so I have selected three quotes that provide relevant information about Epaphras and the interpretation of his role as a fellow prisoner.

## Philip Schaff:
1. "Epaphras, my fellow-prisoner in Christ Jesus, saluteth thee." - The term "fellow-prisoner" suggests that Epaphras voluntarily shared in the imprisonment of the apostle, highlighting the depth of their friendship and commitment to the cause of Christ.

2. "It does not necessarily imply 'bound' as St. Paul was. Therefore it seems probable that the word is used of these friends because they voluntarily shared the imprisonment of the apostle, and so in fact were captives as much as he." - The use of the term "fellow-prisoner" indicates that Epaphras and others willingly chose to be with Paul in his imprisonment, demonstrating their solidarity and devotion to him and the Gospel.

3. "It is not unlike St. Paul thus to magnify the service rendered to him." - Paul's mention of Epaphras as a fellow-prisoner highlights his appreciation for the support and assistance he received, emphasizing the importance of unity and collaboration in the work of spreading the message of Christ.

## Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Epaphras, the Colossian preacher, sought Paul's help in fighting against incipient Gnosticism in the Lycus Valley."
2. "Epaphras is referred to as Paul's fellow-prisoner, indicating a close bond and shared suffering."
3. "The metaphorical use of 'fellow-prisoner' suggests that Epaphras may have faced imprisonment alongside Paul in Rome."

## Adam Clarke:
1. "Epaphras, my fellow prisoner" - This phrase suggests that Epaphras had experienced imprisonment for the sake of the Gospel, highlighting his commitment to the truth and his solidarity with Paul in their shared suffering.

2. "Epaphras was a Colossian" - This statement reveals Epaphras' connection to the church in Colossae, emphasizing his role as a representative of the Colossian believers and his dedication to their spiritual well-being.

3. "The not mentioning of [imprisonment] does not necessarily imply that he was not [in prison]" - This comment reminds us that the absence of explicit mention of Epaphras' imprisonment in Colossians does not negate the possibility of his past confinement, leaving room for speculation and further exploration of his experiences.


# BHT:
In this verse, there is mention of Epaphras, described as a fellow prisoner, indicating a close bond and shared suffering with Paul. Epaphras was a Colossian, representing the believers in Colossae, displaying his commitment to their spiritual welfare. Although his exact imprisonment is not explicitly mentioned, the phrase "fellow prisoner" suggests that Epaphras may have willingly faced imprisonment alongside Paul in Rome, demonstrating his dedication to the Gospel.
