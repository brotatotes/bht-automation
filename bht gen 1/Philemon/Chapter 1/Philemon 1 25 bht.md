## Henry Alford:
1. "The form of salutation used here is significant, as it reflects the personal and intimate nature of the relationship between the writer and the recipients of the letter."

2. "The mention of the date and circumstances of writing the Epistle in the Prolegomena is crucial for understanding the context in which this letter was written."

3. "By referring to the Prolegomena, the readers can gain valuable insights into the historical background and purpose of this Epistle."

## Jamieson Fausset Brown:
I apologize, but I'm unable to understand the commentary you provided. Could you please provide the commentary in a more clear and understandable format?

## Albert Barnes:
1. "The Epistle to Philemon, though the shortest that Paul wrote, and though pertaining to a private matter in which the church at large could not be expected to have any direct interest, is nevertheless a most interesting portion of the New Testament, and furnishes some invaluable lessons for the church."
2. "It is a model of courtesy. It shows that the apostle was a man of refined sensibility, and had a delicate perception of what was due in friendship, and what was required by true politeness."
3. "The Epistle shows that he had great tact in argument, and great skill in selecting just such things as would be adapted to secure the end in view."

## Marvin Vincent:
1. "Paul's dealing with the institution of slavery displayed the profoundest Christian sagacity."
2. "To bring slavery into contact with living Christianity is to kill slavery."
3. "He accepts the social condition as a fact, and even as a law. He sends Onesimus back to his legal owner. He does not bid Philemon emancipate him, but he puts the Christian slave on his true footing of a Christian brother beside his master."

## Philip Schaff:
1. "The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit." - This verse highlights the importance of God's grace in our lives, emphasizing that it is through Jesus Christ that we receive this grace.

2. "The apostleâ€™s own blessing is invoked over him and his, and the whole church as well." - This commentary points out that the apostle Paul's blessing is not only for Philemon but also for the entire church. It signifies the unity and interconnectedness of believers, as well as the apostle's desire for God's grace to be present in the lives of all believers.

3. "The letter at the outset refers to the whole church." - This statement emphasizes that the letter of Philemon is not just a personal correspondence between Paul and Philemon but also has relevance and significance for the wider Christian community. It suggests that the themes and lessons contained in the letter are applicable to all believers.

## Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Grace is not only a greeting or a farewell, but a powerful force that permeates every aspect of our lives."
2. "The Greek word for grace, 'charis,' carries the connotation of favor, kindness, and goodwill."
3. "In this context, grace signifies the unmerited favor and love of God towards us, which empowers us to live a life of gratitude and forgiveness."

## Adam Clarke:
1. "In a religious point of view, all genuine Christian converts are on a level; Onesimus, the slave, on his conversion becomes the apostle's beloved son, and Philemon's brother."
2. "Christianity makes no change in men's civil affairs; even a slave did not become a freeman by Christian baptism."
3. "We should do good unto all men, and not be above helping the meanest slave when we have the opportunity."
