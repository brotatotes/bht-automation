## Albert Barnes:
1. "Grace to you" - This phrase is a common greeting in the New Testament, but it carries a deeper meaning. It signifies the unmerited favor and kindness of God towards believers. It reminds us that our salvation is not based on our own efforts or achievements, but on God's grace alone.

2. "Peace" - The word "peace" here refers to the inner tranquility and harmony that comes from being reconciled to God through Jesus Christ. It is not merely the absence of conflict, but a state of well-being and wholeness that can only be found in a relationship with God.

3. "Grace and peace" - The combination of these two words is significant. Grace comes first because it is through God's grace that we are able to experience true peace. Without God's grace, there can be no peace. This greeting serves as a reminder of the foundational truths of the Christian faith and sets the tone for the rest of the letter.

## Philip Schaff:
1. "The gift of grace is sometimes represented as of Christ’s bestowing ‘the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ;’ and at other times, as here, the gift of the Father and the Son. But the same is meant in both phrases."
2. "Christ, who has been declared by His resurrection to be the Son of God with power, is the channel through which the Church receives the peculiarly Christian gift of grace, the source of which is with the Father."
3. "To those who felt the force of Christ’s words (John 17:22), ‘That they may be one, even as we are one,’ there could be no thought of a double source of blessing."
