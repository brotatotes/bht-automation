# choicest prompt v1 X bht prompt v3; ['Henry Alford', 'Jamieson Fausset Brown', 'Albert Barnes', 'Marvin Vincent', 'John Calvin', 'Philip Schaff', 'Archibald T Robertson', 'Adam Clarke']

## Henry Alford:
1. "It is far better to take ἀγάπη and πίστις as to be distributed between εἰς τὸν κύριον Ἰησοῦν and εἰς πάντας τοὺς ἁγίους." 
2. "The πρός of the rec. has perhaps been a correction for reverence sake." 
3. "εἰς is 'towards,' but more as contributing to 'towards the behoof of:' whereas πρός is simple direction."

## Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Hearing" as to churches and persons whom he had not seen or then visited. (This shows the authenticity of Paul's thanksgiving.)
2. The theological order is first faith then love, the fruit of faith. (Paul emphasizes the importance of love in Philemon's actions.)
3. "Toward" implies simply direction; "unto" implies to the advantage of. (Paul highlights the different implications of these words in relation to Philemon's actions.)

## Albert Barnes:
1. "The faith which is mentioned here refers to the Lord Jesus; the love, to the saints."
2. "The meaning is, that he had strong faith in the Lord Jesus, and ardent love toward all who were Christians."
3. "See a similar declaration in Colossians 1:4."

## John Calvin:
1. "This praise, which he bestows on Philemon, includes briefly the whole perfection of a Christian man. It consists of two parts, faith in Christ, and love towards our neighbors; for to these all the actions and all the duties of our life relate."
2. "Faith is said to be in Christ, because to him it especially looks; in like manner as in no other way than through him alone can God the Father be known, and in no other than in Him can we find any of the blessings which faith seeks."
3. "The arrangement of the passage is somewhat confused; but there is no obscurity in the meaning, except that it is doubtful whether the adverb always (in the 4th verse) is connected with the first clause, 'I give thanks always to my God,' or with the second clause, 'making mention of thee always in my prayers.' The meaning may be brought out in this manner, that, whenever the Apostle offered prayer for Philemon, he interwove thanksgiving with it; that is, because Philemon’s piety afforded ground of rejoicing."

## Philip Schaff:
1. "The love was the outward manifest token of the faith within the heart."
2. "The love was displayed towards the Christian congregation, the faith toward the Lord Jesus Christ."
3. "And so he feels that the son whom St. Paul has begotten in his bonds, and who now has a right to the Christian title, ‘a brother beloved,’ will be made a partaker of this love, and be forgiven what he has offended."

## Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Through Epaphras, possibly from Onesimus also." This suggests that the message of love and faith towards the Lord Jesus was spread by multiple individuals, highlighting the importance and impact of their testimony.

2. "He spoke of 'thy love and faith' towards the Lord Jesus." This emphasizes the intimate connection between love and faith, indicating that they go hand in hand in one's relationship with the Lord.

3. "He carries both words over to the saints." This implies that the love and faith towards the Lord Jesus should extend to all believers, emphasizing the importance of unity and fellowship among the saints.

## Adam Clarke:
1. "Hearing of thy love and faith - His faith in Christ Jesus, his love to the saints." 
2. "Several excellent MSS. and some versions put faith before love, which makes a more natural reading." 
3. "There is no figure of speech which would vindicate our saying faith in the saints; so that, if we do not allow of the arrangement in the MSS. referred to, we shall be obliged to have recourse to the transposition, because faith must refer to Jesus Christ, and love to the saints."
