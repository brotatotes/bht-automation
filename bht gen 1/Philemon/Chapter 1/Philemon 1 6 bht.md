# choicest prompt v1 X bht prompt v3; ['Henry Alford', 'Jamieson Fausset Brown', 'Albert Barnes', 'Marvin Vincent', 'John Calvin', 'Philip Schaff', 'Archibald T Robertson', 'Adam Clarke']

## Henry Alford:
1. "The mixing of prayer and thanksgiving in that clause does not exclude the idea of intercessory prayer."
2. "To join ὅπως κ . τ . λ . with ἣν ἔχεις is flat in the extreme, and perfectly inconceivable as a piece of St. Paul’s writing."
3. "To understand ἡ κοιν . τῆς π . σου, ‘fides tua quam communem nobiscum habes,’ as Bengel (and indeed Chrys., Thl., al.), is very objectionable."

## Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "The aim of my thanksgiving and prayers for thee is, in order that the communication of thy faith - the imparting of it and its fruits - to others." 
2. "The element in which his liberality had place, that is, may be proved by acts in acknowledging - the thorough knowledge, that is, the experimental or practical recognition - of every good thing which is in you." 
3. "In short, that thy faith may by acts be proved to be 'a faith which worketh by love'."

## Albert Barnes:
1. "The phrase translated 'communication of thy faith,' means the making of thy faith common to others; that is, enabling others to partake of the fruits of it, to wit, by good deeds."
2. "The meaning is, that he desired that Philemon would so make common the proper fruits of faith by his good deeds toward others, that all might acknowledge it to be genuine and efficacious."
3. "The truth which is taught in this passage, therefore, is, that when faith exists in the heart, it is very desirable that it should impart its proper fruits toward others in such a way that all may see that it is operative, and may recognize its power."

## Marvin Vincent:
1. "Koinwnia fellowship is often used in the active sense of impartation, as communication, contribution, almsgiving."
2. "The active sympathy and charity growing out of your faith."
3. "His liberality and love will result in perfect knowledge of God's good gifts."

## John Calvin:
1. "That his faith, exercising itself by good works, might be proved to be true, and not unprofitable."
2. "He calls it 'the communication of faith,' because it does not remain inactive and concealed within, but is manifested to men by actual effects."
3. "He wishes that, by its effects, faith may be proved to be effectual. This takes place, when the men with whom we converse know our godly and holy life."

## Philip Schaff:
1. "That thy faith being communicated to others may... that they might become faithful and give evidence thereof, even as he was doing." 
2. "Good works, the fruits of faith, build up the Christian character to greater perfection." 
3. "To deal in a Christian manner with Onesimus is one of the good things for a full knowledge of which St. Paul intercedes with God on behalf of Philemon."

## Archibald T Robertson:
1. "The fellowship of thy faith (η κοινωνια της πιστεως σου). Partnership like Philippians 1:5 in (objective genitive, πιστεως)." 

2. "Effectual (ενεργης). Common adjective, like ενεργος (at work), in N.T. only here, 1 Corinthians 16:9; Hebrews 4:12."

3. "Papyri use ενεργος of a mill in working order, of ploughed land, etc."

## Adam Clarke:
1. "The fellowship or communication of thy faith may be understood as referring to the work of love towards the saints - the poor Christians, which his faith in Christ enabled him to perform." 

2. "The word κοινωνια itself is not unfrequently used to denote liberality, almsgiving." 

3. "That the many good offices which thou dost to the saints may become effectual in bringing others to the acknowledgment of every good disposition which is in you towards Christ Jesus, or towards his members."
