## Henry Alford:
1. "It was not on account of Phm 1:7 that St. Paul had confidence to command him, but that he preferred beseeching him."
2. "ἐν χριστῷ as usual, the element in which the παῤῥησία found place."
3. "τὸ ἀνῆκον, a delicate hint, that the reception of Onesimus was to be classed under this category - that which is fitting."

## Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Because of my love to thee, I prefer to 'beseech,' rather than 'enjoin,' or authoritatively command."
2. "I might...enjoin - in virtue of the obligation to obedience which Philemon lay under to Paul, as having been converted through his instrumentality."
3. "In Christ - the element in which his boldness has place."

## Albert Barnes:
1. "He means that he was invested with authority by the Lord Jesus, and would have a right, as an apostle, to enjoin what ought to be done in the case which he is about to lay before him."
2. "The word 'convenient' here (τὸ ἀνῆκω to anēkō), means that which would be fit or proper in the case."
3. "The apostle implies here that what he was about to ask, was proper to be done in the circumstances, but he does not put it on that ground, but rather asks it as a personal layout."

3. "The kindly reception of Onesimus will be a becoming thing." - This quote suggests that the act of welcoming and accepting Onesimus is not only appropriate but also morally right, implying that it aligns with the principles and values of the Christian faith.

## John Calvin:

## Philip Schaff:
1. "God will show to him what his duty in this matter is, and so the apostle does not command."
2. "He does not ignore the right which he had to speak with authority, he only waives it for the time, that what Philemon does may be done of his free will."
3. "He uses no weak word to indicate what he might have done. It is that which is employed of our Lord’s commands to the winds and waves and to the unclean spirits, and bespeaks an order which may not be disputed."

## Archibald T Robertson:

1. "The tenderness and delicacy of this epistle, says Dr. Paley, have long been admired."
2. "There is something certainly very melting and persuasive in this and every part of the epistle."

# BHT:
The verse, with its tenderness and persuasion, emphasizes the delicacy and respect with which the author, Paul, approaches Philemon. Rather than imposing his authority, Paul chooses to beseech Philemon, highlighting the voluntary and willing nature of the requested action. The verse calls for a fitting and appropriate response, one that aligns with the principles of Christianity, indicating that Paul's appeal is not based on command but rather on a personal layout of love and respect.
