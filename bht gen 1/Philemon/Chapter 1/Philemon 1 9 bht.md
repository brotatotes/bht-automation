# choicest prompt v1 X bht prompt v3; ['Henry Alford', 'Jamieson Fausset Brown', 'Albert Barnes', 'Marvin Vincent', 'John Calvin', 'Philip Schaff', 'Archibald T Robertson', 'Adam Clarke']

## Henry Alford:
1. "τὴν ἀγάπην is quite general 'that Christian love, of which thou shewest so bright an example'".
2. "Being such an one (as declared in διὸ .… παρακαλῶ), as (1) Paul the aged and (2) now a prisoner also of Christ Jesus".
3. "The repetition of ἐμοῦ ἐγώ will serve, as Meyer remarks, to mark more forcibly the character of his own child, and ἐν τοῖς δεσμοίς gives more weight still to the entreaty".

## Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "For love's sake" - This phrase emphasizes the motivation behind the request, highlighting the importance of love in relationships and actions.
2. "Being such an one" - This phrase implies that the person making the request has a certain reputation or character that should be taken into account when considering the request.
3. "And now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ" - This statement highlights the personal sacrifice and hardship endured by the person making the request, appealing to the reader's sense of compassion and empathy.

## Albert Barnes:
1. "For the love which you bear me, and for the common cause."
2. "The argument here is, that we feel that it is proper, as far as we can, to grant the request of an old man."
3. "For such a prisoner we should be ready to do all that we can to mitigate the sorrows of his confinement, and to make his condition comfortable."

## Marvin Vincent:
1. "Being such an one, connect with the previous I rather beseech, and with Paul the aged."
2. "The beseech in ver. 10 is resumptive."
3. "Paul was about sixty years old, besides being prematurely aged from labor and hardship."

## John Calvin:
1. "By his example he shows that pastors should endeavor to draw disciples gently rather than to drag them by force; and indeed, when, by condescending to entreaty, he foregoes his right, this has far greater power to obtain his wish than if he issued a command."
2. "Besides, he claims nothing for himself, but in Christ, that is, on account of the office which he has received from him; for he does not mean that they whom Christ has appointed to be apostles are destitute of authority."
3. "Hence (as I said a little before) pastors are reminded that the hearts of their people must be soothed with all possible gentleness, wherever this method is likely to be more advantageous, but yet so as to know that they who are treated so gently have nothing less exacted from them than what they ought to do."

## Philip Schaff:
1. "For the love I bear you I lay aside all authority, and beg you to be moved by that love alone."
2. "The character of the Gospel spirit, in meekness to forego a right rather than to insist on it."
3. "As Christ’s ambassador St. Paul could plead with much more force than by any allusion to his own age."

## Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Paul is called νεανιας (a young man) at the stoning of Stephen (Acts 7:58). He was perhaps a bit under sixty now." 
2. "The papyri use πρεσβυτης for old man as in Luke 1:18 of Zacharias and in Titus 2:2." 
3. "Undoubtedly ambassador (πρεσβευτης) is possible here as in Ephesians 6:20 (πρεσβευω) though there is no real reason why Paul should not term himself properly 'Paul the aged.'"

## Adam Clarke:
1. "Paul the aged...may not improperly be considered an aged or elderly man, though it is generally allowed that his martyrdom took place in the 66th year of our Lord."
2. "The word πρεσβυς signifies, not only an old man, but also an ambassador; because old or elderly men were chosen to fulfill such an office, because of their experience and solidity."
3. "Some have thought that we should translate here, Paul the ambassador. This would agree very well with the scope and even the design of the place."
