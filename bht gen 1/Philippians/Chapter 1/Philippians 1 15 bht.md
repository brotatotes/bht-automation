## BHT:
In this verse, some individuals preach Christ with impure motives of envy and strife, aiming to undermine the influence of Paul. Interestingly, even those who desired to harm Paul inadvertently contributed to the spread of the Gospel. Paul's arrival in Rome drew attention and stirred up jealousy among other Christians.
