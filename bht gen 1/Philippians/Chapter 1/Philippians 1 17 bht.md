# Philippians 1:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, there are two groups of people preaching about Christ. The first group is driven by selfish ambitions, proclaiming Christ insincerely and hoping to cause trouble for the writer. However, their efforts ultimately do not succeed. The second group, in contrast, preaches Christ out of genuine love - love for Christ, love for the Gospel, and love for the souls of others. They recognize the importance of spreading the message of salvation and support the writer even in his difficult circumstances, knowing that he is dedicated to his work.
