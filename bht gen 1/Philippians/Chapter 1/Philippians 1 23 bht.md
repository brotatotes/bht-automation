### Henry Alford:
1. "I am perplexed by the two, having my desire towards departing and being with Christ." 
2. "For it is by far better." 
3. "To continue in my flesh is more needful on account of you."

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "I know not, BUT am in a strait betwixt the two, having the desire for departing and being with Christ; FOR it is by far better" - This quote highlights the apostle's dilemma between wanting to continue living and desiring to be with Christ, emphasizing the belief in the afterlife and the preference for being in the presence of Christ.

2. "This refutes the notion of the soul being dormant during its separation from the body" - This quote challenges the idea that the soul is inactive or unconscious after death, suggesting that the apostle believed in the continued existence and consciousness of the soul after departing from the body.

3. "The partial life eternal is in the interval between death and Christ's second advent; the perfectional, at that advent" - This quote suggests that there is a distinction between the temporary state of existence after death and the ultimate fulfillment of eternal life that will occur at the second coming of Christ. It implies that being with Christ after death is a partial experience of eternal life, with the fullness of it being realized at Christ's return.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The apostle represents himself as in a similar condition. His strong affection for them bound his heart to them - as an anchor holds a ship to its moorings and yet there was a heavenly influence bearing upon him - like the gale upon the vessel - which would bear him away to heaven."
2. "It was from a purer, higher motive than any of these - the strength of attachment which bound him to the Saviour, and which made him long to be with him."
3. "Other people may be willing to die; perhaps be desirous to die, because their sorrows are so great that they feel that they cannot be borne. But the Christian desires to depart from a different motive altogether. It is to be with Christ - and this constitutes a broad line of distinction between him and other people."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The picture is that of a man pressed on both sides. Lit. I am held together, so that I cannot incline either way." 
2. "The pressure comes from both sides. Note the article, the two, the two considerations just mentioned, departing or abiding in the flesh."
3. "Paul's metaphor here is the military one, to break camp. Compare 2 Corinthians 5:1, where the metaphor is the striking of a tent."

### John Calvin:
1. "Paul did not desire to live with any other object in view than that of promoting the glory of Christ, and doing good to the brethren."
2. "By his choice, however, he shows what ardent love glowed in his breast."
3. "Persons in despair have recourse to [death] from having become weary of life; believers, on the other hand, willingly hasten forward to it, because it is a deliverance from the bondage of sin, and an introduction into the kingdom of heaven."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The apostle describes himself as thus holden and constrained of (i.e., by) the two things, death or the continuance of life that his work may bear its fruit."
2. "He views the world as a place of temporary sojourn, not as a home, and so he uses to describe his departure a significant term which implies that he will be like one who has only been detained here."
3. "He says 'be with Christ,' as though he looked forward to the presence with Christ at the moment of his departure."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "I am held together." - The commentator explains that the phrase "I am in a strait" means being held together, like being hemmed in on both sides. This sheds light on the sense of pressure and confinement that the speaker is experiencing.

2. "Pressure to live on, pressure to die and be with Christ." - The commentator points out the conflicting desires of the speaker, who feels torn between the desire to continue living and the desire to be with Christ in death. This highlights the internal struggle and longing that the speaker is facing.

3. "To depart... to break up camp... to depart." - The commentator provides a nuanced understanding of the phrase "to depart," explaining that it can mean various things such as unloosing, breaking up, or even weighing anchor and setting sail. This adds depth to the idea of departing and suggests a sense of movement and transition.

### John Gill:
1. "The saints are in Christ now, chosen in him, set upon his heart, and put into his hands, are created in him, and brought to believe in him, and are in him as branches in the vine; and he is in them, formed in their hearts, lives and dwells in them by faith, and they have sometimes communion with him in private duties and public worship."
2. "But after death they are immediately with him, where he is in his human nature; and their souls in their separate state continue with him till the resurrection morn, when their bodies will be raised and reunited to their souls, and be both forever with him, beholding his glory, and enjoying uninterrupted communion with him."
3. "To depart and be with Christ is better than to live in the flesh in this sinful world, in the midst of a variety of sorrows and troubles, and in which communion with Christ is but now and then enjoyed, though such a life is better than sleeping in the grave."

### John Wesley:
1. "To depart - Out of bonds, flesh, the world."
2. "And to be with Christ - In a nearer and fuller union."
