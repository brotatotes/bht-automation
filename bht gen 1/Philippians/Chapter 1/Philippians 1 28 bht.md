# Philippians 1:28 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Amidst adversaries, whether Jews or Gentiles, who oppose the Gospel, believers are urged not to be easily frightened but to maintain their integrity. The opposition faced by messengers of God serves as a clear indication of their adversaries' impending ruin. However, for believers, their commitment to the Gospel is a manifest token of their salvation, a divine interposition that assures them of ultimate deliverance and victory over their foes. In enduring persecution with fortitude and perseverance, believers display God's grace at work, while their oppressors only hasten their own condemnation.
