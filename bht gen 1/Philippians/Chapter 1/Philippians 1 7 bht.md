In this verse, we see the deep affection and gratitude that the apostle Paul holds for the Philippians. He confidently prays for their salvation, knowing that they have been partakers of his grace and have shown unwavering support for him in his trials and in the defense of the Gospel.

1. "Because I have you in my heart" - Love begets love, and when a pastor holds his people in his heart, they will hold him in their hearts.
2. "In the defence" - Referring to the original sense of the word "apology" in Acts, it implies a defense or justification rather than an apology in the modern sense.
3. "Partakers with me of grace" - The Philippians were co-sharers in grace, meaning that their actions were prompted by grace to alleviate Paul's imprisonment, defend and propagate the gospel, and suffer for its sake.
