### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "See that ye also be 'obedient,' and so 'your salvation' shall follow your obedience."

### Albert Barnes:

(Note: The commentary is quite long, so I have selected three quotes that provide a good overview of the main points.)

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The particle in the original is not equivalent to ‘on which account,’ or ‘wherefore,’ but merely the lighter conjunction by which an imperative or hortatory clause is attached to what has preceded."
2. "He now begs that he may not find that his presence among them was necessary to sustain that zeal, but that they will prove it to have been of a true nature, a zeal for Christ, by their efforts while he is away from them."
3. "And he employs a verb expressive of complete and perfect accomplishment, that they may feel at now great results they are to aim."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "They are not to render eye-service only when Paul is there, but much more when he is away."
2. "This exhortation assumes human free agency in the carrying on the work of one's salvation."
3. "Paul has no sympathy with a cold and dead orthodoxy or formalism that knows nothing of struggle and growth."

### John Gill:
1. "Since he, who was God over all, blessed for ever, made himself so low in human nature, in which he is now so highly exalted, having done the work and business he came about with such condescension, humility, and meekness; therefore it becomes those who profess to be his followers, to do all their affairs as men and Christians, with, and among one another, in all lowliness of mind."

2. "The apostle calls the saints here, 'my beloved', he having a strong affection for them, which he frequently expresses in this epistle; and he chooses to make use of such an endearing appellation, that it might be observed, that what he was about to say to them sprung from pure love to them, and a hearty desire for their welfare, and from no other end, and with no other view."

3. "Not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence; which clause may either be referred to the foregoing, which expresses their obedience; and so signifies that that was carefully and cheerfully performed, not only while the apostle was with them, but now when he was absent from them, and much more when absent than present:, which shows, that they were not eye servants, and menpleasers, but what they did they did sincerely and heartily, as to the Lord."

### John Wesley:
1. "Having proposed Christ's example, he exhorts them to secure the salvation which Christ has purchased."
2. "Now in my absence — When ye have not me to instruct, assist, and direct you."
3. "Work out your own salvation — Herein let every man aim at his own things."
