# Philippians 2:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
God is ever-present, working in us according to His good pleasure, not because of our own merit. While we have a responsibility to actively pursue our salvation, our efforts are supported and encouraged by the ever-working hand of God. He is with us always, even when others are not, and His presence empowers and guides our journey towards salvation.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1) "God not only brings about the will, but creates the will we owe both the will to do good, and the power, to His indwelling Spirit."
2) "The θέλειν and ἐνεργεῖν are well explained by Calvin: 'Fatemur, nos a natura habere voluntatem: sed quoniam peccati corruptione mala est, tunc bona esse incipit, quum reformata est a Deo.'"
3) "Do all things for the sake of (to carry out) your own good pleasure."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The will, and the power to work, being first instalments of His grace, encourage us to make full proof of, and carry out to the end, the 'salvation' which He has first 'worked,' and is still 'working in' us, enabling us to 'work it out.'" 
2. "Man is, in different senses, entirely active, and entirely passive: God producing all, and we acting all. What He produced is our own acts." 
3. "God makes a new heart, and we are commanded to make us a new heart; not merely because we must use the means in order to the effect, but the effect itself is our act and our duty."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It is of importance, therefore, to understand what this declaration of the apostle means, in order to see whether this objection is valid, or whether the fact that God 'works in us' is to be regarded as a reason why we should make no effort."
2. "The declaration here, therefore, cannot mean that God compels us, or that we are anything else but free agents still, though He 'works in us to will and to do.' It must mean merely that he exerts such an influence as to secure this result."
3. "The fact that God works is an encouragement for us to work... What encouragement of a higher order can man ask? And what farmer is afraid of the agency of God in the case, or supposes that the fact that God exerts an agency is a reason why he should not plow and plant his field, or set out his orchard?"

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "In you, not among you."
2. "The willing which is wrought by God, by its own nature and pressure, works out into action."
3. "We will, but God works the will in us. We work, therefore, but God works the working in us."

### John Calvin:
1. "It is God that worketh. This is the true engine for bringing down all haughtiness — this the sword for putting an end to all pride, when we are taught that we are utterly nothing, and can do nothing, except through the grace of God alone."
2. "He has also expressed much more than if he had said that God is the Author of the beginning and of the end. For in that case sophists would have alleged, by way of cavil, that something between the two was left to men. But as it is, what will they find that is in any degree peculiar to us?"
3. "The Holy Spirit, however, calls us to consider, that he wishes to work upon living organs, but he immediately represses arrogance by recommending fear and trembling. The inference, also, is to be carefully observed: 'You have,' says he, 'all things from God; therefore be solicitous and humble.'"

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The first movement comes from God. He bestows His quickening gift, and then you may improve what He has given by your earnest labour."
2. "Even the wish to serve God comes from Himself, is roused first by Him in the heart of man; and when He has so awakened the mind, He bestows the energy, the working power, so that the wish may have its fulfilment."
3. "And God’s graces are bestowed because He willeth not the death of a sinner, but that all men should come to salvation. This is His good pleasure, and for the sake of its achievement, He is thus large in His bounty to men’s souls."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "God is the Energy and the Energizer of the universe."
2. "God does it all, then. Yes, but he puts us to work also and our part is essential."
3. "So Whitney puts 'the will of God' behind gravitation and all the laws of nature."
