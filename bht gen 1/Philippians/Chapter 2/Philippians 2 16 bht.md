# Philippians 2:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse speaks of holding forth the light of Christ's word to the Gentiles, reflecting His light as believers in the world. Christians are called to make the Gospel known, warning sinners and sharing the way of salvation. This duty rests on us to fix our attention on the word, present it through our conduct, and hold it fast, for it brings both blessings and joy, becoming a cause of glorying.
