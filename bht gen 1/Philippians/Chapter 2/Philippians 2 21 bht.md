# Philippians 2:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the companions of the apostle Paul are described as putting their own interests, such as ease, safety, and profit, above the cause of Jesus Christ. It is noted that even in that time, there were very few individuals who fully dedicated themselves to the ministry, causing the apostle Paul to question if there was anyone he could truly depend on. Those who prioritize personal gain will find that there are few like-minded individuals willing to make the sacrifices required to follow Christ.

"Few come to the help of the Lord's cause, where ease, fame, and gain have to be sacrificed" - This statement highlights the rarity of individuals who are willing to make sacrifices for the sake of advancing the Gospel.

### John Calvin:
1. "It may seem at first view as if it were no great fault to seek one’s own profit; but how insufferable it is in the servants of Christ, appears from this, that it renders those that give way to it utterly useless."
2. "For it must necessarily be, that one or other of two dispositions prevails over us — either that, overlooking ourselves, we are devoted to Christ, and those things that are Christ’s, or that, unduly intent on our own advantage, we serve Christ in a superficial manner."
3. "Your calling ought to be regarded by you in such a way, that you shall turn away all your powers of perception from everything that would impede you.

"In the 'things of Jesus Christ' we must not only understand all that is connected with the preaching and advancement of the Gospel, but such matters also as most nearly concerned the apostle himself." - The phrase "things of Jesus Christ" encompasses not only the spreading of the Gospel but also the personal concerns and well-being of the apostle Paul, emphasizing the holistic nature of his ministry and the interconnectedness of various aspects of his life.

### John Gill:
1. "Not every individual, but the greatest part; and not merely such as were manifestly false teachers, but such as were with the apostle, as ministers of the word."
2. "They sought great things for themselves, and looked every man for his gain from his quarter."
3. "They sought for dominion and authority over men, and their faith, to lord it over God's heritage."
