## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "ὑμῶν should be as ἐθνῶν ( ἀπόστολος ) in Romans 11:13 , but as in ref. 2 Cor. (where see note), almost = ὁ ἀποσταλεὶς ὑφ ʼ ὑμῶν." 
2. "λειτουργὸν δὲ αὐτὸν εἴρηκε τῆς χρείας , ὡς τὰ παρ ʼ αὐτῶν ἀποσταλέντα κομίσαντα χρήματα , Thdrt."
3. "πέμψαι ] it was actually a sending  back , though not so expressed here: see ch. Philippians 4:18 ."

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "The 'apostles' or 'messengers of the churches' were distinct from the 'apostles' specially commissioned by Christ, as the Twelve and Paul."
2. "Epaphroditus was a presbyter or else a deacon."
3. "The Greek 'leitourgon,' literally, implies ministering in the ministerial office."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He is much commended by Paul for his faithfulness and zeal."
2. "The Christian life is a warfare; there are many foes to be overcome; the period which they are to serve is fixed by the Great Captain of salvation, and they will soon be permitted to enjoy the triumphs of victory."
3. "He was in fact sent as a messenger to Paul."

### Marvin Vincent:

3. "He that ministered [λειτουργον] is kindred with leitourgia service, in ver. 17."

### John Calvin:

Note: The commentary is about Philippians 2:25-30.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "It was necessary that Epaphroditus should be sent, for he would hardly recover thoroughly, while longing to go home; nor could the Philippians be happy till they saw again their messenger, whose work in their stead had cost him a severe sickness, and nearly his life. He must go back at once."
2. "He is called ‘brother’ by St. Paul, as a member of the same Christian fellowship. The subsequent epithets rise to a higher level."
3. "Implies that a more devoted service still had been called for from those to whom the title is given. It is only found elsewhere applied to Archippus (Philemon 1:2), on whom an important charge was laid which required good heed that he might fulfil it. It was not only work to do, but enemies to resist."
4. "The Greek is the word ‘apostle,’ but it cannot have that restricted sense here, though some good authorities so render it. It is not given as a title except to the twelve, and those who like Paul and Barnabas were placed on the same level with the first apostles in the earliest days of the Church."
5. "The word appears in our English ‘liturgy,’ but almost certainly here signifies no more than that Epaphroditus was the representative of the Philippian Church in the mission to Rome. St. Paul may have selected the word, which had these various shades of meaning, to indicate that he felt the service done unto himself was in a sense a religious work, and done unto Christ’s cause as well as to the individual prisoner."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Epaphroditus, brother, fellow-worker, fellow-soldier." - These three epithets given to Epaphroditus in ascending scale highlight the common sympathy, work, and danger shared with the readers. 

2. "Messenger (αποστολον)." - This use of αποστολος as a messenger emphasizes the role of Epaphroditus as a missionary.

3. "Minister (λειτουργον)." - The term λειτουργον, used here, carries a ritualistic connotation and emphasizes the service and ministry of Epaphroditus.

### John Gill:
1. "This man was sent by the Philippians to the apostle with a present, and had been detained at Rome for some time, partly through business, and partly through sickness."
2. "The ministry of the word is a work; it is called the work of the ministry; and it is a laborious one when diligently and faithfully performed."
3. "The life of every believer is a warfare; he is always engaged in a war with sin, and Satan, and the world; and is often called to fight the fight of faith."

### John Wesley:
1. "Epaphroditus was not only a messenger, but also a beloved brother and fellow worker in the gospel. This highlights the deep relationship and mutual respect between him and the Philippians, as well as his dedication to spreading the message of Christ."

2. "The Philippians' decision to send Epaphroditus back immediately shows their concern for his well-being. They understood the importance of taking care of their fellow believers and ensuring their physical and emotional health."

3. "By sending Epaphroditus back, the Philippians were also demonstrating their trust in God's providence. They knew that God would continue to provide for their needs and the needs of the church, even without Epaphroditus' presence."

4. "This act of sending Epaphroditus back also serves as a reminder of the selflessness and sacrificial love that should characterize the Christian community. It encourages believers to prioritize the well-being of others and to be willing to make personal sacrifices for the sake of the gospel."
