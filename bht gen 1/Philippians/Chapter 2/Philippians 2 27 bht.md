## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "καὶ γάρ recognizes and reasserts that which has before been put as from another, as 'ἔλεγες τοίνυν δή, ὅτι κ. τ. λ.' 'καὶ γὰρ ἔλεγον, ἔν γε ὄχλῳ.' Plato, Gorg. 459: see Hartung, Partikell. i. 137, for he really was sick." 
2. "παραπλήσιον does not involve any ellipsis (De W.) as of ἀφίκετο or the like, but (as Mey.) it stands adverbially as παραπλησίως; so in Polyb. iii. 33. 10, εἰ πεποιήκαμεν παραπλήσιον τοῖς ἀξιοπίστως ψευδομένοις τῶν συγγραφέων: and θανάτῳ is the dative of congruence after it, sometimes a genitive, as Plato, Soph. p. 217, λόγων ἐπελάβου παραπλησίων ὧν … διερωτῶντες ἐτυγχάνομεν."
3. "λύπην ἐπὶ λύπην] for construction, see reff. The dative after ἐπί is more usual: so φόνος ἐπὶ φόνῳ, Eur. Iph. Taur. 197 (189): the accus. giving the sense of accession, 'sorrow coming upon sorrow,' not, sorrow superimposed upon sorrow."

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Epaphroditus' sickness proves that the apostles had not ordinarily the permanent gift of miracles, any more than of inspiration: both were vouchsafed to them only for each particular occasion, as the Spirit thought fit."
2. "Lest I should have sorrow upon sorrow—namely, the sorrow of losing him by death, in addition to the sorrow of my imprisonment."
3. "Here only occurs anything of a sorrowful tone in this Epistle, which generally is most joyous."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The account of the sickness and recovery of Epaphroditus is such as to lead us to suppose that he was not restored by miracle."
2. "This account shows also that this Epistle is not the work of an impostor."
3. "God had mercy on him by restoring him to health evidently not by miracle, but by the use of ordinary means."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Sorrow upon sorrow" implies a continuous and increasing cycle of grief, like waves crashing one after another.
2. The accusative form of "sorrow upon sorrow" suggests a sense of motion, as if the sorrow is actively coming upon the individual.
3. The phrase "wave after wave" emphasizes the relentless nature of the sorrow, reinforcing the idea of a continuous and unending cycle of grief.

### John Calvin:
1. "It is, however, surprising that he should ascribe it to the mercy of God that Epaphroditus had had his period of life prolonged, while he had previously declared that he desired death in preference to life."
2. "But on me also, lest I should have sorrow. Paul acknowledges that the death of Epaphroditus would have been bitterly painful to him, and he recognises it as an instance of God’s sparing mercy toward himself, that he had been restored to health."
3. "For what excellence were there in patiently enduring the cross, if there were in it no feeling of pain and bitterness? But when the consolation of God overcomes that feeling, so that we do not resist, but, on the contrary, give our back to the endurance of the rod, we in that case present to God a sacrifice of obedience that is acceptable to him."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Such a sickness must also in all probability have extended over some time."
2. "St. Paul does not consider that for all men it is a mercy to them that they be taken away, though he can say of himself that ‘to die is gain.’"
3. "To lose one at such a time would have been a crushing stroke."
4. "He rather regards his life as an heritage of sorrow, from which sorrow never departs, and he says that to this, his wonted grief, the death of his friend would have brought an addition of sorrow."

### John Gill:
1. "Good men, such as Christ loves, as he did Lazarus, are sometimes sick; though their spiritual diseases are healed, and their sins forgiven, so that the inhabitants of Zion have no more reason to say that they are sick, since Christ has took their infirmities, and bore their sickness, yet they are not exempt from bodily disorders."
2. "His recovery was not by man, but by God, and owing to his power, mercy, and goodness; and indeed, whenever means are made rise of, and they succeed to the restoration of health, it ought to be ascribed to the divine blessing on them."
3. "Grace, and the doctrine of grace, though they regulate the passions, and restrain them from immoderate sorrow, they do not destroy them, nor deny the proper use of them. Christianity does not countenance a stoical apathy, but requires and encourages a Christian sympathy, and directs us to weep with them that weep within due bounds."

### John Wesley:
1. "God's compassion is not limited to just forgiving sins, but extends to restoring health and wholeness to those who are broken and hurting."
2. "This verse reminds us that God's compassion is not earned or deserved, but freely given out of His love and mercy."
3. "In this act of healing, we see God's desire to bring restoration and wholeness to every aspect of our lives, not just our spiritual well-being."
