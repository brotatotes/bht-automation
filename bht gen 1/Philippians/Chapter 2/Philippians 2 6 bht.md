# Philippians 2:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the majestic nature of Christ is described as "the form of God", depicting His eternal divinity and the infinite glories that accompany it. Christ, in this divine form, did not consider it a violation to claim equality with God, as He possessed the same essence and unchanging perfection. He willingly emptied Himself of His heavenly glory, humbly descending from the highest heights to the lowest depths for the sake of humanity. This self-emptying demonstrates the remarkable contrast between His divine nature and His sacrificial mission.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "The divine nature had infinite BEAUTY in itself, even without any creature contemplating that beauty: that beauty was 'the form of God';"
2. "He never emptied Himself of the fulness of His Godhead, or His 'BEING on an equality with God'; but between His being 'in the FORM of God,' and His 'taking on Him the form of a servant,'"
3. "Being on an equality with God, is not identical with subsisting in the form of God"; the latter expresses the external characteristics, majesty, and beauty of the Deity, which "He emptied Himself of," to assume "the form of a servant";

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The importance of the passage on the question of the divinity of the Saviour will be perceived at once, and no small part of the point of the appeal by the apostle depends, as will be seen, in the fact that Paul regarded the Redeemer as equal with God."
2. "The word 'form' properly means, form, shape, bodily shape, especially a beautiful form, a beautiful bodily appearance."
3. "The phrase 'thought it not' means 'did not consider'; it was not judged to be a matter of such importance that it could not be dispensed with."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Being in the form of God...to which the sentence refers. In itself it does not imply eternal, but only prior existence."
2. "Form [μορφη]...denote that expression of being which carries in itself the distinctive nature and character of the being to whom it pertains."
3. "To say, then, that Christ was in the form of God, is to say that He existed as essentially one with God."
4. "Christ, being in the form of God, did not think it robbery to be equal with God, but (instead) emptied Himself."
5. "Christ held fast His assertion of divine dignity, but relinquished it. The antithesis is thus entirely destroyed."

### John Calvin:
1. "Christ’s humility consisted in his abasing himself from the highest pinnacle of glory to the lowest ignominy: our humility consists in refraining from exalting ourselves by a false estimation."
2. "Since, then, the Son of God descended from so great a height, how unreasonable that we, who are nothing, should be lifted up with pride!"
3. "He emptied himself. Since, then, the Son of God descended from so great a height, how unreasonable that we, who are nothing, should be lifted up with pride!"

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Christ being in the form of God: here the word ‘being’ is not the usual simple substantive verb, but a stronger word which is employed when the nature of a thing, in contradistinction to its mere existence, is to be predicated."
2. "For, since he from the first had all the essential attributes of the Godhead in Himself, to make Himself equal with God would be but to have and hold what was His own."
3. "What Christ did not do was this. He did not count His equality with God as a prize to be held fast. He possessed this equality, but consented to forego it for a time, that He might work out the salvation of men."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "In his preincarnate state Christ possessed the attributes of God and so appeared to those in heaven who saw him." 
2. "Paul means a prize to be held on to rather than something to be won ('robbery')." 
3. "Undoubtedly Christ gave up his environment of glory. He took upon himself limitations of place (space) and of knowledge and of power, though still on earth retaining more of these than any mere man."

### John Gill:
1. "This phrase, 'the form of God', is to be understood of the nature and essence of God, and describes Christ as he was from all eternity."
2. "Christ being in this glorious form, or having the same divine nature with the Father, with all the infinite and unspeakable glories of it, thought it no robbery to be equal with God."
3. "He reckoned that by declaring and showing forth his proper deity, and perfect equality with the Father, he robbed him of no perfection; the same being in him as in the Father, and the same in the Father as in him."

### John Wesley:
1. "Counted it no act of robbery — That is the precise meaning of the words,-no invasion of another's prerogative, but his own strict and unquestionable right."

2. "To be equal with God — the word here translated equal, occurs in the adjective form five or six times in the New Testament... In all which places it expresses not a bare resemblance, but a real and proper equality."

3. "It here implies both the fulness and the supreme height of the Godhead; to which are opposed, he emptied and he humbled himself."
