# Philippians 2:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, we see the remarkable humility and self-abasement of Christ. He willingly laid aside the glories and manifestation of His divinity, yet He did not cease to be God. Instead, He took on the form of a servant, appearing as a mere man, though still retaining His true divine nature. He embraced a new manifestation of Himself in human likeness, not a mere illusion but a real, authentic humanity. In this act of emptying Himself, He willingly assumed the role of a servant, fully obedient to His Father.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "He used His equality with God as an opportunity, not for self-exaltation, but for self-abasement."
2. "He emptied Himself of the μορφὴ θεοῦ (not His essential glory, but its manifested possession)"
3. "He was not a man, purus putus homo, but the Son of God manifest in the flesh and nature of men."

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "His subjection to the law and to His parents, His low state as a carpenter, and His servant-like dependence on God are all marks of His 'form as a servant'." 
2. "He was in the form of a servant as soon as He was made man." 
3. "His emptying Himself presupposes His previous plenitude of Godhead."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The essential idea is that of bringing to emptiness, vanity, or nothingness; and, hence, it is applied to a case where one lays aside his rank and dignity, and becomes in respect to that as nothing; that is, he assumes a more humble rank and station."
2. "It cannot mean that he literally divested himself of his divine nature and perfections, for that was impossible. He could not cease to be omnipotent, and omnipresent, and most holy, and true, and good."
3. "The language before us fairly implies that he laid aside that which was expressive of his being divine - that glory which is involved in the phrase 'being in the form of God' - and took upon himself another form and manifestation in the condition of a servant."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "He divested Himself of that peculiar mode of existence which was proper and peculiar to Him as one with God."
2. "His self-emptying was not self-extinction, nor was the divine Being changed into a mere man."
3. "What Christ grasped at in His incarnation was not divine sovereignty, but service."
4. "His mode of manifestation resembled what men are. This leaves room for the assumption of another side of His nature - the divine - in the likeness of which He did not appear."
5. "All that was possible was a real and complete likeness to humanity. What He was essentially and eternally could not enter into His human mode of existence."

### John Calvin:
1. "Christ, indeed, could not divest himself of Godhead; but he kept it concealed for a time, that it might not be seen, under the weakness of the flesh."
2. "The abasement of the flesh was, notwithstanding, like a vail, by which his divine majesty was concealed."
3. "He lived in such a manner, that he seemed as though he were on a level with mankind, and yet he was very different from a mere man, although he was truly man."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "St. Paul did not intend us to understand by the word ‘empty,’ that from Christ by the incarnation the Divinity was altogether withdrawn."
2. "Christ had possessed from eternity all those qualities and attributes which are distinctly Divine; these He now, as it were, puts off, lets them not constantly be seen, and wears the character and manifests the attributes of a servant."
3. "Christ at His incarnation entered on a new manifestation of Himself. He had before been in the form of God, He now assumes a human likeness."

2. "His humanity was as real as his deity."
3. "It was a likeness, but a real likeness, no mere phantom humanity as the Docetic Gnostics held."

### John Gill:
1. "The glory of his divine nature was covered, and out of sight; and though some rays and beams of it broke out through his works and miracles, yet his glory, as the only begotten of the Father, was beheld only by a few."
2. "He willingly assented to it, to lay aside as it were his glory for a while, to have it veiled and hid, and be reckoned anything, a mere man, yea, to have a devil, and not be God: O wondrous humility! astonishing condescension!"
3. "He appeared as one in human nature, and was really such; a servant to his Father, who chose, called, sent, upheld, and regarded him as a servant; and a very prudent, diligent, and faithful one he was unto him."

### John Wesley:
1. "He was content to forego the glories of the Creator, and to appear in the form of a creature; nay, to be made in the likeness of the fallen creatures; and not only to share the disgrace, but to suffer the punishment, due to the meanest and vilest among them all."

2. "He emptied himself — Of that divine fulness, which he received again at his exaltation. Though he remained full, John 1:14, yet he appeared as if he had been empty; for he veiled his fulness from the sight of men and angels."

3. "Taking — And by that very act emptying himself. The form of a servant — The form, the likeness, the fashion, though not exactly the same, are yet nearly related to each other. The form expresses something absolute; the likeness refers to other things of the same kind; the fashion respects what appears to sight and sense."
