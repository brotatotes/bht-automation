# Philippians 2:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, we learn that Christ's appearance as a man was an act of self-humiliation. He took on the outward semblance of a common man and subjected Himself to the lowest conditions of life. This humility extended to his obedience even unto death, specifically the death of the cross, which was both painful and shameful. Christ's extreme humility and obedience serve as a remarkable example for all of mankind to behold.
