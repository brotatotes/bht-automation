## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The sense is evidently closed with ch. 3:30."
2. "And this same exhortation, χαίρειν, is in fact the groundtone of the whole Epistle."
3. "The word ἀσφαλές is no objection to this: because the χαίρ . ἐν κυρ. is in fact an introduction to the warning which follows: a provision, by upholding the antagonist duty, against their falling into deceit."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Furthermore" [BENGEL and WAHL] as in 2 Thessalonians 3:1. But it is not restricted to this meaning, as ALFORD thinks, supposing that Paul used it here intending to close his Epistle, but was led by the mention of the Judaizers into a more lengthened dissertation.
2. "The same things" - concerning "rejoicing," the prevailing feature in this Epistle.
3. "In the Lord" - marks the true ground of joy, in contrast with "having confidence in the flesh," or in any outward sensible matter of boasting.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It is the duty of Christians to rejoice in the Lord Jesus Christ."
2. "We may rejoice that we have such a Saviour. He is just such as we need."
3. "The principal joy of the true Christian should be in the Lord. He should find his happiness not in riches, or gaiety, or vanity, or ambition, but in communion with the Lord Jesus."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Finally [το λοιπον] . Lit., for the rest. Frequent in Paul's writings in introducing the conclusions of his letters."
2. "Rejoice [χαιρετε] . See on 2 Corinthians 13:11. The same things."
3. "Grievous [οκνηρον] . Only here, Matthew 25:26; Romans 12:11, in both instances rendered slothful. From ojknew to delay. Hence, in classical Greek, shrinking, backward, unready."

### John Calvin:
1. "Rejoice in the Lord...that they may not fall back from the doctrine which they have once received."
2. "He calls them dogs...impure or profane persons."
3. "He calls them evil workers, meaning, that, under the pretext of building up the Church, they did nothing but ruin and destroy everything."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "There could be neither fulness of joy for the apostle nor for them while party spirit or pride held sway among them. They must first imitate the Lord’s humiliation, and then they could rejoice in Him."

2. "It seems therefore best to take them as the introduction of what is to follow. He is about to speak against the Judaizing teachers and the mischief which they wrought."

3. "Either, ‘I have told you before, but yet it is safe, and a way of making sure that my oral teaching is not forgotten, if I write it:’ or, ‘It may be that there is no present need for what I am going to say, but it is a safe course to warn you against errors which may arise among you.’"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Finally (το λοιπον). Accusative of general reference, literally, 'as for the rest.'"

3. "Paul, as a true teacher, is not afraid of repetition."

### John Gill:
1. "A believer has always reason to rejoice in Christ; in the greatness of his person, he being in the form of God, and equal to him, and therefore able to save his to the uttermost by his obedience and death."
2. "They may, and should rejoice, as they sometimes do, in his salvation; in the contrivance of it by infinite wisdom; in the impetration of it by himself; and in the application of it by his spirit."
3. "For sometimes it is necessary to say and write the same things over and over again, partly that they may be the better understood, and partly that they may be more strongly fixed in the memory; as also, that the saints may be the more established in the present truth."

### John Wesley:
1. "The same things" refers to the teachings and messages that have been previously shared or communicated.
