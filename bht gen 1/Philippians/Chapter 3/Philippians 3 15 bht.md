# Philippians 3:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, believers are called to strive for perfection, not in the sense of absolute flawlessness, but in comparison to others who may be at a lower level of knowledge and experience. It emphasizes the need to press forward, forgetting past failures, and focusing on the ultimate goal of reaching Christ. God's Spirit will guide and reveal the truth to those who earnestly seek it, allowing them to grow and progress in their faith.
