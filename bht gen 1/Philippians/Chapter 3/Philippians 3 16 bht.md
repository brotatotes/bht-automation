2. "As, therefore, they had not yet learned what true perfection was, in order that they might attain it he wishes them to be imitators of him; that is, to seek God with a pure conscience, to arrogate nothing to themselves, and calmly to subject their understandings to Christ."
3. "Observe, that the goal of perfection to which he invites the Philippians, by his example, is, that they think the same thing, and walk by the same rule. He has, however, assigned the first place to the doctrine in which they ought to harmonize, and the rule to which they should conform themselves."
