# Philippians 3:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Beware of those impudent and contentious individuals who are enemies of the cross of Christ. They are like dogs, shameless and malignant, and their influence poses a danger to the integrity of the Gospel. These evil workers serve their own desires rather than the Lord, using deceitful words to undermine the faith. They resemble the Jewish circumcision in name only, for true circumcision is of the heart, not the flesh. The apostle's urgent warning reflects his deep concern for the unity and spiritual purity of the church.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Observe, with a view to avoid: cf. σκοπεῖν, Romans 16:17."
2. "The appellation occurs in various references; but in the Jewish usage of it, uncleanness was the prominent idea."
3. "By ἐργάτας, he seems to point out persons who actually wrought, and professedly for the Gospel, but who were ‘evil workmen,’ not mere ‘evil-doers.’"

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Beware of the dogs, those impure persons who are enemies of the cross of Christ." 
2. "Evil workers, men who worked for evil, serving not our Lord, but their own belly." 
3. "Christians have the only true circumcision, namely, that of the heart; legalists have only 'concision,' that is, the cutting off of the flesh."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The term dog also is used to denote a person that is shameless, impudent, malignant, snarling, dissatisfied, and contentious, and is evidently so employed here."
2. "The strong language which the apostle uses here, shows the sense which he had of the danger arising from their influence."
3. "The word rendered 'concision' - κατατομή katatomē - means properly a cutting off, a mutilation. It is used here contemptuously for the Jewish circumcision in contrast with the true circumcision."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "These were nominally Christians who accepted Jesus as the Messiah, but as the Savior of Israel only."
2. "Dogs was a term of reproach among both Greeks and Jews."
3. "Being unclean animals, dogs were used to denote what was unholy or profane."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Beware of the dogs." - The word signifies 'Look out,' and would rather seem to imply that these teachers were not yet at Philippi, but might come, and so the apostle bids them 'watch.'

2. "Evil workers, because they themselves who are circumcised do not keep the law." - Their pains are bestowed only on pulling down the work of the Christian teachers, and giving nothing in its stead but mere ceremonial observance, weak and beggarly elements without any spiritual benefit.

3. "The thrice repeated 'beware' in reference to the same persons marks the apostle's earnestness." - He calls their practice mere 'cutting,' a mutilation of the body for mutilation's sake, that they may be proud that men consent to be outwardly marked for Jews. But in this word there may also be an allusion to the severance or cutting asunder in the church which such teachers were sure to cause.

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Beware (βλεπετε). Three times for urgency and with different epithet for the Judaizers each time."
2. "The dogs (τους κυνας). The Jews so termed the Gentiles which Jesus uses in a playful mood (κυναριοις, little dogs) to the Syro-Phoenician woman (Matthew 15:26). Paul here turns the phrase on the Judaizers themselves."
3. "The concision (την κατατομην). Late word for incision, mutilation (in contrast with περιτομη, circumcision). In Symmachus and an inscription. The verb κατατεμνω is used in the LXX only of mutilations (Leviticus 21:5; 1 Kings 18:28)."

### John Gill:
1. "The apostle calls them so, because they returned to Judaism, as the dog to its vomit, 2 Peter 2:22; and because of the uncleanness in which many of them lived, and the impudence they were guilty of in transforming themselves into the apostles of Christ, and putting themselves upon an equal foot with them."
2. "Likewise, they may be styled dogs for their covetousness, being such greedy ones as in Isaiah 56:10, with feigned words making merchandise of men; and for their love of their bellies, which they served, and not Christ, and made a god of, Philippians 3:19."
3. "Beware of evil workers: meaning the same persons, who were deceitful workers, did the work of the Lord unfaithfully, walked in craftiness, and handled the word of God deceitfully, endeavored to subvert the Gospel of Christ, and the faith of men in it."

### John Wesley:
1. "Beware of dogs - Unclean, unholy, rapacious men."
2. "The title which the Jews usually gave the gentiles, he returns upon themselves."
3. "Circumcision being now ceased, the apostle will not call them the circumcision, but coins a term on purpose."
