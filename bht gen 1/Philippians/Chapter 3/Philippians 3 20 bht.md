# Philippians 3:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Believers are described as having their citizenship in heaven, where their hearts and affections truly belong. Their thoughts and conversation are focused on the heavenly realm, anticipating the return of the Lord Jesus as their Savior. While they live in this world, they live as pilgrims and strangers, distinguishing themselves from those whose focus is solely on earthly pursuits. Their true home is in heaven, where they eagerly await the fulfillment of their salvation.
