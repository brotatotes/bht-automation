3. "We do not depend on circumcision for salvation, or on any external rites and forms whatever - on any advantage of rank, or blood.

### John Calvin:
1. "For the true circumcision is of the spirit and not of the letter, inward, and situated in the heart, not visible according to the flesh." (Romans 2:29) - This quote emphasizes that true worship of God is not about external rituals or observances, but about the inward transformation of the heart.

2. "We have to do with the reality, while they rest in the symbols: we have to do with the substance, while they look to the shadows." - This quote highlights the distinction between believers who have a genuine relationship with Christ and those who rely on external symbols and rituals for their faith.

3. "He thus reproves, and in no slight manner, the perverse zealots of the law, because, not satisfied with Christ, they have recourse to grounds of glorying apart from him." - This quote criticizes those who seek to find their worth and righteousness in external achievements or observances, rather than finding their confidence in Christ alone.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "When the outward sign had no accompaniment of faith, the sign alone availed nothing."
2. "They will worship in the Spirit, because God’s Spirit will animate all they do."
3. "'They desire to have you circumcised that they may glory in your flesh' is the same word, and in that passage he continues in the like spirit as here: 'but God forbid that I should glory save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ'"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "We believers in Christ, the children of Abraham by faith, whether Jew or Gentile, the spiritual circumcision in contrast to the merely physical."
2. "By the Spirit of God. Instrumental case, though the dative case as the object of λατρευω makes good sense also (worshipping the Spirit of God) or even the locative (worshipping in the Spirit of God)."
3. "In the flesh. Technical term in Paul's controversy with the Judaizers. External privileges beyond mere flesh."

### John Gill:
1. "Circumcision of the heart...lies in being pricked to the heart under a true sense of sin; in having the hardness of the heart removed, and the iniquity of it laid to open view; in pain and contrition of heart about it, joined with shame for it, and loathing of it."
2. "The object of worship is 'God', and him only; not a creature animate or inanimate...only God, Father, Son, and Spirit."
3. "The manner in which worship is to be performed, is 'in the Spirit' either in and with the Spirit of God, without whose grace and assistance no part of it can be performed well."
