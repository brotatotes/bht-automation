# Philippians 3:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this passage, the apostle Paul addresses the issue of confidence in the flesh, acknowledging that he could have found security in his own abilities and achievements. However, he goes on to emphasize that these worldly accomplishments hold no value in the matter of salvation. Instead, he places his trust in Christ, recognizing that true contentment and confidence can only be found in the power of Christ working within us. Paul's words serve as a reminder to not rely on the external and temporary, but to anchor our confidence in the eternal and transformative power of Christ.
