# Philippians 3:6 Commentary Help Text

In this particular verse, the person being described possessed an intense zeal for the Law, to the point of persecuting those who did not follow it. They were believed to have achieved blamelessness in their external observance of the Law, which was highly regarded in their society. However, their righteousness was based on external actions rather than true inner righteousness before God. Despite their zeal and external perfection, they acknowledged their lack of true perfection in terms of holiness before God.
