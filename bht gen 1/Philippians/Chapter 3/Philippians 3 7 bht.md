# Philippians 3:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse being described speaks of a transformation in the speaker's perspective. Formerly, they held pride in their achievements and possessions, viewing them as gains and advantages. However, upon coming to faith in Christ, these worldly gains became insignificant in comparison to Him. The speaker willingly relinquished their previous sources of confidence and placed their ultimate worth and trust in Christ alone. Through this surrender, they gained a new understanding of the true value and surpassing worth of Christ.
