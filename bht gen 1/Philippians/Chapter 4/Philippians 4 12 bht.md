3. "God tries his people, not by a steady course of prosperity, or by long-continued and uniform adversity, but by transition from the one to the other; and it often happens that the grace which would have been sufficient for either continued prosperity or adversity, would fail in the transition from the one to the other."

3. "This is a peculiarly excellent and rare virtue, and much superior to the endurance of poverty."
