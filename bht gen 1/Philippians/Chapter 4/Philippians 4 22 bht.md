# Philippians 4:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Amidst the darkness and corruption of Nero's court, it is remarkable that the grace of God had penetrated even the highest ranks. The mention of Caesar's household indicates that within the influential and powerful, there were individuals who had embraced the Gospel. This serves as a reminder that the transformative message of Christ knows no boundaries, reaching both the marginalized and the influential. The believers in Caesar's household exemplify the triumph of holiness in unexpected places and the far-reaching impact of the Gospel.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "These perhaps were slaves belonging to the familia of Nero, who had been converted by intercourse with St. Paul, probably at this time a prisoner in the prætorian barracks."
2. "This is much more likely, than that any of the actual family of Nero should have embraced Christianity."
3. "The reason of these being specified is not plain: the connexion perhaps between a colonia, and some of the imperial household, might account for it."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "they that are of Cæsar's household—the slaves and dependents of Nero who had been probably converted through Paul's teaching while he was a prisoner in the Prætorian barrack attached to the palace."
2. "Philippi was a Roman 'colony,' hence there might arise a tie between the citizens of the mother city and those of the colony; especially between those of both cities who were Christians, converted as many of them were by the same apostle, and under like circumstances, he having been imprisoned at Philippi, as he now is at Rome."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "There is reason to believe that the bonds of affection among the churches then were much stronger than they are now."
2. "There was a generous warmth in the newness of the Christian affection - the first ardor of love."
3. "The phrase used here - 'the household of Caesar' - may refer to the relatives of the emperor; and it is certainly possible that some of them may have been converted to Christianity."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The mention of Caesar's household indicates that even within the highest levels of power and authority, there were individuals who had come to believe in the Gospel. This serves as a reminder that the message of Christ is not limited by social status or position."

2. "The fact that there were believers within Caesar's household suggests that the Gospel had spread far and wide, reaching even the inner circles of the Roman Empire. It speaks to the transformative power of the message and its ability to penetrate even the most influential and influential circles."

3. "The inclusion of Caesar's household in the narrative highlights the subversive nature of Christianity. It challenges the established order and offers a different way of life, even to those who are part of the ruling class. It shows that the Gospel is not just for the marginalized, but for all who are willing to receive it."

### John Calvin:
1. "It is no common evidence of divine mercy, that the gospel had made its way into that sink of all crimes and iniquities."
2. "It is also the more to be admired, in proportion as it is a rare thing for holiness to reign in the courts of sovereigns."
3. "The conjecture formed by some, that Seneca is here referred to among others, has no appearance of foundation; for he never gave any evidence, even the smallest, of his being a Christian."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Though unknown, they were now brethren in Christ, and so could not be without interest in one another."
2. "The reason why they specially send a salutation may be that they, more than any others, had heard of all the love which the Philippians felt toward the apostle."

1. "Christ was made known to some there likewise; though Nero, the then reigning emperor, was a very wicked prince, and his court a very debauched one, yet the grace of God reached some there."
2. "Who these were cannot be said; as for the conjecture that Seneca the philosopher, Nero's master, was one of them, it is without foundation."
3. "Torpes, a man in great favour and dignity in Nero's court, and Evellius his counsellor, who both suffered martyrdom under him, according to the Roman martyrology, are also mentioned."
