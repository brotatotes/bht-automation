### Albert Barnes:

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "True yoke - fellow" - This term is believed to refer to a person named Synzygus, who is rightly called a yoke-fellow. This interpretation is supported by the play on the name Onesimus in the Epistle to Philemon and is likely correct.

"The book of God's eternal purposes and decrees, divine predestination to eternal life; and this being called a 'book', and the names of persons being said to be in it, denote the love of God to his elect, his care of them, his value for them, his remembrance of them, and the exact knowledge which he has of them."

"Now the apostle's knowledge of these persons being written in this book, did not arise from any special revelation, as being shown the book of life, and the names of the elect in it, when he was caught up into the third heaven, 2 Corinthians 12:2; nor was his knowledge of this matter peculiar and limited to these persons only, but common to all that he had reason to hope and believe had received the grace of God in truth."
