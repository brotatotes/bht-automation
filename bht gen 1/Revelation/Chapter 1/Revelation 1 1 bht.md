## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Revelation is to teach us to understand the times, not the times to interpret to us the Apocalypse."
2. "The book is in a series of parallel groups, not in chronological succession. Still there is an organic historical development of the kingdom of God."
3. "The Apocalypse is the book of His second advent and the events preliminary to it."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The word rendered 'Revelation' - Ἀποκάλυψις Apokalupsis, whence we have derived our word 'Apocalypse' - means properly an that is, nakedness; from ἀποκαλύπτω apokaluptō, to uncover. It would apply to anything which had been covered up so as to be hidden from the view, as by a veil, a darkness, in an ark or chest, and then made manifest by removing the covering. It comes then to be used in the sense of disclosing or revealing, by removing the veil of darkness or ignorance." 

2. "The idea is that of a disclosure of an extraordinary character, beyond the mere ability of man, by a special communication from heaven. This is manifest, not only from the usual meaning of this word, but by the word 'prophecy,' in Revelation 1:3, and by all the arrangements by which these things were made known."

3. "The phrase, 'the Revelation of Jesus Christ,' might, so far as the construction of the language is concerned, refer either to Christ as the subject or object. It might either mean that Christ is the object revealed in this book, and that its great purpose is to make him known, and so the phrase is understood in the commentary called Hyponoia (New York, 1844); or it may mean that this is a revelation which Christ makes to mankind, that is, it is his in the sense that he communicates it to the world."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The participation of the Gentiles in the privileges of the new covenant was made known by revelation." 
2. "Paul received the Gospel which he preached by revelation." 
3. "The second coming of the Lord...in which His glory shall be revealed, His righteous judgment made known, and His children revealed in full majesty."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The book is a revelation, a drawing back of the veil which, to the merely human eye, hangs over the purposes of God."
2. "The object of the revelation on the part of Jesus Christ is to show certain things unto his servants."
3. "The things to be shown are things which most quickly come to pass. They are the purposes of no fallible or mortal creature, but of the infallible and eternal God."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "In the Epistles αποκαλυψις is used for insight into truth (Ephesians 1:17) or for the revelation of God or Christ at the second coming of Christ (2 Thessalonians 1:7; 1 Peter 1:7)."
2. "The precise meaning here turns on the genitive following."
3. "This vivid panorama must be read in the light of that glorious hope and of the blazing fires of persecution from Rome."

### John Gill:
1. "It treats much of his person, offices, and grace, and of Christ mystical, of the state of his church, in the several ages of time." 
2. "This was given him by God the Father, and put into his hands, to make known as being a part of the administration of his prophetic office."
3. "The end of its being given him was, to show unto his servant things which must shortly come to pass."

### John Wesley:
1. "It is, as it were, a manifesto, wherein the Heir of all things declares that all power is given him in heaven and earth, and that he will in the end gloriously exercise that power, maugre all the opposition of all his enemies."
2. "The whole structure of it breathes the art of God, comprising, in the most finished compendium, things to come, many, various; near, intermediate, remote; the greatest, the least; terrible, comfortable; old, new; long, short; and these interwoven together, opposite, composite; relative to each other at a small, at a great, distance; and therefore sometimes, as it were, disappearing, broken off, suspended, and afterwards unexpectedly and most seasonably appearing again."
3. "The peculiar design of this is, to show the things which must come to pass. And this we are especially to have before our eyes whenever we read or hear it."
