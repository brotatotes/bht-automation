In a state of spiritual ecstasy, completely immersed in divine communion, the author vividly describes a profound experience on the first day of the week. Cut off from physical surroundings, the focus shifts to the inner and higher life, as the vision of the Apocalypse unfolds in a series of sevens, initiating the future of the Church. Rich in spiritual influences, this remarkable communication reveals a deep connection to the risen Savior, experienced through acts of devotion even in seclusion.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "In the Spiritâ€”in a state of ecstasy; the outer world being shut out, and the inner and higher life or spirit being taken full possession of by God's Spirit, so that an immediate connection with the invisible world is established."
2. "Though forcibly detained from Church communion with the brethren in the sanctuary on the Lord's day, the weekly commemoration of the resurrection, John was holding spiritual communion with them."
3. "The visions of the Apocalypse, the seals, trumpets, and vials, c., are grouped in sevens, and naturally begin on the first day of the seven, the birthday of the Church, whose future they set forth."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The fair meaning of the passage is, that he was at that time favored, in a large measure, with the influences of the Holy Spirit - the spirit of true devotion; that he had a high state of religious enjoyment, and was in a condition not inappropriate to the remarkable communications which were made to him on that day."

2. "It was a state which seems to have resulted from the fact, that on that desert island he devoted the day to the worship of God, and, by honoring the day dedicated to the memory of the risen Saviour, found, what all will find, that it was attended with rich spiritual influences on his soul."

3. "Though alone, he was engaged on that day in acts of devotion. Though far away from the sanctuary, he enjoyed what all Christians hope to enjoy on such a day of rest, and what not a few do in fact enjoy in its observance."

### John Gill:
1. "The first day of the week is designed; so the Ethiopic version renders it 'on the first day'; and is so called just as the ordinance of the supper is called the Lord's supper, being instituted by the Lord."
2. "This day was known by the ancients by the name of 'the Lord's day'; as by Ignatius, Irenaeus, Tertullian, Origen, and others."
3. "He was in an ecstasy of spirit, and knew not scarcely whether he was in the body or out of it."
