## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The churches selected are not taken at random, but have a many-sided completeness."
2. "These seven are representative churches; and, as a complex whole, ideally complete, embody the chief spiritual characteristics of the Church, whether as faithful or unfaithful, in all ages."
3. "In another aspect, Ephesus in conflict with false freedom, that is fleshly licentiousness (the Nicolaitanes); so also Pergamos in conflict with Balaam-like tempters to fornication and idol-meats; and on the other side, Philadelphia in conflict with the Jewish synagogue, that is, legal bondage."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The voice, in addition to the declaration, 'I am Alpha and Omega,' gave this direction that he should record what he saw." 
2. "Make a fair record of it all; evidently meaning that he should describe things as they occurred."
3. "They were to derive from it themselves the consolation which it was suited to impart in time of trial, and to transmit it to future times, for the welfare of the church at large."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The command to write is so given in the original as to show that it is urgent and that it must be obeyed at once."
2. "These are the seven churches already spoken of in Revelation 1:4, and no reasonable doubt can be entertained that they represent the universal Church in all countries and ages."
3. "The character in which the Redeemer is presented to these seven churches consists of a summary of particulars which are afterwards applied separately to the seven churches in chaps. 2 and 3."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Write in a book (γραψον εις βιβλιον). The commission covers the whole series of visions which all grow out of this first vision of the Risen Christ."
2. "Send (πεμψον). Part of the commission from Christ."
3. "But apparently the whole book was to be read to each of the seven churches. It would probably also be copied at each church."

### John Gill:
1. "These characters, which are repeated here, are left out in the Alexandrian copy, the Complutensian edition, the Vulgate Latin, Syriac, and Ethiopic versions; but are very fitly retained, to point out the person that speaks; to express his dignity, deity, and eternity; to excite the attention of John, and to give weight to what he said."
2. "That it might remain, and be read of all men, and be profitable to the churches in the then present age, and in all future ones."
3. "From whence it appears, that not only the seven following epistles were sent to the churches, but that after John had written in a book the account of all the visions that he saw, the whole was sent unto them, for their use and benefit."

### John Wesley:
1. "This command extends to the whole book. All the books of the New Testament were written by the will of God; but none were so expressly commanded to be written."
2. "So all the Revelation is but one book: nor did the letter to the angel of each church belong to him or his church only; but the whole book was sent to them all."
3. "Hereafter named; and through them to all churches, in all ages and nations."

Note: The commentary provides geographical distances between the cities mentioned in the verse, but since it does not directly enrich the understanding of the verse, it is not included in the quotes.
