# Revelation 1:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When the voice of God the Father resonates, the Seer turns to behold its source. His vision unveils seven golden candlesticks, symbolic of the seven churches and their unity. These candlesticks, representing the churches, hold and emanate the light of Christ, distinguishing them from the darkness of the world. They are not mere bearers of light, but rather embody the brilliance, purity, and treasured worth of Christ's message and their faithful practices.
