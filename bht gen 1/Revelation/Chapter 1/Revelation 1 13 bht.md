# Revelation 1:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, a divine figure, resembling a human being, is seen standing among seven lamp-bearers. The absence of the article before "Son of man" suggests that he is not just 'like' the Son of man, but is indeed the Son of man. He is adorned with a high-girded robe, symbolizing his dignity and priestly role. This vision signifies the presence of Christ in his churches, fulfilling his promise to be with them always. He is not only a priestly figure, but also a royal figure, clothed in a majestic robe.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "I will not deny that the anarthrous use of this title may mark out less sharply our Lord himself than the use with the articles; but in N. T. Greek we should be no more justified in rendering υἱὸς ἀνθρώπου in such a connexion as this, 'a son of man,' than πνεῦμα θεοῦ, 'a spirit of God.'" 
2. "The χιτὼν ποδήρης, vestis talaris, was a sign of high rank or office."
3. "But perhaps after all the point is not to be pressed; for the angels in ch. Rev 15:6 are also girt περὶ τὰ στήθη."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "His glorified form as man could be recognized by John, who had seen it at the Transfiguration."
2. "His being in the midst of the candlesticks (only seen in the temple), shows that it is as a king-priest He is so attired."
3. "The girdle bracing the frame together, symbolizes collected powers. Righteousness and faithfulness are Christ's girdle."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "In the vision as it appeared to John, there was not one lampbearer, with seven lamps or branches, but there were seven lamp-bearers, so arranged that one in the likeness of the Son of man could stand in the midst of them."
2. "The phrase 'like unto the Son of man' should have been 'like unto a son of man'; that is, like a man, a human being, or in a human form."
3. "The raiment here assumed was not that of a priest, but that of a king. It was very far from being that in which the Redeemer appeared when he dwelt upon the earth, and was rather designed to denote his royal state as he is exalted in heaven."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "In the midst of the seven golden candlesticks is One, not walking as in chap. Revelation 2:1, but standing, who is like unto a Son of man, i.e appears in human likeness." 
2. "The description of Gabriel in Daniel 10:5 leaves little doubt as to the nature of the robe spoken of. It was a long white linen garment reaching to the feet, and worn by priests, or by kings. It was thus not only a priestly but a royal robe." 
3. "The Son of man, therefore, is not here at rest, but is engaged in discharging the functions, whatever they are, which belong to Him as a Priest for ever."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "The absence of the article here shows also (Charles) that the idea is not 'like the Son of man' for Christ is the Son of man. He is like 'a son of man,' but not a man."
2. "High girding like this was a mark of dignity as of the high priest."
3. "Note also χρυσαν (vernacular Koine) rather than the old form, χρυσην."

### John Gill:
1. "By whom is meant not an angel, for he speaks of himself as a divine Person, as the Alpha and Omega, the first and the last, phrases not applicable to any created beings."
2. "Christ was seen by John in the midst of the candlesticks or churches, and among whom he walked, which is expressive of his presence in his churches, and which he has promised unto the end of the world."
3. "The robe of the ephod wore by the high priest is called by this name in the Septuagint version of Exodus 28:4; and so it is by Josephus, who speaking of the hyacinthine tunic, or robe of blue, says, this is 'a garment down to the foot', which in our language is called 'Meeir'; rather it should be 'Meil', which is its Hebrew name."
