## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The interpretation, 'brass from Lebanon,' does not appear to be tenable, as there is no notice of Lebanon ever having produced brass of superior quality, such as this from the context must be."
2. "According to usual analogy, not χάλκος but λίβανος is the central idea, and χάλκος the qualifying one."
3. "His voice as the voice of many waters...appealing to ch. Rev 17:1 and Revelation 13:1; but, as Düsterdieck remarks, there seems to be no such allusion here, but only to the power of the voice as resembling the rushing of many waters."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Glowing brass, as if they had been made fiery (red-hot) in a furnace."
2. "The feet of the priests were bare in ministering in the sanctuary. So our great High Priest here."
3. "His voice, however, is here regarded in its terribleness to His foes."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "And his feet like unto fine brass" - The metal referred to was undoubtedly a species of brass distinguished for its clearness or whiteness. Brass is a compound metal, composed of copper and zinc. The color varies much according to the different proportions of the various ingredients.
2. "As if they burned in a furnace" - His feet were so bright that they seemed to be like a beautiful metal glowing intensely in the midst of a furnace. Anyone who has looked upon the dazzling and almost insupportable brilliancy of metal in a furnace, can form an idea of the image here presented.
3. "And his voice as the sound of many waters" - Nothing could be a more sublime description of majesty and authority than to compare the voice of a speaker with the roar of the ocean. This comparison often occurs in the Scriptures.

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Burnished brass (χαλκολιβανω)... It is in reality an unknown metal." 
2. "As if it had been refined (ως πεπυρομενης)... to set on fire, to glow." 
3. "As the voice of many waters (ως φωνη υδατων πολλων)... So the voice of God in the Hebrew of Ezekiel 43:2."

### John Gill:
1. "By which is meant, not his human nature in a suffering state; or his people, the meaner and lower parts of his mystical body, in a like state; or his apostles and ministers, who are supporters of his church, and run to and fro with spiritual knowledge, for which, though they suffer much, are permanent and glorious."
2. "Either the power of Christ in bearing up and supporting his people, in the care and government and defense of them; or his ways, works, and walks in his churches, and all his providential administrations towards them, which are holy, just, and righteous, and will be manifest."
3. "Or his wrath and vengeance in treading down and trampling upon his enemies: and his voice as the sound of many waters; meaning his Gospel, as preached by his apostles and ministers, which was heard far and near; see Romans 10:18; and which made a great noise in the world; or his voice of vengeance on his enemies, which will be very terrible and irresistible."

### John Wesley:
1. "And his feet like fine brass — Denoting his stability and strength."
2. "As if they burned in a furnace — As if having been melted and refined, they were still red hot."
3. "And his voice — To the comfort of his friends, and the terror of his enemies."
4. "As the voice of many waters — Roaring aloud, and bearing down all before them."
