# Revelation 1:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the Bible verse, a divine being's manifestation overwhelms fallen man, restoring his strength through a powerful touch. The verse refers to the One who is both the first by creation and the last by retribution. This divine being is the first because before Him, there was no formed God, and the last because after Him, there will be no other. The verse highlights that even amidst the awe-inspiring display of divine power, the assurance of our Redeemer's nearness brings peace to the soul.
