2. "Behold, I am alive forevermore - I am to live forever. Death is no more to cut me down, and I am never again to slumber in the grave."
3. "And have the keys of hell and of death - To hold the key of this, was to hold the power over the invisible world. It was the more appropriate that the Saviour should represent himself as having this authority, as he had himself been raised from the dead by his own power."

3. "His power over death is seen in taking away persons by death when he pleases, and in delivering persons from death when near it, and in raising persons from the dead."
4. "His power over 'hell', by which may be meant the grave, or the place of the departed, and separate souls, or the place of the damned and of the devils which are there, will be seen in opening the graves at the time of the resurrection, and in retaining or sending out the separate souls 'in hades'."

### John Wesley:
1. "And he that liveth — Another peculiar title of God."
2. "And I have the keys of death and of hades — That is, the invisible world."
