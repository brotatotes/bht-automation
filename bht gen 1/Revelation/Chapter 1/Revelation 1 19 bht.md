## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1) "Write therefore...the things which thou sawest...and what things they signify." 
2) "Is it not because the μέλλει γενέσθαι merely signifies the future time, in which this latter class, en masse, were to happen, whereas this ἃ εἰσί imports, what these things, each of them, severally, mean?"
3) "I would take γενέσθαι in the sense of happening, not in the wide ages of history, but in apocalyptic vision: seeing that, ταῦτα meaning ἃ εἶδες, ἃ μέλλει γενέσθαι will by analogy mean the things which shall succeed these, i. e. a future vision."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Write therefore" (inasmuch as I, "the First and Last," have the keys of death, and vouchsafe to thee this vision for the comfort and warning of the Church).
2. "The things which are" imply the present state of things in the churches when John was writing, as represented in the second and third chapters.
3. "The things which shall be hereafter," the things symbolically represented concerning the future history of the fourth through twenty-second chapters.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He had seen not only the Saviour, but he had seen seven lampstands, and seven stars in the hand of the Saviour, and he is now commanded to record the meaning of these symbols as referring to things then actually existing in the seven churches." 
2. "This interpretation is demanded by Revelation 1:20."
3. "The revelations which were to be made referred to events which were to occur beyond those which were then taking place."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Write, seeing that I am what I have now revealed Myself to be."
2. "In these verses He is described as the Head of His Church, as One who has His Church summed up in Him."
3. "The things which are' then give expression to the present condition of the Church, as she follows her Lord in humiliation and suffering in the world; 'the things which shall come to pass after these things' to the glory that awaits her when, all her trials over, she shall enter upon her reward in the world to come."

### Archibald T Robertson:
