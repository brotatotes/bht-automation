## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "God gave the Revelation to Christ; He signified it by His angel to John, which last hereby makes it known." 

2. "The words ὁ λόγος τοῦ θεοῦ κ . ἡ μαρτυρία Ἰ . χρ . cannot with any likelihood be taken to mean 'the (personal) Word of God, and the testimony of Jesus Christ;' for why, if the former term refer to Christ personally, should He be introduced in the second member under a different name?"

3. "The very adjective ὅσα refutes it. For the Evangelist distinctly tells us, John 20:30, that in writing his Gospel, he did not set down ὅσα εἶδεν, but only a portion of the things which Jesus did in the presence of His disciples, whereas in the case of this Revelation it was otherwise: he set down all which he saw, as a faithful transmitter of the Apocalyptic vision to the churches."

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "The word of God constitutes his testimony."
2. "The testimony of Jesus - 'the Spirit of prophecy'."
3. "Whatsoever things he saw, in apposition with the word of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He regarded himself merely as a 'witness' of what he had seen, and claimed only to make a fair and faithful 'record' of it."
2. "The fair meaning of this expression would be, that John had borne faithful witness to, or testimony of, the truth which God had spoken to man in the gospel of Christ."
3. "The meaning, then, of the expression, 'who bare record of the word of God,' as I understand it, is, that it was a characteristic of the writer to bear simple but faithful testimony to the truth which God communicated to people in the gospel."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The reference is to the present book and not to the Gospel."
2. "The words and the ideas are characteristic of Revelation as of the Gospel and Epistles."
3. "In Apoc. it is constantly used of the seeing of visions."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Individually St. John is nothing: he is only a witness to the Divine, to the word of God, and to the testimony given by Jesus Christ." 
2. "The verse as a whole is thus to be understood of the revelation of this book."
3. "The emphasis lies upon 'bare witness,' upon the attitude of the Seer rather than upon the things seen."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "The word of God (τον λογον του θεου). Subjective genitive, given by God. The prophetic word as in Revelation 1:9; Revelation 6:9; Revelation 20:4, not the personal Word as in Revelation 19:14."

2. "The testimony of Jesus Christ (την μαρτυριαν Ιησου Χριστου). Subjective genitive again, borne witness to by Jesus Christ."

3. "Even of all the things that he saw (οσα ειδεν). Relative clause in apposition with λογον and μαρτυριαν."

### John Gill:
1. "Of the essential and eternal Word of God, his only begotten Son; as John the apostle did in his Gospel, and in his epistles, and also in this book; and which is a clear evidence of his being the writer of it."
2. "The Gospel, which testifies of the person of Christ, of the truth of his divinity, and reality of his human nature; of the union of the two natures, divine and human, his person: of his several offices, of prophet, priest and King; of what he did and suffered for his people; and of the blessings of grace which they receive by him."
3. "Such a faithful witness serves greatly to confirm the authority of this book, and to recommend the perusal of it."
