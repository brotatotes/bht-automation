# Revelation 1:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The symbolism of the Bible verse is rich with meaning. The seven stars represent the angels or messengers of the seven churches, sending forth the message of the Gospel with zeal and diligence. The seven candlesticks, or churches, are called to be lights in the world, reflecting the light of Christ. The pastors or overseers of the churches have the important responsibility of shepherding the flock and will be held accountable for their souls. Together, these symbols reveal the divine mystery and reveal God's plan for his people.
