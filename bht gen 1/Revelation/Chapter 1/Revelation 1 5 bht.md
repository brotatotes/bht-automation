## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "He was the faithful witness, because all things that He heard of the Father He faithfully made known to His disciples."
2. "Christ rose to die no more. The image is not as if the grave was the womb of His resurrection-birth, but as Acts 13:33; Romans 1:4, treat Christ's resurrection as the epoch and event which fulfilled the Scripture."
3. "The kingship of the world which the tempter offered to Jesus on condition of doing homage to him, and so shunning the cross, He has obtained by the cross."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He is faithful in the sense that he is one on whose testimony there may be entire reliance, or who is entirely worthy to be believed."
2. "The exaltation of the Redeemer is elsewhere expressed in different language, but the idea is one that everywhere prevails in regard to him in the Scriptures."
3. "He has removed the pollution of sin from our souls by his blood; that is, his blood has been applied to cleanse us from sin."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The faithful witness, because He gave faithful testimony concerning all things which were to be testified to by Him in the world."
2. "A faithful witness, because whatever He heard from the Father, He faithfully made known to His disciples."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "The witness the faithful," nominative in apposition like πρωτοτοκος and αρχων with the preceding ablative Ιησου Χριστου with απο, a habit of John in this book (apparently on purpose) as in Revelation 2:13; Revelation 2:20; Revelation 3:12, etc. (Commentary on the faithful witness)
2. The first-born of the dead  (ο πρωτοτοκος των νεκρων). A Jewish Messianic title (Psalms 88:28) and as in Colossians 1:18 refers to priority in the resurrection to be followed by others. (Commentary on the first-born of the dead)
3. The ruler of the kings of the earth  (ο αρχων των βασιλεων της γης). Jesus by his resurrection won lordship over the kings of earth (Revelation 17:14; Revelation 19:16), what the devil offered him by surrender (Matthew 4:8). (Commentary on the ruler of the kings of the earth)

### John Gill:
1. "He is described in all his offices: in his prophetic office, the faithful witness; as he is of his Father, of his mind and will, with respect to doctrine and worship; of his truth and faithfulness in his promises; and of his love, grace, and mercy, to his chosen."
2. "He is described in his priestly office by the first begotten of the dead: being the first that rose from the dead by his own power, and to an immortal life."
3. "And he is described in his kingly office, for it follows, and the Prince of the kings of the earth: which is not to be understood figuratively of the saints, but literally of the kings and princes of this world, over whom Christ is King and Lord."

### John Wesley:
1. "He was the faithful witness of the whole will of God before his death, and in death, and remains such in glory."
2. "He rose from the dead, as 'the first fruits of them that slept;' and now hath all power both in heaven and earth."
3. "It became the Divine Majesty to call them kings with a limitation; especially in this manifesto from his heavenly kingdom; for no creature, much less a sinful man, can bear the title of king in an absolute sense before the eyes of God."
