# Revelation 1:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the commentators highlight that Christians are exalted to the dignity of being both kings and priests. They emphasize that the saints will reign with Christ, sharing His King-Priest throne in His millennial kingdom. As kings, Christians will have an exalted rank and triumph over all enemies. As priests, they are engaged in the holy service of God, offering acceptable worship, and ministering to one another. Through Christ's love and sacrifice, believers are made kings and priests, heirs of His eternal kingdom.
