# Revelation 1:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Behold, a majestic sight as He cometh with the clouds, symbolizing both wrath to sinners and the glory and majesty of His second coming. None shall be indifferent to His personal and visible appearing, for every eye, including those who have pierced Him, shall see Him. The righteous shall rejoice in His love, yet also feel penitential sorrow for their sins, while the unbelievers, represented as tribes, shall wail in penitence and dismay. So it is, the Son of Man's coming shall complete His victory and evoke deep and universal alarm.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Clouds are the symbols of wrath to sinners."
2. "His coming shall therefore be a personal, visible appearing."
3. "Even the godly while rejoicing in His love shall feel penitential sorrow at their sins, which shall all be manifested at the general judgment."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Clouds are appropriate symbols of majesty, and God is often represented as appearing in that manner."
2. "The coming of the Saviour will be an event of great interest to all mankind. None can be indifferent to it, for all will see him."
3. "Nothing would fill the earth with greater consternation than the coming of the Son of God in the clouds of heaven; nothing could produce so deep and universal alarm."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The clouds are frequently used in the descriptions of the Lord's second coming."
2. "The verb denotes the physical act, but emphasizes the mental discernment accompanying it."
3. "The expression here refers not to the Jews only, but to all who reject the Son of Man."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Another great truth is connected with Him, that He will come again, to complete His victory, and to be acknowledged by all in His glory and His majesty."
2. "The reference is undoubtedly to John 19:34; John 19:37, and to Zechariah 12:10...the persons referred to are not the Jews only, but they who in any age have identified themselves with the spirit of the Saviour’s murderers."
3. "The ‘tribes’ of Israel are the figure by which God’s believing people, whether Jew or Gentile, are represented. In like manner all unbelievers are now set before us as ‘tribes,’ the mocking counterpart of the true Israel of God."
4. "We have still to ask, In what sense shall all ‘see’ and ‘wail’? The latter word must determine the interpretation of the former. Is this a wailing of penitence or of dismay? or is it both, so that the wailers embrace alike the sinful world and the triumphant Church?"
5. "If this be the meaning of the second clause, that of the first must correspond to it, and the ‘seeing’ must be that of shame and confusion of face. The whole sentence thus corresponds with the object of the book, and the coming of Jesus is described as that of One who comes to overthrow His adversaries and to complete His triumph."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Behold, he cometh with the clouds...It becomes a common eschatological refrain."
2. "Compare the manifestation of God in the clouds at Sinai, in the cloudy pillar, the Shekinah, at the transfiguration."

4. "Shall mourn...as was common for mourners."
5. "Tribes...the spiritual Israel of Jews and Gentiles."

### John Gill:
1. "Christ will appear in great glory and majesty, the dead in Christ will be raised, Christ's personal kingdom will take place, and the general judgment come on."
2. "The manner of his coming will be 'with clouds'; either figuratively, with angels, who will attend him both for grandeur and service, or literally, in the clouds of heaven."
3. "Everyone that has eyes shall see him, or all men shall see him; the righteous shall see him, and be glad; they shall see him in his glory, as he is, and for themselves, and be satisfied."

### John Wesley:
1. "He cometh — Jesus Christ. Throughout this book, whenever it is said, He cometh, it means his glorious coming."
2. "And every eye — Of the Jews in particular. Shall see him — But with what different emotions, according as they had received or rejected him."
3. "And they who have pierced him — They, above all, who pierced his hands, or feet, or side. Thomas saw the print of these wounds even after his resurrection; and the same, undoubtedly, will be seen by all, when he cometh in the clouds of heaven."
