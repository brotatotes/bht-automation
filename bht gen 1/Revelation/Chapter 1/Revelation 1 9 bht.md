## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1) "No inference can be drawn against the apostleship of the Writer from this his designation of himself."
2) "The tribulation brings in the kingdom, and then as a corrective to the idea that the kingdom in its blessed fulness was yet present, the endurance is subjoined."
3) "From what has preceded in this verse, a strong impression remains on the mind that St. John wrote this in a season of tribulation and persecution."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Tribulation is the necessary precursor of the kingdom," therefore "the" is prefixed. This must be borne with "patient endurance." (Quote 1)
2. "Persevering, enduring continuance" (Acts 14:22); "the queen of the graces (virtues)" [CHRYSOSTOM]. (Quote 2)
3. Restricted to a small spot on earth, he is permitted to penetrate the wide realms of heaven and its secrets. Thus John drank of Christ's cup, and was baptized with His baptism (Matthew 20:22). (Quote 3)

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He was in a lonely island, to which he had been banished on account of his attachment to religion; he was in a state of high spiritual enjoyment on the day devoted to the sacred remembrance of the Redeemer; he suddenly heard a voice behind him, and turning saw the Son of man himself, in glorious form, in the midst of seven golden lamps, and fell at his feet as dead." 
2. "That is, he and they were suffering substantially the same kind of trials on account of their religion. It is evident from this that some form of persecution was then raging, in which they were also sufferers, though in their case it did not lead to banishment."
3. "The general idea is, that alike in privileges and sufferings they were united. They shared alike in the results of their attachment to the Saviour."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "John your brother" - This emphasizes the close relationship between the writer and the recipients of the letter, highlighting their shared identity as believers. It promotes a sense of unity and kinship among the Christian community.

3. "The kingdom of God is a present energy" - This statement challenges the notion that the kingdom of God is only a future hope. It asserts that the power and influence of God's kingdom are already at work in the present, providing believers with hope, courage, and patience in the midst of tribulation.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "He is their brother, and he is a fellow-partaker with them in the things of which he speaks."

2. "Both the tribulation and the kingdom were present realities and called for patience."
3. "Here John saw the visions described in the book, apparently written while still a prisoner there in exile."

### John Gill:
1. "John describes himself by his name, 'I John', the evangelist and apostle, a servant of Christ, and a beloved disciple of his; one that was well known to the seven churches to whom he writes, and who had no reason to doubt of his fidelity in the account he gives them."

2. "It is chiefly under various afflictions that faith obtains its part in the kingdom; and whosoever is a partaker of this kingdom is not afraid to suffer for Jesus."
3. "He had all the three parts of the world which were then known, with all Christendom, as it were, before his eyes; a large theatre for all the various scenes which were to pass before him."
