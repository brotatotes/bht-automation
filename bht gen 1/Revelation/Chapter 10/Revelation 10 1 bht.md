# Revelation 10:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Clothed with a cloud, this mighty angel appears distinct from the previous one, emphasizing the strength and power required for his mission. Along with the rainbow on his head symbolizing covenant mercy, his arrival brings peace and light, like sunshine after a storm. Connected with the Son of Man, this angel holds the book open as the uncreated Angel, Jesus Christ, offering comfort and good tidings to the church. With his face shining like the sun, his presence illuminates the righteous who shall shine forth in glory.
