# Revelation 10:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, a powerful figure holds a book in his left hand while raising his right hand to make an oath. The book being held signifies a significant role in prophesying and symbolizes the Bible in a smaller form. It represents the spreading of God's word and the transformative impact it will have on the world, as events are soon to unfold on both land and sea. This moment is significant as it marks a shift in the Revelation, where the language becomes clearer and less figurative, allowing for a deeper understanding of the unfolding events.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Having." in his hand—in his left hand: as in Revelation 10:5, he lifts up his right hand to heaven.
2. This other, a less book, contained only a portion which John was now to make his own and then to use in prophesying to others.
3. The New Testament begins with the word "book" (Greek, "biblus"), of which "the little book" (Greek, "biblaridion") is the diminutive, "the little bible," the Bible in miniature.
4. The angel with his right foot on the sea, and his left on the earth, claims both as God's, and as about soon to be cleared of the usurper and his followers.

### Albert Barnes:
1) "To be able to apply this, it will be necessary, as in all similar cases, to explain the natural significancy of the emblem."
2) "The natural interpretation, then, would be, that something was to be accomplished by the agency of a book, or that a book was to be the prominent characteristic of the times - as the bow, the sword, and the balances had been of the previous periods."
3) "The Bible became, at the Reformation, in fact an 'open' book. it was made accessible. It became the popular book of the world - the book that did more than all other things to change the aspect of affairs, and to give character to subsequent times."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The roll of Ch. 5 was on the hand, being too large to be grasped within it."

3. "The roll of Ch. 5 was on the hand, being too large to be grasped within it."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "A little book (βιβλαριδιον). A diminutive of βιβλαριον (papyri), itself a diminutive of βιβλιον (Revelation 5:1) and perhaps in contrast with it."
2. "Open (ηνεωιγμενον). See Ezekiel 2:9. Perfect (triple reduplication) passive participle of ανοιγω, in contrast to the closed book in Revelation 5:1."
3. "As a lion roareth (ωσπερ λεων μυκατα). Only instance of ωσπερ in the Apocalypse, but ως in the same sense several times. Present middle indicative of μυκαομα, an old onomatopoetic word from μυ or μοο (the sound which a cow utters), common for the lowing and bellowing of cattle, Latin mugire, but in Theocritus for the roaring of a lion as here."

### John Gill:
1. "By which is meant not the Bible, the Scriptures of the Old and New Testament; or the book of the Gospel, the substance of which lies in a little room, and is no other than the preaching of Christ, and him crucified, as God's way of salvation."
2. "It may be said to be 'a little book', because now not only many of the scenes and visions in it were exhibited, upon the opening of the seals; but because, at the time this vision refers to, many of its prophecies were accomplished, so that the bulk of it was greatly reduced."
3. "He was Lord and possessor of both, of the whole terraqueous globe, being the Maker and supporter of it; and that his Gospel should be spread all over the world, both on the continent and in the islands of the sea."

### John Wesley:
1. "And he had in his hand — His left hand: he swore with his right."
2. "And so St. John (as Patmos lies near Asia) could conveniently take the book out of his left hand."
3. "From this place the Revelation speaks more clearly and less figuratively than before."
