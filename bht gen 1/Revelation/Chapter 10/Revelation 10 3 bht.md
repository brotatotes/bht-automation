# Revelation 10:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, a powerful angel cries out with a loud voice, symbolizing the importance and urgency of his message. The intensity of his cry is likened to the roar of a lion, demonstrating the awe-inspiring nature of his proclamation. As he cries out, seven thunders respond with their own voices, representing the denunciations of God's judgments and wrath. Though the specific meaning of the thunders is not explained, their significance is understood, either by previous reference or by a common understanding among the listeners.
