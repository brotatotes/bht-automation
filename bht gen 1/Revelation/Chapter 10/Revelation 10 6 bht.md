# Revelation 10:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, an angel strengthens the significance of his message by swearing by the eternity of God, emphasizing His power and authority. The verse highlights God's role as the Creator, distinguished from false gods, and associates the fulfillment of divine purposes with the end of delay. The mention of time not being no longer does not imply the end of time itself, but rather the end of delay in the fulfillment of certain events and the victory of God over His enemies.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "liveth unto the ages of the ages" - This phrase emphasizes the eternal nature of God, highlighting His everlasting existence and authority.
2. "This detailed designation of God as the Creator" - The commentary points out that God's role as the Creator is significant in understanding His ability to bring about the fulfillment of His plans and mysteries.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The essential idea in such an oath is an appeal to God; a solemn reference to Him as a witness; an utterance in the presence of Him who is acquainted with the truth or falsehood of what is said, and who will punish him who appeals to him falsely."
2. "The design of referring to these things here is what is just specified to give increased solemnity to the oath by a particular reference to someone of the attributes of God."
3. "The proper interpretation would lead us to suppose that there would be so general an expectation of this, as to make the solemn affirmation of the angel proper to correct a prevailing opinion, and to show that the right interpretation was not put on what seemed to be the tendency of things."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Swear by [ωμοσεν εν] . Lit., 'swear in,' a Hebrew idiom." 
2. "Should be time no longer [χρονος ουκ εσται επι] . Rev., correctly, shall be, etc. The meaning is not, as popularly understood, that time shall cease to exist."
3. "There shall be no more delay (so Rev., in margin) before the fulfillment of the divine purposes respecting the Church on earth."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "By him that liveth...the living one for ages of ages" - This oath proves that this angel is not Christ, but rather emphasizes the eternal existence of God (Revelation 1:18; Revelation 4:9; Revelation 4:10; Revelation 15:7).

2. "Who created...a reference to God's creative activity" - The mention of God as the creator highlights His role in the creation of the world, as seen in various biblical passages (Genesis 1:1; Exodus 20:11; Isaiah 37:16; Isaiah 42:5; Psalms 33:6; Psalms 145:6).

3. "That there shall be time no longer...there will be no more delay" - The phrase "time no longer" does not mean the cessation of time itself, but rather signifies the end of delay in the fulfillment of the seventh trumpet, addressing the question of "How long?" (Revelation 6:10).

### John Gill:
1. "And sware by him that liveth for ever and ever.... That is, by the living God, who is the true God: and is so described to distinguish him from idol gods, who have no life nor breath in them; and to assert the excellency and perfection of his nature, who has life in himself originally, and independently, is the fountain of life to all creatures living, and who are supported in their life and being by him."
2. "This is also said to distinguish the great God from all false gods, who made not the heavens and the earth, who alone is, and ought to be the object of an oath, or by whom an oath is to be made, and not any creature whatsoever."
3. "The true key to this passage is Daniel 12:7; where the man clothed in linen swears, that to the end of wonders should be a time, times, and a half, and here the angel swears that time should be no longer; that is, that these time, and times, and half a time, should be no longer; that these dates would be up, and the events affixed to them be accomplished, when the seventh angel should begin to sound his trumpet."

### John Wesley:
1. "The trumpet of the seventh angel alone which is confirmed by so high an oath."
2. "Before whom a thousand years are but a day."
3. "Therefore, all his enemies, though they rage a while in heaven, on the sea, and on the earth, yet must give place to him."
