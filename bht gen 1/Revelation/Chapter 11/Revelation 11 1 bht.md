# Revelation 11:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this mysterious verse, the reed is seen as a strong measuring tool, symbolizing the powerful medium of God's speech through Scripture. The temple mentioned is not the literal one in Jerusalem, but rather represents the church as the abode of God on earth. The act of measuring with the reed signifies an investigation into prevailing views in the church, particularly in regard to atonement and justification. The verse's imagery and language address Jews, invoking their understanding of the temple and the role of Scripture as their rule of faith.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "The reed, the canon of Scripture, the measuring reed of the Church, our rule of faith, speaks."
2. "The Spirit speaks in the canon of Scripture."
3. "The measurement of the Holy place seems to me to stand parallel to the sealing of the elect of Israel under the sixth seal."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The representation undoubtedly pertains to a future age, but the language is such as would be properly addressed to one who had been a Jew, and the imagery employed is such as he would be more likely to understand than any other."
2. "The word, then, must be used of something which the temple would denote or represent, and this would properly be the church, considered as the abode of God on the earth."
3. "The direction here is equivalent, therefore, to a command to make an investigation on these subjects, and all that is implied would be fulfilled if a state of things should exist where it would be necessary to institute an examination into the prevailing views in the church on the subject of the atonement, and the true method of justification before God."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The speech to the reed as an inspired medium of speech."
2. "The temple [τον ναον]."
3. "Measuring the worshippers with a reed."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The reed is for measuring, but it is stronger than a common reed, and is thus more able to effect its purpose: it is like unto a rod." 
2. "The last clause alone is a sufficient proof that the three things to be measured are not to be understood literally. How could those who worship in the temple be thus measured with a reed?" 
3. "By the ‘temple,’ therefore, it is impossible to understand the literal temple in Jerusalem supposed to be as yet undestroyed."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "A reed (καλαμος). Old word for a growing reed (Matthew 11:7) which grew in immense brakes in the Jordan valley, a writer's reed (3 John 1:7), a measuring-rod (here, Revelation 21:15; Ezekiel 40:3-6; Ezekiel 42:16-19)."

2. "But modern scholars do not know how to interpret this interlude (Revelation 11:1-13) before the seventh trumpet (Revelation 11:15). Some (Wellhausen) take it to be a scrap from the Zealot party before the destruction of Jerusalem, which event Christ also foretold (Mark 13:2; Matthew 24:2; Luke 21:6) and which was also attributed to Stephen (Acts 6:14)."

3. "There is a heavenly sanctuary (Revelation 7:15; Revelation 11:19; Revelation 14:15, etc.), but here ναος is on earth and yet not the actual temple in Jerusalem (unless so interpreted). Perhaps here it is the spiritual (Revelation 3:12; 2 Thessalonians 2:4; 1 Corinthians 3:16; 2 Corinthians 6:16; Ephesians 2:19)."

### John Gill:
1. "By it seems to be designed the holy Scripture, or the word of God, which is sometimes called a 'line, a rule, and rod'... and it is the rule and measure of all discipline, worship, and practice."
2. "The temple of God' is here meant the church, of which the temple was a type... and the Gospel church, or churches, in the times of the sixth trumpet, which this vision refers to, and to the close of it, are in the northern parts of Europe."
3. "I take it that this measuring refers to what was done in the last age, particularly in our nation; and that it has respect to the separation from the national church, when churches, more or less, were gathered and formed according to the Gospel plan and the primitive institution."
