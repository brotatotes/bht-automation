# Revelation 11:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Bible verse describes a scene where the non-Christian world celebrates the downfall of two prophets who had tormented them with their ministry. The wicked rejoice and send gifts to one another, finding joy in the cessation of the prophets' prophecies and miracles. This celebration of the prophets' demise is fueled by the wicked's earthly-mindedness and their delight in being freed from the torment caused by the preaching of the Gospel.
