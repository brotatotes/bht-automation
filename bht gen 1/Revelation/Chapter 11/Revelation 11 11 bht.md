## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The Spirit of life—the same which breathed life into Israel's dry bones, Ezekiel 37:10; Ezekiel 37:11 (see on Ezekiel 37:11- :), 'Breath came into them.' The passage here, as there, is closely connected with Israel's restoration as a nation to political and religious life."
2. "The allusion to be to Israel's resurrection, in contrast to 'the times of the Gentiles' wherein these 'tread under foot the holy city.'"
3. "Such as fell on the soldiers guarding Christ's tomb at His resurrection (Ezekiel 37:10- :), when also there was a great earthquake (Ezekiel 37:10- :)."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The living, or life-giving Spirit that proceeds from God entered into them."
2. "They would seem to come to life again, or that effects would follow as if the dead were restored to life."
3. "As if animated anew by a divine power, begin to prophesy, or to proclaim their doctrines to the world."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The Spirit of life, or the breath of life, is a powerful symbol used throughout the Bible to represent the life-giving power of God. It is the divine force that animates and sustains all living beings."

2. "The image of the Spirit entering into them brings to mind the powerful vision of Ezekiel in which the Spirit breathes life into dry bones, bringing them back to life. It is a reminder of God's ability to bring new life and transformation to even the most hopeless situations."

3. "The word 'saw' here carries a deeper meaning than simply observing with the eyes. It implies a deep understanding and perception of the spiritual reality. It is through the Spirit that we are able to truly see and comprehend the things of God."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The short time of the world’s triumph passes away." 
2. "A spirit of life out of God enters into them."
3. "Imparts to them such power that they stand up upon their feet, and strike all beholders with terror."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "The breath of life from God (πνευμα ζωης εκ του θεου). This phrase (πνευμα ζωης) occurs in Genesis 6:17; Genesis 7:15; Genesis 7:22 of the lower animals, but here there is clearly an allusion to Ezekiel 37:5; Ezekiel 37:10 (also 2 Kings 13:21), where the dead bones lived again."

2. "Entered into them (εισηλθεν εν αυτοις). Second aorist active indicative of εισερχομα with εν rather than εις after it (cf. Luke 9:46). The prophecy has here become fact (change from future πεμψουσιν to aorist εισηλθεν)."

3. "They stood upon their feet (εστησαν επ τους ποδας αυτων). Ingressive second aorist active indicative of ιστημ (intransitive). Reference to Ezekiel 37:10, but with the accusative in place of genitive there after επ as in 2 Kings 13:21."

### John Gill:
1. "This resurrection of the witnesses is not to be understood of a corporeal resurrection; for there is no reason to believe that there will be a resurrection of any particular saints until the general resurrection."
2. "A civil resurrection of them, or a resurrection of them as witnesses, when their spirits will revive, and they will take heart and courage again to appear for Christ."
3. "The Spirit of God will inspire these witnesses with fresh life and rigour, zeal and resolution; so that though they have been so long silent, lifeless, and dispirited, they shall now rise in high spirits, and bravely exert themselves in the cause of Christ."

### John Wesley:
1. "Great fear fell upon them" - This phrase signifies the awe and reverence that overcame those who witnessed the power and presence of God. It highlights the realization that God was actively involved in the situation, causing a sense of fear and respect for His authority.

2. "That saw them" - This emphasizes the visual impact of the events unfolding before their eyes. It suggests that the visible manifestation of God's power and presence was so undeniable that it left a lasting impression on those who witnessed it.

3. "Now knew that God was on their side" - This statement reveals the profound realization that God was not only present but also actively supporting and protecting His people. It conveys the assurance and confidence that comes from recognizing that the Almighty is on their side, instilling a sense of trust and security.
