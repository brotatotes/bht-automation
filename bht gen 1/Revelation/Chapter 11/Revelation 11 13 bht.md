# Revelation 11:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse described refers to a significant event in Jerusalem, contrary to popular belief that it references Rome. The conversion of a large portion of the city's inhabitants marks an important step towards fulfilling God's plan. The conversion is driven by a "blessed terror" that leads them to give glory to God, reflecting the transformative power of true conversion. This description sheds light on the identity of the city, the impact of the conversion, and the spiritual change experienced by its inhabitants.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Six is the number of the world power's greatest triumph, but at the same time verges on seven, the divine number, when its utter destruction takes place."
2. "Thus, in the Church-historical view, it is hereby implied that one of the ten apostate world kingdoms fall."
3. "The remnant, consisting of the Israelite inhabitants not slain, become in the flesh the loyal subjects of Christ reigning over the earth with His transfigured saints."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "An earthquake is a symbol of commotion, agitation, change; of great political revolutions, etc. The meaning here is, that the triumph of the witnesses, represented by their ascending to heaven, would be followed by such revolutions as would be properly symbolized by an earthquake."
2. "The word 'tenth' is probably used in a general sense to denote that a considerable portion of the persecuting power would be thus involved in ruin; that is, that in respect to that power there would be such a revolution, such a convulsion or commotion, such a loss, that it would be proper to represent it by an earthquake."
3. "All that seems to be meant by this is, that they stood in awe at what God was doing, and acknowledged his power in the changes that occurred. It does not mean, necessarily, that they would repent and become truly his friends, but that there would be a prevailing impression that these changes were produced by his power, and that his hand was in these things."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Earthquake." - This quote highlights the significance of the earthquake mentioned in Revelation 6:12, drawing attention to the specific event being discussed.

2. "Gave glory to the God of heaven." - This quote clarifies that giving glory to God in this context does not imply conversion or repentance, but rather recognition of His power and authority.

3. "The phrase signifies... recognition, which is its usual sense in scripture." - This quote explains the usual meaning of the phrase "gave glory" in scripture, emphasizing the importance of recognizing God's greatness.

These quotes provide insights into the earthquake mentioned in Revelation 6:12 and the act of giving glory to God, helping to deepen the reader's understanding of the verse.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The earthquake, the fall of the tenth part of the city, and the number 7000, must all be regarded as symbolical."
2. "When they who are thus affrighted give glory to the 'God of heaven,' they do so from no recognition of His heavenly character as compared with the wickedness of earth, but from the conviction which they have received of the irresistibleness of His power and the terror of His judgments."
3. "The two witnesses are believers who, amidst all the defection of others, remain faithful to their Lord. They are the true Divine seed within the outward Church, the little flock that listens only to the voice of the Good Shepherd and is led astray neither by the world nor hireling shepherds."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Earthquakes are often given as a symbol of great upheavals in social and spiritual order."
2. "Only the tenth of the city fell."
3. "A general movement toward Christianity, induced by fear or despair."

### John Gill:
1. "By 'the city' is meant the city of Rome, the great city, mentioned in Revelation 11:8; and by 'the tenth part' of it may be designed either Rome itself, which as it now is, according to the observation of some, is but a tenth part of what it was once."
2. "The Gospel daily gaining ground, and enlightening the minds of men, and freeing them from the slavery they were held in."
3. "These will be affected with the judgments of God upon others, and be made sensible of their danger, and of their deliverance, which will so work upon them, as to reform them from Popery."

### John Wesley:
1. "We have here an unanswerable proof that this city is not Babylon or Rome, but Jerusalem."
2. "And the rest â€” The remaining sixty-three thousand were converted: a grand step toward the fulfilling of the mystery of God."
3. "Blessed terror! And gave glory - The character of true conversion."

Note: The commentary is quite lengthy, so I have selected three quotes that provide insights into the identification of the city, the conversion of its inhabitants, and the character of true conversion.
