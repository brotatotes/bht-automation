# Revelation 11:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the final trumpet is sounded, signifying the completion of God's divine plan. The kingdoms of the world are now under the possession of our Lord and His Christ, ushering in a new era where God's reign is established on earth. This victorious takeover is celebrated in heaven with great voices and joyful praise. It marks the end of the age-long struggle against Satan, as Jesus rejects partnership with him and chooses to reign with divine authority. As God's people, we can rejoice in this ultimate victory and the establishment of His everlasting kingdom.

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Six is the number of the world given over to judgment. It is half of twelve, the Church's number, as three and a half is half of seven, the divine number for completeness."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "There was silence in heaven upon the opening of the seventh seal, but here 'great voices.' Perhaps the great voices are the ζωα of Revelation 4:6; Revelation 5:8."
2. "John understood what was said."
3. "This is the certain and glorious outcome of the age-long struggle against Satan, who wields the kingdom of the world which he offered to Christ on the mountain for one act of worship.

### John Gill:
1. "The days of the voice of this angel, as in Revelation 10:7, cannot refer to the times of Constantine; for though there was then a strange turn of affairs in favour of the kingdom of Christ, when there was a great spread of the Gospel, and large conversions in many places, and many churches were raised and formed in several countries, and the whole empire became Christian; yet this, as we have seen, came to pass under the sixth seal, before any of the trumpets were sounded, and much less this seventh and last; nor do they belong to the times of the Reformation in Germany."
2. "The kingdoms of this world are meant worldly kingdoms, which are set up by worldly power, and are supported by worldly policy, and subsist upon worldly principles and maxims; the government of which proceeds upon worldly ends and views; in distinction from the kingdom of Christ, which is not of this world, and is not supported by any such methods."
3. "Now will an open door be set, which none can shut; many will run to and fro, and knowledge will be increased; the earth will be covered with it, as the sea with waters; multitudes of souls everywhere will be converted; a nation will be born at once; churches will be set up in every place, which are Christ's kingdom, where he reigns, and where his subjects are, and his laws are put in execution; where his word will be now faithfully preached, his ordinances purely administered, and he, in his person, office, and grace, will be alone exalted."

### John Wesley:
1. "The allusion therefore in this and all the trumpets is to those used in festal solemnities."
2. "As soon as the seventh angel sounds, the kingdom falls to God and his Christ. This immediately appears in heaven, and is there celebrated with joyful praise."
3. "In the Old Testament, from Moses to Samuel, God himself was the King of his own people. And the same will be in the New Testament: he will himself reign over the Israel of God."
