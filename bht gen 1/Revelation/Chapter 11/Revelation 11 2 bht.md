# Revelation 11:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the commentators provide insights into the meaning of the passage. The court, which is not to be measured, symbolizes the false members of the church, those who bear no fruit. The reference to the Gentiles in the outer court signifies the spreading influence of the church to the nations. The mention of the holy city being trampled upon refers to the future tribulations and challenges faced by the Christian church. Ultimately, the verse portrays a distinction between true worshippers and false believers, as well as the trials faced by the church throughout history.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The court...outside the Holy Place...is not to be measured; whereas the Holy Place is." 
2. "The different epochs marked by the 2300, 1335, 1290, and 1260 days, will not be fully cleared up till the grand consummation."
3. "The three and a half, in a word, marks the time in which the earthly rules over the heavenly kingdom."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "In forming an estimate of those who, according to the Hebrew notions, were true worshippers of God, only those would be regarded as such who had the privilege of access to the inner court, and to the altar."
2. "The interpretation would demand that they should sustain some relation to the church, or that they would seem to belong to it - as the court did to the temple; but still that this was in appearance only, and that in estimating the true church it was necessary to leave them out altogether."
3. "The language clearly is symbolical, and the reference must have been to something pertaining to the church. And, if the preceding exposition of the tenth chapter is correct, then it may be presumed that this would refer to something that was to occur at about the period there referred to."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The court which is without the temple. Not merely the outer court, or Court of the Gentiles, but including all that is not within the naov, the Holy and Most Holy places." 

2. "Unto the Gentiles [τοις εθνεσιν]. See on Luke 2:32. Rev., nations." 

3. "Forty and two months. A period which appears in three forms in Revelation: forty - two months (ch. 13 5); twelve hundred and sixty days (ver. 3, ch. 12 6); a time, times and half a time, or three years and a half (12, 14, compare Daniel 7:25; Daniel 12:7)."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The court which is without the temple includes every part of the precincts not belonging to the Holy and Most Holy place; and this fact, together with the instruction ‘cast it out,’ shows that it symbolizes not the world but the false members of the Church, the branches of the vine that bear no fruit."
2. "The sense, whatever it be, is metaphorical, as in the case of the ‘temple,’ the ‘altar,’ and the ‘court.’ Jerusalem was the place which God had originally designed to be the residence of His people. In idea and in name it was still that place, but it had been profaned by too many of its citizens."
3. "The main question is, What do they symbolize? First of all it is obvious that 3 1/2 must be regarded as the half of 7. It is indeed expressly presented to us in this light in Daniel 9:27 where it is said, ‘and he shall confirm the covenant with many for one week; and in the midst of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and the oblation to cease.’ The middle of the week is the half of 7, or 3 1/2. Hence the general meaning may be learned with an approach to certainty. Seven is the number of the covenant with its fulness of peace and joy and glory: three and a half is that number broken, incomplete, looking forward to something else."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "This outer court is left to its fate." 
2. "John is to cast it out and leave to its fate (given to the Gentiles in another sense) to be profaned by them."
3. "They shall tread under foot, trample with contempt as in Luke 21:24, even the holy city."

### John Gill:
1. "This outward court, or the worshippers in it, intend a distinct set of worshippers from the internal worshippers, the priests of God in the temple, altar, and inner court, and from the Gentiles, the Papists; and are no other than carnal Protestants, the bulk of the reformed churches, who have only the name, but not the nature of living Christians."
2. "The bulk of the reformed churches, the crowd of outward court worshippers, will be gained over to the Popish party, and fall off to the church of Rome, to which their doctrines and practices are plainly verging."
3. "The holy city" is meant all the kingdoms of Europe, or what has been called Christendom, the western empire as Christian, the main seat of the Christian religion, or all the churches styled Christian."


### John Wesley:
1. "The old temple had a court in the open air, for the heathens who worshipped the God of Israel."
2. "And they shall tread...the holy city - Jerusalem."
3. "But that severe kind of treading which is here peculiarly spoken of, will not be till under the trumpet of the seventh angel, and toward the end of the troublous times."
