# Revelation 11:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, two witnesses, depicted as the two olive trees and candlesticks, stand before God. They possess the power to prophesy and perform acts reminiscent of Moses and Elijah. These witnesses symbolize the ministers and churches of Christ who have testified against antichrist and upheld the truth of the Gospel amidst corrupt and idolatrous influences. Clad in sackcloth, they bear witness to Christ's message while enduring suffering and opposition. This verse reflects the deep connection between the life of Jesus and the profound themes of the Apocalypse, conveying the enduring significance of Christ's teachings.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The two witnesses are described as 'the two olive trees' and 'the two candlesticks,' or lamp-stands, 'standing before the God of the earth.' The reference is to Zechariah 4:3; Zechariah 4:12, where two individuals are meant, Joshua and Zerubbabel, who ministered to the Jewish Church, just as the two olive trees emptied the oil out of themselves into the bowl of the candlestick."
2. "The actions of the two witnesses are just those of Moses when witnessing for God against Pharaoh, turning the waters into blood, and smiting with plagues; and of Elijah causing fire by his word to devour the enemy, and shutting heaven, so that it rained not for three years and six months, the very time during which the two witnesses prophesy."
3. "The sackcloth of the witnesses is a catch word linking this episode under the sixth trumpet, with the sun black as sackcloth (in righteous retribution on the apostates who rejected God's witnesses) under the sixth seal."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The meaning is not that he would send two witnesses to prophesy, but rather that these were in fact such 'witnesses,' and that he would during that time permit them to exercise their prophetic gifts, or give them the privilege and the strength to enunciate the truth which they were commissioned to communicate as his 'witnesses' to mankind."
2. "Perhaps the meaning is, that as, under the law, two witnesses were required, and were enough, to establish any fact, such a number would during those times be preserved from apostasy as would be sufficient to keep up the evidence of truth; to testify against the prevailing abominations, errors, and corruptions; to show what was the real church, and to bear a faithful witness against the wickedness of the world."
3. "The word, as used here, refers to those who, during this period of 'forty and two months,' would thus be witnesses for Christ in the world; that is, who would bear their testimony to the truth of his religion, to the doctrines which he had revealed, and to what was required of man - who would do this amidst surrounding error and corruption, and when exposed to persecutions and trials on account of their belief."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The conception of the Apocalypse is powerfully molded by John's recollections of the life of Jesus."
2. "There is a close parallelism between the Apocalypse and the delineation of the life of Christ contained in the fourth Gospel."
3. "The Apocalypse is, in the deeper conceptions which pervade it, a repetition of the Gospel."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The use of the word my connected with the two witnesses seems to indicate that it is the Lord who speaks." 
2. "The witnesses receive both the words of their prophecy and the power to utter them."
3. "The clothing with sackcloth...indicates the sufferings which the witnesses shall endure in delivering their message."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "The idiom that follows is Hebraic instead of either the infinitive after διδωμ as in Revelation 2:7; Revelation 3:21; Revelation 6:4; Revelation 7:2; Revelation 13:7; Revelation 13:15; Revelation 16:8 or ινα with the subjunctive (Revelation 9:5; Revelation 19:8) we have κα προφητευσουσιν (and they shall prophesy)."
2. "The article seems to point to two well-known characters, like Elijah, Elisha, but there is no possible way to determine who they are. All sorts of identifications have been attempted."
3. "The dress suited the message (Matthew 11:21)."



### John Gill:
1. "By whom are meant, not Enoch and Elias, as some of the ancient fathers thought, who, they supposed, would come before the appearance of Christ, and oppose antichrist, and be slain by him, which sense the Papists greedily catch at."
2. "These witnesses intend the ministers of the Gospel and churches of Christ, who have bore testimony for Christ, and against antichrist, ever since he appeared in the world."
3. "Though they ought not to be considered exclusive of other ministers and churches, who also have bore, and still do bear a witness for Christ, and against the idolatries of the church of Rome."

### John Wesley:
1. "And I — Christ. Will give to my two witnesses — These seem to be two prophets; two select, eminent instruments."
2. "To prophesy twelve hundred and sixty days — Common days, that is, an hundred and eighty weeks."
3. "Clothed in sackcloth — The habit of the deepest mourners, out of sorrow and concern for the people."
