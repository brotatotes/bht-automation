# Revelation 11:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this visionary passage, two candlesticks stand before the Lord as representatives of the Church, drawing their light from the Spirit and the twofold Word. Preaching in sackcloth, they symbolize the ignominious treatment endured by the Word and Christ Himself. These candlesticks are connected to the two olive trees, which serve as sources of grace and spiritual nourishment for God's people. Just as the olive trees provide oil for the lamps, these anointed ones bring forth the oil of grace, shining as burning and shining lights, always waiting on God and asserting His authority over all things.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "They are 'the two candlesticks,' not that they are the Church, the one candlestick, but as its representative light-bearers." 
2. "The Church in both dispensations has no light in herself, but derives it from the Spirit through the witness of the twofold word, the two olive trees." 
3. "The two witnesses preach in sackcloth, marking the ignominious treatment which the word, like Christ Himself, receives from the world."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The olive-trees, or olive-branches, appear in the vision of the prophet to have been connected with the ever-burning lamp by golden pipes; and as the olive-tree produced the oil used by the ancients in their lamps, these trees are represented as furnishing a constant supply of oil through the golden pipes to the candlestick, and thus they become emblematic of the supply of grace to the church."
2. "The sense would appear to be that it was through the pastors of the churches that the oil of grace which maintained the brightness of those mystic candlesticks, or the churches, was conveyed."
3. "The meaning is, that they stood, as it were, in the very presence of God - as, in the tabernacle and temple, the golden candlestick stood 'before' the ark on which was the symbol of the divine presence, though separated from it by a veil."
