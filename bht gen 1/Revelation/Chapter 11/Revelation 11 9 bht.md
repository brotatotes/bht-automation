# Revelation 11:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we see the depiction of a significant event where different groups of people witness the exposed bodies of the witnesses. The commentators highlight how these spectators come from various nations and tribes, expressing joy, scorn, and contempt. The verse also emphasizes the duration of this spectacle, lasting for three and a half days, mirroring the prophetic timeline. While the witnesses' condition is deplorable and discomforting, the onlookers revel in their apparent defeat, displaying a fiendish and childish delight.
