# Revelation 12:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this enigmatic vision, the Church shines brightly as a celestial body, adorned with divine light. She stands in bold authority, triumphantly surpassing the earthly realm, symbolizing her superiority over the kingdom of God. The moon, a metaphor for the Jewish dispensation, is placed beneath her feet, signifying the Church's ascendance. As her crown of victory, the stars represent the twelve tribes or apostles, a testament to her power and divine authority. Cloaked in radiant brilliance, the Church reveals a mature and resolute figure, grounded in the supernatural and indifferent to the transient world.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "The Church, Israel first, and then the Gentile Church; clothed with Christ, 'the Sun of righteousness.' 'Fair as the moon, clear as the sun.' Clothed with the Sun, the Church is the bearer of divine supernatural light in the world." 
2. "The moon, though standing above the sea and earth, is altogether connected with them and is an earthly light: sea, earth, and moon represent the worldly element, in opposition to the kingdom of God—heaven, the sun." 
3. "The sun, moon, and twelve stars, are emblematical of Jacob, Leah, or else Rachel, and the twelve patriarchs, that is, the Jewish Church: secondarily, the Church universal, having under her feet, in due subordination, the ever changing moon, which shines with a borrowed light, emblem of the Jewish dispensation."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The word 'wonder' - σημεῖον sēmeion - properly means something extraordinary, or miraculous, and is commonly rendered 'sign.'"
2. "The woman, beyond all question, represents the church."
3. "Is the fact that she stood upon the moon, or that it was under her feet, designed to denote the superiority of the gospel to the Jewish dispensation?"

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The symbol is usually taken to represent the Church."
2. "Clothed [περιβεβλημενη] . Rev., better, arrayed."
3. "The moon under her feet. See Song of Solomon 6:10."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The immense body of light constituting the sun is her garment."
2. "The idea appears to be that the woman is completely enveloped in light."
3. "The stars are not set as jewels in her crown. They are her crown, a crown of victory."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "The first 'sign in heaven' is a Woman--the earliest appearance of a female figure in the Apocalyptic vision."
2. "The metaphor of childbirth is common enough."
3. "The figure is a bold one with the moon 'under her feet' and 'a crown of twelve stars', a possible allusion to the twelve tribes or to the twelve apostles."

### John Gill:
1. "This vision was seen 'in heavens', whither John was called up to... an emblem of the state of the church on earth."
2. "The church apostolical is here called 'a woman', because the church was not now in its infancy... but grown up, mature, and at full age."
3. "And the moon under her feet... signifies the church's contempt of, and trampling upon all worldly things, which are changeable, perishing, and passing away."
