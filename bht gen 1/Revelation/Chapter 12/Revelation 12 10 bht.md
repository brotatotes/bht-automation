# Revelation 12:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Now that Satan has been cast out of heaven, the ulterior sense of this verse refers to the eve of Christ's second coming. The oppressed Church, God's own elect, should cry day and night unto Him for salvation and deliverance from the power of Satan. This power of Satan, known for being the accuser of the righteous, is now overcome by God's power and authority through His anointed one, Christ. This illustrious appearance of the Kingdom of God is a pledge of the greatness of the everlasting kingdom to come.
