# Revelation 12:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this mysterious verse, we find a depiction of the Church, symbolized as a woman, being protected by two wings. These wings are not just any wings, but they represent the eastern and western divisions of the mighty Roman Empire. The Church, during a time of persecution, found refuge and spread rapidly across various regions. It is clear that the verse emphasizes the endurance and strength of the Church, even amidst tribulations, as it perseveres on its journey, supported by the divine wings of protection and guidance.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Alluding to Revelation 12:14, the commentary suggests that the Old Testament Church, as well as the New Testament Church, is included in 'the woman.' All believers are included."
2. "The flight of the woman into the wilderness represents the passing of the kingdom of God from the Jews to the Gentiles. This is similar to Mary's flight with her child from Judea into Egypt."
3. "The Church's journey in the wilderness, lasting for forty-two months or 1260 days, is seen as a period of protection and oppression by the world power. It is a time of sojourning before reaching the millennial rest."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The church, when exposed to this form of persecution, would be protected as if miraculously supplied with wings."
2. "The church, in the opposition which would come upon it, would find a refuge."
3. "During all the time of the continuance of that formidable, persecuting power, the true church would not in fact become extinct."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The two wings." (The definite article aiJ the should be added : "the two wings.") This emphasizes the specific nature of the wings mentioned in the verse, drawing a parallel with other biblical references that use the definite article to signify a particular set of wings.

2. "The great eagle." (The article does not point to the eagle of ch. 8 13, but is generic.) This clarifies that the article used in the verse does not refer to a specific eagle mentioned in a previous chapter, but rather serves as a generic reference to an eagle.

3. "A time and times and half a time." (Three years and a half.) This provides a clear interpretation of the phrase, explaining that it signifies a period of three and a half years. This reference to another verse in Revelation further supports this understanding.

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "The griffon or vulture rather than the true eagle is pictured." 
2. "For the eagle in the O.T. see Exodus 19:4; Isaiah 40:31; Job 9:26; Proverbs 24:54." 
3. "To the end of the present order the Church dwells in the wilderness."

### John Gill:
1. "By which are meant, not the two testaments, by which she was supported under afflictions, trials, and persecutions, and against Satan and all his efforts; nor the two graces of faith and hope, by which she rose, and dwelt on high, in the view of invisible things, and with contempt of the world, its frowns or flatteries."
2. "rather these two wings of the eagle design the eastern and western divisions of the Roman empire: it is not unusual in Scripture for a monarchy, or monarch, as the Assyrian king and kingdom, to be signified by an eagle, and the wings of eagles."
3. "In a word, these wings may denote the swiftness in which the church proceeded to disappear, having lost her former simplicity and glory for which eagles' wings are famous, Proverbs 23:5; and more especially that divine strength and support by which she was bore up, and carried through, and delivered out of sore afflictions and persecutions; see Isaiah 40:31."

### John Wesley:
1. "The great eagle is the Roman empire; the two wings, the eastern and western branches of it."
2. "After the beginning of the twelve hundred and sixty days, or rather of the third woe, Christianity was exceedingly propagated, in the midst of various persecutions."
3. "This place contained many countries; so that Christianity now reached, in an uninterrupted tract, from the eastern to the western empire; and both the emperors now lent their wings to the woman, and provided a safe abode for her."
