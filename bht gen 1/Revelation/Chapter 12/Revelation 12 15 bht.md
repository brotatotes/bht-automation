### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Water as a river," accusative case after εβαλεν (cast). The serpent could not follow the woman or stop her flight and so sought to drown her.
2. That he might cause her to be carried away by the stream (ινα αυτην ποταμοφορητον ποιηση). Purpose clause with ινα and the first aorist active subjunctive of ποιεω.
3. This compound verbal ποταμοφορητον in the predicate accusative (ποταμος, river, φορητον from φορεω, to bear) was not coined by John, but occurs in a papyrus of B.C. 110 and in several others after N.T. times. It means simply "carried away by the river."

### John Gill:
1. "Such as the Arian heresy, which denied the divinity of Christ; the Nestorian heresy, which divided his person; and the Eutychian heresy, which confounded the two natures in him; and the Macedonian heresy, which took away the deity of the Holy Ghost; and the Pelagian heresy, which destroyed the grace of God, and set up the power of man's free will."
2. "And this flood of errors and heresies may be truly said to be cast out of the serpent's mouth; since the old serpent, the devil, is the father of all lies, and errors."
3. "But rather, as the words of a man's mouth are as deep waters, Proverbs 18:4; and doctrines, good or bad, may be so called; that flood of errors and heresies, which were poured in between the times of Constantine and the rise of antichrist may be here intended."
