# Revelation 12:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In a time of persecution, the earth itself acted as a protector to the woman, shielding her from harm and interposing on her behalf. By swallowing up the flood of attacks that the dragon unleashed, the earth demonstrated its power to overcome and resist the enemy's onslaught. This act of divine intervention occurred unexpectedly, akin to a sudden chasm opening to absorb an impetuous stream. It is through these remarkable events that the earth showcased its capacity to support and defend the woman against adversity.

### John Gill:
1. "And the earth helped the woman,.... By opening itself, and taking in what the serpent cast out, so that it could not reach the woman, and annoy her."
2. "And swallowed up the flood which the dragon cast out of his mouth; if the flood refers to the Arian persecution, then the earth helping the woman, the church, and swallowing up this flood, may respect the Goths, who broke into the Roman provinces, under their king, Athanaricus, and fell upon the Arians, with great rage and cruelty."
3. "But if, by the flood, the errors and heresies of those times are meant, then the councils may be intended by the earth; which, though they consisted of men that were earthly, and greatly apostatized in other things, yet opposed, refuted, and condemned these heresies and errors, and so were the means of preserving the church from them."
