# Revelation 12:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
"The enraged devil, having failed to eradicate the Christian Church, unleashes his fury on those who remain faithful to God's commandments and hold fast to the testimony of Jesus. This relentless warfare targets not only the institutional Church, but also individual believers, symbolizing the ongoing persecution against true followers of Christ. The spiritual offspring of the church, who bear the testimony of Jesus Christ, become the objects of his wrath as he seeks to disrupt and destroy their faith."
