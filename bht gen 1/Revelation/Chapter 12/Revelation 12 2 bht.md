### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "tormented" (basanizomene) - DE BURGH explains this of the bringing in of the first-begotten into the world AGAIN, when Israel shall at last welcome Him.
2. "the man-child shall rule all nations with the rod of iron" - a reference to Christ's second coming to the Jewish Church, the believing remnant of Israel.
3. "almost without travail-pangs, she receives (at His second advent), as if born to her, Messiah and a numerous seed" - the Jewish Church will receive the Messiah and a numerous seed, almost effortlessly, at His second coming.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The woman is evidently designed to symbolize the church; and in this there is a pretty general agreement among interpreters."
2. "The other opinion is, that the woman here refers to the Christian church, and that the object is to represent that church as about to be enlarged."
3. "The design of the whole, therefore, I apprehend, is to represent the peril of the church at the time when it was about to be greatly enlarged, or in a season of prosperity, from the rise of a formidable enemy that would stand ready to destroy it."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Travailing in birth [ωδινουσα]. See on sorrows, Mark 13:9, and pains, Acts 2:24." 
2. "In pain [βασανιζομενη]. Lit., being tormented. See on ch. Revelation 11:10, and references." 
3. "For the imagery compare Isaiah 66:7, Isaiah 66:8; John 16:21."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "To the question, Who is this woman? different answers have been given. We need not dwell upon them. In one sense or another she must be the Church of God, yet not the mere Jewish Church, but the Church in the largest conception that we can form of it, as first indeed planted in Israel but afterwards extended to all nations."
2. "If it be objected that Christ bears the Church, not the Church Christ, it may be sufficient to reply that there is a sense in which Christ may truly be called the Son of the Church. He is the flower of the Chosen Family, as concerning the flesh He comes of Israel."
3. "The Church, therefore, may properly be described by images taken from the history of Christ’s own mother and of His own nativity."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "And she was with child (κα εν γαστρ εχουσα). This is the technical idiom for pregnancy."

3. "And in pain (κα βασανιζομενη). 'And tormented,' only here in N.T. in sense of childbirth."

### John Gill:
1. "Expressive of the fruitfulness of the church in bearing and bringing forth many souls to Christ."
2. "Denote the earnest cries and fervent prayers of the members of the church, and the laborious and painful ministrations of the preachers of the Gospel."
3. "The sore and grievous persecutions which attended the apostles of Christ, and succeeding ministers of the word, throughout the times of the ten Roman emperors."

### John Wesley:
1. "The very pain, without any outward opposition, would constrain a woman in travail to cry out."
2. "These cries, throes, and pains to be delivered, were the painful longings, the sighs, and prayers of the saints for the coming of the kingdom of God."
3. "The woman groaned and travailed in spirit, that Christ might appear, as the Shepherd and King of all nations."
