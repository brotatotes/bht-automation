# Revelation 12:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Bible verse being described depicts a powerful and cunning entity, identified as a dragon, with fiery rage and a murderous nature. This dragon is associated with the color red, symbolizing its bloodthirstiness and destructive tendencies. It possesses seven heads, representing its dominion over various powers, and ten horns, signifying its control over worldly instruments of authority. Despite its formidability, the dragon remains an enemy of God and threatens the existence of the church. Its strength and power are emphasized, but it is ultimately unable to conquer.

### John Gill:
1. "The Roman Pagan empire, as under the influence of Satan, the god of this world, is fitly compared to a 'dragon', for its policy and cunning in circumventing and ensnaring the professors of Christianity; and for its cruelty and inhumanity in persecuting them; and for its poison of idolatry, will worship, and superstition." 

2. "The 'seven heads' of the Roman empire either design the seven mountains, or hills, on which Rome, the metropolis of the empire, was built, or rather the seven forms of government which successively should obtain in the empire, as kings, consuls, decemvirs, dictators, tribunes, emperors, and popes." 

3. "By the 'ten horns' are meant either the ten kingdoms which should hereafter arise out of the Roman empire, and whose kings should give their kingdoms to the beast; or the ten Roman emperors, the persecutors of the Christians; or rather the ten provinces, or jurisdictions, which the empire was divided into while Pagan."

### John Wesley:
1. "His fiery-red colour denoting his disposition."
2. "Implying vast wisdom."
3. "Emblems of mighty power and strength, which he still retained."
