# Revelation 12:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the imagery of a dragon with a powerful tail dragging down the stars is used to convey the idea of persuasion and apostasy. The dragon symbolizes the influence of power and evil, seeking to devour and destroy. It is contrasted with the woman who represents life and the birth of something significant, which the dragon seeks to destroy. There is a struggle between good and evil, where the dragon's influence attempts to hinder the fulfillment of God's plan.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The main idea here undoubtedly is that of power, and the object of John is to show that the power of the dragon was as if it extended to the stars, and as if it dragged down a third part of them to the earth, or swept them away with its tail, leaving two-thirds unaffected."
2. "A power that would sweep them all away would be universal; a power that would sweep away one-third only would represent a dominion of that extent only."
3. "Suppose, then, that the dragon here was designed to represent the Roman pagan power; suppose that it referred to that power about to engage in the work of persecution, and at a time when the church was about to be greatly enlarged, and to fill the world; suppose that it referred to a time when but one-third part of the Roman world was subject to pagan influence, and the remaining two-thirds were, for some cause, safe from this influence - all the conditions here referred to would be fulfilled."
