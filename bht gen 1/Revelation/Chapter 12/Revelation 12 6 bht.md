The verse being described is a symbolic portrayal of the Church's journey throughout history. The Church is depicted as a woman who finds solace and protection in a wilderness, which represents a time of obscurity and persecution.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "The heathen world, the wilderness, could not nourish the Church, but only afford her an outward shelter."
2. "During the whole Church-historic period, or 'times of the Gentiles,' wherein 'Jerusalem is trodden down of the Gentiles,' there is no believing Jewish Church, and therefore, only the Christian Church can be 'the woman.'"
3. "They are equivalent to three and a half years, which, as half of the divine number seven, symbolize the seeming victory of the world over the Church."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The true church became for a time obscure and unknown - as if it had fled away from the habitations of people, and had retired to the solitude and loneliness of a desert."
2. "During that time the true church, though obscure and almost unknown, would be the object of the divine protection and care - a beautiful representation of the church during the corruptions of the papacy and the darkness of the middle ages."
3. "The church during that time would find true friends, and would be kept alive."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Of God, the preposition marking the source from which the preparation came."
2. "The preposition 'of' indicates that the preparation came directly from God."
3. "This use of the preposition 'of' is similar to its use in James 1:13, where it signifies being tempted by God."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The flight of Elijah into the wilderness, perhaps even the temptation of our Lord there, is present to the writer’s mind; and the words are applicable to the condition of the Church during her whole pilgrimage state in the present world."
2. "Strictly speaking, the woman in Revelation 12:1-6 is neither the Jewish nor the Christian Church. She is light from Him ‘who is light, and with whom there is no darkness at all,’ light which had been always shining before it was partially embodied either in the Church of the old or the new covenant."
3. "The dragon is ideal darkness, the power of sin before it begins its deadly warfare against the children of God."


### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "God's people do not at once share the rapture of Christ, but the dragon is unable to destroy them completely."
2. "The phrases used here seem to be reminiscent of various biblical events, such as the flight of Joseph and Mary to Egypt."
3. "The phrase 'prepared of God' marks the source as God and anticipates the symbolism repeated in Revelation 12:13."

Note: The provided commentary is quite technical and specific, making it challenging to extract short quotes that stand alone and enrich the reader's understanding of the verse.

### John Gill:
1. "This does not design the flight of the Christians from Jerusalem to Pella, a little before the destruction of the former; nor the expulsion of the Jews or Christians from Rome, either by Claudius or by Nero; but the disappearance of the true church, and its obscure state and condition quickly after the above advance of it." 

2. "God has had, and will have a church in the worst of times; as he reserved a number in Elijah's time, so he did in the times of the antichristian apostasy, who bowed not the knee to idolatry."

3. "The wilderness is a place of retirement and safety, as well as of obscurity; and if any particular place is pointed at, I should think the valleys of Piedmont, which lie between France and Italy, are intended, where God has preserved, and continued a set of witnesses to the truth, in a succession, from the beginning of the apostasy to the present time."

### John Wesley:
1. "This wilderness is undoubtedly on earth, where the woman also herself is now supposed to be."
2. "In this wilderness, God had already prepared a place; that is, made it safe and convenient for her."
3. "So long the woman enjoyed a safe and convenient place in Europe, which was chiefly Bohemia; where she was fed, till God provided for her more plentifully at the Reformation."
