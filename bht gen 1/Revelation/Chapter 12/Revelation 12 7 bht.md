## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The casting down of Satan from the office of accuser in heaven was evidently connected with the great justifying work of redemption. His voice is heard before God no more: the day of acceptance in Christ Jesus has dawned."
2. "The conflict then is that between Satan and the church. Its first great incident is the birth and triumph of the Son of God and of man."
3. "If we are disposed to carry out this idea, we might see the great realization of the flight into the wilderness in the final severance of the Eastern and Western churches in the seventh century, and the flood cast after the woman by the dragon in the irruption of the Mahometan armies."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "When Christ appeared before God as our Advocate, Satan, the accusing adversary, could no longer appear before God against us, but was cast out judicially." 
2. "Michael and his angels . . . the dragon . . . and his angels—It was fittingly ordered that, as the rebellion arose from unfaithful angels and their leader, so they should be encountered and overcome by faithful angels and their archangel, in heaven." 
3. "The conflict on earth, as in Luke 19:38- :, has its correspondent conflict of angels in heaven."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "There was a state of things existing in regard to the woman and the child - the church in the condition in which it would then be - which would be well represented by a war in heaven; that is, by a conflict between the powers of good and evil, of light and darkness."
2. "There is a vision of the persecuted church - of the woman fleeing into the desert - and the course of the narrative is here interrupted by going back to describe the conflict which led to this result, and the fact that Satan, as it were cast out of heaven, and unable to achieve a victory there, was suffered to vent his malice against the church on earth."
3. "Michael, the archangel, is here represented as the guardian of the church, and as contending against Satan for its protection. This representation accords with the usual statements in the Bible respecting the interposition of the angels in behalf of the church, and is one which cannot be proved to be unfounded."

1. "Not in the third heaven, the habitation of God, the seat of the angels and glorified saints, there is no discord, jars, and contentions there, nothing but peace, love, and joy."
2. "The phrase of war in heaven is not unknown to the Jews; they say when Pharaoh pursued after Israel, there was war above and below, and there was a very fierce war in heaven."
3. "Jesus Christ, who is equal with God, is his fellow, is one with the Father, and in whom the fulness of the Godhead dwells bodily: he is the Archangel, the first of the chief princes, the head of all principality and power, who is on the side of the Lord's people, pleads their cause, defends their persons, and saves them."

### John Wesley:
1. "And there was war in heaven — Here Satan makes his grand opposition to the kingdom of God; but an end is now put to his accusing the saints before God."
2. "That Michael is a created angel, appears from his not daring, in disputing with Satan, Jude 9, to bring a railing accusation; but only saying, 'The Lord rebuke thee.'"
3. "And this modesty is implied in his very name; for Michael signifies, 'Who is like God?' which implies also his deep reverence toward God, and distance from all self-exaltation."
