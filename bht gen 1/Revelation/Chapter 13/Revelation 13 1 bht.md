# Revelation 13:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Upon the shores of an unsettled sea, a power rises, symbolized by a beast with ten horns and seven heads. It represents the divided and united Roman empire, manifested in the Papacy. This critical moment marks the completion of God's mysterious plan for a sinful world, where the Church, undivided by nationality, awaits triumph over the brutal forces that oppose Christ and His true ideal. This beast, with blasphemous titles assumed by Roman emperors, challenges both the weak efforts of the dragon and the strength of the woman's seed.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Man becomes 'brutish' when he severs himself from God, the archetype and true ideal, in whose image he was first made, which ideal is realized by the man Christ Jesus."
2. "The seven implies the world power setting up itself as God, and caricaturing the seven Spirits of God; yet its true character as God-opposed is detected by the number ten accompanying the seven."
3. "The seven heads are the seven world monarchies, Egypt, Assyria, Babylon, Persia, Greece, Rome, the Germanic empire, under the last of which we live."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The sea itself, as compared with the land, represents an agitated or unsettled state of things, and we should naturally look for that in the rise of the power here referred to."
2. "The beast here is evidently a symbol of some power or kingdom that would arise in future times."
3. "The representation here is of Rome, or the one Roman power, contemplated as made up of ten subordinate kingdoms, and therefore subsequently to the invasion of the Northern hordes, and to the time when the papacy was about to rise."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Beast [θηριον] . Properly rendered."
2. "Ten horns. Compare Daniel 7:7."
3. "On each head a name."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The Church of Christ is not thus divided by St. John into two parts. He takes his figures, indeed, at one moment from Judaism, at another from Gentilism, but it is always one Church that he has in view, in which there is neither Jew nor Greek." 
2. "The course of events, too, under the seven Bowls is so strictly parallel, though at the same time climactic, to that under the seven Trumpets, that it is impossible to regard the former in any other light than as a series of visions directed to the same object and filled with substantially the same meaning." 
3. "The moment is thus far more critical than any at which we have previously stood. The purposes of the Almighty are now to be fully accomplished. The whole mystery of His dealings with a sinful world to which He has offered salvation is about to end."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "He stopped" on his way to war with the rest of the woman's seed. 
2. The Roman Empire seems to be meant here. 
3. The meaning is made plain by the blasphemous titles assumed by the Roman emperors in the first and second centuries.

### John Gill:
1. "And I stood upon the sand of the sea" - The sand may signify a multitude of people employed by the dragon, and also denote the weakness and failure of his efforts in the end.
2. "And saw a beast rise up out of the sea" - This beast is not the devil or the old Roman empire, but rather the Roman empire divided into ten kingdoms and united in the Papacy, or Christ in his secular power with the ten kings.
3. "Having seven heads" - The seven heads may refer to the seven mountains on which Rome was built, the seven-fold form of government among the Romans, or the seven capital cities of the empire. It represents the same Roman monarchy in a different form.

### John Wesley:
1. "Be armed both against force and fraud, even with the whole armour of God."
2. "The beast is the Romish Papacy, as it came to a point six hundred years since, stands now, and will for some time longer."
3. "The Pope raised himself above the emperor...the Pope began himself, under a spiritual pretext, to act the emperor of the whole Christian world."
