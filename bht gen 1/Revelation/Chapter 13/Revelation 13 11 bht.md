# Revelation 13:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, a powerful and persecuting sacerdotal authority is described, which is both physical and political, as well as spiritual. It rises from a perturbed state of affairs, appearing gentle and meek like a lamb, but with a hidden haughtiness and arrogance. This power professes religious truth but speaks with the fierce and murderous voice of a dragon. It is an antichrist figure, pretending to humility, performing miracles, and enforcing idolatry through tyranny and cruelty. This beast, although appearing differently, is fundamentally the same as the previous one, embodying both worldly power and worldly wisdom.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "The sacerdotal persecuting power, pagan and Christian; the pagan priesthood making an image of the emperors which they compelled Christians to worship, and working wonders by magic and omens; the Romish priesthood, the inheritors of pagan rites, images, and superstitions, lamb-like in Christian professions, dragon-like in word and act."
2. "The second beast's, or false prophet's rise, coincides in time with the healing of the beast's deadly wound and its revival."
3. "The first beast is physical and political; the second a spiritual power, the power of knowledge, ideas, and scientific cultivation. Both alike are beasts, from below, not from above; faithful allies, worldly Antichristian wisdom standing in the service of the worldly Antichristian power: the dragon is both lion and serpent: might and cunning are his armory."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The former was represented as rising up out of the sea...indicating that the power was to rise from a perturbed or unsettled state of affairs - like the ocean. This, from what was more settled and stable - as the land is more firm than the waters."
2. "In some respects he resembled a lamb; that is, he seemed to be a mild, gentle, inoffensive animal. It is hardly necessary to say that this is a most striking representation of the actual manner in which the power of the papacy has always been put forth - putting on the apparent gentleness of the lamb."
3. "The meaning here is, that he spoke in a harsh, haughty, proud, arrogant tone - as we should suppose a dragon would if he had the power of utterance. The general sense is, that while this 'beast' had, in one respect in its resemblance to a lamb - the appearance of great gentleness, meekness, and kindness, it had, in another respect, a haughty, imperious, and arrogant spirit."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The contrast between the ‘sea’ spoken of in Revelation 13:1 and the ‘earth’ now mentioned makes it impossible to refer the latter to any one particular portion of the world, such as the Asiatic Continent, or even to the whole world itself, or to human society and its progress, or to earthly thinking and willing."
2. "The lamb-like form of the horns can only be a travesty of the seven horns of ‘the Lamb’ spoken of in these visions (chap. Revelation 5:6); and the number two is not to be understood literally."
3. "The beast professed to teach religious truth; but his mode of teaching was fierce and murderous, the very opposite of that of Him who did not strive nor cry aloud, neither did any one hear His voice in the streets."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Another beast, like the first beast, not a different beast." 
2. "He had only two horns, not ten like the first."
3. "He spake as a dragon, with the roar of a dragon and the looks of a lamb."

### John Gill:
1. "The same antichrist, but appearing in another light and view."
2. "Pretending great humility and holiness, showing signs and lying wonders, obliging to idolatry, and exercising tyranny and cruelty on all that will not profess his religion."
3. "He affected a lamb-like disposition, pretended to great humility and meekness, calling himself 'servus servorum', the servant of servants, to cover his pride, ambition, and tyranny."
