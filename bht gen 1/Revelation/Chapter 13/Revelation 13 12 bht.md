# Revelation 13:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse being described in these commentaries refers to the power and influence of the second beast, closely linked to the first, exercising spiritual dominion in the world. It is believed to represent a new authority rising from the same place as the old power, sustaining and ministering to it. The aspects of this power include making war on the saints, ruling over consciences, and subjecting nations to its temporal authority, all seen as a continuation of the influence of the first beast.
