# Revelation 13:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, it is described that a powerful figure performs great signs and miracles, even making fire come down from heaven. These signs are not genuine, but rather deceptive and false. The purpose of these miracles is to establish a claim to supernatural power and influence over the world. These pretended signs aim to mimic the miraculous acts of the past, such as calling down fire from heaven, as done by prophets like Elijah. These false miracles are performed with the intention of deceiving and captivating those who witness them.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "wonders—Greek, 'signs.'"
2. "so great that."
3. "maketh fire—Greek, 'maketh even fire.' This is the very miracle which the two witnesses perform, and which Elijah long ago had performed; this the beast from the bottomless pit, or the false prophet, mimics."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The representation here is, that the power referred to by the second beast would found its claim on pretended miracles, and would accomplish an effect on the world as if it actually did work miracles."
2. "He saw him laying claim to this power, and actually producing an effect as if by a miracle he actually made fire to descend from heaven upon the earth."
3. "The phrase 'in the sight of men' implies that this would be done publicly, and is such language as would be used of pretended miracles designed for purposes of ostentation."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The ‘great signs’ are again a symbol of what is done by false prophetical and priestly power."
2. "The ‘fire out of heaven’ is explained by the function of this beast. He is to direct men to the worship of the first beast in whom the Satanic power of the dragon is personified."
3. "As therefore Christ, in whom the power of God is personified, is preceded by Elias, who is to direct men’s eyes to Him, so the first beast has in the second his Elias, who travesties the miracle of the ancient prophet."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Christ promised great signs to the disciples (John 14:12), but he also warned them against false prophets and false christs with their signs and wonders (Mark 13:22)."

2. "So also Paul had pictured the power of the man of sin (2 Thessalonians 2:9)."

3. "Elijah had called down fire from heaven (1 Kings 18:38; 2 Kings 1:10) and James and John had once even urged Jesus to do this miracle (Luke 9:54)."

### John Gill:
1. "He doeth great wonders,.... Or miracles; not real, but pretended ones, lying wonders, which the Popish legends are full of the accounts of." 
2. "This may be understood mystically, of the pretensions of the Papacy to confer the Holy Ghost, and his gifts upon men, by breathing on them, which on the day of Pentecost were represented by cloven tongues, as of fire, coming down from heaven."
3. "By these miracles, deluded the eyes of the simple with a show of holiness, which, with other instances, are taken notice of by Napier, Brightman, and other writers."
