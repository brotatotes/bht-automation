# Revelation 13:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse in question depicts the deceptive nature of false teachings and the idolatrous practices of Antichrist and those who follow him. These delusions, backed by the secular power of the Papacy, lead astray those who are destined to perish. The image mentioned refers to the various forms of worship and adoration demanded by the papal authority, with some suggesting it symbolizes the transfer of the Roman Empire's power to the emperors endorsed by the Pope. This warns of the dangers of surrendering to deception and placing one's faith in counterfeit authorities, rather than in the true teachings of God.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:

1. "The main fact here stated, that the papacy would endeavor to sustain itself by pretended miracles, is confirmed by an incidental remark of Mr. Gibbon, when speaking of the pontificate of Gregory the Great; he says: 'The credulity or the prudence of Gregory was always disposed to confirm the truths of religion by the evidence of ghosts, miracles, and resurrections'." 

2. "Such things are constantly occurring; and it is by these that the supremacy of the papacy has been and is sustained."

3. "All this in fact occurred in the decline of the Roman power after the time of Constantine, and its final apparent extinction, as if 'wounded to death,' in the exile of the last of the emperors, the son of Orestes, who assumed the names of Romulus and Augustus, names which were corrupted, the former by the Greeks into Momyllus, and the latter by the Latins 'into the contemptible diminutive Augustulus'."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The word involves the idea of representation, though not of perfect representation."

2. "The thought of the Seer appears to be as follows: First, we have God, the Son the true ‘image’ of God, and man ‘renewed’ in the Son ‘after the image of Him that created him.’"
3. "The second beast or the false prophet will then stand in the same relation to the first beast and men as that in which Christ the true prophet stands to God and men."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "It is a constant cause for wonder, the gullibility of the public at the hands of new charlatans who continually bob up with their pipe-dreams." 

2. "This 'image' of the emperor could be his head upon a coin, an imago painted or woven upon a standard, a bust in metal or stone, a statue, anything that people could be asked to bow down before and worship."

3. "Emperor-worship is the issue and that involves worship of the devil."
