## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "False doctrine will give a spiritual, philosophical appearance to the foolish apotheosis of the creaturely personified by Antichrist."
2. "Antichrist shall be 'one of the human race in whom the whole of Satan shall dwell bodily.'"
3. "Rome's speaking images and winking pictures of the Virgin Mary and the saints are an earnest of the future demoniacal miracles of the false prophet in making the beast's or Antichrist's image to speak."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The second beast, however, had power to impart life to it, so that it would be invested with authority, and would exercise that authority in the manner specified."
2. "The 'worship' here referred to is civil, not religious homage."
3. "The facts that we are to look for in the fulfillment of this are: (1) That the Roman imperial power was about to expire - as if wounded to death by the sword; (2) That this was revived in the form of what is here called the 'image of the beast' - that is, in a form closely resembling the former Roman empire; (3) That this was done by the agency of the papal power, represented by the second beast; (4) That the effect of this was to set up over people a wide-extended secular jurisdiction, of a most arbitrary and absolute kind, where the penalty of disobedience to its laws was death, and where the infliction of this was, in fact, to be traced to the influence of the second beast - that is, the papal spiritual power."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Speak. This is supposed by some to refer to the tricks of pagan priests in making pictures and statues appear to speak." 
2. "The command to speak is a reminder that God is the ultimate source of all true communication and revelation."

### Philip Schaff:

2. "But such pictures and images, however they might seem to move and speak, were never able to put to death." 
3. "It seems better, therefore, to think first it may be of the persons in whom civil power was centred, of the possessors of the world power, of kings or emperors in any land, but especially in Rome, who demanded that Divine honours should be paid them, and who persecuted to the death such as refused the homage."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "This second beast, probably a system like the first (not a mere person), was endowed with the power to work magical tricks, as was true of Simon Magus and Apollonius of Tyana and many workers of legerdemain since."
2. "Ventriloquism like that in Acts 16:16."
3. "That refusal to worship the image of the emperor carried with it capital punishment in Trajan's time is clear from Pliny's letter to Trajan (X. 96)."

### John Gill:
1. "He gave this new religion a sanction, he confirmed and established it, and obliged all in his dominions to embrace and acknowledge it."
2. "It may be understood either of the images of the virgin Mary, and other saints, which it is pretended, and the people are made to believe, that they do at times actually speak, and really weep and laugh."
3. "The beast causes, or orders all those that will not worship the image, to be killed; that is, that as many as will not embrace and profess the Popish religion shall be put to death."
