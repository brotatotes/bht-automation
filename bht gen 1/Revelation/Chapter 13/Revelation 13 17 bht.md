# Revelation 13:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, various commentators shed light on the symbolic nature of the mark and its implications. They mention that the mark may be symbolic of allegiance, similar to the sealing of the saints on their forehead. It is associated with a power that seeks control over commerce and traffic, potentially making it subservient to its own purposes. Additionally, the mark could bear the name or number of the beast, representing a public profession of a specific religious system.
