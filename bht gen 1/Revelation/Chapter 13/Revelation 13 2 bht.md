# Revelation 13:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This verse describes a powerful and oppressive world power, symbolized by a beast that combines the characteristics of a leopard, a bear, and a lion. It represents the rule over the entire world, with qualities that are swift, cruel, brutal, and devouring. The seven heads of the beast symbolize different kingdoms, with the final kingdom represented by ten horns, which signifies the dissolution of the wicked Roman Empire and the rise of other world powers. Ultimately, this beast serves as an agent of the dragon, embodying the wickedness and allure that leads many astray.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "It rises up out of the sea, as Daniel's four beasts, and has ten horns, as Daniel's fourth beast, and seven heads, as Daniel's four beasts had in all, namely, one on the first, one on the second, four on the third, and one on the fourth." 
2. "Thus it represents comprehensively in one figure the world power (which in Daniel is represented by four) of all times and places, not merely of one period and one locality, viewed as opposed to God."
3. "Satan appears as a serpent, as being the archetype of the beast nature."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "In this description, it is observable that John has combined in one animal or monster, all those which Daniel brought successively on the scene of action as representing different empires."
2. "There was an obvious propriety in this, in speaking of the Roman power, for it was, in fact, made up of the empires represented by the other symbols in Daniel, and 'combined in itself all the elements of the terrible and the oppressive, which had existed in the aggregate in the other great empires that preceded it.'"
3. "John has thus brought together the qualities of activity, bloodthirstiness, strength, ferocity, all as symbolical of the power that was intended to be represented."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The word stands for either. Leopard is leo - pard, the lion - pard, which was supposed to be a mongrel between a panther and a lioness." 
2. "Compare Daniel 7:6." 
3. "Bear. Compare Daniel 7:5."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The qualities represented are the most offensive of their kind, the swift cruel spring of the leopard, the brutish relentlessness of the bear, and the devouring power of the lion."
2. "The rule symbolized by the power of the beast must be a rule over the whole world."
3. "The objects represented by the heads of the beast must be kingdoms, not personal kings like the Emperors of Rome."
4. "The seventh, resolvable into the ten horns, is no one definite kingdom. It had not yet arisen: but St. John saw that the wicked Roman Empire was tottering to its fall, and that it would be dissolved in other and final world-powers represented in their totality by the number ten."


### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "The leopard was considered a cross between a panther and a lioness." 
2. "The strength and brutality of the Babylonian, Median, and Persian empires appeared in the Roman Empire." 
3. "The dragon works through this beast. The beast is simply Satan's agent."

### John Gill:
1. "The Grecian kingdom is compared to a leopard for its rapidity and swiftness with which Alexander overran the world and set up this monarchy." 
2. "The Roman Papal monarchy bears some resemblance to a leopard for its swiftness, as it quickly extended its power over all kingdoms and churches." 
3. "Antichrist, by outward riches and preferments, allures multitudes unto him and destroys them, just like a leopard lures its prey with its sweet smell."
