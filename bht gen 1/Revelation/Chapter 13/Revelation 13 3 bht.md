# Revelation 13:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, a head of the beast is described as both wounded to death and then healed, signifying the rise and fall of the Roman Empire. The historical context of Rome's destruction and subsequent revival is emphasized, with its last emperor being forced to abdicate the throne. This revival led to the establishment of ten kingdoms, surrendering their power to the beast, symbolizing the rise of the Papacy. The extensive dominion and influence of the beast, representing antichrist, extended to the entire Roman Empire, debunking the claimed universality of the Papists as a mark of the true church.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "The beast's head is not changed into a human head, but receives a deadly wound, that is, the world kingdom which this head represents does not truly turn to God, but for a time its God-opposed character remains paralyzed."
2. "No essential change is noticed in Daniel as effected by Christianity upon the fourth kingdom; it remains essentially God-opposed to the last."
3. "A new and worse heathenism breaks in upon the Christianized world, more devilish than the old one of the first heads of the beast. The latter was an apostasy only from the general revelation of God in nature and conscience; but this new one is from God's revelation of love in His Son."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The phrase 'wounded to death' means properly that it received a mortal wound, that is, the wound would have been mortal if it had not been healed."
2. "The main difficulty...is, in the fact that 'one' of the seven heads is referred to as wounded unto death; as if one-seventh part of the power was endangered...Is not the number seven so used in the Scriptures as to denote a considerable portion - a portion quite material and important?"
3. "The waning Roman secular power was restored by its connection with the spiritual power - the papacy...the waning secular power of Rome was thus restored by connecting itself with the spiritual or ecclesiastical power, thus prolonging what might properly be called the Roman domination far beyond what it would otherwise have been."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The word occurs eight times in Revelation, and in seven of these it must be rendered slain or slaughtered." 
2. "In both cases there had been actual death, and in both revival. The one is a mocking counterpart of the other." 
3. "A pregnant construction for wondered at and followed after."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The statement in the verse is the counterpart of that in chap. Revelation 5:6, where we read of the ‘Lamb as though it had been slaughtered.’ In both cases there had been actual death, although in both there had also been a revival, a resurrection, to life."
2. "The language before us, it will be observed, is thus utterly inconsistent with the idea entertained by so many in modern times, that the sixth head, instead of being the Roman power in general, is the Emperor Nero himself."
3. "In the first place, the head of the beast spoken of had not simply disappeared from view: it had been actually slain. A death-stroke had been inflicted. It had died as really as the Lamb of God had died on Calvary, and the Seer saw that it had done so."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "As though slain" - The phrase suggests a paradoxical image of the beast, appearing both dead and alive. This symbolizes the death and resurrection of the Lamb, emphasizing the power and triumph of Christ over evil.

2. "The stroke of death" - Referring to the death of Nero, this phrase highlights the historical context of the passage. It signifies the rise of pretenders claiming to be Nero redivivus, which John sees as a continuation of the persecutions carried out by Domitian.

3. "All the earth wondered at and followed after the beast" - This quote emphasizes the widespread admiration and following of the beast, representing the allure and influence of Antichrist. It reflects the deceptive nature of evil, drawing people away from the truth and leading them astray.

### John Gill:
1. "And this head was as it were wounded to death; when the Roman empire was like a burning mountain cast into the sea; when Rome itself was taken, sacked, and burnt, more than once, particularly by Totilas; when Augustulus, the last of the emperors, was obliged to abdicate the throne." 

2. "His deadly wound was healed; by the setting up of ten kingdoms in it, the kings of which gave them to the beast, to antichrist, the pope of Rome, and so the empire came to have an head again, a governor, though of another kind."

3. "And all the world wondered after the beast; which expresses the large extent of antichrist's dominion, which reached to all the Roman empire... so that the universality the Papists boast of, as a note of the true church, is manifestly a mark of the beast, or of antichrist."
