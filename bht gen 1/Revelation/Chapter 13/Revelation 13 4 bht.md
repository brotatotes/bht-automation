# Revelation 13:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, a blasphemous parody is made by comparing the beast to God. The language used is typically reserved for God, emphasizing the audacity of equating the two. It echoes the praise and adoration given to God in the Old Testament, highlighting the beast's attempt to usurp divine attributes. The worship given to the beast is not only a mockery of God, but also an extension of devil-worship, as the beast is depicted as a tool of the devil.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "The very language appropriated to God" - The commentary highlights that the phrase "Who is like unto the beast?" is a language typically used to describe God, emphasizing the blasphemous nature of assigning it to the beast. 

2. "A parody of the name 'Michael'" - The commentary suggests that the phrase is a parody of the name "Michael," which means "Who is like unto God?" This further emphasizes the contrast between the beast and God. 

3. "The opponents of the Old Testament Antichrist, Antiochus" - The commentary mentions that the language used in the verse was also used by the Maccabees to describe their opponents, specifically Antiochus, who is considered an Old Testament Antichrist. This historical reference adds depth to the understanding of the verse.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The word 'worship' - προσκυνέω proskuneō - is not always, however, used in a religious sense. It means, properly, 'to kiss'; to kiss toward anyone; that is, to kiss his own hand and to extend it toward a person, in token of respect and homage."
2. "Can anyone doubt that this was the case under papal Rome; that the power which was set up under that entire domination, civil and ecclesiastical, was such as Satan approved, and such as he sought to have established on the earth?"
3. "It was the policy of rulers and princes in those times to augment in every way possible the respect in which they were held; to maintain that they were the vicegerents of heaven; to claim for themselves sacredness of character and of person; and to secure from the people a degree of reverence which was in fact idolatrous."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The phrase 'because he gave' emphasizes the reason for the comparison being made between the beast and God. It highlights the irony and mockery in comparing the beast, a mere creation, to the Almighty God." 

2. "The question 'Who is like unto the beast?' is a rhetorical device used to emphasize the unparalleled power and authority of the beast. It echoes similar ascriptions to God in the Old Testament, highlighting the beast's attempt to usurp divine attributes." 

3. "By referencing passages from Isaiah, Psalms, Micah, and Jeremiah, the author draws attention to the numerous instances in the Hebrew Scriptures where God's incomparable nature is affirmed. This further underscores the audacity of comparing the beast to God, as it is an intentional parody and a display of the beast's arrogance."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "This verse contains a parody of the ascriptions of praise given to the true God in many passages of the Old Testament."
2. "If the words apply to Nero they must apply to Nero redux, for it is unnecessary to spend time in showing that it is to the beast as healed, and not before it was stain, that the song is raised."
3. "But there is not a tittle of evidence to prove that homage of this kind was paid even to the thought of the resuscitated tyrant."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "They really worshipped Satan (the dragon) when 'they worshipped the beast'... The beast is merely the tool of the devil for worship."
2. "Emperor-worship, like all idolatry, was devil-worship."
3. "The worship of such a monster as Nero was indeed a travesty of the worship of God."

### John Gill:
1. "The devil, in the idols, images, angels, and saints departed, to whom they give adoration, as did the Gentiles, whose successors they are, and whose name they bear."
2. "For antichrist sits in the temple to be worshipped as God, showing himself that he is God, and receives adorations from his creatures, the cardinals, and others."
3. "And indeed, such was his power and strength once, that he was more than a match for emperors and kings; and those were badly off that engaged in a war with him."
