3. "to continue—Greek, 'poiesai,' 'to act,' or 'work.'"

1. "These arrogant claims consisted in the assertion of a divine right; in the power assumed over the liberty, the property, and the consciences of the people; in the arbitrary commands that were issued; and in the right asserted of giving absolute law."
2. "The whole power represented by the 'beast' will be blasphemous."
3. "The duration of the existence of this power is the same as what is everywhere ascribed to the papacy, in the passages which refer to it; and all the circumstances, as before remarked, show that the same general power is referred to by the two 'beasts' which are described in this chapter."

### Marvin Vincent:

### Philip Schaff:
1. "And there was given him a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies." - This verse highlights the power and influence given to the beast by God. The mouth symbolizes the ability to speak and persuade, and the great things and blasphemies represent the arrogant and blasphemous words spoken by the beast.

2. "The description is taken from Daniel 8:8; Daniel 8:20; Daniel 8:25, where similar language is used of the ‘Little Horn.’" - The reference to Daniel's prophecies helps to establish a connection between the beast in Revelation and the little horn in Daniel. This connection suggests a continuity and fulfillment of previous prophecies.

### John Gill:
1. "The beast is said to have a mouth before, like the mouth of a lion, but now he was moved and stirred up by the dragon, the devil, to open it, not only in a cruel and voracious way, but in a haughty, lying, and blasphemous manner." 
2. "He was given power to continue in being, or to continue blaspheming and speaking great things; and indeed, as long as he continues, he will continue blaspheming." 
3. "The phrase rather intends his being, and the continuance and duration of it; which is the same period of time in which the holy city is trodden under foot by this beast, and the same with the 1260 days or years, in which the witnesses prophesy in sackcloth, and the woman, the church, is in the wilderness."
