# Revelation 13:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we see the beast arrogantly blaspheme against God by exalting itself as equal to God, sitting in the temple and demanding worship. This blasphemous nature extends to the beast's attempt to manipulate and disregard God's laws, imposing its own traditions and interpretations on followers. The verse serves as a warning to believers to remain discerning and not be swayed by the enticing lies and arrogance of the world.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "opened . . . mouth—The usual formula in the case of a set speech, or series of speeches." 
2. "blasphemy—So B and ANDREAS. A and C read 'blasphemies.'"
3. "and them—So Vulgate, Coptic, ANDREAS, and PRIMASIUS read. A and C omit 'and': 'them that dwell (literally, 'tabernacle') in heaven,' mean not only angels and the departed souls of the righteous, but believers on earth who have their citizenship in heaven, and whose true life is hidden from the Antichristian persecutor in the secret of God's tabernacle."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "By his own arrogant claims; by his assumed authority in matters of conscience; by setting aside the divine authority; and by impious declarations in derogation of the divine claims."
2. "It seems to be used here in a general sense to denote the place where God was worshipped; and the meaning is, that there would be a course of conduct in regard to the true church - the dwelling-place of God on the earth - which could properly be regarded as blasphemy."
3. "No one acquainted with the reproaches cast on the devoted and sincere followers of the Saviour during the dark periods of the papal rule can fail to see that there was in that a complete fulfillment of all that is here predicted."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The meaning is to enhance the enormity of the blasphemy by bringing out the lofty nature of God's holy name and dwelling-place."
2. "The word dwell is, literally, tabernacle."
3. "Thus the literal sense would be to blaspheme the name and tabernacle which dwell in heaven."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The blasphemies mentioned here refer to the arrogant and blasphemous words spoken by the beast, who represents a powerful and oppressive political system. These words are a direct attack on God and His authority, seeking to exalt the beast above all else."

2. "The blasphemies also serve as a reminder of the ongoing spiritual battle between good and evil. The beast's blasphemies are a manifestation of the devil's attempt to deceive and lead people away from the truth of God."

3. "This verse highlights the importance of discernment and staying rooted in the truth of God's Word. It serves as a warning to believers to be vigilant and not be swayed by the enticing lies and blasphemies of the world."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Against God (προς τον θεον). 'Face to face with God' in sheer defiance, like Milton's picture of Satan in Paradise Lost."
2. "The aorist ηνοιξεν is probably constative, for he repeated the blasphemies, though the phrase (ανοιγω to stoma, to open the mouth) is normally ingressive of the beginning of an utterance."
3. "The Roman emperors blasphemously assumed divine names in public documents. They directed their blasphemy against heaven itself ('his tabernacle,' την σκηνην αυτου) and against 'them that dwell in the heaven' (τους εν τω ουρανω σκηνουντας), the same phrase of Revelation 12:12 (either angels or the redeemed or both)."

### John Gill:
1. "By sitting as God in the temple of God, showing himself that he is God...and to be worshipped as God." 
2. "By taking upon him to bind and loose the consciences of men, and to dispense with the laws of God, and make them void by his own traditions."
3. "By making them a nose of wax, by imposing on them what senses he pleases; by assuming a right of being the sole interpreter of them, and the judge of all controversies."
