# Revelation 13:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this powerful verse, we witness the authority given to a figure referred to as the beast. The beast's power is universal, extending over all kindreds, tongues, and nations. This dominance is not only in a physical sense but encompasses both temporal and spiritual realms. The verse also sheds light on the reality faced by the saints, who are engaged in a perpetual battle against the forces of darkness and persecution. However, within this struggle, we find hope and redemption, for the Lamb of God reigns supreme and will ultimately triumph over all.
