# Revelation 13:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This verse describes the worship and reverence given to a figure in contrast to those who follow a heavenly path. The sacrifice of this figure was predestined and planned by God even before the world's creation. The significance and power of this sacrificial death are emphasized, as it fulfills prophecies and operates through the virtue of the Messiah's sacrifice alone. The verse also highlights the responsibility of individuals and the eternal nature of God's elect, who were chosen in the figure and through whom divine election is realized.

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The lamb that hath been slain from the foundation of the world." - This phrase emphasizes the eternal nature of Jesus' sacrifice, suggesting that it was planned and ordained by God even before the world was created.

2. "The position of the words in favor of the connection with slain." - The commentary highlights the argument that the phrase "from the foundation of the world" should be connected with "slain," emphasizing the significance of Jesus' sacrifice throughout history.

3. "The lamb that hath been slain from the foundation of the world." - By using the word "slain," the commentary underscores the sacrificial nature of Jesus' death, emphasizing its redemptive power and its fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "These dwellers upon the earth are in contrast with those who ‘tabernacle in heaven.’ They are the ungodly as distinguished from the godly." 
2. "The plural of the first clause of the verse, ‘all,’ passes into the singular of the second clause, those referred to being now looked at individually." 
3. "The clause is less appropriate to the slaying of the Lamb, an act which took place in time, than to those counsels of the Almighty which are from eternity."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Whose (ου--αυτου). Redundant use of genitive αυτου (his) with ου (whose) as common in this book, and singular instead of plural ων with antecedent παντες (all, plural), thus calling attention to the responsibility of the individual in emperor-worship."
2. "Hath not been written (ου γεγραπτα). Perfect passive indicative of γραφω, permanent state, stands written."
3. "That hath been slain from the foundation of the world (του εσφαγμενου (for which see Revelation 5:6) απο καταβολης κοσμου). For the phrase απο καταβολης κοσμου (not in the LXX) there are six other N.T. uses (Matthew 13:35 without κοσμου; Revelation 25:34; Luke 11:50; Hebrews 4:3; Hebrews 9:26; Revelation 17:8), and for προ καταβολης κοσμου three (John 17:24; Ephesians 1:4; 1 Peter 1:20). It is doubtful here whether it is to be taken with του εσφαγμενου (cf. 1 Peter 1:20) or with γεγραπτα as in Revelation 17:8. Either makes sense, and here the most natural use is with εσφαγμενου. At any rate the death of Christ lies in the purpose of God, as in John 3:16."

### John Gill:
1. "The inhabitants of the Roman empire, the idolatrous part of it, the men of the world, earthly minded men; who are as they came into the world, and are of the earth, earthly, and seek only after earthly honours, pleasures, and profits; these are the admirers and adorers of the beast." 

2. "Election is eternal, and is not an act of time, nor dependent upon anything done in time; and that it is of particular persons, and not of bodies of men, of nations and churches, and still less of propositions, or of persons so and so qualified, or under such conditions and circumstances."

3. "Christ... stands first in it as the elect of God, and the head of all the elect, who, as members, were chosen in him: the act of election was made in him, and stands sure in him; and he is the author and giver of that life, which men are chosen unto both here and hereafter."
