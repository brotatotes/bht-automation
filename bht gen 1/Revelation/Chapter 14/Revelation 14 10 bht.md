# Revelation 14:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the mentioned verse, the punishment for the wicked is vividly described. The wine of God's wrath is undiluted, with no drop of water to cool its heat. It is a cup of pure wrath, poured out without mixture, without any allay of mercy. This punishment, in the presence of the rejected Savior, is a terrifying and fearful judgment, tormenting with fire and brimstone. The verse emphasizes the severity of God's anger, and the complete absence of mercy and hope in this final punishment.
