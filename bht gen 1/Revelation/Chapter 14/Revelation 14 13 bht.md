# Revelation 14:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Bible verse being described is a message of comfort and hope for believers who have died in the Lord. It emphasizes their blessedness and the eternal rest they now experience. They are described as having part in the first resurrection and sitting down to the marriage supper of the Lamb. While the phrase "dying in the Lord" may bring to mind the challenges they faced before death, the focus is on the glory and honor they receive in heaven. Their rest from toil and suffering is contrasted with the present life, where endurance is needed.
