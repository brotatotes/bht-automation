# Revelation 14:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
From the commentators' insights, we can gather that this Bible verse describes an angel, specifically one associated with the altar of burnt offering. This angel possesses power over fire, which symbolizes the judgments of God upon the earth. The angel's cry emphasizes the need to cut off the wicked, depicted as clusters of grapes on the vine of the earth, as they deserve the destructive justice symbolized by fire. Ultimately, this vision aims to provide comfort to the church in the face of persecution, assuring believers that their enemies will be dealt with in due time.
