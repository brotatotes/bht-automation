# Revelation 14:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this passage, we read about the judgment and destruction of the wicked, symbolized by the vine of the earth and the great winepress of the wrath of God. The commentators note that the vine represents those who have rejected God's planting and followed their own ways. The winepress is seen as a metaphor for God's wrath and the severe consequences that await those who oppose Him. This image of judgment and destruction is seen throughout the book of Revelation and serves as a reminder of the dire consequences of rejecting God's ways.
