# Revelation 14:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This verse speaks of a group of individuals who have remained faithful to their Christian beliefs, not being led astray by temptation. They are described as chaste, followers of Jesus, and redeemed from among the people. They are characterized by their purity, free from any defilement or impurity, and they imitate the example of Jesus in their lives. They are honored as the first fruits of the redeemed, near to the Lamb of God, and their reward is to be in his presence. This passage invites us to aspire to be part of this virtuous and dedicated group.

2. "Follow the Lamb whithersoever he goeth—in glory, being especially near His person; the fitting reward of their following Him so fully on earth." 
3. "Not merely a 'first-fruit' in the sense in which all believers are so, but Israel's 144,000 elect are the first-fruit, the Jewish and Gentile elect Church is the harvest."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The general idea is, that they are chaste; that they are the followers of the Lamb; that they are redeemed from among people; and that they are without guile."
2. "The word 'defiled' here determines the meaning of the passage, as denoting that they were not guilty of illicit sexual intercourse with women."
3. "It is a word that is properly expressive of illicit sexual intercourse - of impurity and unchastity of life - and the statement is, that they who are saved are not impure and unchaste."
