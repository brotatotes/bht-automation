# Revelation 14:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Bible verse describes the fall of a powerful entity, often referred to as Babylon. This entity is identified as the apostate Church, distinct from political powers. The fall is prophesied with certainty, echoing previous scriptures, and symbolizes the downfall of all enemies of Christ. The verse also suggests that Rome, characterized by arrogance, pride, and oppression, is the intended meaning of Babylon. Rome's idolatrous practices and ungodly influence over nations contribute to its ultimate demise. This proclamation serves as a prelude to a more detailed description of the fall to come.
