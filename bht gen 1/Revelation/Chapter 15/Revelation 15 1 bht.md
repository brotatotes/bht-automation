1. "The word 'sign' here is the same which in Revelation 12:1, Revelation 12:3; Revelation 13:13, is rendered 'wonder' and 'wonders,' and in Revelation 13:14; Revelation 16:14; Revelation 19:20, 'miracles.' The word is not found elsewhere in the Book of Revelation, though it is of frequent occurrence in other parts of the New Testament."
2. "The subsequent statements fully justify this, and show that the vision was one of portentous character, and that was suited to hold the mind in astonishment."
3. "The destruction of this great anti-Christian power had been distinctly mentioned, Revelation 14:0. That might be spoken of as a thing now well known, and the mention of it would demand the article; and as that was well known, and would demand the article, so any allusion to it, or description of it, might be spoken of in the same manner, as a thing that was definite and fixed, and hence, the mention of the plagues by which it was to be accomplished would be referred to in the same manner."
