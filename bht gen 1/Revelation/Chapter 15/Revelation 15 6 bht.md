The verse describes a group of angels who have received their instructions from God's sanctuary. They are adorned in beautiful garments, with clothes studded with precious stones and clothed in pure white linen, representing their holiness and service. Girded with golden girdles, they bear a high dignity and rest, resembling the Lord Himself in their appearance. As ministers and members of the Church, they execute God's judgment upon the evil and are clothed in the righteousness of Christ.
