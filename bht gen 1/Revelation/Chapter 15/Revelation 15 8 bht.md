# Revelation 15:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the midst of the temple, filled with the smoke of God's glorious presence, no man was able to enter during the execution of divine judgments. The smoke symbolized the overwhelming and awe-inspiring nature of God's presence, serving as a barrier and protection against those who sought to harm His people. This metaphorical "smoke screen" kept out the blind and unrepentant, showcasing the righteous wrath and power of the Lawgiver. As the smoke from the glory of God filled the sanctuary, it was a reminder of both judgment and favor, a visible manifestation of His powerful and gracious presence.
