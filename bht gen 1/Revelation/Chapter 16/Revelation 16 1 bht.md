1. "These seven vials (the detailed expansion of the vintage, Revelation 14:18-20) being called 'the last,' must belong to the period just when the term of the beast's power has expired...close to the end or coming of the Son of man." 
2. "The first four are more general, affecting the earth, the sea, springs, and the sun, not merely a portion of these natural bodies, as in the case of the trumpets, but the whole of them; the last three are more particular, affecting the throne of the beast, the Euphrates, and the grand consummation."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "A great voice (μεγαλης φωνης). Not an angel as in Revelation 5:2; Revelation 7:2; Revelation 10:3; Revelation 14:7; Revelation 14:9; Revelation 14:15; Revelation 14:18, but of God as Revelation 15:8 shows."
2. "Pour out (εκχεετε). Second aorist active imperative of εκχεω (same form as present active imperative). Blass would change to εκχεατε (clearly aorist) as in verse Revelation 16:6."

### John Gill:
1. "The earth here is to be taken in a larger sense than in the following verse, and includes the land and sea, the fountains and rivers, and even the ambient air, and also the sun in the firmament, as the pouring out of these vials upon them show; and designs the whole apostate church, consisting of earthly men, all the inhabitants of the earth, that worship the beast." 

2. "And it may be further observed, that these vials are only poured out on the enemies of God and of Christ, and of his church and people; for no wrath can be poured out upon the saints, not the least drop of it can fall upon them; this would not be consistent with God's everlasting love to them, with the satisfaction of Christ made for them, nor with the blessings of justification, pardon, adoption, c. bestowed on them."

3. "Moreover, these vials will affect antichrist both with respect to his civil and ecclesiastic capacity, or both in temporals and spirituals, and, both antichrists, eastern and western."

### John Wesley:
1. "The phials destroy chiefly the beast and his followers, with a swift and impetuous force."
