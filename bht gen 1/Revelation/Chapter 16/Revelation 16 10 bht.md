# Revelation 16:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, the throne of the beast is depicted as an arrogant mimicry of God's throne, set up in Rome. The pouring out of the fifth vial signifies the destruction of this power, resulting in darkness and confusion, symbolizing the plague of calamity. The intense anguish and distress of those within this kingdom are described as they gnaw their tongues. This vial marks a shift to the spiritual realm and aims at the very heart of the beast's authority.
