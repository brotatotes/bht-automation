# Revelation 16:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, there is a depiction of a powerful coalition formed by the dragon, the beast, and the false prophet. The dragon represents Satan, while the beast symbolizes a force that opposes Christ. The false prophet, on the other hand, works to deceive and undermine the truth. Together, these three forces seek to gather the kings of the world in support of their cause, unleashing lies, deceit, and opposition to God. Their ultimate aim is to challenge and defy God's authority throughout creation, redemption, and sanctification.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Beginning with infidelity as to Jesus Christ's coming in the flesh, men shall end in the grossest idolatry of the beast, the incarnation of all that is self-deifying and God-opposed in the world powers of all ages."
2. "They talk of liberty, but it is not Gospel liberty, but license for lust."
3. "The dragon, the beast, and the false prophet, 'the mystery of iniquity,' form a blasphemous Antitrinity, the counterfeit of 'the mystery of godliness' God manifests in Christ, witnessed to by the Spirit."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The frog is here employed clearly as a symbol, and it is designed that certain qualities of the 'spirits' here referred to should be designated by the symbol... We may suppose, however, that the spirits referred to would be characterized by pride, arrogance, impudence, assumption of authority; perhaps impurity and vileness, for all these ideas enter into the meaning of the symbol."
2. "That is, there would be some putting forth of arrogant pretensions; some loud denunciation or complaining; some manifestation of pride and self-consequence, which would be well represented by the croaking of the frog."
3. "As to the application of this, there is no opinion so probable as that it alludes to the Muhammedan power - not strictly the Turkish power, for that was to be 'dried up,' or to diminish; but to the Muhammedan power as such, that was still to continue for a while in its vigor, and that was yet to exert a formidable influence against the gospel, and probably in some combination, in fact, if not in form, with paganism and the papacy."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The plague of frogs in Exodus is a powerful reminder of the consequences of disobedience and the sovereignty of God. It serves as a warning that when we turn away from God and His commandments, we invite chaos and destruction into our lives."

2. "The frogs were not just a nuisance, but a symbol of the false gods and idols that the Egyptians worshipped. By filling their land with frogs, God was demonstrating His power and superiority over these false deities."

3. "The fact that the frogs invaded every aspect of Egyptian life, from their homes to their beds, highlights the all-encompassing nature of God's judgment. It shows that there is no escape from the consequences of sin and rebellion against God."

4. "The plague of frogs also reveals God's mercy and patience. He could have easily wiped out the Egyptians with a single blow, but instead, He gave them multiple opportunities to repent and turn back to Him."

5. "Ultimately, the plague of frogs serves as a reminder that God is in control of all things. He has the power to bring judgment upon the wicked and deliverance to the righteous. It is a call for us to humble ourselves before Him and seek His forgiveness and guidance in our lives."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The point to be chiefly noticed is that all the great enemies of God’s people are gathered together."
2. "All the demoniacal powers of the world in their united forces are on the stage."
3. "Three unclean spirits as it were frogs. An unclean spirit comes out of the mouth of each; and the spirits are as ‘frogs,’ unclean, boasting, noisy, offensive animals."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Of the dragon. That is Satan."
2. "The brute force of the World-power represented by the Roman Empire."
3. "Out of the mouths of each of the three evil powers comes an evil spirit."

### John Gill:
1. "Rome, the seat of antichrist, being destroyed, and the kingdom of the beast darkened, and brought into great contempt, Mahometanism greatly declining, the Gospel succeeding everywhere, the Jews being converted, and resettled in their own land, the devil bestirs himself more than ordinary."
2. "These antichristian emissaries are fitly compared to [frogs], for their impurity, and pleasure they take in it, as frogs do in dirt and filth; and for their being talkative, impudent, and troublesome, like the noisy croaking frogs."
3. "These spirits manifestly appear to be the emissaries of antichrist, under a diabolical influence; his creatures, that are made, and sent forth by him, have their commissions and orders from him, to act for him in every shape, to support his interest, civil and religious, by lies, murders, and false doctrine."

### John Wesley:
1. "The dragon fights chiefly against God; the beast, against Christ; the false prophet, against the Spirit of truth."
2. "The three unclean spirits...endeavor to blacken the works of creation, of redemption, and of sanctification."
3. "The false prophet...works by lies and deceit."
4. "This beast was first powerful as a prince; afterwards a false prophet, a teacher of lies."
5. "To gather them [the kings of the whole world] to the assistance of their three principals."
