# Revelation 16:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, commentators describe a scene of great spiritual battle and opposition against the truth. The name "Armageddon" comes from the Hebrew words for "mountain" and "slaughter," and it is associated with the idea of decisive battles and overwhelming destruction. The location, Megiddo, is mentioned in the Old Testament as a place of significant battles and mourning. It is suggested that this battle will gather the powers of paganism, Mohammedanism, and Romanism, rallying against the kingdom of God. Ultimately, it is a name that signifies the final conflict that determines the prevalence of true religion on the earth.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Armageddon—Hebrew, 'Har,' a mountain, and 'Megiddo' in Manasseh in Galilee, the scene of the overthrow of the Canaanite kings by God's miraculous interposition under Deborah and Barak; the same as the great plain of Esdraelon."
2. "Megiddo comes from a root, gadad, 'cut off,' and means slaughter."
3. "Probably some great plain, antitypical to the valleys of Megiddo and Jehoshaphat, will be the scene."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "There will be a mustering of spiritual forces; there will be a combination and a unity of opposition against the truth; there will be a rallying of the declining powers of paganism, Mohammedanism, and Romanism, as if the forces of the earth, marshalled by kings and rulers, were assembled in some great battlefield, where the destiny of the world was to be decided."
2. "What we are to expect as the fulfillment of this would seem to be, that there will be some mustering of strength - some rallying of forces - some opposition made to the kingdom of God in the gospel, by the powers here referred to, which would be decisive in its character."
3. "The meaning here is, that there would be, as it were, a decisive battle which would determine the question of the prevalence of true religion on the earth."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Bounded as it is by the hills of Palestine on both north and south, it would naturally become the arena of war between the lowlanders who trusted in their chariots, and the Israelite highlanders of the neighboring heights." 
2. "If that mysterious book proceeded from the hand of a Galilean fisherman, it is the more easy to understand why, with the scene of those many battles constantly before him, he should have drawn the figurative name of the final conflict between the hosts of good and evil, from the 'place which is called in the Hebrew tongue Harmagedon'" (Stanley, " Sinai and Palestine ").
3. "The word, like Euphrates, is the expression of an idea; the idea that swift and overwhelming destruction shall overtake all who gather themselves together against the Lord" (Milligan).

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The simple meaning of the word is 'the mountain of destruction.'"
2. "Megiddo was a name associated with the thought of the sudden and terrible defeat of the enemies of God."
3. "The word, like Euphrates, is the expression of an idea, the idea that swift and overwhelming destruction shall overtake all who gather themselves together against the Lord."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "They gathered (συνηγαγεν). Second aorist active indicative of συναγω, singular (the three unclean spirits), like εκπορευετα in verse Revelation 16:14." 
2. "Har-Magedon (Hαρ-Μαγεδων). John proceeds now after the interruption in verse Revelation 16:15."
3. "Perhaps 'the mountains of Megiddo' though not certain. Megiddo is in the valley of Esdraelon, and by the waters of Megiddo (the Kishon) Israel gained a decisive victory over Sisera (Judges 5:19), celebrated in Deborah's song."

### John Gill:
1. "The same spirits that are there said to go forth, to gather the kings together, these will gather them together; will persuade the Papal, Pagan, and Mahometan powers, the remains of them in the several parts of the world, to join together, and make one effort for the reviving of their declining, and almost ruined interests."
2. "This refers either to the slaying of Josiah in the valley of Megiddo, which occasioned such mourning, that it became proverbial for any great sorrow; or rather to the slaughter of Sisera's army at the waters of Megiddo, by Barak, suggesting that the same would be the fate of these united powers."
3. "Since it is a Hebrew name that will be given it, it may lead us to conclude it will be somewhere in Judea, and very likely no other than the valley of Jehoshaphat, where all nations will be gathered; and which is called the valley of decision, where will be the day of the Lord, and multitudes will be slain."

### John Wesley:
1. "Mageddon, or Megiddo, is frequently mentioned in the Old Testament."
2. "Armageddon signifies the city or the mountain of Megiddo; to which the valley of Megiddo adjoined."
3. "This was a place well known in ancient times for many memorable occurrences; in particular, the slaughter of the kings of Canaan, related, Judges 5:19."
