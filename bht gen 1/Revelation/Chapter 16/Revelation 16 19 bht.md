### Albert Barnes:
1. "The division mentioned here in three parts was manifestly with reference to its destruction - either that one part was smitten and the others remained for a time, or that one form of destruction came on one part, and another on the others."
2. "The meaning is, that 'the city was severed and broken in pieces, so that the whole was reduced to a ruinous state.'"
3. "The certain and entire ruin of the power is predicted by this, but still it is not improbable that it will be by such divisions, or such successions of judgments, that it is proper to represent the city as divided into three portions."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The meaning is that the city was broken up and overthrown."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Came into three parts" - The city of Babylon (Rome) was divided into three parts, indicating its downfall and destruction. (εγενετο εις τρια μερη)

2. "Babylon (Rome) had not been overlooked. God was simply biding his time with Rome." - God had not forgotten about Babylon (Rome), but was waiting for the right moment to execute judgment. (εμνησθη)

### John Gill:
1. "By which is meant not Christendom, distinguished into Protestants, Papists, and neutrals, which has been long the case; nor the city of Jerusalem, as inhabited by Christians, Jews, and Turks; nor the city of Rome itself, the seat of the beast, which will have suffered under the fifth vial; but the whole Romish jurisdiction, which is the great city, that reigns over the kings of the earth, as it will now be." 

2. "The division into three parts is either in reference to the three heads of it, the dragon, beast, and false prophet, or to the three unclean spirits that come out of them, which will lead on to this ruin; though the allusion seems rather to be to the destruction of Jerusalem, Ezekiel 5:2 and denotes the utter ruin of the Romish antichrist, in all its branches and remains."

3. "And great Babylon came in remembrance before God; not Constantinople, as Brightman thinks, because that Rome, the seat of the beast, is affected under the fifth vial, and the great city under this; but since no other is called Babylon in this book but the Romish antichristian state, it must be meant here; see Revelation 14:8 for many hundreds of years Babylon seemed to be forgotten by God, no notice being taken of her sins and iniquities in a judicial way; but now God will remember her sins, Revelation 18:5 and inflict deserved punishment upon her."

2. "And the cities of the nations fell — Were utterly overthrown." 
3. "And Babylon was remembered before God — He did not forget the vengeance which was due to her, though the execution of it was delayed."
