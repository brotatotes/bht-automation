# Revelation 16:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we see angels leaving the heavenly scene to pour out their vials on the appointed objects. The judgment inflicted here involves the falling of a noisome and grievous sore upon those who worshiped the mark of the beast. This plague is different from the previous ones and is reminiscent of the boils brought upon the Egyptians. The purpose of these plagues is to punish the corruption and irreligion that have spread like a plague throughout society.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Each angel, as his turn comes, leaves the heavenly scene, and from the space between heaven and earth, empties his vial on the appointed object."
2. "The γῆ, which before in Rev 16:1 was general, is now particular, and correlative with the objects of the other vials."
3. "There came an evil and painful sore upon the men that had the mark of the beast and that worshipped his image."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The reason why the sixth Egyptian plague is the first here is because it was directed against the Egyptian magicians, Jannes and Jambres, so that they could not stand before Moses; and so here the plague is sent upon those who in the beast worship had practiced sorcery."
2. "As they submitted to the mark of the beast, so they must bear the mark of the avenging God."
3. "This first vial is subsequent to the period of the beast's rule."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The judgment here is specifically different from that inflicted under the first trumpet, Revelation 8:7. There it is said to have been that 'the third part of trees was burnt up, and all green grass was burnt up.' Here it is that there fell upon people a 'noisome and grievous sore.' The two, therefore, are designed to refer to different events, and to different forms of punishment."
2. "The word rendered 'sore' properly denotes a wound (Homer, Iliad xi. 812), and then, in later writers, an ulcer or sore. It is used in the New Testament only in the following places: Luke 16:21, 'The dogs came and licked his sores'; and in Revelation 16:2, Revelation 16:11, where it is rendered 'sore,' and 'sores.' It is used in the Septuagint, in reference to the boils that were brought upon the Egyptians, in Exodus 9:9-12, and probably Deuteronomy 28:27; in reference to the leprosy, Leviticus 13:18-20, Leviticus 13:23; in reference to the boil, ulcer, or elephantiasis brought upon Job Job 2:7; and in reference to any sore or ulcer, in Deuteronomy 28:35."
3. "The symbol would properly denote that 'tremendous outbreak of social and moral evil, of democratic fury, atheism, and vice, which was specially seen to characterize the French revolution: that of which the ultimate source was in the long and deep-seated corruption and irreligion of the nation; the outward vent, expression, and organ of its Jacobin clubs, and seditious and atheistic publications; the result, the dissolution of all society, all morals, and all religion; with acts of atrocity and horror accompanying, scarce paralleled in the history of people; and suffering and anguish of correspondent intensity throbbing throughout the social mass and corroding it; what, from France as a center, spread like a plague throughout its affiliated societies to the other countries of papal Christendom, and was, wherever its poison was imbibed, as much the punishment as the symptoms of the corruption within."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Each angel, as his turn comes, withdraws from the heavenly scene." 
2. "Noisome and grievous [malice and wickedness] occur together." 
3. "Sore [boil]...also of the boil or scab of leprosy, king Hezekiah's boil, the botch of Egypt."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The whole earth is thought of, and no more only a third part of it as at chap. Revelation 8:7."
2. "And there fell a noisome and grievous sore upon the men which had the mark of the beast and which worshipped his image."
3. "The idea of the plague is taken from that of Egypt in Exodus 9:8-12, but it cannot be literally understood, for literal interpretation is wholly inapplicable to the sixth bowl, and all the bowls must be interpreted on the same principles."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Each angel 'went off' to perform his task." 
2. "For εξεχεεν see it repeated in verses Revelation 16:3; Revelation 16:4; Revelation 16:8; Revelation 16:10; Revelation 16:12; Revelation 16:17."
3. "Hελκος is old word for a suppurated wound (Latin ulcus), here, verse Revelation 16:11; Luke 16:21."

### John Gill:
1. "Though these vials are so many plagues upon antichrist, they are each of them so many steps to the advancement of Christ's kingdom and glory."
2. "This may design something internal, either the remorse of their consciences, reflections on their past practices, and black despair and horror of mind."
3. "Their secret and wicked practices, both in political and ecclesiastical affairs, will be discovered, and they will appear with boils and blotches upon them all over, which will render them odious to the people, and be the means of a general reformation."

### John Wesley:
1. "They have a great resemblance to the plagues of Egypt, which the Hebrews generally suppose to have been a month distant from each other."
2. "And poured out his phial upon the earth — Literally taken."
3. "On the men who had the mark of the wild beast — All of them, and them only. All those plagues seem to be described in proper, not figurative, words."
