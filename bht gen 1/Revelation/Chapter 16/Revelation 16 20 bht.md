# Revelation 16:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this gripping verse, the cataclysmic judgment of God unfolds as islands vanish and mountains are eradicated from existence. The severity of this event surpasses any previous mention, symbolizing the ultimate culmination of divine retribution. It signifies not only the dissolution of the world, but also the eradication of all antichristian powers, bringing low every high mountain and hill. With every island and mountain fleeing away, the face of the earth is forever transformed, yet this is merely a precursor to the impending end of the world.
