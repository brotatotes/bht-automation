# Revelation 16:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
A devastating event occurs, where a hailstorm of enormous hailstones, symbolizing divine wrath, falls upon humanity. These hailstones have tremendous weight and destruction, each weighing around 50 to 60 pounds, and falling upon all the ungodly. The magnitude and impact of this storm are compared to previous judgments and emphasize the complete and awful destruction it brings upon those who reject and defy God. No one is spared from its consequences, and even those who survive cannot escape its devastating power.
