## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The mention of an angel in this verse is found in some ancient versions, such as the Syriac, Coptic, and ANDREAS. However, it is important to note that the oldest and most reliable manuscripts, such as A, B, C, and the Vulgate, do not include this mention of an angel."
2. "The omission of the angel in these manuscripts suggests that it may have been a later addition or interpolation. This highlights the importance of relying on the earliest and most authoritative sources when studying biblical texts."
3. "The absence of the angel in the oldest manuscripts does not diminish the significance of the verse itself. It serves as a reminder that the core message and meaning of the verse remain intact, regardless of the inclusion or exclusion of certain details."

### Albert Barnes:
