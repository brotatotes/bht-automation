# Revelation 16:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we are introduced to the angel of the waters, the one who presides over these life-giving sources. The angel recognizes the righteousness of the Lord, who brings vengeance and inflicts judgments according to His justice. As desolations and revolutions unfold, the angel acknowledges the unchanging nature of God, whose throne is from everlasting to everlasting. The punishment on the waters is deserved, and the judgments of God reflect His purity and holiness. In His grace, He is praised for His power, and in His vengeance, He is praised for His mercy.
