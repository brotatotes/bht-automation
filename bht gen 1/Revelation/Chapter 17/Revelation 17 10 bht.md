1. "An eighth is mentioned in Revelation 17:11, but it is, at the same time, said that this one so pertains to the seven, or is so properly in one sense of the number seven, though, in another sense, to be regarded as an eighth, that it may be properly reckoned as the seventh."
2. "The word 'kings' - βασιλεῖς basileis - may be understood, so far as the meaning of the word is concerned: (a) Literally, as denoting a king, or one who exercises royal authority; (b) In a more general sense, as denoting one of distinguished honor - a viceroy, prince, leader, chief; (c) In a still larger sense, as denoting a dynasty, a form of government, a mode of administration, as what, in fact, 'rules.'"
3. "The notion of ruling, or of authority, is undoubtedly in the word, for the verb βασιλεύω basileuō means 'to rule,' but the word may be applied to anything in which sovereignty resides."
