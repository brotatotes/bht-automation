# Revelation 17:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Bible verse being described is about a powerful entity, referred to as the beast or the eighth, which embodies intense opposition to God and is connected to a previous empire. Commentators believe that this power takes different forms throughout history and is often associated with a personal Antichrist and the papacy. It is seen as a symbol of evil and its ultimate destruction is seen as a symbol of the end it is hastening towards.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Antichrist manifested in fullest and most intense opposition to God."
2. "That a personal Antichrist will stand at the head of the Antichristian kingdom."
3. "The eighth is not merely one of the seven restored, but a new power or person proceeding out of the seven, and at the same time embodying all the God-opposed features of the previous seven concentrated and consummated."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It is evident that, by the 'beast' here, there is some one power, dominion, empire, or rule, whose essential identity is preserved through all these changes, and to which it is proper to give the same name."
2. "This form of sovereignty, though a mere prolongation of the former government, so much so as to be, in fact, but keeping up the same empire in the world, appears in such a novelty of form, that, in one sense, it deserves to be called the eighth in order."
3. "The papacy, as an ecclesiastical institution, was sustained by the civil power, with which it was so closely connected."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The 'beast' here is, therefore, identical with that of Revelation 17:8; that is, with the beast as it was thought of at a time prior to any mention, in Revelation 17:9, of the successive forms of its manifestation."
2. "It is spoken of as an eighth simply because it follows the seven, and because in its final condition all the malice and evil of its previous conditions are concentrated."
3. "The beast is the essence, the concentrated expression, of the seven, the embodiment of their spirit; and it was necessary to mention this, lest we should think that it belongs to a wholly different category."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "This is the angel's interpretation and it looks like a reference to Domitian as the eighth, who is regarded as one of the seven because he was considered a second Nero (Nero redivivus)." 
2. "John may have used εκ των instead of εις εκ των to avoid absolute identity between Domitian and Nero (Beckwith)."
3. "The tyrant's end was a symbol of the end to which the Beast which he personated was hastening" (Swete).

### John Gill:
1. "The Papacy... is the eighth king; and this is the Papacy, which takes the name of the beast, because it is the head of the beast, and the only surviving head of the beast, or Roman empire, now become Papal."
2. "The pope of Rome is the eighth king, and seventh head, the latter with respect to his temporal power, and the former with respect to his ecclesiastical authority."
3. "Being the son of perdition, [the Papacy] is justly deserving of [perdition]."
