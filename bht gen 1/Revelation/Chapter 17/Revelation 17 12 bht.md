# Revelation 17:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Bible verse being described is a prophecy about ten kings or kingdoms that will rise up after the fall of the Roman Empire. These kings are not ordinary rulers, but rather possess a distinctive power and authority. This period of their rule is temporary, symbolizing the transient nature of their administration. These kings are also associated with the antichristian powers of the earth, and they exhibit the same ungodly spirit as Rome and the preceding world powers. This description highlights the unique qualities of these kings and their significant role in the unfolding of future events.
