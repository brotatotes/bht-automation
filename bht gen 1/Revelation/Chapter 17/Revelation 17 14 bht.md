# Revelation 17:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
A coalition of kings, in league with the beast and papacy, wage war against the Lamb. They seek to extinguish true religion, but the Lamb's chosen and faithful followers will overcome them. Crowned heads are subject to the Lamb's supreme power, and his servants who fight under him are called, chosen, and faithful. They will partake in the triumph and share in the victory, as they remain steadfast and unwavering in their devotion to the Lamb and his cause.
