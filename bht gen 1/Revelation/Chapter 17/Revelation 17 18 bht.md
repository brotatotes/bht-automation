# Revelation 17:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse being described in these commentaries depicts a powerful and influential city that holds a spiritual significance beyond its physical presence. This city is identified as Rome, which has exercised its dominion over kings and is associated with the concept of reigning. However, the commentators emphasize that the woman, representing this city, is not limited to Rome alone but symbolizes a broader spiritual power that aligns itself with the world and exerts its influence for evil. This description ties together the themes of authority, control, and spiritual implications associated with the city of Rome in the biblical verse.
