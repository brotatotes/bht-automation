# Revelation 17:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This verse describes a powerful, seductive entity that represents the apostate Church, encompassing not only the corrupt practices of Rome but also the Church as a whole. It portrays this entity as a harlot, leading both rulers and ordinary people astray through idolatry, corruption, and false zeal. The kings of the earth have been deceived and enticed into partaking in her wickedness, while the inhabitants of the earth are intoxicated by her allure, blinded to the truth. This vivid imagery demonstrates the pervasive influence and destructive consequences of deviating from true faith.
