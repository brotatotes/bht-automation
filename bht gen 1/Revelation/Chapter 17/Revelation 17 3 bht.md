# Revelation 17:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse describes a powerful force represented by a scarlet-colored beast, which seeks to control and manipulate others. This force is guided by a woman, symbolizing the city of Rome or the apostate church. The woman's influence leads the beast to exhibit blasphemous pretensions, indicating a connection to the papacy. The vision is not a literal relocation but a spiritual ecstasy, allowing the author to witness the downfall of Rome and the beast's animalistic nature. The scene is laid in a wilderness to symbolize the future condition of this influential entity.
