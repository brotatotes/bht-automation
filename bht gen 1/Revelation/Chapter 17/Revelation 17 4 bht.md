# Revelation 17:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the imagery portrays a powerful and seductive entity that represents the corruption and compromise of the church. The woman, clothed in worldly splendor and luxury, deceives the nations with her allure. Her golden cup symbolizes her deceptive enticement, leading people astray. She is adorned in purple and scarlet, signifying her authority and influence. However, beneath her external grandeur lies abominable teachings and practices, as she juxtaposes hypocrisy with her superficial beauty.

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Whenever and wherever the Church, instead of being 'clothed (as at first, Revelation 12:1) with the sun' of heaven, is arrayed in earthly meretricious gauds, compromising the truth of God through fear, or flattery, of the world's power, science, or wealth, she becomes the harlot seated on the beast, and doomed in righteous retribution to be judged by the beast." 
2. "Instead of drinking her Lord's 'cup' of suffering, she has 'a cup full of abominations and filthinesses.'"
