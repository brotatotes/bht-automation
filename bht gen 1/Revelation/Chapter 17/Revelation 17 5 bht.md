# Revelation 17:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse describes a contrast between the holy saints with the name of God and the Lamb on their foreheads and the impudent church of Rome, labeled as "Mystery, Babylon the Great." The symbolic nature of the name implies the connection to the mystery of iniquity and the confusion of the church's doctrine, a mixture of Paganism, Judaism, and Christianity. This description sheds light on the significance of the label and its associations with idolatry and pride.
