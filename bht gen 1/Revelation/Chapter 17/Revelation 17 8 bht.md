# Revelation 17:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Bible verse is described as depicting a powerful and enigmatic figure known as the beast. Commentators note that this beast represents different entities, such as the Roman Empire, an emperor like Domitian, or even the devil himself. The beast's existence is described in three distinct periods: "was," "and is not," and a future ascent from the bottomless pit. Despite various interpretations, it is agreed that the beast ultimately meets its doom in perdition. The verse's vivid imagery and symbolic language convey the sense of awe and intrigue surrounding this impactful and ominous figure.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The time when the beast 'is not' is the time during which it has 'the deadly wound'; the time of the seventh head becoming Christian externally, when its beast-like character was put into suspension temporarily."
2. "The healing of its wound answers to its ascending out of the bottomless pit. The beast, or Antichristian world power, returns worse than ever, with satanic powers from hell."
3. "The continuance of this revived seventh (that is, the eighth) head is short: it is therefore called 'the son of perdition,' who is essentially doomed to it almost immediately after his appearance."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "There are three things affirmed here: first, that there is a sense in which it might be said of the power here referred to, that it 'was,' or that, before this, it had an existence."
2. "The 'beast' here referred to is the same that is mentioned in Revelation 17:3, and in Revelation 13:1, Revelation 13:3, Revelation 13:11-16."
3. "The power would seem to come up from the nether world. It would appear at one time to be extinct, but would revive again as if coming from the world over which Satan presides."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "To go into perdition [υπαγειν] . Some good texts read uJpagei, goeth." 
2. "In the book [επι] . Lit., upon." 
3. "From the foundation of the world. In ordinary New Testament Greek these words would belong to are written."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "In what is here said of the beast we have a travesty of what is said elsewhere of our Lord; and this alone compels us to think of something wider and more conspicuous than any single Emperor of Rome."
2. "The evil of the world, beheld by the Seer as concentrating itself in the Roman Empire, is to him the particular form in which the beast existed in his day."
3. "The ‘seven’ mountains are not literally seven. They symbolize a seat of evil as wide as was the good, if in the one case the one Catholic Church, in the other the one Catholic synagogue of Satan."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "This is a picture of the beast of Revelation 13:1 which the woman is riding, but no longer just the empire, but one of the emperors who died (ουκ εστιν, is not)." 
2. "Most interpreters see here an allusion to the 'Nero redivivus' expectancy realized in Domitian, who was ruling when John wrote and who was called Nero redivivus." 
3. "John had wondered (εθαυμασα) in verse Revelation 17:6 'with the amazement of a horrible surprise; the world will wonder and admire' (Swete)."

### John Gill:
1. "This beast is to be understood not of the devil, who 'was' the god of this world, 'is not', being cast out by Christ, and yet is in being."
2. "The Roman empire itself is intended, as we have seen, which carried and supported the Papacy."
3. "In short, the meaning is, that this beast 'was' the Roman empire, as Pagan, described by a dragon with seven heads, and ten horns, with crowns on the heads, but is not as yet in the Apostle John's time, as Papal, described with seven heads, and ten horns, and crowns on the horns."

### John Wesley:
1. "His whole duration is here divided into three periods, which are expressed in a fourfold manner."
2. "He, 1. Was; 2. And is not; 3. And will ascend out of the bottomless pit, and go into perdition."
3. "He, 1. Was; 2. And is not; 3. Even he is the eighth, and is one of the seven, and goeth into perdition."

These quotes highlight the division of the beast's duration into three periods and emphasize his eventual descent into perdition.
