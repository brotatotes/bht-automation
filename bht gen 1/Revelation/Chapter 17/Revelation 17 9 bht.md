## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The connection between mountains and kings must be deeper than the mere outward fact to which incidental allusion is made, that Rome (the then world city) is on seven hills."
2. "The true connection is, as the head is the prominent part of the body, so the mountain is prominent in the land. Like 'sea' and 'earth' and 'waters . . . peoples,' so 'mountains' have a symbolical meaning, namely, prominent seats of power."
3. "Especially such as are prominent hindrances to the cause of God, especially Babylon, in majestic contrast to which stands Mount Zion, 'the mountain of the Lord's house,' and the heavenly mount; 'a great and high mountain . . . and that great city, the holy Jerusalem.'"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Here is what requires wisdom to interpret it; or, here is a case in which the mind that shows itself able to explain it will evince true sagacity."
2. "It is undoubtedly implied that the symbol might be understood - whether in the time of John, or afterward, he does not say; but it was a matter which could not be determined by ordinary minds, or without an earnest application of the understanding."
3. "Referring, undoubtedly, to Rome - the seven-hilled city - Septicollis Roma."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Bespeaking attention and spiritual discernment for that which follows."
2. "Nouv is the organ of mental perception and apprehension - of conscious life, the mind, comprising the faculties of perceiving and understanding, of feeling, judging, determining."
3. "The reason, regarded as the faculty of perceiving divine things: of recognizing goodness and hating evil."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Here is the intelligence which has wisdom." 
2. "Rome was known as the city on seven hills."

### John Gill:
1. "Notwithstanding the interpretation of these things by the angel, yet it requires a large share of wisdom to understand them; and here is enough to exercise the mind that is ever so well stored with knowledge and understanding."
2. "The seven heads are seven mountains of which the woman sits, that is, they signify seven mountains, or are symbolical representations of them; just as the seven good kine, and seven good ears, in Pharaoh's dream, signified seven years of plenty, and seven thin kine, and seven empty ears, seven years of famine."
3. "This confirms that the beast before spoken of, on whom the woman sat, is the Roman empire, since she is here said to sit on the seven mountains, on which Rome, the metropolis of that empire, was built; and this shows the pope of Rome to be antichrist, the great whore, Babylon, the mother of harlots, since no other has his seat at Rome but he."
