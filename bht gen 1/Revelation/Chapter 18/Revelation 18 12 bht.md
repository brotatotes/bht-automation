# Revelation 18:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we see a contrast between the true church and the apostate church. The fine linen worn by the people of God represents their purity and righteousness bestowed upon them by God. However, the apostate church, represented by Egypt, is depicted as engaging in idolatry and worldly indulgence. The verse further highlights the opulence and luxury found in the apostate church, with mentions of precious stones, silk, and all manner of valuable vessels. This description serves as a cautionary reminder of the dangers of materialism and the importance of remaining steadfast in true faith.
