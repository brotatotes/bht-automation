# Revelation 18:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse describes a scene of indulgence and opulence, where various luxurious items are mentioned. Cinnamon, mentioned as an ingredient in holy anointing oil, is now desecrated by the adulteress. Frankincense, a true "incense" loved by God, is contrasted in its pure form with the false incense. The mention of souls of men and slaves alludes to the enslavement and exploitation of both physical bodies and spiritual selves. The reference to beasts and chariots highlights the lavishness of the setting, pointing to the excesses of the wealthy.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Cinnamon—designed by God for better purposes: being an ingredient in the holy anointing oil, and a plant in the garden of the Beloved; but desecrated to vile uses by the adulteress." 
2. "Frankincense—Contrast the true 'incense' which God loves." 
3. "Souls of men—Said of slaves. Appropriate to the spiritual harlot, apostate Christendom, especially Rome, which has so often enslaved both bodies and souls of men."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Cinnamon is the aromatic bark of the Laurus Cinnamomam, which grows in Arabia, India, and especially in the island of Ceylon. It was formerly, as it is now, a valuable article in the Oriental trade."
2. "And slaves - The Greek here is σωμάτων sōmatōn - 'of bodies.' Prof. Stuart renders it 'grooms,' and supposes that it refers to a particular kind of slaves who were employed in taking care of horses and carriages."
3. "And souls of men - The word used and rendered 'souls' - ψυχὰς psuchas - though commonly denoting the 'soul' (properly the 'breath' or 'vital principle'), is also employed to denote the living thing - the animal - in which the soul or vital principle resides; and hence may denote a person or a man."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Cinnamon, mentioned as one of the ingredients of the holy oil for anointing, and as a perfume for the bed." 
2. "A fragrant Indian plant, with seed in grape-like clusters, from which ointment was made."
3. "Chariots, a Latin word though of Gallic origin, had four wheels."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Cinnamon, a fragrant plant of India, for perfume." 
2. "Incense, used in the book of Revelation." 
3. "Fine flour, the finest wheaten flour, mentioned only here in the New Testament."

### John Gill:
1. "Cinnamon, odours, and frankincense may signify the perfumings and censings used in churches, or the burning incense in imitation of the sweet incense under the law."
2. "Ointments may denote their chrism, or anointing with oil at baptism."
3. "Wine is for the chalice, used in daily Masses, and drank only by the priests; 'oil' for chrism at baptism, and for the extreme unction; 'fine flour' for the Mass, or to make their breaden god of; and 'wheat, beasts, and sheep' for tithes for the clergy."

### John Wesley:
1. "And beasts — Cows and oxen." 
2. "And of chariots — a purely Latin word is here inserted in the Greek. This St. John undoubtedly used on purpose, in describing the luxury of Rome." 
3. "And souls of men — For these also are continually bought and sold at Rome. And this of all others is the most gainful merchandise to the Roman traffickers."
