# Revelation 18:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we see a vivid description of the downfall of a great city. Artists have tainted their crafts to support corrupted beliefs, and skilled artisans will vanish. The joyful sounds of music will be silenced, echoing the desolation of the city. Even the most intricate musical instruments, like harps, will no longer be heard. In addition, the loss of other professions, like skilled craftsmen and millers, will contribute to the sprawling devastation. Rome's demise is depicted as a place where the wealthy, the ordinary, and the destitute struggle to survive.
