# Revelation 18:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the description is given of a city, characterized by its luxury, idolatry, and shedding of the blood of prophets and saints. The city is found guilty of slaying the witnesses and has a clear title to catholic blood-guiltiness. It is heavily condemned for its immense quantities of bloodshed, from the past to the present, under both the pagan and papal Rome. The fall of this city, described in the chapter, is seen as a removal of an obstruction to the final triumph of the gospel.
