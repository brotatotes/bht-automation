The punishment will be proportional to the sins committed.

3. "Her sins have been so great that there has been a double mention of them, and the punishment shall be proportioned to the sin." - The repetition of the mention of the harlot's sins signifies the magnitude of her transgressions, and the punishment she will receive will be commensurate with the gravity of her offenses. This echoes the concept of divine justice seen in other biblical passages.
