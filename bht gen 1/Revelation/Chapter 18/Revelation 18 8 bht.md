# Revelation 18:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse in question depicts a catastrophic and devastating fate that awaits a defiant and faithless entity. The imminent plagues that will be unleashed upon it will arrive suddenly and relentlessly, bringing complete destruction and utter ruin. With divine justice and retribution, the consequences of its actions will catch up to it, and its once glorious and secure state will be turned into shame and despair. This doom is certain and inescapable, for the power of God, the ultimate judge, has pronounced and determined its fate.
