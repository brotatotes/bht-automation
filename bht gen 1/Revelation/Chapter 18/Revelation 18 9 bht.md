# Revelation 18:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the faithless and self-indulgent Church is condemned for its alliance with the great men of the world. The destruction of Babylon will lead to intense mourning and lamentation, symbolized by the weeping and wailing of kings. The catastrophic event will be characterized by the engulfing smoke of burning, signifying the severe consequences of Babylon's ruin. The fall of Babylon will also bring judgment upon earthly and idolatrous kings who were in communion with the Church of Rome. This event will serve as a signal for the imminent overthrow of thrones across Europe.
