This cautionary reminder emphasizes the importance of not allowing our emotions to overcome us and the significance of the Spirit of prophecy in bearing witness to Jesus.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "John's intending to worship the angel here, as in Revelation 19:10, on having revealed to him the glory of the new Jerusalem, is the involuntary impulse of adoring joy at so blessed a prospect."
2. "It exemplifies the corrupt tendencies of our fallen nature that even John, an apostle, should have all but fallen into 'voluntary humility and worshipping of angels,' which Paul warns us against."
3. "We angels, and you apostles, all alike have the testimony of (bear testimony concerning) Jesus by the operation of one and the same Spirit, who enables me to show you these revelations and enables you to record them: wherefore we are fellow servants, not I your lord to be worshipped by you."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "John was entirely overcome with the majesty of the heavenly messenger, and with the amazing truths that he had disclosed to him, and in the overflowing of his feelings he fell upon the earth in the posture of adoration."
2. "This may be regarded as an admonition to be careful in our worship; not to allow our feelings to overcome us; and not to render that homage to a creature which is due to God alone."
3. "The sentiment is, that in promoting religion in the world, we are associated with angels. It is no condescension in them to be engaged in the service of the Redeemer, though it seems to be condescension for them to be associated with us in anything; it constitutes no ground of merit in us to be engaged in the service of the Redeemer, though we may regard it as an honor to be associated with the angels, and it may raise us in conscious dignity to feel that we are united with them."

### Marvin Vincent:

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The angel reminds the Apostle that worship is due to God alone; that he himself is only his fellow-servant and the fellow-servant of all who have the witness of Jesus, whose personal possession the witness of Jesus is become."
2. "The words are spoken by the angel, and they contain the reason why, high as he may seem to be, he ought to be looked upon in no other light than as the fellow-servant of all who believe in Jesus."
3. "The argument is as follows: ‘All believers are witnesses of Jesus; I, because I prophesy, and because the witness of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy, am also a witness of Jesus; thou and I therefore occupy the same footing before God, and we must worship God alone."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "John either felt that the angel represented God or he was beside himself with excitement over the glorious consummation." 
2. "The angel refuses worship from John on this ground. All Christians are fellow-servants as Christ taught and as Paul and John taught." 
3. "The possession of the prophetic spirit shows itself in witness to Jesus."

2. "The words are in the original very short and concise, and are spoken in an abrupt manner, and in great haste; as fearing he would be guilty of idolatry, before he could speak all his mind, and use the arguments that were necessary to dissuade from it."
3. "The worshipping of which will now be no more, or at least will be quickly at an end."
