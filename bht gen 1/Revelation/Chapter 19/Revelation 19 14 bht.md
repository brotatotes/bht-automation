### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The armies...in heaven" refers to the glorified saints who will accompany Christ at His second coming. This aligns with the idea of "they that are with Him, called, chosen, faithful" and "His mighty angels." (Revelation 17:14)
2. The phrase "white and clean" can be translated as "pure," emphasizing the purity and righteousness of these heavenly armies. (Revelation 17:14)
3. The omission of the word "and" in the phrase "white and clean" is found in some ancient manuscripts and versions, suggesting that it may not be necessary for the understanding of the verse. (Revelation 17:14)

### Albert Barnes:
