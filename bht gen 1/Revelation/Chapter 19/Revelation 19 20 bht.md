# Revelation 19:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the first beast, representing the secular power, and the second beast, symbolizing the ecclesiastical power of Rome, are captured and defeated. The leaders of these powers are forcefully seized, reserved for severe punishment, and cast into the lake of fire, symbolizing the ultimate judgment for their deception and ungodliness. The punishment, described as the wrath of God, is intense and everlasting, reflecting the severity of their actions and refusal to repent. This event marks the end of false statecraft and false priestcraft, as the enemies of God face the righteous judgment they deserve.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Many expositors represent the first beast to be the secular, the second beast to be the ecclesiastical power of Rome; and account for the change of title for the latter from the 'other beast' to the 'false prophet,' is because by the judgment on the harlot, the ecclesiastical power will then retain nothing of its former character save the power to deceive."
2. "The first beast is a political power; the second is a spiritual powerâ€”the power of ideas. But both are beasts, the worldly Antichristian wisdom serving the worldly Antichristian power."
3. "The world at the highest development of its material and spiritual power is but a decorated carcass round which the eagles gather."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The general idea is, that these armies were overcome, and that the Messiah was victorious; but there is a propriety in the representation here that the leaders - the authors of the war should be taken captive, and reserved for severer punishment than death on the battlefield would be."
2. "The whole representation is that of an alliance to prevent the spread of the true religion, as if the papacy and Mohammedanism were combined, and the one was sustained by the pretended miracles of the other."
3. "The overthrow will be as signal, and the destruction as complete, as if the leaders of the combined hosts should be taken alive, and thrown into a pit or lake that burns with an intense heat."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The phrase 'was taken' implies a forceful and sudden action, indicating that the person or object was forcefully seized or captured." 

2. "The mention of 'lake' suggests a place of great depth and vastness, symbolizing the magnitude of the punishment or judgment being described." 

3. "The reference to 'brimstone' brings to mind the image of fire and sulfur, which signifies the intensity and everlasting nature of the punishment being described."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The description given in this verse can leave no doubt that we have here the two enemies of chap. 13, the beast and the lamb-like beast with the two horns." 
2. "The 'lake of fire' is again mentioned in chaps. Revelation 20:10; Revelation 20:14, and Revelation 21:8."
