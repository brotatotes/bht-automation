# Revelation 19:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the bride is presented as a glorious and spotless Church, adorned with righteousness bestowed by Christ Himself. This righteousness is symbolized by the bride's garments of fine linen, representing purity and innocence. It is not a superficial display, but rather a righteousness that becomes an integral part of the bride's being. Through Christ's gift, the Church is sanctified and made holy, prepared to meet the Bridegroom and enter into an everlasting union. This righteousness, both in terms of justification and sanctification, is not the Church's own, but a gracious bestowment from the Lord.
