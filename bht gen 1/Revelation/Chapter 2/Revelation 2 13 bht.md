## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Satan's seat—rather as the Greek is translated all through Revelation, 'throne.' Satan, in impious mimicry of God's heavenly throne, sets up his earthly throne."
2. "Æsculapius was worshipped there under the serpent form; and Satan, the old serpent, as the instigator of fanatical devotees of Æsculapius, and, through them, of the supreme magistracy at Pergamos, persecuted one of the Lord's people (Antipas) even to death."
3. "Antipas is another form for Antipater. SIMEON METAPHRASTES has a palpably legendary story, unknown to the early Fathers, that Antipas, in Domitian's reign, was shut up in a red-hot brazen bull, and ended his life in thanksgivings and prayers."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It does much to enable us to judge of character to know where people live. It is much more easy to be virtuous and pious in some circumstances than in others; and in order to determine how much credit is due to a man for his virtues, it is necessary to understand how much he has been called to resist, how many temptations he has encountered." 
2. "In order to judge correctly of those who have embraced error, or have been led into sin, it is necessary to understand what there may have been in their circumstances that gave to error what was plausible, and to sin what was attractive." 
3. "The great essential element in the Christian religion is faith, and this, since it is so important, is often put for the whole of religion."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The word throne is used in the New Testament to represent Satan as exercising dominion there."
2. "The word throne is also used to represent the seats of the elders and the judicial tribunal."
3. "Antipas, mentioned in the verse, is a martyr with no other record."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The purpose of the writer being to contrast the throne of Satan with the throne of God, of which it is the evil and mocking counterpart, and thus to point with peculiar emphasis to the temptations and dangers which the Christians of Pergamos had to encounter."
2. "The true explanation seems to be that in Pergamos persecution first culminated, reaching even to the shedding of Christian blood."
3. "Even in such a city, however, the church had been found faithful, for it is said to it, 'Thou boldest fast My name.'"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Satan's 'throne' or seat of power...made Pergamum indeed a very throne of Satan." 
2. "This church refused to say Κυριος Καισαρ and continued to say Κυριος Ιησους. They stood true against the emperor-worship."
3. "Antipas, faithful unto death, was killed among you. Proof of the throne of Satan, 'where Satan dwells.'"

### John Gill:
1. "Pergamos was a city very much given to idolatry, here Satan reigned while it was Pagan, and so was a fit emblem of the idolatrous church of Rome."
2. "Moreover, he may be called so for his enmity and malice against the saints, and for his art and subtlety, and insidious methods to ensnare and destroy them."
3. "They had the truths of the Gospel in their possession, which were dear and valuable to them; and whereas there was danger of losing them, they held them fast, with great courage, magnanimity, and strength."

### John Wesley:
1. "Where the throne of Satan is — Pergamos was above measure given to idolatry: so Satan had his throne and full residence there."
2. "Thou holdest fast my name — Openly and resolutely confessing me before men."
3. "Even in the days wherein Antipas — Martyred under Domitian."
4. "Was my faithful witness — Happy is he to whom Jesus, the faithful and true witness, giveth such a testimony!"
