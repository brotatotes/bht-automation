1. "Few—in comparison of the many tokens of thy faithfulness."
2. "The teaching of Balaam, namely, that which he taught Balak."
3. "The temptation to eat idol-meats was a peculiarly strong one to the Gentile converts."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The charge against this church, however, is somewhat different from that against the church at Ephesus. The charge there was, that they had 'left their first love'; but it is spoken in commendation of them that they 'hated the deeds of the Nicolaitanes.'"
2. "The meaning is, that they taught substantially the same doctrine which Balaam did, and deserved to be classed with him."
3. "The attitude of Balaam’s mind in the matter was this: I. He had a strong desire to do what he knew was wrong, and which was forbidden expressly by God. II. He was restrained by internal checks and remonstrances, and prevented from doing what he wished to do. III. He cast about for some way in which he might do it, notwithstanding these internal checks and remonstrances, and finally accomplished the same thing in fact, though in form different from that which he had first prepared."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The act of sacrifice, among all ancient nations, was a social no less than a religious act. Commonly only a part of the victim was consumed as an offering, and the rest became the portion of the priests, was given to the poor, or was sold again in the markets. Hence sacrifice and feast were identified."
2. "Thus, for the Gentile, refusal to partake of the idol-meats involved absence from public and private festivity, a withdrawal, in great part, from the social life of his time."
3. "The eating of things sacrificed to idols was more and more a crucial test, involving a cowardly shrinking from the open confession of a Christian's faith."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The defects of the church are next alluded to." 
2. "There were in Pergamos some that held fast the teaching of Balaam." 
3. "It is to be observed that these teachers of erroneous doctrine, these seducers to grievous sin, were not merely inhabitants of the city; they were members of the church."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "A party in the church that resisted emperor-worship, to the death in the case of Antipas, yet were caught in the insidious wiles of the Nicolaitans which the church in Ephesus withstood." 
2. "These early Gnostics practised licentiousness as a principle since they were not under law, but under grace." 
3. "Balaam, as Josephus and Philo also say, showed Balak how to set a trap for the Israelites by beguiling them into the double sin of idolatry and fornication, which often went together (and do so still)."

### John Gill:
1. "The members of this church...were a stumbling block, and a snare to others to join in their idolatry and superstition."
2. "The instruction Balaam gave to Balak...was that Balak should get some of the most beautiful women in his kingdom to ply the men of Israel, and draw them into uncleanness, and so to idolatry."
3. "By Balaam may be meant the pope of Rome, for that name signifies, 'the lord of the people'; and is very appropriate to him, who in this interval took upon him to be universal bishop, and lorded it over both church and state, in a most haughty and tyrannical manner."

### John Wesley:
1. "Them that hold the doctrine of Balaam - Doctrine nearly resembling his."
2. "To cast a stumblingblock before the sons of Israel - They are generally termed, the children, but here, the sons, of Israel, in opposition to the daughters of Moab, by whom Balaam enticed them to fornication and idolatry."
3. "To eat things sacrificed to idols - Which, in so idolatrous a city as Pergamos, was in the highest degree hurtful to Christianity."
