### Henry Alford:
1) "Thus thou also hast... men holding the teaching of the Nicolaitans." 
2) "It is most according to the sense of the passage to understand these sins in the case of the Nicolaitans, as in that of those whom Balaam tempted, literally, and not mystically."
3) "The whole sense of the passage is against the idea of the identity of the Balaamites and the Nicolaitans; and would be in fact destroyed by it."

1. "Various considerations may be urged in favour of the latter view: (1) Of the Nicolaitans as a separate sect nothing is known...we may safely regard it as a mere conjecture intended to explain the apparent meaning of the words before us."
2. "The position of the word ‘also’ in the verse is to be noticed...the ancient church had its Balaamites, thou hast thy Nicolaitans."
3. "In these circumstances, it becomes a highly probable supposition that the word Nicolaitans is a rough translation into Greek of the Hebrew term Balaamites, destroyers or conquerors of the people."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Thou and the church at Pergamum as Israel had the wiles of Balaam."
