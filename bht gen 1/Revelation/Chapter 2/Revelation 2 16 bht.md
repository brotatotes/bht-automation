3. "Many expositors (e. g., Grot., Wetst., Vitr., Beng., Stern, Hengst., Trench, al.) suppose an allusion to the sword of the angel, armed with which he withstood Balaam in the way (Numbers 22:23 ; Num 22:31 ), or to that and the sword by which those who sinned in the matter of Baal-peor ( Num 25:5 ), and eventually Balaam himself ( Num 31:8 ), were slain."
