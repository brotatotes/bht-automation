2. "Believers are now hidden, even as their meat is hidden. As the manna in the sanctuary, unlike the other manna, was incorruptible, so the spiritual feast offered to all who reject the world's dainties for Christ is everlasting: an incorruptible body and life forever in Christ at the resurrection."
3. "The 'new name' is Christ's: some new revelation of Himself which shall hereafter be imparted to His people, and which they alone are capable of receiving."

Note: The commentary is quite lengthy, so I had to condense it significantly to meet the word limit.

### Philip Schaff:
1) "The manna laid up in the ark was not for food, but in memory of food once enjoyed. It seems better, therefore, to place the emphasis on the thought of the manna itself, that bread from heaven by which Israel was nourished in the wilderness." 
2) "The 'white stone'...we may also reject the supposition that the white stone has no more importance than as a medium for the name written on it." 
3) "What seems almost condusive upon this point is, that we learn from other passages of this book that it was upon the forehead that the peculiar mark of the child of God was borne."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Christ is the true bread from heaven and that may be the idea here. Those faithful to Christ will have transcendent fellowship with him." 
2. "The white stone with one's name on it was used to admit one to entertainments and also as an amulet or charm." 
3. "The man himself may be the ψηφος on which the new name is written. 'The true Christian has a charmed life'."

### John Gill:
1. "To him that overcometh; the Balaamites and Nicolaitans, and do not give in to the doctrines and practices of the one, or of the other, whatever persecution and trouble he meets with, and endures on that account."
2. "The allusion is to the manna which the Israelites ate of in the wilderness, which may be called 'hidden': either because they knew not what it was, when they first saw it; or because it was laid up in a golden pot, and put in the most holy place, where it was secret, and none but the high priest could see it."
3. "The phrase, 'to add a white stone', with the Latins, is used to give one's approbation of anything; and could it be applied here, might signify the approbation Christ gives of his church and people here, amidst the testimonies they bear, and the persecutions they endure for his name's sake."

### John Wesley:
1. "The new name answers to this: it is now 'hid with Christ in God.'"
2. "The heavenly ark of the covenant appears under the trumpet of the seventh angel... It seems properly to mean, the full, glorious, everlasting fruition of God."
3. "Here may be an allusion to both [the practice of voting with stones and writing on stones]."
