1. "In Thyatira, a centre of trade, especially for the royal purple, home of Lydia of Philippi, shown by inscriptions to be full of trade guilds, Apollo the chief deity with no emperor-worship, centre of activity by the Nicolaitans with their idolatry and licentiousness under a 'prophetess' who defied the church there."

1. "Thyatira is the same as Thygatira, which signifies a 'daughter'; and it had its name... when the virgin Mary, whom the Romanists call the daughter of God, was more worshipped than her son; and was not only made a partner with him in the business of salvation, but even set above him."
2. "Christ makes use of [the title 'Son of God'] to assert his proper deity, as being of the same nature, and having the same perfections with his Father, as well as to command the greater regard to what he ordered to be written to the churches; and chiefly in opposition to the effeminate state of this church."
3. "His eyes like unto a flame of fire... expressing fury, wrath, and vengeance against the Romish antichrist and his followers; and may also design the light of Gospel doctrine, which broke out in those times at certain seasons, to the dispelling of Popish darkness in some measure."
