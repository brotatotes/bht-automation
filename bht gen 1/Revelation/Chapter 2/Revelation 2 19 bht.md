## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "faith and service." The four are subordinate to "thy works"; thus, "I know thy works, even the love and the faith (these two forming one pair, as 'faith works by love,' :-), and the service (ministration to the suffering members of the Church, and to all in spiritual or temporal need), and the endurance of (that is, shown by) thee (this pronoun belongs to all four)."
2. "As love is inward, so service is its outward manifestation."
3. "Similarly, faith and persevering endurance, or 'patient continuance (the same Greek as here, Romans 2:7) in well-doing,' are connected."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He knew all they had done, good and bad."
2. "Love; love to God, and love to man."
3. "The word here would include not only trust in Christ for salvation, but what is the proper result of such trust - fidelity in his service."
4. "Patient endurance of the sorrows of life - of all that God brought upon them in any way, to test the reality of their religion."
5. "Those which had been recently performed were more numerous, and more commendable, than those which had been rendered 'formerly.' That is, they were making progress."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The fact commended is that there is progress in them all." 
2. "The path of the church has been as the morning light shining unto the perfect day."

1. "Good works, as appears from the particular enumeration of them afterwards, and the commendation of proficiency in them, the last being more than the first."
2. "Charity, by which is meant not a relieving the wants of the poor; much less such a charity as connives at the errors and heresies of men; but the divine grace of love to God and Christ, and the saints."
3. "The faithfulness, both of the ministers and private believers of those times, as the Waldenses and Albigenses, the Lollards and Wickliffites, who abode by, and were faithful to the light which they had received."

### John Wesley:
1. "I know thy love â€” How different a character is this from that of the angel of the church at Ephesus!"
