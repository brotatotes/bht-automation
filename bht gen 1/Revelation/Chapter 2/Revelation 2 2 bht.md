## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "I know thy works—expressing His omniscience. Not merely 'thy professions, desires, good resolutions' (Revelation 14:13, end)."
2. "thy labour—Two oldest manuscripts omit 'thy'; one supports it. The Greek means 'labor unto weariness.'"
3. "bear—evil men are a burden which the Ephesian Church regarded as intolerable. We are to 'bear (the same Greek, Revelation 14:13- :) one another's burdens' in the case of weak brethren; but not to bear false brethren."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It is designed to impress upon them deeply the conviction that he was intimately acquainted with all that they did, good and bad, and that therefore he was abundantly qualified to dispense rewards or administer punishments according to truth and justice."
2. "They had patiently borne the opposition made to the truth, they had manifested a spirit of firm endurance amidst many arts of those opposed to them to draw them off from simple faith in Christ."
3. "The point here commended in the Ephesian church is, that they had sought to have a 'pure ministry,' a ministry whose claims were well founded. They had felt the importance of this, had carefully examined the claims of pretenders, and had refused to recognize those who could not show, in a proper manner, that they had been designated to their work by the Lord Jesus."

3. "It is the stranger, as this hatred of evil, purely as evil, however little thought of or admired now, is eminently a Christian grace."

### Philip Schaff:
1) "I know thy works, and thy toil and patience... These works are then resolved into two parts; ‘toil,’ which is more than labour in the service of the Lord; and ‘patience,’ which is more than the passive virtue commonly represented by that word."
2) "And that thou canst not bear evil men... The Ephesian church had a holy impatience of those who, by their evil deeds, brought disgrace upon the Christian name, and she is commended for it."
3) "And thou didst try them that call themselves apostles... The Ephesian Christians had ‘tried,’ and in trying had discovered their false pretensions."

### John Gill:
1. "Christ, as the omniscient God, knows all the works of his people, and the springs, and principles, and ends, and views of them, whether they are done in obedience to him, and spring from love to him, and are performed in his strength, and by his grace, and are directed to his glory."
2. "The work of the ministry is a laborious work to the mind in studying, and to the body in the outward discharge of it; and it becomes more so, through the malice and opposition of enemies, and the weakness of friends; and such as are diligent and laborious deserve respect, even double honour; and though they may not have it from men, yet Christ takes notice of them and their labours, and commends them for them, and will reward them."
3. "The primitive ministers and churches could not bear men that lived immoral lives, and held erroneous doctrines; they had an inward abhorrence and detestation of them in their minds; they could not bear them in communion with them; they admonished them according to the nature of their offence, and cast out such as were obstinate and incorrigible; they withdrew from such as were disorderly, and rejected heretics after the first and second admonition; their zeal for church discipline is here taken notice of to their commendation."

### John Wesley:
1. "Weighty word, 'I know,' how dreadful will it one day sound to the wicked, how sweet to the righteous!"
2. "The churches and their angels must have been astonished, to find their several states so exactly described, even in the absence of the apostle, and could not but acknowledge the all-seeing eye of Christ and of his Spirit."
3. "Happy is he that conceives less good of himself, than Christ knows concerning him."
