## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The figure of 'Jezebel thy wife' being once recognized in its historical import, it would not be needful that an individual woman should be found to answer to it: the conscience of the Thyatiran church could not fail to apply the severe reproof to whatever influence was being exerted in the direction here indicated."
2. "The denunciation of such a teacher under such a title would be at once startling and decisive."
3. "The fact that this was the prevalent direction of the false teaching of the day, is important in a chronological point of view."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The symbolical Jezebel was to the Church of Thyatira what Jezebel, Ahab's 'wife,' was to him."
2. "Like her father, she was swift to shed blood. Wholly given to Baal worship, like Eth-baal, whose name expresses his idolatry, she, with her strong will, seduced the weak Ahab and Israel beyond the calf-worship to that of Baal."
3. "Her spiritual counterpart at Thyatira lured God's 'servants' by pretended utterances of inspiration to the same libertinism, fornication, and eating of idol-meats, as the Balaamites and Nicolaitanes."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Jezebel was the wife of Ahab; a woman of vast influence over her husband - an influence which was uniformly exerted for evil."
2. "The kind of character, therefore, which would be designated by the term as used here, would be that of a woman who was artful and persuasive in her manner; who was capable of exerting a wide influence over others; who had talents of a high order; who was a thorough advocate of error."
3. "Every sentiment of our nature makes us feel that it is right to expect that if a woman teaches at all in a public manner, she should inculcate only what is true and holy - she should be an advocate of a pure life."

### Philip Schaff:
1) "The very head and front of the church’s sin was, not that it merely tolerated false teaching and sinful practices in its midst, but that it had allied itself with them." 
2) "The sins into which the persons alluded to sought to betray the church are now mentioned. They are the sins already spoken of in the case of Pergamos; yet there is at the same time an important distinction." 
3) "At Pergamos the evil came from an outward source, Balaam; at Thyatira from an inward source, Jezebel."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The woman Jezebel: Symbolical name for some prominent woman in the church in Thyatira, like the infamous wife of Ahab who was guilty of whoredom and witchcraft." 
2. "She is the pastor's wife! Which calleth herself a prophetess: Nominative articular participle of λεγω in apposition with the accusative γυναικα like ο μαρτυς in apposition with Αντιπας in Revelation 2:13." 
3. "This woman was not a real prophetess, but a false one with loud claims and loose living."

### John Gill:
1. "The impartiality of Christ may be observed in taking notice of the bad deeds, as well as of the good ones of his people."
2. "By her is meant the apostate church of Rome, comparable to Jezebel, the wife of Ahab."
3. "As Jezebel stirred up Ahab against good and faithful men, so has this church stirred up the secular powers against the true followers of Christ."

### John Wesley:
1. "But thou sufferest that woman Jezebel — who ought not to teach at all" - This verse highlights the issue of allowing a woman named Jezebel to teach, despite the belief that women should not hold such positions. 

2. "To teach and seduce my servants" - The commentary emphasizes that Jezebel's teaching was not only about imparting knowledge but also about leading people astray and seducing them into idolatry.

3. "This Jezebel, fitly called by her name, from the resemblance between their works, led them to partake in the idolatry of the heathens" - The comparison between the biblical Jezebel and the woman in question suggests that she was leading the people into idolatry, just as Jezebel did in the past.
