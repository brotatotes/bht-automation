# Revelation 2:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, there is a transition from literal to spiritual fornication which is likened to Jehovah's covenant relationship with the Old Testament Church. The sin has been long standing, but now there is no more room for delay and the judgment of God is imminent. The delay in executing judgment was meant to lead the transgressors to repentance, but they obstinately refused. Though granted time, opportunity, and warnings, they chose not to repent. The power of Christ is great, but ultimately, repentance is the gift of God that can be rejected by man.
