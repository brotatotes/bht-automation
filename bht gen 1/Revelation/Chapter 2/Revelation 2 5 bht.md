### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Not merely 'feel thy first feelings,' but do works flowing from the same principle as formerly, 'faith which worketh by love.'"
2. "I will take away the Church from Ephesus and remove it elsewhere. 'It is removal of the candlestick, not extinction of the candle, which is threatened here; judgment for some, but that very judgment the occasion of mercy for others.'"
3. "The seat of the Church has been changed, but the Church itself survives. What the East has lost, the West has gained."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The duty here enjoined is, when religion has declined in our hearts, or in the church, to call to distinct recollection the former state - the ardor, the zeal, the warmth of love which once characterized us."
2. "Nothing is better adapted to affect a backsliding Christian, or a backsliding church, than to call to distinct recollection the former condition - the happier days of piety."
3. "The counsel of the Saviour to all such, however, is to do their first works. It is to engage at once in doing what they did in the first and best days of their piety, the days of their 'espousals' to God."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Its candlestick has been for centuries removed out of his place; the squalid Mohammedan village which is nearest to its site does not count one Christian in its insignificant population; its temple is a mass of shapeless ruins; its harbor is a reedy pool; the bittern booms amid its pestilent and stagnant marshes; and malaria and oblivion reign supreme over the place where the wealth of ancient civilization gathered around the scenes of its grossest superstitions and its most degraded sins" (Farrar, "Life and Work of Paul," 2, 43, 44).

2. The Nicolaitans taught that, in order to master sensuality, one must know the whole range of it by experience; and that he should therefore abandon himself without reserve to the lusts of the body, since they concerned only the body and did not touch the spirit.

3. "The Nicolaitans are the Balaamites; no sect bearing the one name or the other; but those who, in the new dispensation, repeated the sin of Balaam in the old, and sought to overcome or destroy the people of God by the same temptations whereby Balaam had sought to overcome them before."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Remember therefore from whence thou hast fallen; her first condition being regarded as a height."
2. "Works’ are here to be understood in that widest sense of the word peculiar to St. John. The Lord does not bid His Church act as if acting were everything and feeling nothing. Feeling is rather the thing mainly thought of."
3. "The removal of the church’s candlestick denotes removal from her high standing and privileges in the sanctuary of God. There is nothing here of what has been described as simply ‘the removal of the candlestick, not the extinction of the candle; judgment for some, but that very judgment the occasion of mercy for others.’"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Continue mindful" - The imperative to remember serves as a call to reflect on the past and the state of fallenness.
2. "Urgent appeal for instant change" - The imperative to repent emphasizes the need for immediate transformation in attitude and behavior.
3. "Do at once" - The imperative to do implies the urgency of taking action and not delaying in restoring the first love that has grown cold.

1. "Believers cannot totally and finally fall away from the grace which they have received; but they may fall into sin, and from a degree of grace, and the exercise of it."
2. "They are called upon to remember, mind, and observe from what degree of [grace] they were fallen; in order to bring them under a conviction and acknowledgment of their evil, and a sense of their present state, and to quicken their desires after a restoration to their former one."
3. "Former good works are to be remembered and done, to show the truth of repentance for evil ones."


### John Wesley:
1. "Remember from whence thou art fallen — From what degree of faith, love, holiness, though perhaps insensibly." 
2. "Do the first works — Outwardly and inwardly, or thou canst never regain the first love." 
3. "I will remove, unless thou repent, the flock now under thy care to another place, where they shall be better taken care of."
