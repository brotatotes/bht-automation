2. "To him that conquereth, I will give to him to eat: not in the ordinary sense of giving to eat."
3. "The promise, and its expression, are in the closest connexion with our Lord’s discourse in John 6:0, as will be seen by comparing Genesis 3:22, μή ποτε ἐκτείνῃ τὴν χεῖρα αὐτοῦ, καὶ λάβῃ ἀπὸ τοῦ ξύλου τῆς ζωῆς, καὶ φάγῃ, καὶ ζήσεται εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα, with John 6:51, ἐάν τις φάγῃ ἐκ τούτου τοῦ ἄρτου, ζήσεται εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Every man 'hath an ear' naturally, but he alone will be able to hear spiritually to whom God has given 'the hearing ear'; whose 'ear God hath wakened' and 'opened.'" 
2. "What Christ saith, the Spirit saith; so one are the Second and Third Persons."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The attributes here referred to are, that he was 'the first and the last,' that 'he had been dead, but was alive' - attributes suited to impress the mind deeply with reverence for him who addressed them, and to comfort them in the trials which they endured." 
2. "An exhortation not to be afraid of any of those things that were to come upon them, for, although they were to be persecuted, and some of them were to be imprisoned, yet, if they were faithful, they should have a crown of life." 
3. "The language addressed to the church of Smyrna is throughout that of commiseration and comfort. There is no intimation that the Saviour disapproved of what they had done; there is no threat that he would remove the candle-stick out of its place."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The phrase is not found in John's Gospel. It is used always of radical truths, great principles and promises."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches." - These words are found in all the seven Epistles, but with a different position in some of them as compared with others. No student of the Apocalypse will doubt that this difference is designed, and that although he may be unable to say what the design is.

2. "To him that overcometh." - The expression is a characteristic one with St. John. It occurs in each of the seven Epistles, as also in chap. Revelation 21:7. It is used of Christ Himself.

3. "I will give to him to eat out of the tree of life, which is in the paradise of God." - The true answer seems to be that it is Christ Himself. Who but the Lord Jesus Christ is that fulness 'out of' which all believers eat and live?

2. "Let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches; let such hearken, and listen with attention to what is said by the Spirit, in what goes before, and follows after, in this epistle, designed for the use of all the churches."
3. "And moreover, it may be concluded from hence, that there are in this epistle, and so in all the rest, for the same words are subjoined to them all, some things which are parabolical and prophetic, and not obvious to everyone's understanding and view."

### John Wesley:
1. "He that hath an ear, let him hear — Every man, whoever can hear at all, ought carefully to hear this."
