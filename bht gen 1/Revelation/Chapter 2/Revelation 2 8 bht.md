# Revelation 2:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the city of Smyrna, a prosperous and wealthy center of commerce, the Church faced bitter afflictions and persecutions, which were compared to the bitter taste of myrrh. However, their sufferings for Christ were pleasing to Him, as the fragrance of myrrh. Despite their hardships, they were encouraged by the promise of being raised to life just as Christ, the "first and the last" who was once dead but is now alive, had conquered death. This assurance brings comfort and strength to face any challenges or persecutions, reminding them of Christ's triumph over death and His eternal life.
