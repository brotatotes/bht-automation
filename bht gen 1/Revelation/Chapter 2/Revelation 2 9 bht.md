1. "There are both poor rich-men, and rich poor-men in God's sight."
2. "The Jews, who might have been 'the Church of God,' had now, by their opposition and unbelief, become the synagogue of Satan."
3. "So 'the throne of Satan' represents the heathens' opposition to Christianity; 'the depths of Satan,' the opposition of heretics."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Poverty is no hindrance to the favor of God, and there are some things in it which are favorable to the promotion of a right spirit toward God which are not found where there is abundant wealth."
2. "The poor should always be cheerful and happy, if they can hear their Saviour saying unto them, 'I know thy poverty - but thou art rich.'"
3. "The meaning here is plain, that though they worshipped in a synagogue, and professed to be the worshippers of God, yet they were not worthy of the name, and deserved rather to be regarded as in the service of Satan."

### Marvin Vincent:

1. "I know thy tribulation. The word ‘tribulation’ is to be understood in the general sense of affliction, suffering, but with a special reference to persecution brought upon believers for stedfastness in their Master’s cause." 
2. "Like all the churches of that early time, the church at Smyrna was composed of members for the most part poor. ‘Not many rich, not many noble, were called.’ But in the possession of a better inheritance it was ‘rich,’ ‘rich in faith, and an heir of the kingdom which the Lord promised to them that love Him’."
