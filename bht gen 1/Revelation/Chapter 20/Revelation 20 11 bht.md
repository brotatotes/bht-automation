# Revelation 20:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this powerful and awe-inspiring vision, a great white throne is revealed, symbolizing the supreme authority and purity of the one who sits upon it. This throne, associated with the judgment of the wicked, represents the righteous judge, Jesus Christ, accompanied by the Almighty Father. As His presence is unveiled, the earth and heavens flee away, shaking under His divine presence, for no place is found for them. The dissolution of all things underscores the magnitude of His majestic and severe but honorable presence on the throne.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Great" - The greatness of the one who sits on the white throne is emphasized, contrasting with the thrones mentioned in Revelation 20:4. This signifies the supreme authority and power of the one who will judge all.
2. "White" - The color white symbolizes purity and justice. It represents the righteous judgment that will be carried out by the one who sits on the throne.
3. "God in Christ" - The one who sits on the throne is identified as the Son, to whom the Father has entrusted all judgment. This highlights the role of Jesus Christ as the mediator between God and humanity, and the ultimate authority in the final judgment.

### Albert Barnes:

3. "When the Son of God shall descend in his glory to judge the world, the earth and all other worlds shall seem to vanish."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The throne that is seen is ‘great,’ not so much in contrast with the thrones of Revelation 20:4, as in correspondence with the Great Being who sits upon it."
2. "It is also ‘white,’ emblematic of His perfect purity and righteousness."
3. "From before His face the earth and the heavens flee away, they are completely removed, time and earth and all that belongs to them coming to an end."

2. "It is best therefore to understand it of the general judgment at the last day, which is the common sense of ancient and modern interpreters; though it seems only to regard the judgment of the wicked, for no other are made mention of in it."

### John Wesley:
1. "A great white throne — How great, who can say? White with the glory of God, of him that sat upon it,-Jesus Christ."
2. "From whose face the earth and the heaven fled away - Probably both the aerial and the starry heaven; which 'shall pass away with a great noise.'"
