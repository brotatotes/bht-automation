# Revelation 20:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the final judgment, all the dead, both the wicked and the righteous, will stand before the majestic presence of God. The books containing a collection of records and accounts will be opened, while the book of life, a symbol of God's grace, will be a testament to those who will be saved. The judgment will be based on written evidence, revealing the true character of every individual. In this moment, hidden things will be brought to light, and every person will come to know themselves with the utmost precision.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The godly who were transfigured and reigned with Christ during it, shall also be present, not indeed to have their portion assigned as if for the first time, but to have it confirmed for ever, and that God's righteousness may be vindicated in the case of both the saved and the lost, in the presence of an assembled universe."
2. "The saints having been first pronounced just themselves by Christ out of 'the book of life,' shall sit as assessors of the Judge."
3. "The books of God's remembrance, alike of the evil and the good: conscience, the word of Christ, the law, God's eternal counsel."
4. "Besides the general book recording the works of all, there is a special book for believers in which their names are written, not for their works, but for the work of Christ for, and in, them."
5. "We are justified by faith, but judged according to (not by) our works. For the general judgment is primarily designed for the final vindication of God's righteousness before the whole world."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The fair meaning in this place therefore is, that all the dead would be there, and of course this would preclude the idea of a 'previous' resurrection of any part of the dead, as of the saints, at the beginning of the millennium."
2. "None can judge the secrets of the heart; none can pronounce on the moral character of all mankind, of all countries and ages, and determine their everlasting allotment, but he who is divine."
3. "The final judgment will proceed on the record that has been made. It will not be arbitrary, and will not be determined by rank, condition, or profession, but it will be according to the record."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Before God" - This phrase should be understood as "before the throne of God," emphasizing the majestic and divine presence of God.

2. "The books [βιβλια]. No article. Read books." - The absence of the definite article suggests that these are not specific books but rather a collection of records or accounts. This highlights the idea of divine judgment and the recording of every action and thought.

3. "Book of life" - This phrase refers to a specific book that contains the names of those who have been granted eternal life. It is a symbol of God's grace and mercy, as those whose names are written in this book will be saved.

4. "Compare Daniel 7:10" - This reference to the book of Daniel helps to establish a connection between the visions and prophecies found in both books. It highlights the continuity of God's plan throughout history and the ultimate judgment that awaits all people.

5. "See on ch. Revelation 3:5" - This cross-reference directs readers to another passage in the book of Revelation that discusses the concept of the book of life. It encourages readers to explore further insights and connections within the text.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "All the dead, not only the wicked, but (as some think) certain classes of the righteous who had had no part in the ‘first resurrection,’ or (as others think) the righteous without exception, are supposed to be included."
2. "The ‘dead,’ therefore, are here the wicked alone; and the ‘books’ contain a record of no deeds but theirs."
3. "The words ‘another book’ show that this book is quite distinct from the ‘books’ before mentioned, and that ‘the books’ now spoken of are the ‘books’ of the previous clause."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "The record of each human being has been kept in God's books."
2. "The sentence upon each rests upon written evidence."
3. "We are saved by grace, but character at last (according to their works) is the test as the fruit of the tree."

### John Gill:
1. "It cannot be thought they were dead when they stood before the throne, but were raised from the dead; for this character is not descriptive of them as dead in trespasses and sins, though they are such as die in their sins, and rise in them, who are meant, but as having been corporeally dead."
2. "This description respects them as they are in this world, and is designed to show that no consideration whatever, of age, condition, or character, will exempt them from the general judgment."
3. "The books were opened; the book of God's omniscience, which contains all the actions of the wicked, in which all their sins are taken notice of, and will now be brought to light; and the book of his remembrance, in which they are all written as with a pen of iron, and with the point of a diamond; and the book of the creatures, which they have abused, and which will witness against them; and the book of providence, the riches of whose goodness have been despised by them; and the book of the Scriptures, both of law and Gospel, as well as the book of nature, of the light of nature."
4. "No other use seems to be made of this book in the judgment of the wicked, than only to observe whose names were not written in it."
5. "They were sentenced to everlasting condemnation and death, according to the just demerit of their wicked works; for no other are done by wicked men, nor can any other be in the books, since they are without God and Christ, and destitute of the Spirit, have no principle of grace to act from, nor any good end in view in any action of theirs."

### John Wesley:
1. "O how many hidden things will then come to light; and how many will have quite another appearance than they had before in the sight of men!"
2. "The book of God's omniscience, that of conscience will then exactly tally."
3. "Then, particularly, shall every man know himself, and that with the last exactness."
