# Revelation 20:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this passage, commentators describe a powerful scene where various elements of creation give up their dead. The sea symbolizes the troubled and sinful world, releasing the bodies of those who had been buried beneath its depths. Death and Hades, inseparable as ever, relinquish the souls they have held captive. This reunion allows each individual to face judgment based on their actions in life. It is a moment of both great significance and magnitude, as bodies and souls are reunited in preparation for their ultimate destiny.
