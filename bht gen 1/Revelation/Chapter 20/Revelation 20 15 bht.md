# Revelation 20:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse being described depicts the final judgment, where the righteous are not specifically mentioned as their bliss had already begun. However, the inclusion in the book of life is critical for salvation, and the absence of one's name results in being cast into the lake of fire. The verse emphasizes the universal invitation to salvation, the importance of personal faith, and the consequence of not being included in the book of life. The lake of fire represents eternal punishment, paralleled with the destructive symbolism of the lake Asphaltites.
