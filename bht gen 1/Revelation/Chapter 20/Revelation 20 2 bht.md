# Revelation 20:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, a powerful confrontation takes place as a figure seizes the ancient serpent, the devil, and Satan. The dragon, symbolizing the wickedness and deception in the world, is confronted with superior force, leading to a thousand-year period of immunity from evil and a flourishing of blessings. The binding of the devil during this time restrains his ability to disturb or deceive, bringing peace to the saints and safeguarding them from the nations' persecution. The significance of this event, shrouded in mystery, lies in its connection to the redemptive work of Christ, His cross, and His glorious victory.
