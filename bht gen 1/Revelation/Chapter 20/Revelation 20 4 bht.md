## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Though in one sense having to stand before the judgment-seat of Christ, yet in another sense they 'do not come into judgment, but have already passed from death unto life.'" 
2. "From Psalms 49:11-15, I infer that 'souls' is here used in the strict sense of spirits disembodied when first seen by John though doubtless 'souls' is often used in general for persons, and even for dead bodies."
3. "The martyrs are put first, because most like Jesus in their sufferings and death, therefore nearest Him in their life and reign; for Christ indirectly affirms there are relative degrees and places of honor in His kingdom, the highest being for those who drink his cup of suffering."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "John seems to have assumed that it would be understood who were meant. And yet to us it is not entirely clear; for John has not before this given us any such intimation that we can determine with certainty what is intended."
2. "The doctrine of the last resurrection, as everywhere stated in the Scripture, is, that the 'body' will be raised up, and not merely that the 'soul will live.'"
3. "The meaning, then, so far as the language is concerned, must be, that there would exist, at the time of the thousand years, a state of things as if the martyrs were raised up from the dead - an honoring of the martyrs as if they should live and reign with Christ."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Thrones. See on ch. Revelation 2:13." 
2. "They sat. All the faithful members of Christ's Church." 
3. "They reigned with Christ."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The thrones before us are thrones of kings...They can be no other than all the faithful members of Christ’s Church." 
2. "The most natural meaning will be that the result of judgment was in such a manner given them that they did not need to come into the judgment." 
3. "The exposure to which they had been subjected, and the contumely with which they had been treated, are thought of more than the manner of their death."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Judgment was given unto them (κριμα εδοθη αυτοις). First aorist passive of διδωμ. Picture of the heavenly court of assizes." 

2. "The souls (τας ψυχας). Accusative after ειδον at the beginning of the verse. Of them that had been beheaded (των πεπελεκισμενων). Genitive of the articular perfect passive participle of πελεκιζω, old word... to cut off with an axe." 

3. "And they lived (κα εζησαν). First aorist active indicative of ζαω. If the ingressive aorist, it means 'came to life' or 'lived again' as in Revelation 2:8 and so as to verse Revelation 20:5. If it is the constative aorist here and in verse Revelation 20:5, then it could mean increased spiritual life."

### John Gill:
1. "There will be thrones set, or pitched, for all the saints, who will sit on them, in the character of kings, and as conquerors, and shall sit quiet, and undisturbed, and be in perfect ease, and peace."
2. "And judgment was given unto them; that is, power, dominion, regal authority, possession of a kingdom, answerable to their character as kings, and to their position, sitting on thrones."
3. "These are they who will sit on thrones, during the thousand years of Satan's being bound, and will have judgment given them; even such who have bore witness to the truth of Jesus being the Son of God, the true Messiah, and the only Saviour of sinners, and to him as the essential Word of God, or to the written word of God, the whole Gospel, all the truths and doctrines of it."

### John Wesley:
1. "And I saw thrones — Such as are promised the apostles." 
2. "And I saw the souls of those who had been beheaded — With the axe: so the original word signifies. One kind of death, which was particularly inflicted at Rome, is mentioned for all."
3. "And they lived — Their souls and bodies being re-united."

These quotes highlight the promise of thrones for the apostles, the mention of martyrdom for the testimony of Jesus, and the reunion of souls and bodies in the afterlife.
