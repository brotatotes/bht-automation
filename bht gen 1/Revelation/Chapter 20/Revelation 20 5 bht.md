# Revelation 20:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we see a description of a resurrection, where those who have died are brought back to life in a renewed and revived state. This resurrection is not a mere continuation of their previous life, but rather a completely new and different existence. It signifies a transformation or revival of what was once dead or dormant. This first resurrection is contrasted with a second death, emphasizing the eternal contrast between those who are raised to life and those who are eternally separated from God.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The martyrs would be honored as if they were raised up and the others not - that is, that special respect would be shown to their principles, their memory, and their character."
2. "Their places in honor, in rank, and in reward would be 'beneath' that of those who in fiery times had maintained unshaken fidelity to the cause of truth."
3. "The resurrection of the saints and martyrs, as specified in Revelation 20:4. It is called the 'first' resurrection in contradistinction from the second and last - the general resurrection."

### Marvin Vincent:

### Philip Schaff:

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "To infer from this statement, as many expositors have done, that the εζησαν of v. Revelation 20:4 must be understood of bodily resuscitation, is to interpret apocalyptic prophecy by methods of exegesis which are proper to ordinary narrative" (Swete).
2. "Accepting it as genuine, Swete applies it to 'the return of the martyrs and confessors to life at the beginning of the Thousand Years.' According to this view the first resurrection is a special incident in the present life before the Parousia."
3. "No effort is here made to solve this problem, save to call attention to the general judgment out of the books in Revelation 20:12 and to the general resurrection in John 5:29; Acts 24:15."

### John Gill:
1. "This clause is left out in the Syriac version."
2. "This resurrection is not meant of a resurrection from the death of sin to a life of grace."
3. "By this first resurrection must be meant a corporeal one; for as some of those that will live again were corporeally beheaded, and all of them corporeally died, they will be corporeally raised again."

### John Wesley:
1. "The thousand years during which Satan is bound both begin and end much sooner."
2. "But neither the beginning of the first nor of the second thousand will be known to the men upon earth, as both the imprisonment of Satan and his loosing are transacted in the invisible world."
3. "By observing these two distinct thousand years, many difficulties are avoided. There is room enough for the fulfilling of all the prophecies, and those which before seemed to clash are reconciled."
