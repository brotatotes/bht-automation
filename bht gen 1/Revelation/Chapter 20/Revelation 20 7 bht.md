## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

2. "The word 'finished' signifies that all the types and prophecies concerning His sufferings were accomplished, all His own predictions were fulfilled, and the work of man's redemption and salvation was now completed."

3. "By His death, He finished and put an end to the ceremonial law, and abolished the necessity of all the typical sacrifices and offerings."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "A state of things will then occur as if Satan should be for a time let loose again, and should be permitted to go as formerly over the world."
