# Revelation 21:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, commentators describe a future state where there is no more sea, interpreted as representing ungodliness and restlessness. This description is not about an entirely new creation, but a transformed one. It depicts a new and eternal state of all things, where the old physical world is replaced and the former things are done away with. It is a glorious picture of the blissful state of the church, in sharp contrast to the lake of fire portrayed earlier.

2. "The absence of sea, after the metamorphosis of the earth by fire, answers to the unruffled state of solid peace which shall then prevail."
3. "Then man shall possess inherent powers which shall make the sea no longer necessary, but an element which would detract from a perfect state."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Such a heaven and earth that they might properly be called new; such transformations, and such changes in their appearance, that they seemed to be just created."

1. "This vision relates to a glorious state of the church, not in the times of the apostles, or first dispensation of the Gospel; when the old Jewish church state, with its ordinances, rites, and ceremonies, passed away, and a new church state, a new dispensation, new ordinances, and a new people, took place." 
2. "Nor does this vision refer to the times of Constantine, when the old Pagan idolatry was removed out of the empire, and the Christian religion was revived, and came to be in a flourishing condition, and a new face of things appeared, and Christianity was embraced and honoured by the emperor, and the great men of the earth."
3. "Nor has this vision anything to do with the conversion and restoration of the Jews, when they will become a new people, quit their old principles and modes of worship, and there will be no more among them the sea of corrupt doctrine, respecting the Messiah, the works of the law, c. for this will be over before this vision takes place."
