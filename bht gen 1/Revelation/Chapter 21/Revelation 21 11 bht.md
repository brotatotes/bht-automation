# Revelation 21:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The city described in this verse is adorned with the radiant glory of God, both within and without. It shines with divine light, like the heavenly luminaries, giving off a crystalline brightness. This light, clear as crystal, shines forth from the city as if it were a precious jasper stone, illuminating its surroundings. It represents the glory and presence of God, symbolized by the Shekinah, and is a witness to Christ, the true light of the world. This light is not dependent on external sources, but is self-sustaining and reveals the eternal nature of God's presence.
