1. "Twelve foundations (θεμελιους δωδεκα). Foundation stones, old adjective (from θεμα, from τιθημ), here as in 1 Corinthians 3:11; 2 Timothy 2:19, with λιθους (stones understood), though often neuter substantive to θεμελιον (Luke 6:48; Acts 16:26)."
2. "Twelve because of the twelve apostles as foundation stones (Ephesians 2:20)."
3. "Names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb (ονοματα των δωδεκα αποστολων του αρνιου). Jesus had spoken of twelve thrones for the apostles (Matthew 19:28); names of all twelve are here written, not just that of Peter, as some would argue from Matthew 16:18."
