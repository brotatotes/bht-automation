# Revelation 21:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The described Bible verse portrays a magnificent and symmetrical city, glowing with glory and perfection. With a faultless symmetry and immense height, it is meant to contain vast numbers of redeemed inhabitants. The shape of the city is akin to a perfect cube, reminiscent of the Holy of Holies in the tabernacle. Its dimensions, whether twelve thousand furlongs for each side or in total, symbolize the people of God and the heavenly realm. The focus, however, should not be on literal measurements, but on the profound idea that this city will be expansive enough to embrace all of God's beloved.

3. "These are enough to show how utterly futile are attempts to reduce these symbolic visions to mathematical statement."

### Philip Schaff:
