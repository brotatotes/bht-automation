# Revelation 21:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Bible verse being described is a vision of the New Jerusalem, a city surrounded by a wall. Commentators highlight that the wall is considerably lower than the city itself, symbolizing the city's immense height and security. It is emphasized that the angel measures the city using a standard human measurement, emphasizing that the New Jerusalem is meant to be the dwelling place of people. The number 144, which is a multiple of 12, is seen as significant, representing completeness and perfection.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The wall is far beneath the height of the city."
2. "The ordinary measure used by men is the measure here used by the angel."
3. "Men shall then be equal to the angels."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "As the walls of a city are designed to protect it from external foes, the height mentioned here gives all proper ideas of security; and we are to conceive of the city itself as towering immensely above the walls."
2. "Its glory, therefore, would not be obscured by the wall that was thrown around it for defense."
3. "This seems to be added in order to prevent any mistake as to the size of the city. It is an 'angel' who makes the measurement, and without this explanation it might perhaps be supposed that he used some measure not in common use among people, so that, after all, it would be impossible to form any definite idea of the size of the city."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Cubits [πηχων] . The word originally means that part of the arm between the hand and the elbow - joint, the forearm."
2. "The most inconsiderable wall" remarks Dusterdieck, "is sufficient to exclude all that is impure."
3. "It is to be the dwelling - place of men; and even, therefore, when an angel measures it, he measures it according to the measure of a man" (Milligan).

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The wall is a part of the city as strictly as the foundations are, and is itself, like them, radiant with the light which shines forth from the city as a whole."
2. "The New Jerusalem is not framed according to angelic ideas or for angelic purposes. It is to be the dwelling-place of men; and even, therefore, when an angel measures it, he measures it ‘according to the measure of a man.’"
3. "The last clause of the verse has occasioned considerable difficulty. The meaning seems to be, that a human standard of measurement was used; and it was well to note this."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "A hundred and forty and four cubits... Another multiple of 12 (12x12=144) as in Revelation 7:4; Revelation 14:1." 
2. "It is not clear whether it is the height or the breadth of the wall that is meant, though υψος (height) comes just before."
3. "According to the measure of a man, that is, of an angel... Though measured by an angel, a human standard was employed, man's measure which is angel's (Bengel)."

### John Gill:
1. "The root of which is twelve, for twelve times twelve is a hundred and forty-four; which number is mystical and apostolical, and suited to the perfect state of this church."
2. "According to the measure of a man, that is, of the angel; who talked with John, and measured the city, gates, and wall, and who appeared in the form of a man."
3. "His reed might be, as some have supposed, the length of a man, six cubits, or six feet, as in Ezekiel 40:5 and may denote that this business requires the utmost wisdom and understanding of a man, and even of an angel, to look into, and find out."
