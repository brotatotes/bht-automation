2. "Hierousaleem is a Hebrew name, the original and holy appellation. Hierosoluma is the common Greek term, used in a political sense."
3. "There is no longer merely a Paradise as in Eden, no longer a mere garden, but now the city of God on earth, costlier, statelier, and more glorious, but at the same time the result of labor and pains such as had not to be expended by man in dressing the primitive garden of Eden."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "On the phrase 'new Jerusalem,' see the Galatians 4:26 note, and Hebrews 12:22 note. Here it refers to the residence of the redeemed, the heavenly world, of which Jerusalem was the type and symbol."
2. "This, of course, does not mean that this great city was 'literally' to descend upon the earth...but it is a symbolical or figurative representation, designed to show that the abode of the righteous will be splendid and glorious."
3. "The purpose here is, to represent it as exceedingly beautiful. The comparison of the church with a bride, or a wife, is common in the Scriptures...It is a beautiful city that seems to descend, and this city is itself compared with a richly-attired bride prepared for her husband."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "New Jerusalem" - This phrase refers to the heavenly city that is described in the book of Revelation. It represents the ultimate fulfillment of God's promises and the dwelling place of His people.
