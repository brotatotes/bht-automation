### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Sardonyx—a gem having the redness of the cornelian, and the whiteness of the onyx."
2. "Chrysolite—described by PLINY as transparent and of a golden brightness, like our topaz: different from our pale green crystallized chrysolite."
3. "Jacinth—The flashing violet brightness in the amethyst is diluted in the jacinth."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The fifth, sardonyx - This word does not occur elsewhere in the New Testament... It is a silicious stone or gem, nearly allied to the onyx. The color is a reddish yellow, nearly orange."
2. "The seventh, chrysolite - This word does not elsewhere occur in the New Testament... It means 'golden stone,' and was applied by the ancients to all gems of a golden or yellow color."
3. "The twelfth, an amethyst - It denotes a gem of a deep purple or violet color... It is a species of quartz, and is used in jewelry."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Sardonyx, the most beautiful and rarest variety of onyx, is called from the resemblance of its white and yellow veins to the shades in the human finger-nail." 
2. "Beryl, resembling the greenness of the pure sea, has been supposed to be of the same or similar nature with the emerald." 
3. "Amethyst, the stone being supposed to avert intoxication, is the amethystine quartz, or rock-crystal, colored purple by manganese of iron."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Sardonyx, white with layers of red, symbolizes the combination of purity and sacrifice, reflecting the dual nature of Christ's sacrifice on the cross."

### John Gill:
1. "The fifth, sardonyx,.... Which is partly of the sardian, and partly of the onyx stone, which resembles a man's nail, from whence it has its name; it is reddish, bordering on white; it may be thought to answer to the onyx in the breastplate, on which was written the name of Joseph."

2. "The seventh, chrysolite; a stone of a dusky green colour, with a cast of yellow; by its name it should have the colour of gold. Schroder says it is found in Bohemia, and that it is the same the moderns call the topaz. Some think it answers to 'tarshish' in the breastplate, rendered 'beryl', on which was the name of Asher."

3. "The twelfth, an amethyst; a stone of a violet colour, bordering on purple: it has been thought a preservative from drunkenness, from whence it seems to have its name. On this stone was written the name of Gad."

1. "The description of the precious stones in this verse not only adds visual richness to the text, but also symbolizes the diversity and beauty of God's creation." 
2. "Each stone mentioned here has its own unique color and characteristics, reminding us that every individual is created with their own unique qualities and purpose."
