## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "The phrase 'every several' emphasizes the individuality and uniqueness of each person. It reminds us that God sees and values each person as an individual, with their own gifts, talents, and purpose." 

2. "This verse reminds us that God has given each person a specific role and responsibility within the body of Christ. We are not meant to be carbon copies of each other, but rather to use our unique gifts and abilities to serve and build up the church."

3. "The phrase 'each one severally' also highlights the importance of personal accountability. We are each responsible for our own actions and choices, and we cannot rely on others to fulfill our own obligations. It is a reminder that we are called to be faithful and obedient in our own individual walk with God."

### Albert Barnes:
