# Revelation 21:27 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The heavenly city described in the verse is a place of absolute purity and righteousness, reserved only for those who are pure and righteous themselves. The gates of the city are open only to those who are washed in the blood of Christ, without spot or wrinkle. Those who have their names written in the Lamb’s book of life, predestined to eternal life and justified by Christ's righteousness, are the ones who can enter and experience the pure and perfect state of this heavenly place. It is a blessedness enjoyed exclusively by true, holy, and persevering believers.
