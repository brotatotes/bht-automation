# Revelation 21:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, we see the concept of thirsting for salvation being emphasized as a characteristic of the believer. The promise of inheriting all things is given to those who overcome, becoming heirs of God in every aspect of their lives. God, in turn, becomes their everlasting Father, and they become his spiritual seed and offspring. This promise is a reminder of the glorious position of the believers, who will see Christ in his glory and be made like him.
