## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "the fearful—Greek, 'the cowardly,' who do not quit themselves like men so as to 'overcome' in the good fight; who have the spirit of slavish 'fear,' not love, towards God; and who through fear of man are not bold for God, or 'draw back.'" 
2. "abominable—who have drank of the harlot's 'cup of abominations.'"
3. "sorcerers—one of the characteristics of Antichrist's time."
4. "all liars—Greek, 'all the liars': or else 'all who are liars'; compare 1 Timothy 4:1; 1 Timothy 4:2, where similarly lying and dealings with spirits and demons, are joined together as features of 'the latter times.'"
5. "second death— 1 Timothy 4:2- :: 'everlasting destruction,' 2 Thessalonians 1:9; Mark 9:44; Mark 9:46; Mark 9:48, 'Where THEIR worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched.'"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The 'fearful' denote those who had not firmness boldly to maintain their professed principles, or who were afraid to avow themselves as the friends of God in a wicked world."
2. "The 'abominable' refers to all who are detestable, to wit, on account of their sins; all whose conduct is offensive to God."
3. "All who are false in their statements, their promises, their contracts. The word would embrace all who are false toward God and false toward human beings."

These quotes provide insights into the characteristics and behaviors that would exclude individuals from entering the blessed world, emphasizing the importance of firmness in maintaining one's principles, avoiding detestable conduct, and being truthful in all aspects of life.

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The fearful [δειλοις] . The dative case. Hence, as Rev., for the fearful."
2. "Abominable [εβδελυγμενοις] . See on abomination, Matthew 24:15. Properly, defiled with abominations."
3. "Whoremongers [πορνοις] . Much better, as Rev., fornicators."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The ‘fearful’ are mentioned first as occupying a position the reverse of them that ‘overcome;’ they have shrunk from the struggle; they have yielded to the foe instead of conquering him." 
2. "They are such as have chosen the darkness rather than the light; as have loved the lie rather than the truth (John 8:44); as have deliberately resisted and cast aside the grace that might have been theirs."
3. "Their part can be only in the second death."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "They are with Satan and the two beasts, and are the same with those not in the book of life." 
2. "Disloyalty is close kin to cowardice."
3. "These two crimes often go together."

### John Gill:
1. "But the fearful... who, through fear of men, either make no profession of Christ and his Gospel, or having made it, drop it, lest they should be exposed to tribulation and persecution; these are they that are afraid of the beast, and live in servile bondage to him."
2. "And unbelieving... who do not truly believe in him, nor embrace his Gospel and the truths of it, but believe a lie; these are condemned already, and on them the wrath of God abides, and they will be damned at last."
3. "And all liars... particularly such who speak lies in hypocrisy, as the followers of the man of sin, and who are given up to believe a lie, that they might be damned; all lies being of the devil, and abominable to God."

### John Wesley:
1. "The fearful and unbelieving, those lacking courage and faith, are unable to overcome." 
2. "The abominable, referring to sodomites, are condemned for their actions." 
3. "Whoremongers, sorcerers, and idolaters, often found together, will face their punishment in the lake."
