# Revelation 21:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The New Jerusalem, depicted by one of the angels who had previously brought judgment on Babylon, stands in sharp contrast as the bride of the Lamb. It represents the redeemed church, united with its Lord in pure love and eternal union. The pouring out of the vials, symbolizing God's final judgment, serves as a reminder of the impending reckoning for those who reject mercy, while emphasizing the righteousness and completeness of His wrath. The vision portrays the glorious future of the Church, as she is prepared as a radiant and consecrated bride for her heavenly Bridegroom.
