# Revelation 22:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse portrays a profound unity between the divine and human aspects of the Church. It highlights the active role of the Church, represented by the Bride, in responding to the call of the Spirit. This call is not merely an invitation to salvation, but an ongoing beckoning to enter into a deep relationship with God. The Church eagerly waits for the coming of the Lord, expressing a heartfelt desire for His presence. This invitation is open to all who thirst for a deeper connection with God, as freely as one quenches their thirst with water.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The invitation, 'Come,' only holds good while the Church is still but an affianced Bride, and not the actually wedded wife." 
2. "Let him that heareth the Spirit and Bride saying to the Lord Jesus, 'Come,' join the Bride as a true believer, become part of her, and so say with her to Jesus, 'Come.'"
3. "As the Bride, the Church, prays to Jesus, 'Come,' so she urges all whosoever thirst for participation in the full manifestation of redemption-glory at His coming to us, to COME in the meantime and drink of the living waters."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The design of this whole verse is, evidently, to show the freeness of the offers of the gospel; to condense in a summary manner all the invitations of mercy to mankind; and to leave on the mind at the close of the book a deep impression of the ample provision which has been made for the salvation of a fallen race."
2. "The Spirit - The Holy Spirit. He entreats all to come. This he does: (a)In all the recorded invitations in the Bible - for it is by the inspiration of that Spirit that these invitations are recorded; (b)By all his influences on the understandings, the consciences, and the hearts of people; (c)By all the proclamations of mercy made by the preaching of the gospel, and by the appeal which friend makes to friend, and neighbor to neighbor, and stranger to stranger - for all these are methods in which the Spirit invites people to come to the Saviour."
3. "The church on earth and the church in heaven unite in the invitation, saying, Come. The living father, pastor, friend, invites - and the voice of the departed father, pastor, friend, now in heaven, is heard re-echoing the invitation. The once-loved mother that has gone to the skies still invites her children to come; and the sweet-smiling babe that has been taken up to the Saviour stretches out its arms from heaven, and says to its mother - 'Come.'"

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The Spirit and the Bride are intimately connected, representing the divine and human aspects of the Church. They both have a voice that speaks to the hearts of believers, calling them to listen and respond to the invitation of God." 

2. "The Church, as the Bride, is not a passive entity but an active participant in the work of the Spirit. She is called to hear and respond to the voice of the Spirit, embracing the guidance and direction that He provides."

3. "The voice of the Spirit and the Bride is not just a call to salvation, but an ongoing invitation to enter into a deep and intimate relationship with God. It is a call to surrender, to be transformed, and to actively participate in the mission of the Church."

4. "The unity between the Spirit and the Bride reflects the unity between God and His people. It is a reminder that the Church is not just an institution, but a living organism, empowered by the Spirit to carry out the purposes of God in the world."

5. "The voice of the Spirit and the Bride is a constant reminder that the Church is not meant to be isolated or individualistic, but a community of believers who are united in their love for God and their commitment to one another."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "He is coming: the Church is waiting in joyful assurance that He is at hand. Both the Lord and His Church are at a moment of highest rapture." 
2. "The Spirit working in the Church, and teaching her to long and cry for that Coming with which all her hopes are associated, together with the Church herself, no sooner think of the testimony of Christ as ended than they can restrain themselves no longer, and by the voice of the Church they both cry ‘Come.’"
3. "The thirst referred to is not the first thirst of the sinner after salvation. It is the constant longing of one who has already been refreshed for deeper and fuller draughts; and to each one who so thirsts the Lord says ‘Come.’"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
