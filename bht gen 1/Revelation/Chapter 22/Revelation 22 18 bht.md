### John Gill:
1. "To 'add' to the things contained in this book, is not to deliver, or write an exposition of it, in a modest manner, with a sincere view to give light into it, agreeably to the analogy of faith; for to expound Scripture, or to preach from it, consistent with it, is not to add unto it, but to give the sense of it."
2. "But then may it be said to be added unto, and so this book, when it is wrested and perverted, and a false gloss is put upon it, as the Pharisees did upon the law."
3. "The punishment of such a crime follows, God shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book; the things threatened to the antichristian party, the seven last plagues in which the wrath of God is filled up."
