# Revelation 22:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the heavenly city, there is a tree of life that holds significant importance, symbolizing the presence of Christ, the author of life. It is situated between the streets where the saints commune and the river of God's everlasting love, representing the delightful and comfortable manner in which Christ is seen and enjoyed by all. The leaves of this tree are for the preservation and constant health of the people of God, depicting the abundant and diverse fruits of the Spirit. In this realm, there is no need for restoration as there is no sickness or sorrow.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "How striking it is that, as in the beginning we found Adam and Eve, his bride, in innocence in Paradise, then tempted by the serpent, and driven from the tree of life, and from the pleasant waters of Eden, yet not without a promise of a Redeemer who should crush the serpent; so at the close, the old serpent cast out forever by the second Adam, the Lord from heaven, who appears with His Bride, the Church, in a better Paradise, and amidst better waters."
2. "The antitype exceeds the type: in the first Paradise was only one tree of life; now there are 'very many trees at the bank of the river, on the one side and on the other.'"
3. "The leaves shall be the health-giving preventive securing the redeemed against, not healing them of, sicknesses, while 'the fruit shall be for meat.'"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The city had not only a river passing through it, but it was pervaded by streets, and all those streets were lined and shaded with this tree. The idea in the mind of the writer is that of Eden or Paradise; but it is not the Eden of the book of Genesis, or the Oriental or Persian Paradise: it is a picture where all is combined, that in the view of the writer would constitute beauty, or contribute to happiness."
2. "It was the common tree in this blessed Paradise - of which all might partake, and which was everywhere the emblem of immortality."
3. "The idea is, that the tree bore every month in the year, so that there were twelve fruit-harvests. It was not like a tree that bears but once a year, or in one season only, but it constantly bore fruit - it bore every month. The idea is that of abundance, not variety. The supply never fails; the tree is never barren."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "In the midst of the street thereof." - This phrase suggests that the tree of life is at the center, symbolizing its importance and significance in the heavenly city.
2. "On either side [εντευθεν και εντευθεν]." - This phrase emphasizes the abundance and accessibility of the tree of life, as it is present on both sides of the street.
3. "Twelve manner of fruits [καρπους δωδεκα]." - The mention of twelve fruits highlights the completeness and diversity of the tree's produce, symbolizing the fullness of blessings and provision in the heavenly realm.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "We are again, as in chap. Revelation 21:21, to understand the word ‘street’ genetically, so that the picture presented to us is that of a clear stream flowing down the middle of each street of the city, bordered with trees on either side. Yet these trees are one tree."
2. "A good sense may be obtained from the latter interpretation, which will point us to the variety, ever new, of the enjoyments provided for the inhabitants of the city. But the former interpretation appears to be preferable. It is almost demanded by the third clause of the verse, ‘yielding her fruit every month,’ which carries our thoughts much more to the same fruit produced every month than to twelve successive varieties of fruit."
3. "The supply of fruit, at once for the nourishment and the delectation of the saints, never fails. In the last clause of the verse it. Is not implied that any inhabitants of the new earth stand in need of healing. For the same reason it is impossible to think that ‘the nations’ here spoken of have yet to be converted. They have already entered that better world to which the old world has given place."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Connected probably with the river in verse Revelation 22:1, though many connect it with verse Revelation 22:2."
2. "The tree of life... For the metaphor see Genesis 1:11 and Revelation 2:7; Revelation 22:14."
3. "Here again the problem occurs whether this picture is heaven before the judgment or afterwards."

### John Gill:
1. "By the tree of life is meant not the Gospel, nor godliness, nor eternal life, nor any other of the divine Persons, but Christ, who is the author of life, natural, spiritual, and eternal." 
2. "Its situation between the street of the city, where the saints commune and converse together, and the river of God's everlasting love, which in this state will appear in its fulness and glory, shows that Christ will be seen and enjoyed by all in the most delightful and comfortable manner that can be wished for."
3. "These leaves will be for the preserving and continuing the health of the people of God in this state, as the tree of life in Eden's garden was for the preservation of the health and life of Adam, had he continued in a state of innocence."

### John Wesley:
1. "Here is the paradise of God, mentioned, Revelation 2:7."
2. "The variety, likewise, as well as the abundance of the fruits of the Spirit, may be intimated thereby."
3. "For the continuing their health, not the restoring it; for no sickness is there."
