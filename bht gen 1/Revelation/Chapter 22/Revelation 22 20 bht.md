## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Amen. Even so, come—The Song of Solomon (Song of Solomon 8:14) closes with the same yearning prayer for Christ's coming."
2. "Christ's 'I come,' and John's 'Come,' are almost coincident in time; so truly does the believer reflect the mind of his Lord."
3. "Joining the 'Amen,' or 'So be it,' not with Christ's saying (for He calls Himself the 'Amen' at the beginning of sentences, rather than puts it as a confirmation at the end), but with John's reply."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He which testifieth these things - The Lord Jesus; for he it was that had, through the instrumentality of the angel, borne this solemn witness to the truth of these things, and this book was to be regarded as his revelation to mankind."
2. "Saith, Surely I come quickly - That is, the development of these events will soon begin - though their consummation may extend into far distant ages, or into eternity."
3. "Come, Lord Jesus - That is, as here intended, 'Come in the manner and for the objects referred to in this book.' The language, however, is expressive of the feeling of piety in a more extended sense, and may be used to denote a desire that the Lord Jesus would come in any and every manner."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The word 'even so' is a powerful affirmation of the truth being stated. It emphasizes the certainty and importance of what is being said."

2. "The omission of the word 'ναι' in this verse may seem insignificant, but it actually adds depth to the statement. It suggests that the truth being expressed is so self-evident and undeniable that it doesn't need any additional confirmation."

3. "By omitting the word 'ναι,' the author is highlighting the absolute truth of the statement. It is a bold declaration that leaves no room for doubt or debate."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Jesus Himself speaks first, testifying to that great truth of His Coming which has been the main theme of the whole revelation of this book; and adding, as suited the moment at which we have arrived, that He comes ‘quickly.’"
2. "The Coming of Christ has been the source of her hope, the spring of her joy, throughout all her troubles. When she hears that it is at hand, what can she do but lift up her head and cry ‘Come’?"
3. "The words are in striking harmony with what we have found to be the tone and character of the whole book. It was especially intended to describe the fortunes of ‘the saints;’ it was written for their sakes, to encourage and strengthen them; it has now reached a point at which we behold nothing but saints in the new heavens and new earth; and its closing salutation is to them."
