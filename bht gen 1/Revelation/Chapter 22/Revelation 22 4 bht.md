# Revelation 22:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, believers are promised the extraordinary privilege of seeing God's face and experiencing deep intimacy with Him. This divine revelation surpasses even the experience of Moses, as it grants a profound understanding and recognition of God. In the New Jerusalem, believers will not only behold the face of Jesus Christ but also bear His name, symbolizing their complete surrender and identification as His own. This glorious vision and close fellowship with God serves as a glimpse of the believers' ultimate destination, where they will be transformed into the likeness of Christ and enjoy perfect communion with Him.
