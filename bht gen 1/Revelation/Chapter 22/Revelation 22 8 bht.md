# Revelation 22:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the author describes an overwhelming encounter with divine revelation. The narrator, identified as John, emphasizes his firsthand account of both what he has seen and heard.

The repetition of language and the connection to previous events suggest a profound experience, raising questions about the nature of the encounter and the identity of the angel.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Rapturous emotion, gratitude, and adoration, at the prospect of the Church's future glory transport him out of himself, so as all but to fall into an unjustifiable act."
2. "It is observable that in Revelation 19:10, the language is, 'I fell before his feet to worship him'; but here, 'I fell down to worship (God?) before the feet of the angel.' It seems unlikely that John, when once reproved, would fall into the very same error again."
3. "John had first intended to worship the angel (Revelation 19:10), but now only at his feet intends to worship (God). The angel does not even permit this."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "I saw the parts that were disclosed by pictures, visions, and symbols; I heard the parts that were communicated by direct revelation."
2. "John appears to have been entirely overcome by the extraordinary nature of the revelations made to him."
3. "John... entertained some suspicion that it was the Redeemer himself who had manifested himself to him in this remarkable manner."

### Marvin Vincent:

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Once more, as at chap. Revelation 1:1; Revelation 1:4, the Seer names himself, thus again binding together the opening and closing paragraphs of his book, a clear proof that by the words ‘these things’ we are to understand the contents of the whole book and not merely those of its latest section." 
2. "On the importance of seeing and hearing, comp. 1 John 1:1-2." 
3. "We need not wonder that he should do it again; nor is it necessary to think that, having just heard the words ‘Behold, I come quickly, he may have been doubtful whether the angel before him was the Lord Himself or not."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Here he claims to be the 'one who hears and sees these things'." 
2. "It was a natural, though a wrong, thing to do, especially after Christ's own voice followed that of the angel 'which shewed me these things'." 
3. "Cf. Revelation 1:1; Revelation 4:1; Revelation 17:1; Revelation 21:9; Revelation 22:1; Revelation 22:6."

### John Gill:
1. "He was both an eye and an ear witness; some things he saw, and others he heard; and to render his testimony the more authentic, he puts his name to it."

3. "This is the second time John did so, though warned of it, and rebuked for it, which shows the proneness even of good men to fall into sin again and again; and what a propensity there is in mankind to idolatry."

### John Wesley:
1. "The reproof of the angel, likewise, 'See thou do it not,' for I am thy fellowservant, is expressed in the very same terms as before."
2. "May it not be the very same incident which is here related again?"
