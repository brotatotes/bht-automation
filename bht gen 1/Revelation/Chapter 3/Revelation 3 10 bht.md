### Philip Schaff:
1. "The reference is neither to any precepts of Christ concerning patience, nor to any accounts given us of the patience of Christ Himself, but simply to Christ’s ‘word,’ which cannot be kept without much patient endurance on the part of His people."

2. "Out of’ (comp. John 17:15) this trial believers are to be kept, not that they are to be kept in it, when in the course of providence it comes upon the Church as well as others, but that they are to be kept entirely out of it; it shall not touch them."

3. "The trial comes upon the whole inhabited world; no part of the world shall escape it. But at the same time, it comes to try them that dwell upon the earth, not all living men without exception, but, as clearly shown by the use of this expression in the Apocalypse, only the wicked."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Endurance" as in Revelation 13:10; Revelation 14:12 as also in 2 Thessalonians 3:5. (Patience)
2. Jesus endured (Hebrews 12:1) and he will help them. There is still a church in Philadelphia in spite of the Turks. (From the hour of trial)
3. The inhabited earth (γης) as in Revelation 12:19; Luke 2:1; Acts 16:6, etc.), not the physical earth, but the world of men as explained by the next clause. (Upon the whole world)

### John Gill:
1. "The Gospel; so called because it gives an account of the patience of Christ, in the midst of all his outward meanness and humiliation."

3. "Christ will now have his fan in his hand, and purge his floor of all his formal professors and hypocrites; and it will be known who are his true churches, and pure members."

1. "The word of Christ is indeed a word of patience."
