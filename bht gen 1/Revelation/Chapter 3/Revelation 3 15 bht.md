# Revelation 3:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This Bible verse describes a lukewarm state, where there is a profession of religion but no warm-hearted piety or fervency. It is a dangerous condition, mistaken for a safe state, lacking the honesty of open opposition or devoted love. It is a state where one is attached to the world and opposed to the Church, neither hot nor cold. However, there is more hope for those who are cold and ignorant of religion, as they have the potential to respond to the Gospel call and become fervent Christians.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "The lukewarm state, if it be the transitional stage to a warmer, is a desirable state (for a little religion, if real, is better than none); but most fatal when, as here, an abiding condition, for it is mistaken for a safe state."
2. "This accounts for Christ's desiring that they were cold rather than lukewarm. For then there would not be the same 'danger of mixed motive and disregarded principle.'"
3. "Also, there is more hope of the 'cold,' that is, those who are of the world, and not yet warmed by the Gospel call; for, when called, they may become hot and fervent Christians."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The state indicated here, therefore, would be that in which there was a profession of religion, but no warm-hearted piety; in which there was not, on the one hand, open and honest opposition to him, and, on the other, such warm-hearted and honest love as he had a right to look for among his professed friends."
2. "Such a state of open and professed coldness or indifference is more honest. There is no disguise; no concealment; no pretence."
3. "The most hopeless of all persons, in regard to salvation, are those who are members of the church without any true religion; who have made a profession without any evidence of personal piety; who are content with a name to live."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Cold [ψυχρος]. Attached to the world and actively opposed to the Church."
2. "This... would be an intelligible and plainly-marked condition; at all events free from the danger of mixed motive and disregarded principle which belongs to the lukewarm state."
3. "Hot [ζεστος]. From zew to boil or seethe."

Note: The commentary provides additional explanations and references, but these quotes capture the essence of the commentary in a concise manner.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "In no circumstances could either of these states be to the Lord an object of desire, for experience shows that there is none out of which it is so difficult to awaken the heart to a proper reception of the Divine message."
2. "There must be some positive quality in him who is thus ‘cold.’ for the sake of which Jesus can say, ‘I would thou wert cold or hot.’"
3. "The church at Laodicea was neither ‘cold’ nor ‘hot.’ It had received the truth outwardly, but no deep impression had been made upon it. Its members were not zealous for the truth, but neither were they zealous against it."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Old word from ψυχω, to grow cold (Matthew 24:12), in N.T. only Matthew 10:42 and this passage." 
2. "Late verbal from ζεω, to boil, (Romans 12:11), boiling hot, here only in N.T."
3. "Wish about the present with οφελον (really ωφελον, second aorist active indicative of οφειλω, without augment) with the imperfect ης (instead of the infinitive) as in 2 Corinthians 11:1, when the old Greek used ειθε or ε γαρ."

### John Gill:
1. "she was alive, but not lively"
2. "she had love, but the fervency of it was abated"
3. "it is better to be ignorant, and not a professor of religion, than to be a vain and carnal one"

### John Wesley:
1. "I know thy works — Thy disposition and behaviour, though thou knowest it not thyself." 
2. "Nor hot — As boiling water: so ought we to be penetrated and heated by the fire of love." 
3. "Cold or hot — Even if thou wert cold, without any thought or profession of religion, there would be more hope of thy recovery."
