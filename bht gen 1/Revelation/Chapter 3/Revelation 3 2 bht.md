# Revelation 3:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we are reminded to strengthen the remaining graces within us and revive the dying fruits of the Spirit. The church is encouraged to watch over themselves and hold onto the truths of the Gospel, for they may be on the brink of extinction. Despite a low state of religion, there are still vestiges of life within that need to be preserved and established. We must be vigilant and avoid falling into the sin of spiritual pride, so that our works may measure up to God's standard.
