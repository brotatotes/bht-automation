## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The vivid depiction of Christ standing at the door is introduced, to bring home to the lukewarm and careless church the truth of His constant presence, which she was so deeply forgetting."
2. "Our verse is a striking and decisive testimony to the practical freedom of our will to receive or reject the heavenly Guest: without the recognition of which, the love and tenderness of the saying become a hideous mockery."
3. "We then open the door to Christ, when we admit Him, His voice, His commands, His example, to a share in our inner counsels and sources of action."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "He who is Himself 'the Door,' and who bids us 'knock' that it may be 'opened unto' us, is first Himself to knock at the door of our hearts." 
2. "If we refuse to answer to His knocking at our door now, He will refuse to hear our knocking at His door hereafter."
3. "The Sun of righteousness, like the natural sun, the moment that the door is opened, pours in His light, which could not previously find an entrance."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He was still willing to be gracious, though their conduct had been such as to be loathsome."
2. "The language here is so plain that it scarcely needs explanation. It is taken from an act when we approach a dwelling, and, by a well-understood sign - knocking - announce our presence, and ask for admission."
3. "Salvation, in the Scriptures, is never represented as originated by man."
4. "The meaning here is simply, if anyone will admit me; that is, receive me as a friend."
5. "The truths, then, which are taught in this verse, are: (1)That the invitation of the gospel is made to all - 'if any man hear my voice'; (2)That the movement toward reconciliation and friendship is originated by the Saviour - 'behold, I stand at the door and knock'; (3)That there is a recognition of our own free agency in religion - 'if any man will hear my voice, and open the door'; (4)The ease of the terms of salvation, represented by 'hearing his voice,' and 'opening the door'; and, (5)The blessedness of thus admitting him, arising from his friendship - 'I will sup with him, and he with me.'"

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "He at whose door we ought to stand (for He is the Door, who, as such, has bidden us to knock), is content that the whole relation between Him and us should be reversed, and, instead of our standing at His door, condescends Himself to stand at ours" (Trench).
2. "Love for men emptied God. For He doth not abide in His place and summon to Himself the servant whom He loved; but goes Himself and seeks him; and He who is rich comes to the dwelling of the poor, and discloses His love, and seeks an equal return; nor does He withdraw from him who repels Him, nor is He disgusted at his insolence; but, pursuing him, remains sitting at his doors, and that He may show him the one who loves him, He does all things, and sorrowing, bears and dies."
3. "Christ not only knocks but speaks. 'The voice very often will interpret and make intelligible the purpose of the knock' (Trench)."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The figure is not intended to convey to the church the thought of the Lord’s constant presence, but rather the assurance that He has taken up a new position, that He is at hand for judgment, and that He will immediately admit His people to the full enjoyment of His promised blessedness."
2. "No knocking in various ways, by providence, by conscience, by the ordinances of the Church, by the work of the Spirit, is referred to. The words simply show how near Jesus is, and how ready to bless."
3. "The picture is one of the heavenly reward, and both statements, I will sup with him, and he with me, are to be taken together. The first is not confined to the blessedness of earth, the second to the blessedness of heaven; but the two combined express the glory and joy of the future world, where the believer shall be forever with his Lord."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Picture of the Lord's advent as in Matthew 24:33; James 5:9, but true also of the individual response to Christ's call (Luke 12:36) as shown in Holman Hunt's great picture."
2. "If any man hear--and open (εαν τις ακουση κα ανοιξη). Condition of third class with εαν and first aorist (ingressive) active subjunctive of ακουω and ανοιγω. See John 10:3; John 18:37."
3. "I will come in to him (εισελευσομα). Future middle of εισερχομα. See Mark 15:43; Acts 11:3 for εισερχομα προς, to go into a man's house. Cf. John 14:23."

### John Gill:
1. "The phrase of standing at the door may be expressive of the near approach, or sudden coming of Christ to judgment."
2. "His knocking may signify the notice that will be given of it, by some of the immediate forerunners and signs of his coming."
3. "If any man hear my voice; in the appearances of things and providences in the world: and open the door; or show a readiness for the coming of Christ, look and wait for it, and be like such that will receive him with a welcome."

### John Wesley:
1. "I stand at the door, and knock" - This quote emphasizes the persistence and patience of Jesus, who continues to seek a relationship with humanity, even when we may not be actively seeking Him.

2. "If any man open" - This quote highlights the importance of our response to Jesus' invitation. It implies that we have the choice to open the door of our hearts and invite Him in or to keep Him at a distance.

3. "I will sup with him" - This quote portrays the intimacy and communion that Jesus desires to have with us. It signifies a deep connection and fellowship between the believer and Christ, where He nourishes and satisfies our spiritual hunger.
