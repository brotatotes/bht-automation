## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "What Sardis is to 'remember' is, not how joyfully she had received originally the Gospel message, but how the precious deposit was committed to her originally, so that she could not say, she had not 'received and heard' it." 
2. "The word 'keep'...accords with this sense. 'Keep' or observe the commandment which thou hast received and didst hear."
3. "Christ applies the language which in its fullest sense describes His second coming, to describe His coming in special judgments on churches and states...these special judgments being anticipatory earnests of that great last coming."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It is always well for Christians to call to remembrance the 'day of their espousals,' and their views and feelings when they gave their hearts to the Saviour, and to compare those views with their present condition, especially if their conversion was marked by anything unusual."
2. "Repent in regard to all that in which you have departed from your views and feelings when you embraced the gospel."
3. "Every man who is warned of the evil of his course, and who refuses or neglects to repent, has reason to believe that God will come suddenly in his wrath, and call him to his bar."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Thou hast received the truth as a permanent deposit."
2. "Thief, as distinguished from a robber, a plunderer on a larger scale."
3. "The unexpected and stealthy coming of the Lord."
4. "The feet of the avenging deities are shod with wool."
5. "Unseen and voiceless Justice dogs his steps, striking athwart his path from right or left."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The exhortation to Sardis is to remember, not the simple fact that she had received, but how she had done so, after what manner thou hast received, the earnestness, the faithfulness, and the zeal which had marked the first stages of her spiritual life."
2. "She had ‘received,’ and she still retained possession of the truth; hence the perfect. But she no longer ‘heard’ in that sense of obeying so common in the writings of St. John; hence the aorist pointing to a specific moment of the past."
3. "If, however, the church at Sardis will not obey the command to ‘watch,’ she shall not escape. The Lord will come as a thief. It is not the suddenness or unexpectedness of the hour only that is thought of under the image of a ‘thief,’ for that image has rather its expression in the last clause of the verse. It is the object with which the thief comes that is in view, to break up and to destroy."

### John Gill:
1. "The design of the advice is to put this church in mind of the doctrines of grace she had heard at the beginning of the Reformation, from Luther and others; such as justification by the righteousness of Christ, pardon through his blood, and atonement by his sacrifice, doctrines now almost lost and buried in forgetfulness."
2. "It looks as if there was danger, as there is, that they would be entirely wrested out of her hands."
3. "If therefore thou shalt not watch: and preserve truth, and hold fast the form of sound words, and keep to the order, as well as the faith of the Gospel, and constantly attend divine worship, and look for the coming and kingdom of Christ."
