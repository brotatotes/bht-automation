# Revelation 3:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the commentator's insights reveal a profound description of Christ's authority and role. Christ is hailed as the Holy One, truly divine and genuine, consecrated and set apart for God's service. He is the ultimate source of truth and possesses the key of David, representing supreme authority and control over the spiritual city. Through Christ, the Scriptures are opened to those who seek Him, while being shut to those who reject Him. His power is unmatched, allowing Him to determine who gains access to the kingdom and who does not.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "He that is holy—as in the Old Testament, 'the Holy One of Israel.' Thus Jesus and the God of the Old Testament are one."
2. "true—Greek, 'alethinos': 'VERY God,' as distinguished from the false gods and from all those who say that they are what they are not: real, genuine."
3. "he that hath the key of David—the antitype of Eliakim, to whom the 'key,' the emblem of authority 'over the house of David,' was transferred from Shebna, who was removed from the office of chamberlain or treasurer, as unworthy of it."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Our impression of what is said to us will often depend much on our idea of the character of him who addresses us, and solemnity and thoughtfulness always become us when we are addressed by a holy Redeemer."
2. "It is a characteristic often ascribed to him in the New Testament, and one which is eminently adapted to impress the mind with solemn thought in view of the fact that he is to pronounce on our character, and to determine our destiny."
3. "The language is what properly denotes authority or control - as when one has the key of a house, and has unlimited access to it; and the meaning here is, that as David is represented as the king of Israel residing in a palace, so he who had the key to that palace had regal authority."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Of all the seven churches it had the longest duration of prosperity as a Christian city."
2. "Christ is called holy... in all which passages the word, however, is osiov, which is holy by sanction, applied to one who diligently observes all the sanctities of religion."
3. "Alhqinov is not merely, genuine as contrasted with the absolutely false, but as contrasted with that which is only subordinately or typically true. It expresses the perfect realization of an idea as contrasted with its partial realization."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "By the word holy we are to understand not so much one who is free from sin, as one who is consecrated and set apart to the service of God."
2. "By the word true, one who is the essence of reality as opposed to one who is only phenomenal and shadowy."
3. "He is the Way, no one cometh unto the Father but by Him; and against those that come to Him the gates of Hell shall not prevail."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "The holy, the genuine." Asyndeton in the Greek. Latin Vulgate, Sanctus et Verus. Hο αγιος is ascribed to God in Revelation 4:8; Revelation 6:10 (both αγιος and αληθινος as here), but to Christ in Mark 1:24; Luke 4:34; John 6:69; Acts 4:27; Acts 4:30; 1 John 2:20, a recognized title of the Messiah as the consecrated one set apart.

2. Christ as the Messiah (Revelation 5:5; Revelation 22:16) has exclusive power in heaven, on earth, and in Hades (Matthew 16:19; Matthew 28:18; Romans 14:9; Philippians 2:9; Revelation 1:18). Christ has power to admit and exclude of his own will (Matthew 25:10; Ephesians 1:22; Revelation 3:21; Revelation 19:11-16; Revelation 20:4; Revelation 22:16).

3. Charles calls the structure Hebrew (future active indicative of κλειω), and not Greek because it does not correspond to the present articular participle just before ο ανοιγων (the one opening), but it occurs often in this book as in the very next clause, "and none openeth" (κα ουδεις ανοιγε) over against κλειων (present active participle, opening) though here some MSS. read κλειε (present active indicative, open).

### John Gill:
1. "Love, which is now so cold, and so much wanting in our present Sardian church state, will be exceeding warm and fervent, and in its highest pitch in the Philadelphian state."
2. "The characters Christ here assumes point at the holiness of life, truth of doctrine, and purity of discipline, for which this church state will be distinguished."
3. "He opens the Scriptures, which are shut to a natural man, as he did in his own personal ministry, when here on earth, and now by his Spirit; and none can shut them, either men or devils, or hinder the spread of light and knowledge by them."

### John Wesley:
1. "He that hath the key of David - A master of a family, or a prince, has one or more keys, wherewith he can open and shut all the doors of his house or palace."
2. "Much more has Christ, the Son of David, the key of the spiritual city of David, the New Jerusalem; the supreme right, power, and authority, as in his own house."
3. "He openeth this to all that overcome, and none shutteth: he shutteth it against all the fearful, and none openeth."
