Despite their small numbers, they were capable of doing good works and continuing to obey and proclaim God's name.

1. "An open door (quran ajnewgmenhn). Rev., more literally, a door opened. This is variously explained. Some refer it to the entrance into the joy of the Lord; others to the initiation into the meaning of scripture; others again to the opportunity for the mission - work of the Church." 

2. "I have given is appropriate, since all opportunities of service are gifts of God."
