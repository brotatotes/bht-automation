# Revelation 4:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
After witnessing visions of Christ and writing the letters to the seven churches, John eagerly sought to see more. His desires were fulfilled when he saw a door open in heaven, providing him with a glimpse into the heavenly realm. The voice of the Son of God, like the sound of a trumpet, resonated within him, inviting him to come closer and be shown the things that were to come. The succession of visions revealed not only a change in the panorama, but also a deep connection between heaven and earth, allowing John to bear witness to divine truths.
