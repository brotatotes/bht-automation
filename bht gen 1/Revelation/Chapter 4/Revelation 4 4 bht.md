The Bible verse being described is from the Book of Revelation. It portrays a scene where twenty-four elders are seated on thrones, representing the Church throughout different ages. These elders are not angels but representatives of the Church, adorned in white garments, symbolizing purity.

The elders are in a state of rest and honor, having already completed their course and taken their place among the citizens of heaven.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "These 24 elders are not angels, but representatives of the Church, as generally understood."
2. "The key to the interpretation being the analogy with the sayings of our Lord to the Apostles."
3. "It is no small confirmation of the view, that in ch. Revelation 15:3, we find the double idea of the church, as made up of Old Testament and New Testament saints, plainly revealed to St. John."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "the seat (rather, throne) of the beasts, in hellish parody of God's throne."
2. "the twenty-four elders were not mentioned before, whereas the twenty-four thrones were."
3. "They are not angels, for they have white robes and crowns of victory, implying a conflict and endurance."
4. "the Old Testament and the New Testament. 'Elders' is the very term for the ministry both of the Old and New Testament, the Jewish and the catholic Gentile Church."
5. "Thus Jehovah's throne is represented by the mercy seat in the holiest, the Shekinah-cloud over it."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The word, indeed, properly denotes a seat, but it came to be employed to denote particularly the seat on which a monarch sat, and is properly translated thus in Revelation 4:2-3."
2. "They are designed to represent the whole church in every land and every age of the world."
3. "The design, therefore, is to represent the church triumphant - redeemed - saved - as rendering praise and honor to God; as uniting with the hosts of heaven in adoring him for his perfections and for the wonders of his grace."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "A royal throne. Used of the oracular seat of the priestess of Apollo."
2. "The twenty-four elders are usually taken to represent the one Church of Christ, as at once the Church of the old and of the new Covenant, figured by the twelve patriarchs and the twelve apostles."
3. "The natural inference from this epithet and from the fact that the symbolism of Apoc. is Hebrew, and that the Jews had the greatest detestation of the Greek games, would be that stefanov is here used of the royal crown, especially since the Church is here represented as triumphant - a kingdom and priests."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "It is important to observe the word ‘thrones’ here used by St. John, for there can be no doubt that it is deliberately chosen in order to bring out the fact that the glorified Church of Christ is placed in no lower position than that of the Saviour’s and the Father’s throne."
2. "The twenty-four elders, thus embodying the conception of the Church of Christ in her perfected condition, have three characteristics. (1) They are sitting, the attitude of rest and honour. (2) They are clothed in white garments, the robes of perfect purity, the robes of priests. (3) They have on their heads golden crowns, those of chaps. Revelation 2:10, Revelation 3:11, and Revelation 14:14, in which last passage the same ‘golden crown’ is assigned to the Son of man."
3. "Like Him, they are not only priests but kings. The Church is before us in her triumphing condition."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Four and twenty elders...Twenty-four as a symbolic number occurs only in this book and only for these elders." 
2. "We do not really know why this number is chosen, perhaps two elders for each tribe, perhaps the twelve tribes and the twelve apostles (Judaism and Christianity), perhaps the twenty-four courses of the sons of Aaron (1 Chronicles 24:1-19), perhaps some angelic rank (Colossians 1:16) of which we know nothing."
3. "Arrayed in white garments...Locative case here as in Revelation 3:5 (with εν), though accusative in Revelation 7:9; Revelation 7:13."

### John Gill:
1. "The thrones in the above form, came to both ends, or sides of it; just as when the sanhedrim, or great court of judicature among the Jews say m, the 'Nasi', or prince, sat in the uppermost seat, at his right hand was 'Ab beth din', or the father or the sanhedrim, and at his left hand a doctor or wise man, and all the rest of the members sat in a semicircular form upon seats before them, so that they could see them all."
2. "The members of the Gospel church state, throughout the whole of it, in every succession and period of time, are here meant; and are expressed by the number 'twenty four', in allusion to the twenty four courses of the priests, into which they were divided by David."
3. "Clothed in white raiment in the pure and spotless robe of Christ's righteousness, which is comparable to fine linen, clean and white; and is the righteousness of the saints in common, of every true member of Christ's body."

### John Wesley:
1. "The most holy of all the former ages, representing the whole body of the saints." 
2. "Clothed in white raiment, showing that they had already finished their course and taken their place among the citizens of heaven."
3. "They are never termed souls, and hence it is probable that they had glorified bodies already."
