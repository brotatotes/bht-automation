### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Like crystal—not imperfectly transparent as the ancient common glass, but like rock crystal."
2. "Thus, primarily, the pure ether which separates God's throne from John, and from all things before it, may be meant, symbolizing the 'purity, calmness, and majesty of God's rule.'"
3. "There is in this sea depth and transparency, but not the fluidity and instability of the natural sea... It stands solid, calm, and clear, God's judgments are called 'a great deep.'"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It resembled, in its general appearance, glass; and this idea is strengthened by the addition of another image of the same character - that it was like an expanse of crystal, perfectly clear and pellucid."
2. "The most natural explanation to be given of the 'four living beings' is to suppose that they are symbolical beings designed to furnish some representation of the government of God - to illustrate, as it were, that on which the divine government rests, or which constitutes its support - to wit, power, intelligence, vigilance, energy."
3. "The emblem here would denote an everwatchful and observing Providence; and, in accordance with the explanation proposed above, it means that, in the administration of the divine government, everything is distinctly contemplated; nothing escapes observation; nothing can be concealed."

### Marvin Vincent:

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Like a glassy sea" - The adjective "glassy" in this context refers to the appearance, not the material. It suggests a likeness to the sky reflecting on the surface of the sea, creating a serene and calm image. (Quote 1)

2. "Like crystal" - The use of the word "crystal" emphasizes the clarity and transparency of the scene. It is not semi-opaque, but clear like rock-crystal, symbolizing purity and divine radiance. (Quote 2)

3. "Full of eyes" - The phrase "full of eyes" describes the four living creatures surrounding the throne. It signifies unlimited intelligence and ceaseless vigilance, representing the all-knowing nature of God and the constant watchfulness of creation. (Quote 3)

### John Gill:
1. "By which is meant, not heaven, nor the souls of the blessed there, nor the multitude of the holy angels, nor the first converts to Christianity at Jerusalem; for those that got the victory over the beast are said to stand upon this sea, Revelation 15:2, which these senses, especially the three last, will by no means admit of."
2. "Others think the ordinance of baptism is designed, of which the Red sea, through which the Israelites passed under the cloud, was an emblem; and which may be compared to a 'sea of glass', for its transparency, it clearly expressing the sufferings, burial, and resurrection of Christ; and to crystal, for its purity; and to all this for its cleansing nature, as it leads unto the blood of Christ; and its being before the throne may denote its being the way of entrance into the Gospel church."
3. "And this is said to be before the throne, where the rainbow of the covenant is, of which the Gospel is a transcript; and where the four and twenty elders, or members of churches be, for their delight and comfort; and where the seven spirits of God are, to furnish men with gifts to preach it; and where the four living creatures, or ministers of the word, have their place, who officiate in it."

### John Wesley:
1. "Both the 'seven lamps of fire' and this sea are before the throne; and both may mean 'the seven spirits of God,' the Holy Ghost; whose powers and operations are frequently represented both under the emblem of fire and of water." 
2. "The sea which is before the throne, and the stream which goes out of the throne, may both mean the same; namely, the Spirit of God."
3. "The first living creature was like a lion — To signify undaunted courage. The second, like a calf — Or ox, to signify unwearied patience. The third, with the face of a man — To signify prudence and compassion. The fourth, like an eagle — To signify activity and vigour."
