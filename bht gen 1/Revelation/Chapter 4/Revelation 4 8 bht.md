# Revelation 4:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse reveals a breathtaking scene of heavenly creatures, full of eyes, singing praises to God. The six-winged cherubim, like seraphim, encompassed the throne, displaying both reverence and vigilance. They join in a chorus of "Holy, holy, holy," acknowledging God's majesty, justice, and mercy. This continual worship is a tribute to the absolute being and perfections of the Almighty, who is praised as the one who was, is, and is to come. In this sacred space, the cherubim and other heavenly beings are in constant awe, recognizing the need for holiness and the everlasting nature of God's praise.

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The eyes were round the outside of each wing, and up the inside of each when half expanded, and of the part of body in that inward recess."
2. "Holy, holy, holy—The 'tris-hagion' of the Greek liturgies. In :-, as here, it occurs; also Psalms 99:3; Psalms 99:5; Psalms 99:9, where He is praised as 'holy,' (1) on account of His majesty (Revelation 4:1) about to display itself; (2) His justice (Revelation 4:1- :) already displaying itself; (3) His mercy (Revelation 4:1- :) which displayed itself in times past."
3. "The cherubim here have six wings, like the seraphim in Isaiah 6:2; whereas the cherubim in Ezekiel 1:6 had four wings each."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "An emblem common to them all, denoting that, in reference to each and all the things here symbolized, there was one common characteristic - that in heaven there is the utmost promptness in executing the divine commands."

3. "Holy, etc. Compare Isaiah 6:3, which is the original of the formula known as the Trisagion (thrice holy), used in the ancient liturgies."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The Trisagion thus sung by the living creatures is found also in Isaiah 6:3, in a passage which we have already seen lies largely at the bottom of the description of this chapter."
2. "It is thus natural to think that it is sung to the glory of God in the same character as that in which He there appears, that it is sung therefore to God in the absoluteness of His being and perfections, and not as specially the Father."
3. "The ascription of praise appears to consist of three parts, not as commonly supposed of two. He to whom it is sung is first addressed as ‘Lord’ or Jehovah, and is then celebrated as ‘God;’ as ‘the Almighty;’ and as ‘He which was, and which is, and which is to come.’"
