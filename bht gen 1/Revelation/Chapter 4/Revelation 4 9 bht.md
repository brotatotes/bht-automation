# Revelation 4:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
From the commentaries, we gather that this Bible verse depicts a scene in which creation and the redeemed beings are engaged in continuous praise and worship of God. It highlights the foundational role of creation in expressing gratitude towards God. The praise and glory given by representatives of nature are reciprocated by the redeemed, as they acknowledge and honor God's perfections, covenant, promises, and the gifts and grace bestowed upon them. This act of worship encompasses all aspects of God's work in creation, redemption, and sanctification.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Creation is the foundation of all God's other acts of power, wisdom, and love, and therefore forms the first theme of His creatures' thanksgivings."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "In these words we have a description of the Trisagion which has just been sung, and the description introduces the fact that the four-and-twenty elders are stirred by the lofty melody."
2. "It is remarkable that this should be the order of the song of praise. We might have expected that the twenty-four elders as representing the Church would be first, and that by them the representatives of creation would be stirred to a like enthusiasm. As it is, the order is reversed."
3. "The song raised is not so much one of praise for redemption, as of praise for that creation and providence of God which preceded and prepared the way for redemption. Redeemed creation therefore begins it; but it is immediately taken up by the Church."

2. "Created life adores the Uncreated."
