## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The lying on the open hand imports, that on God’s part there was no withholding of His future purposes as contained in this book."
2. "The completeness of the contents as containing the divine counsels: there was no room for addition to that which was therein written."
3. "The opening of the seals, as notified by the symbolic visions belonging to each, does not relate to things past, but to things which were yet future when this book was written."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The roll, or book, appears from the context to be 'the title-deed of man's inheritance' redeemed by Christ, and contains the successive steps by which He shall recover it from its usurper and obtain actual possession of the kingdom already 'purchased' for Himself and His elect saints." 
2. "The opening of the seals will mean the successive steps by which God in Christ clears the way for the final opening and reading of the book at the visible setting up of the kingdom of Christ."
3. "The question is not (as commonly supposed), Who should reveal the destinies of the Church (for this any inspired prophet would be competent to do)? but, Who has the WORTH to give man a new title to his lost inheritance?"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The book or roll referred to here was what contained the revelation in the subsequent chapters, to the end of the description of the opening of the seventh seal - for the communication that was to be made was all included in the seven seals."
2. "It is not necessary to suppose that John saw both sides of the parchment as it was held in the hand of him that sat on the throne. That it was written on the back side he would naturally see, and, as the book was sealed, he would infer that it was written in the usual manner on the inside."
3. "May it not have been intended by this arrangement to suggest the idea that the whole future is unknown to us, and that the disclosure of any one portion, though necessary if the whole would be known, does not disclose all, but leaves seal after seal still unbroken, and that they are all to be broken one after another if we would know all?"

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Within and on the back side. Indicating the completeness of the divine counsels contained in the book." 
2. "The roll is wound round a staff and fastened down to it with the seven seals." 
3. "The contents of the book leap forth in plastic symbols from the loosened seal."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The roll is close-sealed, a strong expression, to mark the mysterious and inscrutable nature of its contents."
2. "The number one is elevated into the sacred number seven in order to indicate the completeness of the sealing."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Upon the right hand, the open palm." - This anthropomorphic language draws from Ezekiel 2:9 and emphasizes the significance and authority of what is being held.
2. "Description of a roll like that in Luke 4:17, not a codex as some scholars think." - This clarifies the form of the book, highlighting that it was a scroll rather than a bound book.
3. "This sealed book of doom calls for no witnesses beyond God's own will." - The sealed book represents God's will and purpose, and its sealing signifies its importance and divine authority.

### John Gill:
1. "This book seems to have consisted of seven rolls, to which was annexed seven seals; and there being not room enough within, contrary to the common way of writing, some things were written upon the backside of the outermost roll; and such writings were by the ancients called 'Opistographi'." 
2. "By this book some understand the Scriptures of the Old Testament, which were written in rolls; and which came out of the right hand of God, and were given forth by him; and being written within, and on the backside, may denote the fulness of them, they containing a variety of matter, useful and profitable, for different purposes."
3. "Rather therefore the book of God's decrees is here meant, which respects all creatures, and all occurrences and events in the whole world, from the beginning to the end of time; and so Ezekiel's roll, according to the Targum on Ezekiel 2:10; which was written before and behind, signified that which was 'from the beginning', and which 'shall be in the end', or hereafter."

### John Wesley:
1. "He held it openly, in order to give it to him that was worthy."
