# Revelation 5:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the redeemed humbly refer to themselves in the third person, highlighting their deep self-abasement. They anticipate reigning over the new earth, as symbolized by the golden crowns worn by the elders. This reign of the saints, which begins after the first resurrection and continues into eternity, reflects God's ultimate plan and the eschatological hope of believers.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The Hebrew construction of the third person for the first, has a graphic relation to the redeemed, and also has a more modest sound than us, priests." 
2. "They who cast their crowns before the throne, do not call themselves kings in the sight of the great King; though their priestly access has such dignity that their reigning on earth cannot exceed it."
3. "ALFORD takes this reading and explains it of the Church EVEN NOW, in Christ her Head, reigning on the earth: 'all things are being put under her feet, as under His; her kingly office and rank are asserted, even in the midst of persecution.'"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The idea clearly is, in accordance with what is so frequently said in the Scriptures, that the dominion on the earth will be given to the saints; that is, that there will be such a prevalence of true religion, and the redeemed will be so much in the ascendency, that the affairs of the nations will be in their hands."
2. "Righteous people will hold the offices; will fill places of trust and responsibility; will have a controlling voice in all that pertains to human affairs."
3. "To such a prevalence of religion all things are tending; and to this, in all the disorder and sin which now exist, are we permitted to look forward."
