### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Creature [κτισμα] . See 1 Timothy 4:4; James 1:18. From ktizw to found. A thing founded or created Rev., created thing." 

2. "In the sea [επι της θαλασσης] . More accurately, 'on the sea,' as Rev. Not ships, but creatures of the sea which have come up from its depths to the surface."
