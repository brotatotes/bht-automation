# Revelation 5:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, the commentators emphasize the universal significance of the event, noting that no one, not even angels or the souls of departed saints, could escape the judgment of God. The verse encompasses all realms of existence, highlighting the vastness and scope of God's dominion. The inability of creation to fully comprehend or grasp the mysteries of God is underscored, as there is no one in heaven, on earth, or even in Hades who has the ability to open the book or look upon its contents.
