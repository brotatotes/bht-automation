## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:

2. "The lion, as victorious: from the tribe of Judah, as the Messiah of promise, sprung from among the brethren of the Seer, and so carrying more comfort to him."
3. "The evident design here is to set forth Christ as sprung from the tribe of Judah and lineage of David, and His victory as His exaltation through suffering."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The elders in heaven round God's throne know better than John, still in the flesh, the far-reaching power of Christ."
2. "Not merely 'a sucker come up from David's ancient root' (as ALFORD limits it), but also including the idea of His being Himself the root and origin of David."
3. "He is at once 'the branch' of David, and 'the root' of David, David's Son and David's Lord, the Lamb slain and therefore the Lion of Juda: about to reign over Israel, and thence over the whole earth."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Though they were in heaven, they were deeply interested in all that pertained to the welfare of the church, and they had been permitted to understand what as yet was unknown to him, that the power of opening the mysterious volume which contained the revelation of the future was entrusted particularly to the Messiah."
2. "The lion is the king of beasts, the monarch of the forest, and thus becomes an emblem of one of kingly authority and of power... It is because Christ has power to open the seals - as if he ruled over the universe, and all events were under his control, as the lion rules in the forest - that the name is here given to him."
3. "This expression would connect him directly with David, the great and glorious monarch of Israel, and as having a right to occupy his throne. As one thus ruling over the people of God, there was a propriety that to him should be entrusted the task of opening these seals."

### John Gill:
1. "And one of the elders said unto me,.... The Ethiopic version reads, 'one of these elders'; that is, one of the four and twenty elders that were round about the throne; not the first of the four and twenty books of the Old Testament; nor the patriarch Jacob, because of the prophecy concerning Shiloh, Judah's son, which stands in Genesis 49:10, nor Moses, who spoke of the Messiah as the great prophet of the church; nor John the Baptist, who pointed out the Lamb of God; these are all fancies and conjectures."
2. "Christ may be compared to one, because of his great strength, he being the mighty God, the able Saviour, and strong Redeemer, and protector of his church and people, and the avenger of their enemies; and because of his courage and intrepidity when he engaged with Satan, and his principalities and powers, when he bore the sins of his people, sustained his Father's wrath, and the terrors of death set themselves in array against him; and because of the fierceness of his wrath, and fury against the wicked, and for his generosity and lenity towards those that stoop unto him, and obey him."
3. "The root of David; in like manner is Christ called the root of Jesse in Isaiah 11:10; and the meaning either is, that he is a branch that springs out of the roots of Jesse and David, is David's son and offspring, according to his human nature; see Revelation 22:16; or that he is David's Lord, according to his divine nature: and the metaphor of a root well agrees with him as Mediator, he being hidden out of sight, and unknown to a natural man; and may denote his meanness in his state of humiliation, when he was as a root out of a dry ground; and because he is the root from whence all the elect of God spring, in whom they have their being, and by whom they are bore and supported, and from whom are derived to them all the blessings of grace, all their spiritual life, holiness, fruitfulness, and perseverance."


### John Wesley:
1. "The Lion of the tribe of Judah - The victorious prince who is, like a lion, able to tear all his enemies in pieces."
2. "The root of David - As God, the root and source of David's family."
3. "Hath prevailed to open the book - Hath overcome all obstructions, and obtained the honour to disclose the divine counsels."
