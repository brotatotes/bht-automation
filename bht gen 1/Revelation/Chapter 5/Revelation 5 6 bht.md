# Revelation 5:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the midst of heavenly glory, a striking contrast emerges as John sees a lamb standing after being slaughtered for sacrifice. The lambsymbolizes Christ's meekness, innocence, and sacrificial work that made an atonement for sin. Symbolically representing completeness, the seven eyes of the lamb signify the discerning Spirit of God in operation,while the seven horns depict Christ's perfect strength and dominion. As he stands among the throne, living creatures, and elders, Christ, our Advocate, is ready to execute his divine offices with readiness and authority.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The use of ἀρνίον, the diminutive, as applied to our Lord, is peculiar to the Apocalypse. It is difficult to say what precise idea is meant to be conveyed by this form. Possibly, as De W., it may be to put forward more prominently the idea of meekness and innocence." 
2. "Though ὡς ἐσφαγμένον, it was not lying, but standing."
3. "The seven eyes of the Lamb represent the same Spirit in his sevenfold perfection, profluent, so to speak, from the incarnate Redeemer: busied in His world-wide energy."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Lamb—Greek, 'arnion' always found in Revelation exclusively, expresses endearment, namely, the endearing relation in which Christ now stands to us, as the consequence of His previous relation as the sacrificial Lamb."
2. "In the midst of heavenly glory Christ crucified is still the prominent object."
3. "The seven eyes of the Lamb represent the same sevenfold Spirit profluent from the incarnate Redeemer in His world-wide energy."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He was so placed as to seem to be in the midst of the group made up of the throne, the living beings, and the elders."
2. "The great work which the Redeemer performed - that of making an atonement for sin - was thus represented to John in such a way that he at once recognized him."
3. "The number seven here seems to be designed, as in other places, to denote completeness. The meaning is, that he had so large a number as to denote complete dominion."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Christ had just been spoken of as a lion. He now appears as a lamb. Some interpreters emphasize the idea of gentleness, others that of sacrifice."
2. "Though slaughtered the lamb stands. Christ, though slain, is risen and living."
3. "The horn is the emblem of might. The eyes represent the discerning Spirit of God in its operation upon all created things."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The Seer had been told of a lion, and he beholds a lamb; and Revelation 5:9 makes it evident that the lamb is thought of not merely in its gentleness and patience, but as an animal used for sacrifice."
2. "The 'standing' of the Lamb is deeply important. First of all we may observe that it is as slaughtered (not 'slain,' but 'slaughtered') for sacrifice, the word being sacrificial (Exodus 12:6), that the Lamb appears. Jesus suffering even unto death is before us. But though thus 'slaughtered' the Lamb 'stands,' stands as a living, not lies as a dead, animal. Jesus risen and glorified is presented to our view."
3. "While His people live forever in His life, they never cease to feel that they were redeemed in His blood. The Lamb has still further seven horns. In Scripture the horn is always the emblem of strength and force; the number 'seven' denotes, as usual, completeness."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "In the midst (εν μεσω). See Revelation 4:6 for this idiom."
2. "A Lamb (αρνιον). Elsewhere in the N.T. ο αμνος is used of Christ (John 1:29; John 1:36; Acts 8:32; 1 Peter 1:19 like Isaiah 53:7), but in the Apocalypse το αρνιον occurs for the Crucified Christ 29 times in twelve chapters."
3. "Seven eyes (οφθαλμους επτα). Like Zechariah 3:9; Zechariah 4:10 and denotes here, as there, omniscience."

### John Gill:
1. "Christ, both in the Old and New Testament, is often compared; and that very aptly, for his innocence and purity of nature; for his harmless and inoffensive conversation; and for his meek and humble deportment throughout the whole of his life; and for his patience at the time of his sufferings and death; and for his usefulness both for food and clothing to his people; and chiefly for his sacrifice for them."
2. "Christ had been really slain by the wicked hands of the Jews, and not in appearance only; the as, here, is not a note of mere similitude and likeness, but of reality and truth."
3. "He stood between the throne, and between the living creatures, and the elders, being the Mediator between God, and his church, and people; he, appeared before the throne for them, as their advocate, and stood ready to give them all the assistance, and to do them all the good he could."

### John Wesley:
1. "He is now in a posture of readiness to execute all his offices of prophet, priest, and king."
2. "And because he was slain, he is worthy to open the book, to the joy of his own people, and the terror of his enemies."
3. "Having seven horns - As a king, the emblem of perfect strength. And seven eyes - The emblem of perfect knowledge and wisdom."
