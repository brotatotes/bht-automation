# Revelation 5:7 Commentary Help Text

In this symbolic vision, a book lies open on the hand of the One seated on the throne, ready to be taken by any worthy. The Lamb, symbolizing Christ, takes the book from the Father, establishing His universal dominion. This powerful act signifies the setting up of Christ's everlasting kingdom. The tense used, "He has taken it," highlights the ongoing significance and lasting impact of this momentous event. This action fulfills the prophetic words and showcases the Lamb's ability to fulfill all that is written in the book.
