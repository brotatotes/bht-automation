# Revelation 6:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, the elect are depicted as crying out to God day and night, seeking justice and vengeance for their cause, even though they bear long with it. Their cry reflects the sentiment of the Old Testament, as they appeal to God as their Master, acknowledging His holiness and truth. The martyrs' fervent cry is a pure and suitable desire, longing for the righteous judgments of God to be executed against their enemies on earth. Thus, their prayer is transformed into a thanksgiving, as they trust in God's attributes and His ultimate justice.

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The elect...cry day and night to God, who will assuredly, in His own time, avenge His and their cause, 'though He bear long with them.'"

### Philip Schaff:
1. "They cried (yet not the martyrs themselves but the blood which represents them) as the blood of Abel cried." 
2. "Their confidence that God will deliver is confirmed by the thought of the attributes which distinguish Him. He is 'the holy:' therefore He will the more surely punish wickedness. He is the 'true,' that is, certainly not the truthful, which is never the meaning of the word here employed, but either the Being who alone has true and substantial existence, or the Master who completely corresponds with the idea of what a Master ought to be."
3. "Their cry is, How long will it be before the Judge arises to claim the victory as His own, and to punish His adversaries as they deserve?"

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "How long" (εως ποτε). "Until when." Cf. Matthew 7:17; John 10:24.
2. "O Master" (ο δεσποτης). Nominative articular form, but used as vocative (δεσποτα) as in Revelation 4:11 (John 20:28).
3. "The holy and true" (ο αγιος κα αληθινος). See Revelation 3:7 for these attributes of God.

### John Gill:
1. "And they cried with a loud voice,.... With great ardour and fervency, being very pressing and importunate; and which shows that they were awake, and not asleep, and that the soul does not sleep with the body in the grave, or is after the death of that in a state of insensibility and inactivity, as some imagine."

2. "the person they address is either the Lamb in the midst of the throne, with whom they were, and under the shelter of whom they were safe and happy; or God the Father, who sat upon the throne, whom they call 'holy', because being so in his nature, and as appears in all his works, he could not but hate, and so revenge the evil that was done to them by their cruel persecutors."

3. "they doubted not but he would judge and avenge them of their enemies; but they seem desirous to know how long it would be first: saying, dost thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth? the men of the world, idolatrous persons, earthly princes, who had shed their blood; and which they desire not out of any sinful or malicious affection, but that the holiness and justice of God might appear."

### John Wesley:
1. "The cry of the martyrs is a pure and suitable desire, reflecting the holiness and truth of God."
2. "The martyrs are concerned for the praise of their Master, acknowledging His holiness and truth."
3. "The prayer of the martyrs is transformed into a thanksgiving, recognizing the righteous judgments of God."
