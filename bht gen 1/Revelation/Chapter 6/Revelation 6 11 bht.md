# Revelation 6:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, it is revealed that white robes are given to every individual, symbolizing their purity, triumph, and favor in the eyes of God. These robes represent their innocence, joy, and victory. Furthermore, they are granted rest and peace from their toils and sufferings, enjoying eternal rest. While the duration of this period of rest is not explicitly stated, it is made clear that it is not to be equated with a short season, but rather has a specific meaning within the context of the book.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "A white robe was given." - This quote highlights the symbolism of the white robe, representing light, joy, and triumphant victory over their foes. It signifies purity and sanctity through Christ, likening the blessed ones to spotless priests who minister unto God and the Lamb.

2. "Even if it be omitted, is it to be inferred that the 'season' is short as compared with eternity?" - This quote challenges the assumption that the "little season" mentioned in the verse is necessarily a short period of time. It suggests that the duration of this season may not be easily quantifiable in human terms.

3. "Until their full number shall have been completed." - This quote emphasizes the idea that the number of the elect, or chosen ones, is fixed and definite. It implies that there is a predetermined number of individuals who will partake in the full blessedness and glory of all the saints, and this number will be fulfilled in due time.
