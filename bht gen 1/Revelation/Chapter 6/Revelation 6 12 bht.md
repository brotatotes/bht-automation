# Revelation 6:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, we witness the culmination of God's judgment on the wicked departed, depicted as the sixth seal. With the imagery of earthquakes and the darkening of the sun and moon, the verse symbolizes the removal of Paganism and idolatry from the Roman empire. Through the shaking of mutable things, the divine sets the stage for the establishment of an unshakable order. St. John's vision reveals the impending end of the world to the spirits of the departed, without any awareness of this cosmic event on earth.

2. "And the sun came black as sackcloth of hair; which is made of black hairs; as when eclipsed.

3. "And the moon became as blood; as when obscured; this may design the next Heathen deity, or class of deities, for the moon was also worshipped by the Heathens under different names; and may likewise include the Pagan priesthood, which was next, and was annexed to the imperial dignity."
