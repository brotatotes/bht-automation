# Revelation 6:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we see a vivid portrayal of bloodshed and conflict. The color of the horse, red, signifies carnage and discord, symbolizing the suffering state of the church. It represents the taking away of peace from the Roman empire, leading to civil discord and mutual slaughter. Ultimately, this period of war and bloodshed clears the way for the coming of Christ's kingdom, as the saints endure amidst the judgments of the earth. The verse reminds us of the consequences of war and the endurance required in turbulent times.
