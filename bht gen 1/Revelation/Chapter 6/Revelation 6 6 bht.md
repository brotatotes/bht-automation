# Revelation 6:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the midst of the four living creatures, God's voice is heard, showing His compassion and mercy for His redeemed. This verse reveals a time of scarcity and famine, where basic necessities become scarce and unaffordable, affecting not just individuals but families as well. The scarcity is specifically on the necessities of life, such as bread, while the luxuries like oil and wine are preserved. It is a season where God safeguards the essential truths, protecting them from heretics and false teachers, even in times of darkness and spiritual famine.
