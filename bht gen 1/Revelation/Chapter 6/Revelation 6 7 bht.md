## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The fourth living creature, who was 'like a flying eagle,' introduces this seal; implying high-soaring intelligence, and judgment descending from on high fatally on the ungodly, as the king of birds on his prey." 

2. "The image of a flying eagle symbolizes divine judgment, suggesting that God's judgment will come swiftly and decisively upon the ungodly."

3. "The eagle's ability to soar high in the sky represents the divine perspective and wisdom from which this judgment is executed."

4. "This seal serves as a reminder that God's justice is not only righteous but also swift, leaving no room for escape or evasion."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "As in the other cases, there does not appear to have been any particular reason why the fourth of the living creatures should have made this proclamation rather than either of the others." 
2. "It was poetic and appropriate to represent each one in his turn as making proclamation."
3. "Come and see."

### John Gill:
1. "The opening of this seal begins with Maximinus the Roman emperor, who came from Thrace, far north."
2. "This living creature was not James, the brother of our Lord, who had been dead long ago, as Grotius imagines; nor Cyprian, as Brightman thinks, though he lived under this seal; but the ministers of the Gospel in general in the times referred to are intended."
3. "It may denote some decline in the Gospel ministry, that they had not the courage and strength of the lion, as the first Gospel preachers; nor the patience and laboriousness of the ox, the next set of ministers; nor the solidity and prudence of the man, the ministers that followed them; and yet they retained some degree of light and knowledge, sagacity and penetration, and contempt of the world, signified by the eagle."

### John Wesley:
1. "The voice of the fourth living creature coming from the north signifies the power and authority of God, as the north is often associated with strength and majesty in the Bible."

2. "This verse reminds us that God's voice can be heard from all directions, symbolizing His omnipresence and sovereignty over all creation."

3. "The mention of the fourth living creature highlights the harmony and unity among the heavenly beings, as they all join together in proclaiming the greatness of God."

4. "The voice from the north also serves as a reminder that God's voice is not limited by our human understanding or expectations, but rather transcends all boundaries and speaks to us in ways we may not always anticipate."
