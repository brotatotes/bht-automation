# Revelation 6:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the depiction of the Bible verse, the imagery of the souls under the altar in heaven carries a symbolic significance. These souls, representing the martyrs sacrificed for Christ, cry out for vengeance, as blood often symbolizes. The white robe given to the martyrs symbolizes their acknowledged and glorified righteousness, although their prayer for vengeance is yet to be fulfilled. This scene is part of a series of seals that transition from the visible to the invisible world, encompassing both the heavenly and earthly realms of martyrdom and the divine justice that awaits.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The representation here, in which they are seen under the altar, is simply symbolical, carrying out the likening of them to victims slain on an altar. Even as the blood of these victims was poured under the altar and the life was in the blood, so their souls are represented as under the symbolical altar in heaven, crying for vengeance, as blood is often said to do."
2. "The cry of the martyrs’ blood has been ever going up before God since Stephen fell: ever and anon, at some great time of persecution, it has waxed louder: and so on through the ages it shall accumulate and gather strength, till the great issue of the parable Luke 18:1 ff. is accomplished."
3. "The white robe, in this book, is the vestment of acknowledged and glorified righteousness in which the saints walk and reign with Christ: this was given to the martyrs: but their prayer for vengeance was not yet granted."

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "The three last seals relate to the invisible, as the first four to the visible world."
2. "The souls of those sacrificed for Christ's testimony are symbolically represented as under the altar, in heaven."
3. "The only altar in heaven is that antitypical to the temple altar of incense. The blood of the martyrs cries from the earth under Christ's cross, whereon they may be considered virtually to have been sacrificed; their souls cry from under the altar of incense, which is Christ in heaven."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The imagery is from the tabernacle."
2. "Blood and life were equivalent terms to the Hebrew."
3. "They bore the testimony which was committed to them."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "With the opening of the fifth seal we pass into scenes of a kind in many respects distinguished from those of the first four."
2. "The word used, the same as that applied to the Lamb in chap. Revelation 5:6, leaves no doubt upon the point. They had been sacrificed in the same manner as their Lord; their blood had been shed as His was, and their bodies had been laid upon God’s altar to be consumed as an offering acceptable to Him."
3. "These ‘souls underneath the altar,’ therefore, are the saints of the Old Testament waiting for the completion of their happiness by having added to them their ‘fellow-servants’ of New Testament times."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "The altar of sacrifice, not of incense."
2. "This altar in heaven is symbolic, of course, the antitype for the tabernacle altar."
3. "The souls, the lives, were given for Christ."
4. "A long line of martyrs has followed."
5. "The confession of loyalty to Christ as opposed to emperor-worship."

### John Gill:
1. "This seal refers to the times of Dioclesian, and the persecution under him; and instead of the voice of one of the living creatures, John hears the voice of martyrs."
2. "These were the souls of such as 'were slain'; their bodies were dead, but their souls were alive; which shows the immortality of souls, and that they die not with their bodies, and that they live after them in a separate state."
3. "Christ may be meant by the altar here, as he is in Hebrews 13:10, who is both altar, sacrifice, and priest, and is the altar that sanctifies the gift, and from off which every sacrifice of prayer and praise comes up with acceptance before God."

### John Wesley:
1. "These all refer to the invisible world; the fifth, to the happy dead, particularly the martyrs; the sixth, to the unhappy; the seventh, to the angels, especially those to whom the trumpets are given."
2. "And it not only describes the actions of both these armies upon earth; but their respective removals from earth, into a more happy or more miserable state, succeeding each other at several times, distinguished by various degrees, celebrated by various thanksgivings."
3. "By and by their blood shall be avenged upon Babylon; but not yet, whence it appears that the plagues in the fourth seal do not concern Rome in particular."
