# Revelation 7:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Amidst the sequential visions, the opening of the seventh seal is preceded by significant events. The sealing of a chosen number, a true and secure church, occurs as a testament that even in times of turmoil, God's faithful remain protected. The four angels signify the restraint of evil forces and the prevention of false doctrines from permeating the churches across the world. These events serve as a preparation for the climactic seventh seal, carrying great significance and weight.
