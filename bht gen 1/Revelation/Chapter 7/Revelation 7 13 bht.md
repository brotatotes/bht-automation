## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "One of the twenty-four elders, representing the Old and New Testament ministry, appropriately acts as interpreter of this vision of the glorified Church."
2. "These which are arrayed in white robes, WHO are they?"
3. "The question which might have been expected to arise in John's mind from what has gone before."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The word 'answer,' with us, means 'to reply to something which has been said.' In the Bible, however, the word is not infrequently used in the beginning of a speech, where nothing has been said - as if it were a reply to something that might be said on the subject; or to something that is passing through the mind of another; or to something in the case under consideration which suggests an inquiry."
2. "The object evidently is to bring the case of these persons more particularly into view. The vast host with branches of palm had attracted the attention of John, but it was the object of the speaker to turn his thoughts to a particular part of the host - the martyrs who stood among them."
3. "There was a propriety in thus directing the mind of John to the martyrs as triumphing in heaven in a time when the churches were suffering persecution, and in view of the vision which he had had of times of darkness and calamity coming upon the world at the opening of the sixth seal."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Answered. In the sense of taking up speech in connection with some given occasion." This quote highlights the meaning of "answered" in the verse, emphasizing that it refers to responding to a specific situation or question.

2. "What are these, etc. The Rev., properly, follows the Greek order, which places first 'These which are arrayed in the white robes, who are they?'" This quote explains the significance of the revised translation, emphasizing the order of the words and the emphasis on the question about the identity of those wearing white robes.

3. "For what, render who, as Rev." This quote suggests a revision in the translation, replacing "what" with "who" to better capture the intended meaning of the verse.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The question is not asked by the Seer. It is Addressed to him in order that his attention may be drawn to it with greater force." 
2. "In chap, vi the four living creatures spoke, because they represented creation, and were the instruments of vengeance."
3. "Now one of the elders speaks, because the elders represent the triumphant Church."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "An elder intervenes, though no question has been asked to interpret the vision."
2. "Prophetic predicate nominative put before 'who are they'."
3. "Both 'who' and 'whence' as in Joshua 9:8."

### John Gill:
1. "This elder was not the Apostle Peter, as some Popish interpreters have thought; and still less Pope Silvester, who lived in the times of Constantine."
2. "The elder opened his mouth, began to speak, and called to John, and said as follows: 'What are these which are arrayed in white robes? and whence came they?'"
3. "He said this to stir up John to take more notice of them, as being a body of men that were worthy of observation and contemplation, and were worth his while to consider well who they were, and from whence they came."

### John Wesley:
1. "What stands, verses 13-17, Revelation 7:13-17 might have immediately followed the tenth verse; but that the praise of the angels, which was at the same time with that of the 'great multitude,' came in between." 
2. "He answered St. John's desire to know, not any words that he spoke." 
3. "He answered by explaining the identity and origin of the multitude before the throne, emphasizing their victory and salvation through the Lamb."
