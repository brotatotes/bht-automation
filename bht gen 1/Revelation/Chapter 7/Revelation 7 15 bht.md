# Revelation 7:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Blessed are those who wash their robes, for they have been brought through great afflictions and cleansed by the grace and power of God. They are called to serve Him in constant and uninterrupted worship, like priests in the heavenly temple. The dwelling of God among them provides not only a place of worship but also a protective covering, spreading His glory over them. It is through this purification and service that they are granted the right to eternal life and entrance into His heavenly city.
