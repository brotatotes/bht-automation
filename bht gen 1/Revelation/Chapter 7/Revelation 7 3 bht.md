# Revelation 7:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, God's love and protection for His people are emphasized. He ensures their security before initiating judgment. A faithful remnant is preserved amidst destructive forces and the mark on their foreheads signifies their allegiance to God and distinguishes them from those who have rejected Him. This mark is not physical but represents a person's unwavering faith and loyalty to God in their thoughts, actions, and character. It serves as a seal of God's ownership and protection, safeguarding His people from harm.
