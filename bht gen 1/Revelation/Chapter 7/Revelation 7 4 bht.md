# Revelation 7:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, God's divine knowledge and protection over His chosen ones is highlighted. The sealing signifies exemption from judgment upon the unbelieving, the completeness and fixedness of the sealed, with twelve symbolizing both the tribes and the Church. The number 144,000 represents a perfect and complete multitude. The description portrays the true Israel of God, consisting of both Jewish and Gentile Christians, chosen from all nations.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1) "The import for us is that the Lord knoweth and sealeth His own: that the fulness of their number shall be accomplished and not one shall fail."
2) "The sealing here mentioned...was to exempt those sealed from the judgments which were to come on the unbelieving."
3) "The objection brought against this view...is grounded on the mistake of not distinguishing between the trials of the people of God and the judgments on the unbelieving world."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Twelve is the number of the tribes, and appropriate to the Church: three by four: three, the divine number, multiplied by four, the number for world-wide extension." 
2. "Twelve by twelve implies fixity and completeness, which is taken a thousandfold in 144,000. A thousand implies the world perfectly pervaded by the divine; for it is ten, the world number, raised to the power of three, the number of God."
3. "Not 144,000 of each tribe, but the aggregate of the twelve thousand from every tribe."
4. "In consummated glory, still the Church will be that 'built on the foundation of the (Twelve) apostles (Israelites), Jesus Christ (an Israelite) being the chief corner-stone.'"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The fair interpretation seems to require that it should be understood as symbolical, or as designed not to be literally taken."
2. "It would seem from the language that there would be some selection from a much greater number."
3. "The language is such as a Christian, who had been by birth and education a Hebrew, would naturally use if he wished to designate the church."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "An hundred and forty and four thousand. Not literally, but the number symbolical of fixedness and full completion (12 x 12)."
2. "According to the Apocalyptic usage, Jewish terms are 'christianized and heightened in their meaning, and the word' Israel 'is to be understood of all Christians, the blessed company of all faithful people, the true Israel of God.'"
3. "The one hundred and forty - four thousand in chapter 14., have the Father 's name written in their foreheads; and in chapter Revelation 22:4, all the inhabitants of the New Jerusalem are so marked."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The number connotes perfection (Alford), 12x12x1000 = a hundred and forty-four thousands."
2. "There are two opposite views here, one taking the sealed as referring only to Jews... the other including Gentiles as well as Jewish Christians, that is the true Israel."
3. "But in either view there remains the difficulty about names of the tribes... The list is not geographical, since Levi is included, but Dan is omitted and Manasseh put in his place, though he as the son of Joseph is included in Joseph."

### John Gill:
1. "And I heard the number of them which were sealed... he heard the number expressed." 
2. "which is a square number arising from twelve, the square root of it, being just twelve times twelve thousand; and may denote their being the true and genuine offspring of the twelve apostles of the Lamb." 
3. "they take in all the saints within this long tract of time, even all that are the true Israel of God, who are Jews inwardly, of what nation, kindred, tongue, and people soever."

### John Wesley:
1. "To these will afterwards be joined a multitude out of all nations." 
2. "This is not the number of all the Israelites who are saved from Abraham or Moses to the end of all things."
3. "It seems as if this book had, in many places, a special view to the people of Israel."
