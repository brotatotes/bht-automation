## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The openings of these seals correspond to the various arrangements of God’s Providence by which the way is prepared for the final opening of the closed book of His purposes to His glorified Church."

2. "This book the Lamb opens, containing as it does matters which οὐδεὶς οἶδεν, οὐδὲ ἄγγελος ἐν οὐρανῷ, οὐδὲ ὁ υἱός, first by the acts and procedures of His establishment of His reign over the earth, and then finally by His great second coming, the necessary condition of His elect being gathered out of the four winds into His glory."

3. "When these preparations for His coming have taken place, and that coming itself has passed, and the elect are gathered into glory, then will be the time when the last hindrance to our perfect knowledge will be removed, and the book of God’s eternal purposes will lie open the theme of eternity’s praise."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The half hour's silence contrasts with the previous jubilant songs of the great multitude, taken up by the angels. It is the solemn introduction to the employments and enjoyments of the eternal Sabbath-rest of the people of God."
2. "The half-hour silence is the brief pause given to John between the preceding vision and the following one, implying, on the one hand, the solemn introduction to the eternal sabbatism which is to follow the seventh seal; and, on the other, the silence which continued during the incense-accompanied prayers which usher in the first of the seven trumpets."
3. "The half-hour stillness implies, too, the earnest adoring expectation with which the blessed spirits and the angels await the succeeding unfolding of God's judgments."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "On the opening of this seal, instead of voices, thunderings, tempests...there was an awful stillness, as if all heaven was reverently waiting for the development."
2. "The moments would seem to move slowly; and to see the exact force of this, we are to reflect on the scenes represented - the successive opening of seals disclosing most important events."
3. "The most simple and obvious interpretation is likely to be the true one; and that is, as above suggested, that it refers to silence in heaven as expressive of the fearful anticipation felt on opening the last seal that was to close the series, and to wind up the affairs of the church and the world."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The use of the indefinite particle with the indicative mood in this verse gives it an indefiniteness which sets it apart from the rest of the seals." 

2. "The phrase 'there followed' in this context can be more accurately translated as 'come to pass', emphasizing the unfolding of events." 

3. "John frequently uses the expression 'about' to indicate a general approximation, as seen in other passages such as John 1:39, John 6:19, and John 11:18."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The silence is generally supposed to relate to the cessation either of the songs of praise spoken of in chap. 7, or of the trials of the Church, which is now to enjoy a blessed period of rest."
2. "We suggest that the ‘silence’ alluded to refers only to the cessation of the ‘lightnings and voices and thunders’ of chap. Revelation 4:5."
3. "The silence of half an hour may well be understood to mean that the hour of judgment is interrupted or broken. In other words, judgment is not yet completed, and we must pause in order to prepare for that unfolding of it which is yet to come."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Here modal αν is used with οτε (used about the opening of the preceding six seals), but οταν is not here rendered more indefinite, as is sometimes true (Mark 3:11; Revelation 4:9), but here and possibly (can be repetition) in Mark 11:19 it is a particular instance, not a general rule." 
2. "Dramatic effect by this profound stillness with no elder or angel speaking, no chorus of praise nor cry of adoration, no thunder from the throne."
3. "Late and rare word (ημ, half, ωρα, hour), here only in N.T. Accusative of extent of time."

### John Gill:
1. "This space of time some think refers to the time which elapsed, while the angel, who had incense given him to offer it with the prayers of saints, did so, and took fire off the altar with his censer, and cast it on the earth: and while the seven angels had their trumpets given them, and they were preparing to sound."
2. "Others understand it of the amazement of the saints at the judgments of God, which were coming upon the Christian empire, and of their quiet and silent preparations for these troubles and combats, both within and without, they were to be exercised with."
3. "Rather this is to be understood of that peace and rest which the church enjoyed upon Constantine's having defeated all his enemies, when he brought the church into a state of profound tranquillity and ease; and this lasted but for a little while, which is here expressed by about, or almost half an hour."

### John Wesley:
1. "Such a silence is mentioned but in this one place. It was uncommon, and highly observable: for praise is sounding in heaven day and night."
2. "Hereby the seventh seal is very remarkably distinguished from the six preceding. This silence before God shows that those who were round about him were expecting, with the deepest reverence, the great things which the Divine Majesty would farther open and order."
3. "Silence is only a preparation: the grand point is, the sounding the trumpets to the praise of God."
