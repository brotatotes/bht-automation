# Revelation 8:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, a great star falls from heaven like a powerful torch, casting its light and impact upon the waters and celestial bodies. It symbolizes divine judgment, intervention, and the consequences of spiritual deception that can embitter and lead to spiritual death for those who deny the grace of God. This imagery reminds us to seek the guidance and illumination of God's truth in the midst of darkness and confusion, and to be like lamps shining brightly with the truth of His Word to a world in need of salvation.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "And the third angel blew his trumpet, and there fell from heaven a great star burning as a lamp, and it fell upon the third part of the rivers and upon the fountains of the waters." 
2. "And the name of the star is called Wormwood, and the third part of the waters became wormwood: and many of the men died from the waters, because they were embittered."
3. "And the fourth angel blew his trumpet: and the third part of the sun was struck and the third part of the moon and the third part of the stars, that the third part of them might be darkened, and the day might not shine during the third part of it, and the night in like manner."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The image of a lamp or torch is often used in the Bible to represent God's guidance and illumination. Just as a lamp provides light in the darkness, God's Word and wisdom can lead us out of spiritual darkness and into the path of righteousness."

2. "In this verse, the lamp can also symbolize the presence of God. Just as a lamp brings light and warmth, God's presence brings comfort and guidance in our lives. When we seek Him and His Word, we can find the light we need to navigate through the challenges and uncertainties of life."

3. "The lamp can also be seen as a metaphor for the truth and knowledge found in the Scriptures. Just as a lamp reveals what is hidden in the darkness, the Bible reveals God's truth and wisdom to us. It is through studying and meditating on His Word that we can gain a deeper understanding of His will and purpose for our lives."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "A star falling from heaven would be a natural symbol of one who had left a higher station, or of one whose character and course would be like a meteor shooting through the sky."
2. "In all languages, probably, a star has been an emblem of a prince whose virtues have shone brightly, and who has exerted a beneficial influence on mankind."
3. "This usage occurs because a meteor is so bright; because it appears so suddenly; because its course cannot be determined by any known laws; and because, in the apprehensions of people, it is either sent as a proof of the divine displeasure, or is adapted to excite consternation and alarm."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The use of the word 'lamp' or 'torch' in this verse symbolizes the light of God's truth and guidance in the midst of darkness and confusion."

2. "Just as a lamp or torch illuminates the way in the physical world, God's truth and guidance illuminate the path for believers in their spiritual journey."

3. "The image of a lamp or torch also suggests the idea of being a witness or a beacon of light, shining forth God's truth and love to a world in need."

4. "In a world filled with darkness and deception, believers are called to be like lamps, shining brightly with the truth of God's Word and pointing others to the way of salvation."
