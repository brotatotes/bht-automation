# Revelation 8:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Between the prayers of martyrs and the final judgments, a partial obscuration descends, extinguishing a portion of the world's rulers and teachers. The darkness spreads, leaving the world in gloom, but hints at the eventual return of light. The luminaries' darkening symbolizes great calamity, and as the sun, moon, and stars are affected, so too is the earth and its comfort. Part of the world suffers, as if immersed in darkness, while the church's order and beauty are defaced. Under the sun, ministers become corrupt, leading to a time of darkness before the final judgments.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "This partial obscuration, therefore, comes between the prayers of the martyrs under the fifth seal, and the last overwhelming judgments on the ungodly under the sixth seal, at the eve of Christ's coming."
2. "The night likewise withdrew a third part of the light which the bright Eastern moon and stars ordinarily afford."
3. "The third part of the sun, moon, and stars being darkened, implies that a portion of the world's rulers and teachers, civil and ecclesiastical, shall be extinguished."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The darkening of the heavenly luminaries is everywhere an emblem of any great calamity - as if the light of the sun, moon, and stars should be put out."
2. "The meaning is, that calamity would come as if darkness should spread over the sun, the moon, and the stars, leaving the world in gloom."
3. "Perhaps it is also intended by the symbol that there would be light again. The world was not to go into a state of total and permanent night. For a third part of the day, and a third part of the night, this darkness reigned; but does not this imply that there would be light again - that the obscurity would pass away, and that the sun, and moon, and stars would shine again?"

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Sun, moon, and stars are thought of only in their relation to earth and its life and comfort, so that when they are affected it also suffers."
2. "The objects judged are simply parts of the world in which men dwell."
3. "The whole series of the trumpets is more intense in judgment than that of the seals, but not to such a degree that the judgment of the fourth trumpet may not be lighter than that of the sixth seal."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The eclipse here is only partial and is kin to the ninth Egyptian plague (Exodus 10:21)."
2. "Purpose clause with ινα and the first aorist passive subjunctive of σκοτιζω, from σκοτος (darkness) as in Matthew 24:29, but σκοτοω in Revelation 9:2."
3. "Negative purpose clause with ινα μη and the first aorist active subjunctive of φαινω, to shed light upon, as in Revelation 18:23, not the second aorist passive subjunctive φανη with different accent."

### John Gill:
1. "When the doctrine concerning the person and offices of Christ, who is the sun and light of the world, was obscured by heresies."
2. "The discipline of the church, which, like the moon, has all its light, beauty, and order from Christ, was sadly defaced by the introduction of Jewish and Paganish rites and ceremonies."
3. "The ministers, the stars, were drawn by the tail of the dragon, and cast to the earth, became corrupt in their principles, and carnal and sensual in their lives."

### John Wesley:
1. "The stroke began long before Odoacer, namely, when the barbarians first conquered the capital city."
2. "They are so overwhelmed with calamities in those days of darkness, that they can no longer enjoy the light of heaven."
3. "The fourth trumpet transcends the three preceding trumpets, affecting not just a third part of the earth, sea, or rivers, but all who are under the sun."
