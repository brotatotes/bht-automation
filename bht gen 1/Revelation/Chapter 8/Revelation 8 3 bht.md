# Revelation 8:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this passage, we see the representation of Christ as the Mediator of the prayers of the saints, offering them up as incense that is pleasing to God. The angel is given the incense by Christ, symbolizing His meritorious obedience and death, which render the saints' prayers acceptable. The prayers of the saints, likened to incense, ascend alongside the abundant incense, signifying the multitude of prayers being offered. Through this angelic ministry, the prayers of the suffering church are united in calling on God, anticipating the approaching series of wonders and seeking His mercy.
