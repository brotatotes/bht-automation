# Revelation 8:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this passage, the vivid descriptions from the commentators bring to life a scene of destruction and judgment. The hailstones and fireballs fall in a shower of blood, reminiscent of the plagues in Egypt. The judgments unleashed affect natural objects and elements, punishing those who have abused them. The storm of hail, fire, and blood symbolizes the cruel and oppressive treatment of God's people throughout history, while also signifying the irruption of the Goths into the Roman empire. The trumpet blows, ushering in a time of fear, devastation, and the fulfilling of divine justice.

3. "And the third part of the earth was burnt up."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Pharaoh, who was visited by these plagues, was always to Israel the symbol of the cruel and oppressive treatment by the world of the children of God; while the judgments of the Almighty upon Egypt, vindicating His own glory and effecting the deliverance of His people, became types of the manner in which the same great ends shall be effected in every age of the Church’s history."
2. "It is more natural to think that these objects of terror simply denote judgment in general, and that they are to be interpreted neither of classes of judgments nor of individuals of a class."
3. "Neither does it seem as if any particular meaning were intended by the ‘third part’ mentioned. It was necessary to fix upon some fractional part in order to leave room for the heavier judgments that are yet to come."

### John Gill:
1. "Some have thought the Arian heresy is here intended, which may well enough agree with the time; and which may be compared to 'hail', for the mischief it did to the vines, the churches; and because of the violence with which it came, and the chillness of affection to Christ and his people, which it brought on professors of religion."
2. "This storm fell upon 'the earth'; the whole Roman empire; for even all the world was once said to be Arian, except one Athanasius; and particularly upon the carnal and earthly part of the church, who were seeking places and preferments under the Arian emperors."
3. "But rather this trumpet regards not the church, but the empire; and this storm of hail, fire, and blood, designs the irruption of the Goths into it, from the year 395, in which Theodosius died, to the year 408, under Radagaisus their general; with two hundred thousand of them, some say four hundred thousand, be entered and overrun all Italy, but was stopped and defeated by Stilicho."

### John Wesley:
1. "And here the trumpets begin. Even under Trajan, in the year 114, the Jews made an insurrection with a most dreadful fury; and in the parts about Cyrene, in Egypt, and in Cyprus, destroyed four hundred and sixty thousand persons." 
2. "But they were repressed by the victorious power of Trajan, and afterward slaughtered themselves in vast multitudes."
3. "The storm fell, the blood flowed, and the flames raged round Cyrene, and in Egypt, and Cyprus, before they reached Mesopotamia and Judea."
