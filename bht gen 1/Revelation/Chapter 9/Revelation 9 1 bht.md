# Revelation 9:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, a fallen star is seen as a connection to Satan's expulsion from heaven, representing both a physical and spiritual fall from grace. The star, symbolizing a potentate or power, holds the key to the bottomless pit, a place associated with hell. This abyss, depicted as a deep shaft, is like a well leading to the dwelling of Satan and his demons. It is a dark and hideous prison, distinct from the lake of fire.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The mention of a ‘star’ leads to the thought of a potentate or power; and, as what is said of it can hardly be separated from the statement of chap. Revelation 12:7-9, there is little doubt that the star represents Satan, there his expulsion from heaven, here his condition after he is expelled."
2. "The words used suggest also the important consideration that, in the view of the apostle, Satan was not originally evil.
