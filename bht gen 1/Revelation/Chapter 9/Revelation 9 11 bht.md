# Revelation 9:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this passage, we are introduced to a group of locusts who have a powerful king ruling over them, referred to as the "angel" or "false prophet Mahomet." This king, known as Abaddon or Apollyon, personifies destruction and is associated with the dark and gloomy depths of the abyss. He has the authority to command the locusts, tormenting and afflicting the ungodly. Notably, this king is distinct from Satan himself, emphasizing his role as a powerful force of devastation and ruin.

2. "The word 'angel' here would seem to refer to the chief of the evil angels, who presided over the dark and gloomy regions from whence the locusts seemed to emerge."
