2. "This was referred to by the first woe-trumpet."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The first woe is a warning of impending judgment and calamity. It serves as a wake-up call for those who have strayed from the path of righteousness and warns them of the consequences of their actions."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The first woe (η ουα η μια). Note feminine gender ascribed to the interjection ουα as in Revelation 11:14, perhaps because θλιψις is feminine, though we really do not know."
2. "Note also the ordinal use of μια (one) like πρωτη (first) as in Revelation 6:1; Mark 16:2."
3. "There come yet two Woes (ερχετα ετ δυο Ουα). Singular number ερχετα instead of ερχοντα, though δυο ουα. It is true that ουα is an interjection and indeclinable, but it is here used with δυο and is feminine just before, and not neuter."

### John Gill:
1. "One woe is past" - This phrase indicates that a significant event or judgment has already taken place. It suggests that there has been a period of distress or calamity, but it also implies that there is hope for relief or restoration.

2. "One of the three woe trumpets" - This phrase highlights the sequential nature of the judgments described in the vision. It suggests that there is a predetermined order to the events, and that each woe trumpet represents a distinct period of tribulation or hardship.

3. "Behold there come two woes more hereafter" - This statement emphasizes the impending nature of the remaining woes. It suggests that there is still more to come, and that the future holds additional challenges or trials. It serves as a reminder that the journey is not yet over and that there are still obstacles to be faced.
