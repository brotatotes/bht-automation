# Revelation 9:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, there is a river that is significant - it was the ancient foe of God's people and formed a natural defense for Israel against Assyria. This river, known as the great River, suddenly becomes the place where four angelic ministers of God's judgments are let loose. They assemble an army to bring devastation, particularly in Palestine. These angels were previously bound, restrained from proceeding further into the Roman Empire, but now they are allowed to carry out their purpose. It is unclear why they were bound or for how long.
