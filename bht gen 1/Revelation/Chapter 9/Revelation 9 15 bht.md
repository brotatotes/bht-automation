# Revelation 9:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, a time period is described with precise and specific timing. The appointed hour, day, month, and year have been fixed by God, and the angels, who had been prepared and kept ready, are finally released to carry out their mission. The timing of this event is significant, as it marks the culmination of a period of destruction and devastation brought upon the inhabitants of the earth. The progression in the reckoning of time reflects the gradual growth of the event, starting small but ultimately leading to a significant and profound impact on the world.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The Greek article (teen), put once only before all the periods, implies that the hour in the day, and the day in the month, and the month in the year, and the year itself, had been definitely fixed by God."
2. "The article would have been omitted had a sum-total of periods been specified, namely, three hundred ninety-one years and one month."
3. "The third part of men refers to the earthly men, the inhabitants of the earth, as distinguished from God's sealed people."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The loosening of the angels was, in fact, also a letting loose of all these hosts, that they might accomplish the work which they were commissioned to do."
2. "The word used here properly refers to what is made ready, suited up, arranged for anything... As used here, the word means 'that whatever was necessary to prepare these angels' - the leaders of this host - for the work which they were commissioned to perform, was now done, and that they stood in a state of readiness to execute the design."
3. "The meaning, however, rather seems to be that they were prepared, not for the commencement of such a period, but they were prepared for the whole period indicated by the hour, the day, the month, and the year; that is, that the continuance of this 'woe' would extend along through the whole period."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The angels are prepared unto the hour appointed by God." 
2. "This hour shall fall in its appointed day and month and year." 
3. "The four periods mentioned are not to be combined, but rather represent the precise timing of God's plan."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "They had not only been bound: they had been kept ready for an appointed moment." 
2. "The meaning is that the angels are prepared ‘unto the hour’ appointed by God, and that this hour shall fall in its appointed day and month and year." 
3. "The point chiefly to be noticed is the climax from a one-fourth part under the seals to a one-third part here."

### John Gill:
1. "The time being come, fixed by the decrees of God, making use of the Turks for the destruction of the eastern empire, the restraints of divine Providence were taken off from them, and they were suffered to pass the river Euphrates; they were let loose like so many furies, and in a little time overran and destroyed the whole empire." 

2. "They lay for a good while hovering over the banks of the river Euphrates, as if they were waiting for an order, or a commission to go over it: they were ready not only at a year's, a month's, a day's, but at an hour's warning, and all of them together; and as soon as ever they had the divine permission, they lost no time; they improved every opportunity, every year, every month, every day, every hour, to settle and enlarge their dominions to the ruin of others."

3. "An hour, which is the twenty fourth of a day or year, in the prophetic style, is fifteen days, and a day is a year, and a month is thirty years, and a year is three hundred sixty five years and a quarter, or ninety one days; in all, three hundred and ninety six years, and a hundred and six days; which is the precise time between A. D. 1057, when the Turkish empire begun, and A. D. 1453, in which year Constantinople was taken by the Turks, and an end put to the eastern Roman empire, signified by the third part of men."

### John Wesley:
1. "By loosing them, as well as by their strength and rage." 
2. "For the hour, and day, and month, and year — All this agrees with the slaughter which the Saracens made for a long time after Mahomet's death." 
3. "The gradation in reckoning the time, beginning with the hour and ending with a year, corresponds with their small beginning and vast increase."
