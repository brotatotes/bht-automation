# Revelation 9:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This verse describes a vast and immense army, with hosts that are not merely human but possibly infernal, constrained to work out God's will. The horsemen, who are likened to cavalry, are of immense and unparalleled numbers, possibly numbering in the hundreds of millions. The magnitude of this army is almost unimaginable, comparable to the size of the armies of the Turks and the incredulity of an emperor being challenged with a camel-load of wheat representing the countless fighting men.
