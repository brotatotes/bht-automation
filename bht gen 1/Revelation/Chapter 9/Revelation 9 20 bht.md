# Revelation 9:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the ungodly are compared to Pharaoh, stubbornly refusing to repent even in the face of plagues. Their persistent idolatry and refusal to abandon the works of their own hands are seen as a cover for the presence of lurking demons. Despite being spared from calamity, they remained unchanged in their creed and conduct, persisting in the worship of idols and unclean spirits. This idolatry is condemned as the worship of devils, even though the idols themselves are lifeless and powerless.
