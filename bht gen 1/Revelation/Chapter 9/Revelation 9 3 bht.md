# Revelation 9:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, a multitude of destructive locusts emerges from smoke, symbolizing a numerous and hostile people. These locusts are different from ordinary ones, as they specifically target and harm humans, not vegetation or trees. Among them are terrifying scorpions from the earth, known for their venomous sting and situated in dark, hidden places. This portrayal of formidable creatures causing distress and ruin aligns with various other biblical references and parallels historical events involving religious clergy and invading forces.
