# Revelation 9:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the judgment brought upon a specific group is seen as divine and restrained supernaturally. These locusts differ from others in their focus on troubling people rather than destroying vegetation. The verse refers to a class of individuals who do not have the seal of God on their foreheads, suggesting that they are the ones to be smitten by this plague. While not harming nature, they pose a threat to those who lack the protection of God. The description also highlights the escape of the "new Israel," exempt from this attack.
