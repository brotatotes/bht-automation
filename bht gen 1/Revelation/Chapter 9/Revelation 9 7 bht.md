# Revelation 9:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we are presented with a vivid description of otherworldly creatures that resemble horses prepared for battle. The outer shell of the locusts is likened to the armor of a warhorse, emphasizing their strength and readiness for combat. These supernatural locusts possess faces that bear a distant resemblance to human countenances, implying a sense of intelligence and capacity. With their striking appearance and resemblance to both horses and men, they evoke a sense of awe and fear, mirroring the conquering might and rapid spread of the Saracens in their wars and conquests.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:

2. "Their faces were as the faces of men...the face of the locust, which under ordinary circumstances has a distant resemblance to the human countenance, bore this resemblance even more notably in the case of these supernatural locusts."
3. "They had hair as the hair of women...perhaps we must regard the comparison as rather belonging to the supernatural portion of our description."
