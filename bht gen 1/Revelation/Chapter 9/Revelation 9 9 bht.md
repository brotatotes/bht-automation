### Marvin Vincent:

2. "The comparison with the insect as it exists in nature fails here, though Smith's 'Bible Dictionary' gives a picture of a species of locust, the Acridium Lineola, a species commonly sold for food in the markets of Bagdad, which has a sting in the tail." (Commentary on tails like unto scorpions)

3. "Originally any sharp point. A goad. See on pricks, Acts 26:14. Plato uses it of the peg of a top ('Republic,' 436). Herodotus of an instrument of torture." (Explanation of the term "stings" [κεντρα])

2. "their breastplates were not breastplates of righteousness, faith, and love, nor in defence of truth, but against it."
3. "The sound of locusts, when they fly or march in large companies, is very great... The sound of them is said to have been heard six miles... this may be expressive of the swift and rapid incursions of the Saracens, and of the dreadful alarms to the nations which their invasions made."
