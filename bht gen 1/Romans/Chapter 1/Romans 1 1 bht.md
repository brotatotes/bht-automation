## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "The word here rendered 'servant' means 'bond-servant,' or one subject to the will and wholly at the disposal of another."
2. "The apostles call themselves, in the same official sense, 'the servants of Christ,' expressing such absolute subjection and devotion to the Lord Jesus as they would never have yielded to a mere creature."
3. "He was called at one and the same time to the faith and the apostleship of Christ."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The word 'servant' here means 'bondman,' expressing the fact that Paul personally belonged to Jesus Christ, rather than the idea of service in His behalf. Any unpleasant thought connected with the former idea is removed by the character of the Master, Jesus Christ. This term of humility and dependence is the most honorable of all titles."

2. "His setting apart at Antioch was not the call, but a formal recognition of the call on the part of the Church there, and for a special mission. The title is an official one, and while it might at first refer to any messenger, in the early Church it was soon restricted to the Twelve and to Paul, as chosen witnesses of the resurrection, selected to lay the foundation of the Christian Church."

3. "Paul was selected from the world, singled out, consecrated to, and destined for the gospel service. In one sense this took place at his birth, but the reference here is probably to the call to be an Apostle, especially as the tense used is not the same as in Galatians, but points to a past act with a continuous result."

### John Gill:
1. "A servant of Jesus Christ"; not a servant of sin, nor of Satan, nor of man, nor of Moses and his law, nor of the traditions of the elders, but of Jesus Christ; and not by creation only, but by redemption, and by powerful efficacious grace in conversion.
2. "called to be an apostle: an apostle was one that was immediately sent by Christ, and had his authority and doctrine directly from him, and had a power of working miracles from him, in confirmation of the truth of his mission, authority, and doctrine."
3. "separated unto the Gospel of God. This may regard either God's eternal purpose concerning him, his preordination of him from eternity to be a preacher of the Gospel, to which he was separated from his mother's womb, Galatians 1:15; or the separation of him to that work made by the order of the Spirit of God, Acts 13:2."

### John Wesley:
1. "Called to be an apostle - And made an apostle by that calling. While God calls, he makes what he calls."
2. "As the Judaizing teachers disputed his claim to the apostolical office, it is with great propriety that he asserts it in the very entrance of an epistle wherein their principles are entirely overthrown."
3. "Separated - By God, not only from the bulk of other men, from other Jews, from other disciples, but even from other Christian teachers, to be a peculiar instrument of God in spreading the gospel."
