# Romans 1:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the apostle Paul expresses his desire to not only instruct and do good to the Romans, but also to receive comfort and encouragement from their mutual faith. He humbly associates himself with them and values their faith on equal terms. This contrasts with the hierarchical and self-centered nature of the modern Roman church. The verse highlights the interconnectedness between believers, the importance of mutual comfort and establishment, and the unity of faith among all faithful followers.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Not wishing to 'lord it over their faith,' but rather to be a 'helper of their joy,' the apostle corrects his former expressions: my desire is to instruct you and do you good, that is, for us to instruct and do one another good: in giving I shall also receive" [JOWETT].

2. "Nor is he insincere in so speaking, for there is none so poor in the Church of Christ who may not impart to us something of value: it is only our malignity and pride that hinder us from gathering such fruit from every quarter" [CALVIN].

3. "How 'widely different is the apostolic style from that of the court of Papal Rome!" [BENGEL].

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The A. V. and Rev. omit de however, thus losing an important shade of meaning."
2. "That is is not merely an explanatory repetition of the preceding phrase, but modifies the idea contained in it."
3. "It is a modest and delicate explanation, by which Paul guards himself against the possible appearance of underestimating the Christian standpoint of his readers."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "By this modifying explanation, subjoined with humility, and expressed in a delicate complimentary manner, Paul guards himself, in the presence of a church to which he was still a stranger, from the possible appearance of presumption and of forming too low an estimate of the Christian position of his readers." (Meyer)

2. "The full meaning is: that he might be comforted, i.e., encouraged and helped, as these ideas are included in the New Testament use of the word, at the same time when they were, namely, when by the fulfilment of his purpose, he should be 'among them.' The literal sense 'in you' is preferred by some as indicating that the comfort was found in them; but the next phrase designates the source of the comfort." 

3. "Each of us, etc. The translation we adopt is now generally accepted. ('Mutual faith' suggests the incorrect sense, that the faith they had was faith in each other.) This turn of the thought indicates that their faith is the same, that they can, therefore, help and comfort one another; the closing expression shows tact and modesty."

### John Gill:
1. "What makes for establishment, makes for comfort; and what makes for comfort, makes for establishment."
2. "When souls are established, ministers are comforted as well as they."
3. "The grace of faith is the same in all the saints, and so is the doctrine of it, as dispensed by Christ's faithful ministers, and experimentally received and embraced by his people."

These quotes emphasize the interconnectedness between comfort and establishment, the mutual benefit between ministers and their congregations, and the unifying power of faith.

### John Wesley:
1. "He not only associates the Romans with, but even prefers them before, himself."
2. "How different is this style of the apostle from that of the modern court of Rome!"
3. "I long to be comforted by the mutual faith both of you and me."
