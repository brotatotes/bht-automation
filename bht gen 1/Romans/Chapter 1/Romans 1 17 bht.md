# Romans 1:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this powerful verse, the Gospel is presented as the revelation of God's righteousness, which is unfolded through faith. It unveils the truth that salvation and life with God are found through the righteousness that comes from God Himself. This righteousness, both justifying and sanctifying, is offered to us as a free gift through Jesus Christ. It is a righteousness that surpasses human understanding and can only be received by faith. Those who believe in God's promises and trust in Him will find life and be declared righteous through their faith in Him.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The gospel is the power of God to salvation, because in it God’s righteousness is unfolded, and the more we believe, the more it is revealed."
2. "God justifies for Christ’s sake on condition of faith in Him as Mediator: the result of His justification is righteousness from faith."
3. "Righteousness by faith is not a new idea, but found in the prophets. All faith is one, in whatever word or act of God reposed."

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "For therein is the righteousness of God revealed—that is (as the whole argument of the Epistle shows), GOD'S JUSTIFYING RIGHTEOUSNESS." 
2. "The righteousness of God is in the gospel message, revealed (to be) from (or 'by') faith to (or 'for') faith," that is, "in order to be by faith received." 
3. "The just shall live by faith—This golden maxim of the Old Testament is thrice quoted in the New Testament—here Galatians 3:11; Hebrews 10:38—showing that the gospel way of 'LIFE BY FAITH,' so far from disturbing, only continued and developed the ancient method."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "There is not perhaps a more important passage in the Bible than this verse; or one more difficult to be understood."
2. "The righteousness of God...stands opposed to man’s plan of justification, that is, by his own works: God’s plan is by faith."
3. "The gospel states the fact that God has such a plan of justification; and shows the way or manner in which it might be done."
4. "The grand idea which is kept up [in the Epistle] is that people are justified by faith."
5. "The just shall live by faith...Those who rely on God the Saviour shall be justified, and saved."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "This statement contains the subject of the epistle: Righteousness is by faith."
2. "Righteousness is union with God in character. To the Greek mind of the legendary age such a conception is both strange and essentially impossible, since the Greek divinity is only the Greek man exaggerated in his virtues and vices alike."
3. "The righteousness which becomes his is that which God declares to be righteousness and ascribes to him."

### John Calvin:
1. "For if we seek salvation, that is, life with God, righteousness must be first sought, by which being reconciled to him, we may, through him being propitious to us, obtain that life which consists only in his favor."
2. "What some think, that there is here an implied comparison between the Old and New Testament, is more refined than well-founded; for Paul does not here compare the Fathers who lived under the law with us, but points out the daily progress that is made by every one of the faithful."
3. "Faith alone is that which secures the perpetuity of life; and whence is this, except that it leads us to God, and makes our life depend on him?"

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The word ‘righteous,’ so frequent in the Old Testament, is used of conformity to law, equivalent to holy, perfect. It is applied absolutely to God alone, and the entire family of similar terms has a religious significance." 
2. "In this verse ‘God’s righteousness,’ in itself, might mean: (1) a righteousness which belongs to God; (2) a righteousness which comes from God; (3) a righteousness which He approves. But the discussion in chaps. 3, 4, leaves no room for doubting that the correct meaning is (2), a righteousness of which God is the author, and that too His free gift, so that it is reckoned to the believer." 
3. "The present tense indicates continued action: it is being revealed, it is continuously proclaimed and made known. In the Old Testament it was promised and prepared for, but first made known fully in the gospel."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "A righteousness of God (δικαιοσυνη θεου). Subjective genitive, 'a God kind of righteousness,' one that each must have and can obtain in no other way save 'from faith unto faith' (εκ πιστεως εις πιστιν), faith the starting point and faith the goal." 
2. "It is a revelation from God, this God kind of righteousness, that man unaided could never have conceived or still less attained."
3. "By 'righteousness' we shall see that Paul means both 'justification' and 'sanctification.' It is important to get a clear idea of Paul's use of δικαιοσυνη here for it controls the thought throughout the Epistle."

### John Gill:
1. "By 'the righteousness of God', is not meant the essential righteousness of God, the rectitude of his nature, his righteousness in fulfilling his promises, and his punitive justice, which though revealed in the Gospel, yet not peculiar to it; nor the righteousness by which Christ himself is righteous, either as God, or as Mediator; but that righteousness which he wrought out by obeying the precepts, and bearing the penalty of the law in the room of his people, and by which they are justified in the sight of God." 

2. "This righteousness is not known by the light of nature, nor by the law of Moses; it was hid under the shadows of the ceremonial law, and is brought to light only by the Gospel; it is hid from every natural man, even from the most wise and prudent, and from God's elect themselves before conversion, and is only made known to believers, to whom it is revealed."

3. "The just shall live by faith: 'a just', or righteous man is, not everyone who thinks himself, or is thought by others to be so; nor are any so by their obedience to the law of works; but he is one that is made righteous by the righteousness of Christ imputed to him, which is before said to be revealed in the Gospel."

### John Wesley:
1. "The righteousness of God...includes both justice and mercy, and is eminently shown in condemning sin, and yet justifying the sinner."
2. "Sometimes it means that righteousness by which a man, through the gift of God, is made and is righteous; and that, both by receiving Christ through faith, and by a conformity to the essential righteousness of God."
3. "The just shall live by faith - Which was primarily spoken of those who preserved their lives, when the Chaldeans besieged Jerusalem, by believing the declarations of God, and acting according to them."
