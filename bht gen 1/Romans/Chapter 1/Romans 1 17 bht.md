# Romans 1:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the righteousness of God is revealed through His justifying righteousness, as explained by Jamieson Fausset Brown. The righteousness of God, as described by Philip Schaff, encompasses conformity to God's will and law, and is manifested in His dealings with His creatures. This righteousness, imputed through faith, brings the justified person into fellowship with Christ and leads to the indwelling of the Holy Spirit. John Wesley highlights that this righteousness is both shown in the condemnation of sin and the justification of the sinner, and is being revealed in the present time, as opposed to times of ignorance.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "For therein is the righteousness of God revealed—that is (as the whole argument of the Epistle shows), GOD'S JUSTIFYING RIGHTEOUSNESS."
2. "The righteousness of God is in the gospel message, revealed (to be) from (or 'by') faith to (or 'for') faith," that is, "in order to be by faith received."
3. "The just shall live by faith—This golden maxim of the Old Testament is thrice quoted in the New Testament—here Galatians 3:11; Hebrews 10:38 —showing that the gospel way of 'LIFE BY FAITH,' so far from disturbing, only continued and developed the ancient method."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "God's righteousness, when used of man, means conformity to the holy will and law of God, as the ultimate standard of right; when used of God, it expresses one of His attributes, essentially the same with His holiness and goodness, as manifested in His dealings with His creatures, especially with men."
2. "The righteousness imputed 'becomes righteousness inwrought.' This is necessarily the case: because when God accounts a man righteous, He is pledged to make him so; because faith which lays hold on this imputed righteousness brings the justified man into living fellowship with Jesus Christ, who gives him the Holy Spirit."
3. "The gospel makes known constantly that faith on Christ is the subjective cause of the righteousness from God, the condition of its imputation, the organ which appropriates it; and it further makes known that thus faith is produced; faith is the beginning and end, the vital principle is ever the same."

### John Wesley:
1. "The righteousness of God... is eminently shown in condemning sin, and yet justifying the sinner."
2. "Sometimes it means that righteousness by which a man, through the gift of God, is made and is righteous."
3. "Each, the apostle says, is revealed at the present time, in opposition to the times of ignorance."
