# Romans 1:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this powerful verse, the commentators emphasize the consequences of disregarding the voice of conscience and stifling the light of God. They describe how the wrath of God is not to be confused with punishment, but is instead an expression of divine displeasure and justice against sin and ungodliness. It is revealed through the law, through historical examples, and even recorded in Scripture. Ultimately, they highlight the universal need for salvation and the inadequacy of works to justify.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "The apostle, though he began this verse with a comprehensive proposition regarding men in general, takes up in the end of it only one of the two great divisions of mankind, to whom he meant to apply it; thus gently sliding into his argument."
2. "But before enumerating their actual iniquities, he goes back to the origin of them all, their stifling the light which still remained to them."
3. "As darkness overspreads the mind, so impotence takes possession of the heart, when the 'still small voice' of conscience is first disregarded, next thwarted, and then systematically deadened."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The wrath of God, so frequently spoken of, must not be confounded with its result, the punishment of sin; it is rather 'an affection of the personal God, having a necessary connection with His love." 
2. "The continuous revelation is indicated. It is not necessary to assume that such a revelation is exclusively supernatural, especially here where historical facts exemplify the made of the revelation." 
3. "God's wrath is against every form of irreligiousness and immorality; the two words distinguishing sin with respect to God and the law of right He has established."

### John Gill:
1. "By 'the wrath of God' is meant the displicency and indignation of God at sin and sinners; his punitive justice, and awful vengeance; the judgments which he executes in this world; and that everlasting displeasure of his, and wrath to come in another world, which all through sin are deserving of." 

2. "This wrath of God is revealed in the law, it is known by the light of nature, and to be perceived in the law of Moses, and may be observed in the Scriptures, where are many instances and examples of divine wrath and displeasure."

3. "The subject matter or object of it, against, or 'upon' which it is revealed, are all ungodliness, and unrighteousness of men; that is, all ungodly and unrighteous men; or all men who are guilty of ungodliness, the breach of the first table of the law, which respects the worship of God, and of unrighteousness, the breach of the second table of the law, which regards our neighbours' good."

### John Wesley:
1. "There is no other way of obtaining life and salvation."
2. "The law condemns all men, as being under sin. None therefore is justified by the works of the law."
3. "The wrath of God is revealed... against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men."
