# Romans 1:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we find a revelation of God's righteousness and wrath. The righteousness is necessary for humanity's salvation, as all men are condemned under the law. The wrath of God is not a blind rage but a just response to sin and ungodliness. It is revealed against all who practice ungodliness and unrighteousness, showing that there is no other way to obtain life and salvation. This passage emphasizes the need for divine truth and the consequences of resisting it.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The necessary condition of this revelation is the DESTRUCTION of the righteousness of MAN by the revelation of God’s anger against sin."
2. "ὀργὴ θεοῦ is anthropopathically, but with the deepest truth, put for the righteousness of God in punishment."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The apostle, though he began this verse with a comprehensive proposition regarding men in general, takes up in the end of it only one of the two great divisions of mankind, to whom he meant to apply it; thus gently sliding into his argument."
2. "But before enumerating their actual iniquities, he goes back to the origin of them all, their stifling the light which still remained to them."
3. "Thus 'the truth' which God left with and in men, instead of having free scope and developing itself, as it otherwise would, was obstructed."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The phrase 'divine displeasure' or 'indignation,' therefore, expresses the meaning of this phrase; see Matthew 3:7; Luke 3:7; Luke 21:23; John 3:36; Romans 2:5, Romans 2:8; Romans 3:5; Romans 4:15; Romans 5:9; Romans 9:22; Romans 12:19; Romans 13:4-5; Ephesians 2:3; Ephesians 5:6; 1Th 1:10; 1 Thessalonians 2:16, etc."
2. "The wrath of God is as really revealed against the neglect of God as it is against positive iniquity; and that this is an offence of so much consequence as to be placed 'first,' and as deserving the divine indignation more than the neglect of our duties toward people."
3. "People hold back or resist the truth of the gospel by their sins in the following ways: (1) People of influence and wealth employ both, in directly opposing the gospel. (2) People directly resist the doctrines of religion since they know they could not hold to those doctrines without abandoning their sins. (3) People who resolve to live in sin, of course, resist the gospel, and endeavor to prevent its influence."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "All men require this mode of justification, for all men are sinners, and therefore exposed to God's wrath."
2. "The wrath of God [οργη θεου]. Not punishment, but the personal emotion."
3. "The truth. Divine truth generally, as apparent in all God's self-revelations."

### John Calvin:
1. "Without the gospel, all men are condemned: by it alone there is salvation to be found."
2. "The whole world is deserving of eternal death. It hence follows that life is to be recovered in some other way, since we are all lost in ourselves."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The wrath of God, so frequently spoken of, must not be confounded with its result, the punishment of sin; it is rather ‘an affection of the personal God, having a necessary connection with His love." 
2. "The continuous revelation is indicated. It is not necessary to assume that such a revelation is exclusively supernatural, especially here where historical facts exemplify the made of the revelation."
3. "God’s wrath is against every form of irreligiousness and immorality; the two words distinguishing sin with respect to God and the law of right He has established."

1. "The wrath of God is revealed... It is the temper of God towards sin, not rage, but the wrath of reason and law." 

2. "The revelation of God's righteousness in the gospel was necessary because of the failure of men to attain it without it, for God's wrath justly rested upon all."

3. "Truth is out in the open, but wicked men, so to speak, put it in a box and sit on the lid and 'hold it down in unrighteousness.' Their evil deeds conceal the open truth of God from men."

### John Gill:
1. "By 'the wrath of God' is meant the displicency and indignation of God at sin and sinners; his punitive justice, and awful vengeance; the judgments which he executes in this world; and that everlasting displeasure of his, and wrath to come in another world, which all through sin are deserving of, some are appointed to, God's elect are delivered from, through Christ's sustaining it, in their room and stead, and which comes and abides on all impenitent and unbelieving persons."
2. "This wrath of God is revealed in the law, it is known by the light of nature, and to be perceived in the law of Moses, and may be observed in the Scriptures, where are many instances and examples of divine wrath and displeasure."
3. "The subject matter or object of it, against, or 'upon' which it is revealed, are all ungodliness, and unrighteousness of men; that is, all ungodly and unrighteous men; or all men who are guilty of ungodliness, the breach of the first table of the law, which respects the worship of God, and of unrighteousness, the breach of the second table of the law, which regards our neighbours' good."

### John Wesley:
1. "There is no other way of obtaining life and salvation."
