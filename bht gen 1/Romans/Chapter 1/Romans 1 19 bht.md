# Romans 1:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Humanity has been given the opportunity to observe and understand the truth about God through the world around them. This knowledge of God's existence and attributes is universal and accessible to all individuals. Despite limitations in our understanding, we have been provided with enough knowledge to recognize our accountability before God. By observing the beauty and intricacy of creation, we are called to acknowledge and glorify the Creator.
