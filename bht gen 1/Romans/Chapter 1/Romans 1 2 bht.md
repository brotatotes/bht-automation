# Romans 1:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In embracing Christ, the Gentile believers of the Roman Church did not forsake their Jewish heritage, but rather found a deeper understanding and fulfillment of the promises made in the holy scriptures through Moses and the prophets. By embracing Christ, they were not rejecting their past, but rather embracing a deeper understanding and fulfillment of the prophecies given by Moses and the prophets. The divine promises of the gospel, given through the prophets of God, are confirmed by their fulfillment throughout history, with Deuteronomy 18:18, Isaiah 9:6,7, 53:1, 61:1, and Jeremiah 23:5 providing evidence of this promise.
