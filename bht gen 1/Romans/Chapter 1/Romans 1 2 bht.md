# Romans 1:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Bible verse being described is a reminder that the gospel preached by Paul is not a new invention but is deeply rooted in the promises and prophecies of God. This good news, proclaimed by Christ and fulfilled in the Scriptures, was foretold by the prophets and anticipated since the beginning of the world. It is not a doctrine that disregards the Old Testament writings, but one that fulfills them, confirming the faithfulness of God's promises throughout history.
