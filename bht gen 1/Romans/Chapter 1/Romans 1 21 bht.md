# Romans 1:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This Bible verse describes those who had some knowledge of God but failed to glorify Him or show gratitude towards Him. Their understanding of God was flawed, leading them to worship false idols and hold empty and foolish beliefs about Him. Their refusal to honor God resulted in senseless thoughts and a darkening of their hearts.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Because that, when they knew God—that is, while still retaining some real knowledge of Him, and ere they sank down into the state next to be described."
2. "they glorified him not as God, neither were thankful—neither yielded the adoration due to Himself, nor rendered the gratitude which His beneficence demanded."
3. "in their imaginations—thoughts, notions, speculations, regarding God; compare Matthew 15:19; Luke 2:35; 1 Corinthians 3:20, Greek."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "What worship they rendered was not in accordance with the knowledge they had. 'Glorify' refers to praising God for what He is."
2. "The conceptions, ideas, and reflections, which they formed for themselves regarding the Deity, were wholly devoid of any intrinsic value corresponding with the truth."
3. "Not worshipping and thanking God, although they knew Him, they became vain in their reasonings; this made their heart senseless, and thus it was darkened, deprived of the truth which it might have had from the light of nature."

### John Gill:
1. "They neither thought nor spoke honourably of him; nor did they ascribe those perfections to him, which belonged to him."
2. "They did not adhere to him as the one and only God, nor honour him as the Creator of all things out of nothing, and as the sole Governor of the universe."
3. "The vanity of their minds was the spring and source of their evil conduct; which may design the wickedness of their hearts, and the imaginations thereof, which were evil, and that continually."

### John Wesley:
1. "Knowing God — For the wiser heathens did know that there was one supreme God; yet from low and base considerations they conformed to the idolatry of the vulgar."
2. "They did not glorify him as God, neither were thankful — They neither thanked him for his benefits, nor glorified him for his divine perfection."
3. "But became vain — Like the idols they worshipped.In their reasonings — Various, uncertain, foolish."
