# Romans 1:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, commentators describe a group of people who are without excuse for not giving glory to God as the great Creator. Despite having some knowledge of God, they turned away from Him, becoming ungrateful and foolish in their thoughts. Their hearts were darkened, leading them to engage in futile speculations and empty reasoning that led them further away from the truth. They neither honored God nor thanked Him for His divine perfection, resulting in a vain and misguided existence. This highlights the consequences of forsaking the truth of God and relying on their own futile understanding.
