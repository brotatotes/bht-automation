# Romans 1:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse describes the irony of those who claim to be wise, yet in their pursuit of self-proclaimed wisdom, become fools. The commentators emphasize the conceited arrogance of individuals, particularly the Greeks and the Gentiles, who not only boasted about their wisdom but also exhibited foolishness in their thoughts, actions, and idolatry. These individuals sought to exalt themselves above God and lacked true understanding or moral sense, resulting in a distorted view of deity and a departure from the knowledge of the true God.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Not, 'because they professed themselves wise,' but while they professed themselves wise professing themselves to be wise."
2. "The words relate perhaps not so much to the schools of philosophy, as to the assumption of wisdom by the Greeks in general."
3. "Of which assumption their philosophers were indeed eminent, but not the only examples."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Professing themselves wise, they became fools." - The commentary highlights how those who claim to be wise often end up being foolish. This quote emphasizes the irony of individuals boasting about their wisdom while being ignorant of the truth.

2. "It is the invariable property of error in morals and religion, that men take credit to themselves for it and extol it as wisdom." - This quote explains the tendency of people to take pride in their erroneous beliefs and consider them as wisdom. It sheds light on the deceptive nature of false knowledge.

3. "So the heathen." - This short phrase refers to the non-believers or pagans mentioned in 1 Corinthians 1:21. It implies that even those who do not follow the teachings of the Bible can fall into the trap of claiming false wisdom.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Professing themselves to be wise - This was the common boast of the philosophers of antiquity. The very word by which they chose to be called, 'philosophers,' means literally 'lovers of wisdom.'"
2. "They became fools - They became really foolish in their opinions and conduct. There is something particularly pungent and cutting in this remark, and as true as it is pungent."
3. "Sinners of all kinds are frequently spoken of as fools in the Scriptures. In the sense in which it is thus used, the word is applied to them as void of understanding or moral sense; as idolaters, and as wicked."

### John Calvin:
1. "The arrogance then which is condemned here is this — that men sought to be of themselves wise, and to draw God down to a level with their own low condition, when they ought humbly to have given him his own glory."
2. "For Paul holds this principle, that none, except through their own fault, are unacquainted with the worship due to God; as though he said, 'As they have proudly exalted themselves, they have become infatuated through the righteous judgment of God.'"
3. "The wiser they thought themselves, the more foolish they became."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Professing themselves to be wise." - This verse refers to the conceit of wisdom that underlies heathenism, not just the claims of individual philosophers. It highlights the arrogance of those who think they are wise without acknowledging the true source of wisdom.

2. "They became fools." - The folly of these individuals is evident in their idolatry. Heathenism is not the original religion, but a departure from the knowledge of the true God. Instead of recognizing and preserving the truth revealed in God's works, they choose self-wisdom, which ultimately leads to foolishness.

3. "Idolatry in its train." - The consequence of their self-proclaimed wisdom is the proliferation of idolatry. By rejecting the true God and relying on their own understanding, they fall into the trap of worshiping false gods. This commentary emphasizes the destructive path that follows when people abandon the knowledge of the true God.

3. "Paul shows indignant contempt for these grotesque efforts to present pictures of a deity that had been lost."

### John Gill:
1. "The learned men among the Gentiles first called themselves σοφοι, "Sophi", wise men: and afterwards, to cover their wretched pride and vanity, φιλοσοφοι, "Philosophers", lovers of wisdom."
2. "Notwithstanding all their arrogance, their large pretensions to wisdom, and boast of it, they became fools."
3. "They showed themselves to be such in those very things they prided themselves with the knowledge of."
