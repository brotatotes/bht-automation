# Romans 1:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, the commentators highlight the tragic downfall of humanity's worship. They describe how the glory of God, His power and majesty, was degraded and replaced by worship of idols, which were made in the likeness of corruptible man, animals, and even reptiles. This act of exchanging the true God for these lowly creatures represents a deep degradation of the living God and a departure from the true nature of worship. It is a solemn reminder of the consequences when humanity forsakes the glory of God for idols and dishonors His majesty.
