# Romans 1:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the commentators discuss the idolatry and degradation of human worship throughout history. They highlight the descent of man's religious belief from loftier conceptions of the Supreme Being to lower, more debasing forms. It is emphasized that the worship of images made in the likeness of corruptible man, animals, and reptiles marks a departure from the true God and embodies the absurdity of such idolatry. Ultimately, God's incorruptible and immovable nature contrasts with the changing and weakened glory ascribed to false gods.
