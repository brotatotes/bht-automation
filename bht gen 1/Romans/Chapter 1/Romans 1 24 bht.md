# Romans 1:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the commentator highlights the consequences of paganism, emphasizing the abandonment of individuals by God. It is described as a divine abandonment, where God ceases to restrain them, resulting in gross acts of depravity. Paganism leads to a state of immorality, with individuals dishonoring themselves and indulging in their sinful desires. It is a punishment for turning away from God and embracing wickedness, as God allows them to experience the consequences of their actions.

3. "He let them do what they pleased, even what was in the last degree vile, that those who had not honored God, might dishonor themselves."

### Albert Barnes:
