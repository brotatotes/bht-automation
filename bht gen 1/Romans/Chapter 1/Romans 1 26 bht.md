# Romans 1:26 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This verse describes a state of moral degradation and abandonment to sinful desires. The heathen Romans are described as being consumed by vices and engaging in unnatural and abominable acts. The women, in particular, are noted for losing their modesty and becoming shameless, leading the entire society to be corrupted. Even the highest authorities, such as the emperors, were not spared from this moral decay. The verse highlights the consequences of turning away from God and the resulting perversion of human nature.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "For even their women, that sex whose priceless jewel and fairest ornament is modesty, and which, when that is once lost, not only becomes more shameless than the other sex, but lives henceforth only to drag the other sex down to its level."
2. "But observe how vice is here seen consuming and exhausting itself. When the passions, scourged by violent and continued indulgence in natural vices, became impotent to yield the craved enjoyment, resort was had to artificial stimulants by the practice of unnatural and monstrous vices."
3. "No wonder that, thus sick and dying as was this poor humanity of ours under the highest earthly culture, its many-voiced cry for the balm in Gilead, and the Physician there, 'Come over and help us,' pierced the hearts of the missionaries of the Cross, and made them 'not ashamed of the Gospel of Christ!'"

### John Calvin:
1. "They not only abandoned themselves to beastly lusts, but became degraded beyond the beasts, since they reversed the whole order of nature."
2. "Paul here records those abominations which had been common in all ages, and were at that time especially prevalent everywhere."
3. "There were none who were not found polluted by some vice or another."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The uncleanness to which the heathen were given up took a special and aggravated form; as vile passions, lit., 'passions of dishonor.'"
2. "Those are truthfully described, and yet with modest reticence."
3. "Abundant evidence of such unnatural crime is found in heathen writers."

### John Wesley:
