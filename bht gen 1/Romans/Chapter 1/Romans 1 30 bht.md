## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

2. The active sense of the word "haters" agrees perhaps better with the context.
3. The majority of expositors adopt the active sense of the word "haters."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "To an awakened sinner there is often nothing more plain and painful than that he is a hater of God."
2. "Pride is well understood. It is an inordinate self-esteem; an unreasonable conceit of one’s superiority in talents, beauty, wealth, accomplishments, etc."
3. "This doubtless refers to their seeking to find out new arts or plans to practice evil; new devices to gratify their lusts and passions; new forms of luxury, and vice, etc."

### John Calvin:
1. "Those, then, are designated, who hate God, whose justice they seem to resist by doing wrong."
2. "Theὑβρισται are those who treat others petulantly, contumeliously, or insultingly."
3. "Theὑπερηφάνος is one who sets himself to view above others, the high and elevated, who exhibits himself as superior to others."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Leaving the word in its strict signification, hated of God, we recognize in it a summary judgment of moral indignation respecting all the preceding particulars; so that, looking back on these, it forms a resting-point in the disgraceful catalogue." (Meyer)
2. "If any crime was known more than another, as 'hated by the gods,' it was that of informers, abandoned persons who circumvented and ruined others by a system of malignant espionage and false information." (Alford)
3. "Apostasy from the piety and affection due to parents is a fountain of corruption." (Lange)

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Whisperers (ψιθυριστας). Old word from ψιθυριζω, to speak into the ear, to speak secretly, an onomatopoetic word like ψιθυρισμος (2 Corinthians 12:20) and only here in N.T." 
2. "Backbiters (καταλαλους). Found nowhere else except in Hermas, compound like καταλαλεω, to talk back (James 4:11), and καταλαλια, talking back (2 Corinthians 12:20), talkers back whether secretly or openly."
3. "Inventors of evil things (εφευρετας κακων). Inventors of new forms of vice as Nero was. Tacitus (Ann. IV. ii) describes Sejanus as facinorum omnium repertor and Virgil (Aen. ii. 163) scelerum inventor."

### John Gill:
1. "Backbiters, who more publicly defamed the characters of their neighbors, and hurt their good name, credit, and reputation, though behind their backs."

### John Wesley:
1. "Whisperers — Such as secretly defame others."
2. "Backbiters — Such as speak against others behind their back."
3. "Inventors of evil things — Of new pleasures, new ways of gain, new arts of hurting, particularly in war."
