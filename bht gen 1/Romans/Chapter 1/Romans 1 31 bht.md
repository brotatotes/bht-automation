## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Gave them over—or 'up' (see on :-)." 
2. "To do those things which are not convenient—in the old sense of that word, that is, 'not becoming,' 'indecorous,' 'shameful.'"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Without natural affections - This expression denotes the lack of affectionate regard toward their children. The attachment of parents to children is one of the strongest in nature, and nothing can overcome it but the most confirmed and established wickedness."
2. "Implacable - This word properly denotes those who will not be reconciled where there is a quarrel; or who pursue the offender with unyielding revenge. It denotes an unforgiving temper; and was doubtless common among the ancients, as it is among all pagan people."
3. "Unmerciful - Destitute of compassion. As a proof of this, we may remark that no provisions for the poor or the infirm were made among the pagan. The sick and the infirm were cast out, and doomed to depend on the stinted charity of individuals."

### John Calvin:
1. "Without the feelings of humanity are they who have put off the first affections of nature towards their own relations." 
2. "As he mentions the want of mercy as an evidence of human nature being depraved..."
3. "...mercy is a Christian virtue."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Without understanding; the same word as ‘senseless’ (E. V. ‘foolish’), Romans 1:21." 
2. "Covenant breakers. In the original there is another play upon the sound of the words." 
3. "Unmerciful. This concludes the list, marking the absence of the least principle of moral action."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Covenant-breakers (ασυνθετους). Another paronomasia or pun. Α privative and verbal συνθετος from συντιθημ, to put together. Old word, common in LXX (Jeremiah 3:7), men 'false to their engagements' (Sanday and Headlam), who treat covenants as 'a scrap of paper.'" 

2. "Without natural affection (αστοργους). Late word, α privative and στοργη, love of kindred. In N.T. only here and 2 Timothy 3:3."

3. "Unmerciful (ανελεημονας). From α privative and ελεημων, merciful. Late word, only here in N.T. Some MSS. add ασπονδους, implacable, from 2 Timothy 3:3. It is a terrible picture of the effects of sin on the lives of men and women."

### John Gill:
1. "Without understanding... being given up to a reprobate mind" - This highlights the consequence of lacking knowledge and understanding of God and His ways, leading to a corrupted mindset and moral decay.

2. "Covenant breakers; had no regard to private or public contracts" - It emphasizes the disregard for commitments and promises, both in personal relationships and societal obligations.

3. "Without natural affection...implacable; unmerciful" - These phrases depict a lack of empathy, compassion, and forgiveness towards family, friends, and those in need, revealing a heart hardened and devoid of basic human kindness.

### John Wesley:
1. "The Romans, as a nation, from the very beginning of their commonwealth, never made any scruple of vacating altogether the most solemn engagement, if they did not like it, though made by their supreme magistrate, in the name of the whole people."
2. "The custom of exposing their own new-born children to perish by cold, hunger, or wild beasts, which so generally prevailed in the heathen world, particularly among the Greeks and Romans, was an amazing instance of this."
3. "The killing of aged and helpless parents, now common among the American heathens, is also an example of lacking natural affection."
