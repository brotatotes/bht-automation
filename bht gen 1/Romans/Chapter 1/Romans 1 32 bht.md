# Romans 1:32 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Bible verse being described paints a vivid picture of the moral state of the heathen world, illustrating the abandonment to sin and the knowledge of God's judgment against it. The verse highlights the tragic reality of individuals not only committing sinful acts themselves, but also finding pleasure in the sins of others, thus incurring guilt upon themselves. It conveys the insufficiency of relying solely on human understanding and the desperate need for divine revelation. Ultimately, it serves as a stark reminder of the impossibility of achieving righteousness through one's own works.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The Apostle advances to the highest grade of moral abandonment, the knowledge of God’s sentence against such crimes, united with the contented practice of them, and encouragement of them in others."
2. "The sentence of God, unmistakeably pronounced in the conscience."
3. "The description here given by the Apostle of the moral state of the heathen world should by all means be compared with that in Thucyd. iii. 82-84, of the moral state of Greece in the Peloponnesian war."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The wrath of God" against sin has all the dread reality of a "revelation from heaven" sounding in the consciences of men, in the self-inflicted miseries of the wicked, and in the vengeance which God's moral government, sooner or later, takes upon all who outrage it.
2. We must not magnify the supernatural revelation which God has been pleased to make of Himself, through Abraham's family to the human race, at the expense of that older, and, in itself, lustrous revelation which He has made to the whole family of man through the medium of their own nature and the creation around them.
3. Wilful resistance of light has a retributive tendency to blunt the moral perceptions and weaken the capacity to apprehend and approve of truth and goodness.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The charges which the apostle makes here were evidently those which were well known. He does not even appeal to their writings, as he does on some other occasions, for proof; compare Titus 1:12. So well known were they, that there was no need of proof."
2. "If this was the state of things, then it was clear that there was need of another plan of saving people."

1. "Men left nothing undone for the purpose of giving unbridled liberty to their sinful propensities."

3. "It is the summit of all evils when the sinner is so void of shame, that he is pleased with his own vices, and will not bear them to be reproved, and also cherishes them in others by his consent and approbation."

1. "The Jews have a saying that no man is suspected of a thing but he has done it; and if he has not done the whole of it, he has done part of it, and if he has not done part of it, he has thought in his heart to do it, and if he has not thought in his heart to do it, he has seen others do it, and has rejoiced." This quote highlights the wickedness of those who not only commit sin themselves but also take pleasure in the sins of others.
