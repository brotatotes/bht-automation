# Romans 1:32 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse under consideration describes the profound consequences of sin and the justice of God's wrath. Through self-inflicted miseries and the vengeance of God's moral government, the reality of divine judgment is felt. It also highlights the responsibility of humanity to recognize and respond to the revelation of God in both supernatural means and the natural order. Willful ignorance and resistance to the truth result in a dulled conscience and an inability to discern goodness. Ultimately, those who delight in wickedness shoulder the weight of their own guilt and contribute to the perpetuation of evil.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "The wrath of God" against sin has all the dread reality of a "revelation from heaven" sounding in the consciences of men, in the self-inflicted miseries of the wicked, and in the vengeance which God's moral government, sooner or later, takes upon all who outrage it.
2. We must not magnify the supernatural revelation which God has been pleased to make of Himself, through Abraham's family to the human race, at the expense of that older, and, in itself, lustrous revelation which He has made to the whole family of man through the medium of their own nature and the creation around them.
3. Wilful resistance of light has a retributive tendency to blunt the moral perceptions and weaken the capacity to apprehend and approve of truth and goodness.

### Philip Schaff:

2. "Their conscience gave such knowledge." 
3. "The climax of the punishment of sin by sin suggests one feature of the eternal death threatened in the Bible."

### Archibald T Robertson:

2. "The ordinance of God."

### John Wesley:
