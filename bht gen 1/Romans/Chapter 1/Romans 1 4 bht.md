# Romans 1:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, it is revealed that the Son of God was not made but rather declared and manifested through His birth in the flesh. Through His resurrection from the dead, His divine sonship and deity were made evident, demonstrating His power and the possession of that power as the Son of God. This resurrection, which is both the source and focus of our faith, powerfully declares His identity and confirms His divine nature.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "He 'was MADE [says the apostle] of the seed of David, according to the flesh' (Romans 1:3); but He was not made, He was only 'declared [or proved] to BE the Son of God.'"
2. "By His birth in the flesh, that Sonship, which was essential and uncreated, merely effloresced into palpable manifestation."
3. "Declared to be the Son of God in possession of that 'power' which belonged to Him as the only-begotten of the Father, no longer shrouded as in the days of His flesh, but 'by His resurrection from the dead' gloriously displayed and henceforth to be forever exerted in this nature of ours."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The two allowable meanings are: (1) instated or installed; (2) declared, manifested, etc. They differ in this respect that (1) points to what God did, and (2) to the human recognition or proof of the Sonship of Christ."
2. "In neither case is there any suggestion that Christ became the Son of God in consequence of the resurrection, although the human nature of Christ was then exalted, and made partaker of the glory which eternally belonged to the Son."
3. "This should be connected with 'declared'; it thus sets forth the in-stating by the resurrection as an exhibition of the divine power."
4. "According to the Spirit of holiness. This is evidently in contrast with 'according to the flesh,' and must set forth that side of the person of Christ wherein He differs absolutely from those who are only human."
5. "Jesus Christ our Lord. 'Having given this description of the person and dignity of the Son of God, very man and very God, he now identifies this divine person with Jesus Christ, the Lord and Master of Christians, the historical object of their faith.'"

### John Gill:
1. "He, the Son of God, who existed as such, from everlasting, was manifested in the flesh, or human nature."
2. "His divine sonship, and proper deity, are declared and made evident with his power."
3. "The power of Christ in raising the dead...declared him to be, or clearly made it appear that he was the Son of God, a divine person, truly and properly God."

### John Wesley:
1. "Powerfully declared to be the Son of God, according to the Spirit of Holiness." 
2. "According to his divine nature."
3. "The resurrection from the dead is both the fountain and the object of our faith."
