## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The Apostle, dwelling here on patent facts, the announcements of prophecy, the history of the Lord’s Humanity, does not deal with the essential subsistent Godhead of Christ, but with that manifestation of it which the great fact of the Resurrection had made to men."
2. "Thus the objective words ποιεῖν (Act 2:36), γεννᾷν (Act 13:33) are used of the same proof or manifestation of Christ’s Sonship by His Resurrection."
3. "And this Spirit is designated by the gen. of quality, ἁγιωσύνης, to shew that it is not a human, but a divine Spirit which is attributed here to Christ, a Spirit to which holiness belongs as its essence."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "He 'was MADE [says the apostle] of the seed of David, according to the flesh'; but He was not made, He was only 'declared [or proved] to BE the Son of God.'"
2. "By His birth in the flesh, that Sonship, which was essential and uncreated, merely effloresced into palpable manifestation."
3. "Declared to be the Son of God in possession of that 'power' which belonged to Him as the only-begotten of the Father, no longer shrouded as in the days of His flesh, but 'by His resurrection from the dead' gloriously displayed and henceforth to be forever exerted in this nature of ours."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The act of raising him from the dead designated him, or constituted him the Son of God. It was such an act as in the circumstances of the case showed that he was the Son of God in regard to a nature which was not 'according to the flesh.'"
2. "The phrase 'Son of God' stands in contrast with the title 'Son of man,' and as the natural and obvious import of that is that he was a man, so the natural and obvious import of the title 'Son of God' is that he was divine; or that he sustained relations to God designated by the name Son of God, corresponding to the relations which he sustained to man designated by the name Son of Man."
3. "The expression 'Son of God' is applied to him no less than 27 times in the Gospels and the Acts of the Apostles, and 15 times in the Epistles and the Revelation."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The idea is that of Christ's instatement or establishment in the rank and dignity of His divine sonship with a view to the conviction of men."
2. "This was required by His previous humiliation, and was accomplished by His resurrection, which not only manifested or demonstrated what He was, but wrought a real transformation in His mode of being."
3. "He was declared or instated mightily; in a striking, triumphant manner, through His resurrection."

### John Calvin:
1. "Christ was declared the Son of God by openly exercising a real celestial power, that is, the power of the Spirit, when he rose from the dead." 
2. "The Spirit, as far as it sanctifies, confirms and ratifies that evidence of its power which it once exhibited." 
3. "A divine power is said to have shone forth in the resurrection of Christ for this reason — because he rose by his own power, as he had often testified."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The two allowable meanings are: (1) instated or installed; (2) declared, manifested, etc. They differ in this respect that (1) points to what God did, and (2) to the human recognition or proof of the Sonship of Christ." 
2. "In neither case is there any suggestion that Christ became the Son of God in consequence of the resurrection, although the human nature of Christ was then exalted, and made partaker of the glory which eternally belonged to the Son."
3. "This should be connected with 'declared'; it thus sets forth the in-stating by the resurrection as an exhibition of the divine power."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "The Resurrection of Christ is the miracle of miracles. 'The resurrection only declared him to be what he truly was' (Denney)."
2. "Not the Holy Spirit, but a description of Christ ethically as κατα σαρκα describes him physically (Denney)."
3. "These words gather up the total personality of Jesus (his deity and his humanity)."

However, the selected quotes highlight the significance of the Resurrection in declaring Jesus as the Son of God, the ethical description of Christ, and the comprehensive nature of Jesus as both divine and human.

### John Gill:
1. "Not made as he is said to be before, when his incarnation is spoken of; nor did he begin to be the Son of God, when he was made of the seed of David, but he, the Son of God, who existed as such, from everlasting, was manifested in the flesh, or human nature."
2. "This his divine sonship, and proper deity, are declared and made evident, with, or 'by' [his] power; which has appeared in the creation of all things out of nothing; in upholding all things in their beings; in the government of the world, and works of Providence; in the miracles he wrought; in his performing the great work of redemption."
3. "And this was done according to the Spirit of holiness; which may be understood of the Holy Spirit, the third person in the Trinity, who is holy in himself, and the author of holiness in the saints; and who is the declarer of Christ's sonship, partly by bearing a testimony to it in the word, and in the hearts of believers, and chiefly by being concerned in the resurrection of the body of Christ from the dead."
