## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The whole to χριστοῦ should be taken together: among whom ye also are called of Jesus Christ; otherwise, with a comma at ὑμεῖς, the assertion, ‘among whom are ye,’ is flat and unmeaning."
2. "De Wette and Calvin would take Ἰησοῦ χρ. as a gen. of possession, because the call of believers is generally referred to the FATHER: but sometimes the SON is said to call likewise, see John 5:25; 1 Timothy 1:12."
3. "With ἀγαπητοὶ θεοῦ following so close upon it, the expression can I think hardly be taken otherwise than as called by Jesus Christ."

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "The apostle ascribes nothing special to the Church of Rome."
2. "The called ones of Christ Jesus."
3. "One hardly knows which to prefer."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "This proves that the church at Rome was made up partly at least, if not mainly, of Gentiles or pagans."
2. "The word 'called' denotes not merely an external invitation to privilege, but it also denotes the 'internal' or 'effectual' call which secures conformity to the will of him who calls."

3. "Not called as I am called" - This phrase recognizes the distinction between the writer and the readers. It implies that the writer has a different calling or purpose, emphasizing the diversity within the group and reminding the readers that they have their own unique calling to fulfill.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "To prepare for the address he says that his mission for the glory of Christ’s name is to them also; they are included among those for whom he received his apostleship."
2. "They were not called by Jesus Christ but called to tie His, since the call of believers is always referred to God."

1. "Called to be Jesus Christ's" - This phrase emphasizes the divine calling and ownership of believers by Jesus Christ. It highlights the intimate relationship between Christ and his followers, indicating that they belong to him and are chosen for a specific purpose.

2. "Predicate genitive after κλητο" - This grammatical explanation clarifies that the phrase "Jesus Christ's" functions as the object of the verb "called." It helps to understand the syntactical structure of the sentence and the specific role of the genitive case in expressing possession.
