## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Both these clauses refer to all the Christians addressed: not (as Bengel) the first to Jewish, the second to Gentile believers."
2. "No such distinction would be in place in an exordium which anticipates the result of the Epistle that Jew and Gentile are one in guilt, and one in Christ."
3. "God is the Giver of Grace and Peace, Christ the Imparter."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Beloved of God" - This phrase emphasizes the special love and favor that God has for believers, comparing it to the love shown to the tribe of Benjamin in Deuteronomy 33:12. 

2. "Grace, c." - This refers to the undeserved favor and blessings that believers receive from God, as explained in Colossians 3:12. 

3. "Peace...from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ" - This peace is not just a mere absence of conflict, but a deep inner peace that comes from the reconciling work of Christ on the cross. It is a peace that surpasses human understanding and is derived from both God the Father and Jesus Christ.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The word 'saints,' ἅγιοι hagioi, means those who are holy, or those who are devoted or consecrated to God. The radical idea of the word is what is separated from a common to a sacred use, and answers to the Hebrew word, קדושׁ qadowsh. It is applied to any thing that is set apart to the service of God, to the temple, to the sacrifices, to the utensils about the temple, to the garments, etc. of the priests, and to the priests themselves. It was applied to the Jews as a people separated from other nations, and devoted or consecrated to God, while other nations were devoted to the service of idols. It is also applied to Christians, as being a people devoted or set apart to the service of God."
2. "Grace - This word properly means 'favor.' It is very often used in the New Testament, and is employed in the sense of benignity or benevolence; felicity, or a prosperous state of affairs; the Christian religion, as the highest expression of the benevolence or favor of God; the happiness which Christianity confers on its friends in this and the future life; the apostolic office; charity, or alms; thanksgiving; joy, or pleasure; and the benefits produced on the Christian’s heart and life by religion - the grace of meekness, patience, charity, etc."
3. "Peace is the state of freedom from war. As war conveys the idea of discord and numberless calamities and dangers, so peace is the opposite, and conveys the idea of concord, safety, and prosperity. Thus, to wish one peace was the same as to wish him all safety and prosperity. But the word 'peace' is also used in contrast with that state of agitation and conflict which a sinner has with his conscience and with God. The sinner is like the troubled sea, which cannot rest. The Christian is at peace with God through the Lord Jesus Christ."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The theory that the Ephesian Epistle was encyclical, or addressed to a circle of churches, and not merely to the church at Ephesus, has been very widely received."
2. "The term 'saints' is applied to Christians in three senses in the New Testament: as members of a visible and local community, as members of a spiritual community, and as individually holy."
3. "It is asserted that they are what they are called."

### John Calvin:
1. "Paul does by no means ascribe the praise of our salvation to ourselves, but derives it altogether from the fountain of God’s free and paternal love towards us."
2. "We also learn from this passage that none rightly connect themselves with the number of the faithful, except they feel assured that the Lord is gracious, however unworthy and wretched sinners they may be, and except they be stimulated by his goodness and aspire to holiness."
3. "Nothing is more desirable than to have God propitious to us, and this is signified by grace; and then to have prosperity and success in all things flowing from him, and this is intimated by peace."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The Christians at Rome, of whatever nationality, are viewed as one community, though not addressed as a ‘church.’"
2. "'Saints' refers first of all to consecration to God, and then as a consequence to holiness."
3. "The greeting seems to be an earnest wish or prayer, rather than an authoritative benediction."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The evidence is late and slight and by no means shows that this was the case in the first century."
2. "Ablative case of θεου after the verbal adjective like διδακτο θεου (taught of God) in John 6:45."
3. "Paul's theology is clearly seen in the terms used in verses Romans 1:1-7."

### John Gill:
1. "The inscription of it is not to the Roman emperor; nor to the Roman senate, nor to all the inhabitants in Rome; but to all the saints there, whether rich or poor, bond or free, male or female, Jew or Gentile, without any distinction, being all one in Christ Jesus."
2. "These are described as beloved of God; not for any loveliness there was in them, nor because of any love in them to God, nor on account of their obedience and righteousness; but through the free favour and sovereign will and pleasure of God."
3. "By 'grace' is not meant ministerial gifts, which are not common to all the saints; nor the Gospel, which was at Rome already; nor the love and favour of God, which these persons were sharers in, as appears from their above characters; nor the principle of grace, which was now formed there in their effectual calling; but an increase of grace, as to its degrees, acts, and exercise."

### John Wesley:
1. "Beloved of God — And from his free love, not from any merit of yours, called by his word and his Spirit to believe in him, and now through faith holy as he is holy."
2. "Grace — The peculiar favour of God."
3. "It is one and the same peace, and one and the same grace, which is from God and from Jesus Christ. Our trust and prayer fix on God, as he is the Father of Christ; and on Christ, as he presents us to the Father."
