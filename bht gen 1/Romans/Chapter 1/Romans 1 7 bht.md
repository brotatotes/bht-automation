2. "Grace and peace" - These words signify the blessings that come from Christ's sacrifice on the cross. The grace of God and the peace that surpasses understanding are bestowed upon believers, bringing them into harmony with God and filling their hearts with tranquility.

3. "From God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ" - This phrase underscores the divinity of Christ and His role as the source of divine influence.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The Christians at Rome, of whatever nationality, are viewed as one community, though not addressed as a 'church.'"
2. "'Saints' refers first of all to consecration to God, and then as a consequence to holiness. This must always be borne in mind."
3. "The word translated 'grace' is akin to the common Greek salutation, while 'peace' is the Hebrew salutation. The two, as here lifted up into Christian usage, are related to each other as cause and effect: the one is God's feeling toward us; the other the result in us."

### John Gill:
1. "The inscription of it is not to the Roman emperor; nor to the Roman senate, nor to all the inhabitants in Rome; but to all the saints there, whether rich or poor, bond or free, male or female, Jew or Gentile, without any distinction, being all one in Christ Jesus."
2. "These are described as beloved of God; not for any loveliness there was in them, nor because of any love in them to God, nor on account of their obedience and righteousness; but through the free favour and sovereign will and pleasure of God."
3. "By 'grace' is not meant ministerial gifts, which are not common to all the saints; nor the Gospel, which was at Rome already; nor the love and favour of God, which these persons were sharers in, as appears from their above characters; nor the principle of grace, which was now formed there in their effectual calling; but an increase of grace, as to its degrees, acts, and exercise; every grace is imperfect in this respect, and those who have the most stand in need of more."

### John Wesley:
1. "Beloved of God — And from his free love, not from any merit of yours, called by his word and his Spirit to believe in him, and now through faith holy as he is holy."
2. "Grace — The peculiar favour of God."
3. "It is one and the same peace, and one and the same grace, which is from God and from Jesus Christ. Our trust and prayer fix on God, as he is the Father of Christ; and on Christ, as he presents us to the Father."
