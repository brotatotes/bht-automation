## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:

### John Gill:
1. "These words are an appeal to God, and carry in them the nature and form of an oath; the reason of the apostle's using it was, because he was personally unknown to the Romans, and they to him, and so might doubt of his affectionate regard unto them; and therefore for the confirmation thereof he uses it."

2. "He describes him as the God 'whom [he] served', to distinguish him from all false gods, and to show that he that takes an oath, should be one that fears and serves the Lord; what he served him in was not the law, but the Gospel of his Son; Jesus Christ, who is the author, minister, and subject matter of it."

3. "The manner in which he served him was, as he says, with my Spirit; either with the Spirit of God, which was given to him; or in a spiritual manner, in opposition to the carnal worship of the Jews; internally, in opposition to bodily exercise only, and voluntarily, with his whole heart, soul, and spirit."

### John Wesley:
1. "God, whom I serve - As an apostle."
2. "In my spirit - Not only with my body, but with my inmost soul."
3. "In the gospel - By preaching it."
