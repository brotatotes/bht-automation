## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "There could be no other witness to his practice in his secret prayers, but God: and as the assertion of a habit of incessantly praying for the Roman Christians, whom he had never seen, might seem to savour of an exaggerated expression of affection, he solemnly appeals to this only possible testimony."
2. "The serving God in his spirit was a guarantee that his profession was sincere, and that the oath just taken was no mere form, but a solemn and earnest appeal of his spirit."
3. "His peculiar method of λατρεία was concerned with the gospel of the Son of God."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The word denotes religious service."
2. "From my inmost soul."
3. "Paul's whole religious life and official activity were consecrated."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "A deep interest shown in this way was well suited to prepare them to receive what he had to say to them."
2. "He was really and sincerely devoted to the service of God."
3. "If with the same intensity of prayer all Christians, and Christian ministers, would remember the churches, what a different aspect would the Christian church soon assume!"

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The word [λατρευω] was used in a special sense to denote the service rendered to Jehovah by the Israelites as His peculiar people."
2. "Paul here appropriates the Jewish word for the spiritual Christian service."
3. "As in his Philippian letter, Paul here appropriates the Jewish word for the spiritual Christian service."

### John Calvin:
1. "He proves his love by its effects; for had he not greatly loved them, he would not have so anxiously commended them to the Lord, and especially he would not have so ardently desired to promote their welfare by his own labors."
2. "He did not notwithstanding transgress the prohibition of Christ. It hence appears that it was not Christ’s design (as the superstitious Anabaptists dream) to abolish oaths altogether, but on the contrary to call attention to the due observance of the law."
3. "He at the same time intimates how frequently, or rather, how unceasingly he was engaged in such prayers, since he says that he prayed continually."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "God is my witness. Such appeals to God are not uncommon in Paul’s writings. God only could know what his habit in secret prayer was. The fact was important, since he had labored so widely and yet not visited them. This might seem like ignorance or forgetfulness of them."
2. "He renders true service, not in the temple, but in his ‘spirit.’ ‘Spirit’ is the highest part of man’s nature, and in passages like this the reference is to the human spirit, not in contrast with soul or body, but as the sphere of the working of the Holy Spirit."
3. "Paul served God by telling the good tidings of the Son of God, Jesus Christ our Lord."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "I serve (λατρευω). Old verb from λατρον, hire, and λατρις, hireling, so to serve for hire, then to serve in general gods or men, whether sacred services (Hebrews 9:9; Hebrews 10:2) or spiritual service as here." 

2. "Unceasingly (αδιαλειπτως). Late adverb for which see 1 Thessalonians 1:2; 1 Thessalonians 2:13; 1 Thessalonians 5:17, only other N.T. examples."

3. "Always (παντοτε). One might think that Paul prayed for no others, but he uses both adverbs in 1 Thessalonians 1:2. He seems to have had prayer lists. He never omitted the Romans."

### John Gill:
1. "These words are an appeal to God, and carry in them the nature and form of an oath."
2. "He describes him as the God 'whom [he] served', to distinguish him from all false gods."
3. "The manner in which he served him was, as he says, with my Spirit; either with the Spirit of God, which was given to him; or in a spiritual manner."
