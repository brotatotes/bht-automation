## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "In this preaching of the Gospel some have been found obedient, others disobedient: and this was before announced by Isaiah." 
2. "The persons here meant are as yet kept indefinite, but evidently the Apostle has in his mind the unbelieving Jews, about whom his main discourse is employed." 
3. "But not all hearkened to the glad tidings...for Esaias saith, Lord, who believed the hearing of us?"

2. "Where shall one find a believer?"
3. "The apostle softens this into 'They have not all believed.'"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It must be admitted that all have not obeyed the gospel. So far as the objection of the Jew arises from that fact, and so far as that fact can bear on the case, it is to be conceded that all have not yielded obedience to the gospel."
2. "Isaiah complains that his declarations respecting the Messiah had been rejected by his countrymen. The form of expression, 'Who hath believed?' is a mode of saying emphatically that few or none had done it."
3. "The force of this verse, perhaps, may be best seen by including it in a parenthesis, 'How beautiful are the feet, etc.' how important is the gospel ministry - (although it must be admitted, that all have not obeyed, for this was predicted also by Isaiah, etc.)"

### John Calvin:
1. "Many are called, who are yet not chosen."
2. "There is no benefit from the word, except when God shines in us by the light of his Spirit."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Faith was required, those who did not believe were those who did not hearken."
2. "This state of things was foreseen and predicted; was not accidental, but was recognized in the Divine plan."
3. "The preaching of the gospel is a duty, whether men hearken or not; to believe the message is the necessary condition of really hearkening."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "They heard, but did not heed." - This quote highlights the distinction between hearing and truly listening or obeying. It suggests that simply hearing the message is not enough; one must also take it to heart and act upon it.

2. "Some disbelieve now as they did then." - This quote draws attention to the fact that disbelief is not a new phenomenon. Just as there were people in the past who did not believe, there are still those who reject the message of faith today.

3. "He quotes Isaiah 53:1 to show how Isaiah felt." - This quote indicates that the author of the commentary refers to a specific verse in Isaiah to provide insight into the emotions and thoughts of the prophet. This reference adds depth to the understanding of the verse being discussed.

1. "The prophet Isaiah begins this chapter by expressing the astonishment of those who hear the message of the suffering servant. He highlights the unexpected nature of the servant's identity and mission, emphasizing that it goes against human expectations and conventional wisdom." 

2. "Isaiah's use of the word 'arm' in this verse signifies power and strength. It suggests that the servant's work is not accomplished through human might or military force, but through the power of God. This highlights the divine nature of the servant's mission and the supernatural aspect of his redemptive work."

3. "The phrase 'to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?' implies that the revelation of the servant's identity and mission is a divine act. It emphasizes that the understanding of the servant's role is not something that can be attained through human wisdom or intellect alone, but requires a revelation from God."

4. "The purpose of the servant's suffering is not for his own sake, but for the sake of others. Through his suffering, the servant will bring about salvation and healing for humanity. This highlights the sacrificial nature of the servant's mission and underscores the depth of God's love and compassion for humanity."

5. "Isaiah's use of the word 'believe' in this verse implies that faith is required to truly understand and accept the message of the suffering servant. It suggests that the revelation of the servant's identity and mission requires a response of faith and trust in God's plan of redemption."
