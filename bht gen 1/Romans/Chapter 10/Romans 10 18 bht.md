## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Did they not hear?...into all the earth went forth their voice, and to the ends of the world their words." 
2. "It is remarkable that so few of the Commentators have noticed that Psalms 19:0 is a comparison of the sun, and glory of the heavens, with the word of God."
3. "As to the assertion of the preaching of the Gospel having gone out into all the world, when as yet a small part of it only had been evangelized, we must remember that it is not the extent, so much as the universality in character, of this preaching, which the Apostle is here asserting."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Can Israel, through any region of his dispersion, plead ignorance of these glad tidings?"
2. "Their sound went into all the earth, and their words unto the end of the world."
3. "The irradiation of the world with the beams of a better Sun by the universal diffusion of the Gospel of Christ."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The objection had been carried through the previous verses. The apostle comes now to reply to it. In doing this, he does not deny the principle contained in it, that the gospel should be preached in order that people might be justly condemned for not believing it; not that the messengers must be sent by God, not that faith comes by hearing. All this he fully admits." 

2. "The apostle means to affirm strongly that they had heard. The word 'they,' in this place, I take to refer to the Gentiles. What was the fact in regard to Israel, or the Jew, he shows in the next verses. One main design was to show that the same scheme of salvation extended to both Jews and Gentiles." 

3. "The meaning here is, that that may be affirmed in fact of the gospel which David affirmed of the works of God, that their sound had gone into all the earth. As applied to the gospel, it means that it was spread far and wide, that it had been extensively preached in all lands."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Surely it is not true that they did not hear."
2. "The voice of the gospel message is like that of the starry sky proclaiming God's glory to all the earth."
3. "The Septuagint sound seems to be a free rendering in order to secure parallelism with words."

### John Calvin:
1. "God has already from the beginning manifested his divinity to the Gentiles, though not by the preaching of men, yet by the testimony of his creatures; for though the gospel was then silent among them, yet the whole workmanship of heaven and earth did speak and make known its author by its preaching."
2. "He indeed manifested himself then more particularly to his chosen people, so that the Jews might be justly compared to domestic hearers, whom he familiarly taught as it were by his own mouth; yet as he spoke to the Gentiles at a distance by the voice of the heavens, he showed by this prelude that he designed to make himself known at length to them also."
3. "The 'sound,' or voice, as applied in this passage, means the report, the news, respecting the gospel; and the 'words,' the actual preaching of it."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "It cannot be that they did not hear, they did hear, though they did not hearken, hence have not this excuse."
2. "So far from its being the case that they did not hear, the very opposite is true."
3. "The manifestation of God in nature is for all His creatures to whom it is made, a pledge of their participation in the clearer and higher revelation."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Did they not hear? Rather, 'Did they fail to hear?'"
2. "Yea, verily."
3. "Sound. Vibration of a musical string."

### John Gill:
1. "The Jews heard the Gospel in the times of Isaiah, and other prophets, though they disbelieved the report of it; they heard it from John the Baptist, and were pleased with his ministry for a while; yea, they heard Christ himself preach it, who spake as never man did, with power and authority, as the Scribes did not, and wondered at his gracious words; they heard the apostles of Christ, who for some time were limited in their ministry to them only, and after their commission was enlarged, were ordered to preach first to them; so that they could not say they had not heard it, and they were left entirely inexcusable."
2. "The Gentiles also had heard it; the apostles were bid to go into all the world, and preach the Gospel to every creature; and at a proper opportunity, they did as the Lord commanded them, and the Gentiles heard the Gospel with joy and pleasure; multitudes were converted everywhere, and churches raised through their ministry, according to the will of God; thus their sound went into all the earth, and their words unto the ends of the world."
3. "The apostle is speaking neither of the light of nature, nor the law of Moses, but of the preaching of the Gospel; and what the Psalmist, literally understood, says of the heavens, that the apostle in an allegorical and mystical sense, or by an argument from the lesser to the greater, or by way of allusion, applies to the apostles and ministers of the Gospel, the luminaries of the world, and stars of heaven; whose ministry, by this time, had reached the then known parts of the habitable world."

### John Wesley:
1. "Their unbelief was not owing to the want of hearing... For they have heard." 
2. "So many nations have already heard the preachers of the gospel."
3. "I may in some sense say of them as David did of the lights of heaven."
