## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Did Israel not know the fact that such a general proclamation of the Gospel would be made as has been mentioned in the last verse, raising up the Gentiles into equality and rivalry with themselves?"
2. "First, Moses saith, I will provoke you to jealousy against a nation that hath no understanding."
3. "Moses prophetically assumes the departure of Israel from God, and his rejection of them, and denounces from God that as they had moved Him to jealousy with their ‘no-gods’ (idols) and provoked Him to anger by their vanities, so He would, by receiving into his favour a ‘no-nation,’ make them jealous, and provoke them to anger by adopting instead of them a foolish nation."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Did not Israel know?—know, from their own Scriptures, of God's intention to bring in the Gentiles?" 
2. "In this verse God warns His ancient people that because they had moved Him to jealousy with their 'no-gods,' and provoked Him to anger with their vanities, He in requital would move them to jealousy by receiving into His favor a 'no-people,' and provoke them to anger by adopting a nation void of understanding." 
3. "God's plan to bring in the Gentiles was not a new revelation, but something that Israel should have known from their own Scriptures."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "This principle the apostle applies to his own times; and affirms that it ought to have been understood by the Jews themselves." 
2. "That when people abuse his mercies, become proud, or cold, or dead in his service, he often takes away their privileges, and bestows them on others." 
3. "Proud and wicked people are always enraged that he bestows his favors on others; and the effect of his sovereign dealings is, to provoke to anger the very people who by their sins have rejected his mercy."

2. "The prediction is that Israel shall be conquered by an apparently inferior people." 
3. "The force of the compounded preposition para in this verb and in parazhlwsw provoke to jealousy, seems to be driving to the side of something which by contact or comparison excites jealousy or anger."

### John Calvin:
1. "What then is to be said of Israel, who had been illuminated by a far different light of truth? for how comes it that aliens and the profane should run to the light manifested to them afar off, and that the holy race of Abraham should reject it when familiarly seen by them?"
2. "He proves by the testimony of Moses, that there was nothing inconsistent in God in preferring the Gentiles to the Jews."

2. "The universality had been announced to Abraham, but Moses was the ‘first’ to write of this; others, among them Isaiah, repeated the prophecy."
3. "The use made by the Apostle of this prophecy is very apt. 'Moses prophetically assumes the departure of Israel from God, and His rejection of them, and denounces from God that, as they had moved Him to jealousy with their 'no-gods' (idols) and provoked Him to anger by their vanities, so He would, by receiving into His favor a 'no-nation' make them jealous, and provoke them to anger by adopting instead of them a foolish nation' (Alford)."

1. "Did Israel fail to know?" - This phrase highlights the lack of knowledge or understanding on the part of Israel, suggesting their ignorance or negligence in recognizing certain truths.

These quotes shed light on the context and implications of the verse, highlighting the ignorance of Israel, the importance of Moses, and the unexpected favor shown to both Jews and Gentiles.

### John Gill:

3. "The Lord threatened by these people to provoke the Jews to jealousy, and to anger them; and this was but just, and by way of retaliation."
