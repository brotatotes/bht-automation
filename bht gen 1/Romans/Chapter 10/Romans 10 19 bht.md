# Romans 10:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This verse reminds us that Israel should have known from their own Scriptures about God's plan to bring in the Gentiles. Instead, they provoked God's jealousy and anger by rejecting this plan. As a consequence, God turned to the Gentiles, adopting a people who did not understand Him. It is a just and retaliatory action on God's part. Not recognizing God's truth, the Israelites followed false gods, leading God to accept another nation in their place.
