# Romans 10:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Among a faith-filled community, there exists a distinct contrast between those who wholeheartedly believe and confess their faith, and an opposing group that stubbornly opposes and contradicts the truth of the Gospel. While heartfelt belief and open confession are vital signs of true faith, this distinction underscores the different responses to the Gospel message. It reminds us of the importance of unwavering belief and unashamedly proclaiming our faith in the face of resistance or doubt.

1. "He says to Israel; but Paul has imitated the Hebrew idiom; for ל, lamed, is often put for מן, men. And he says, that to Israel he stretched forth his hands, whom he continually by his word invited to himself, and ceased not to allure by every sort of kindness; for these are the two ways which he adopts to call men, as he thus proves his goodwill towards them."

3. "Their unfaithfulness is also set forth by two most suitable words. I have thought it right to render the participle ἀπειθούντα , refractory, or rebellious, and yet the rendering of [Erasmus ] and of the Old Translator, which I have placed in the margin, is not to be wholly disapproved."
