# Romans 10:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Christ, the aim and fulfillment of the law, brings an end to its role as a means of salvation. Both Jew and Gentile are no longer under its legislative authority. As the termination and conclusion of the law, Christ's righteousness becomes accessible to all who believe. He is the ultimate purpose and goal, the one who offers forgiveness and eternal life that the law reveals but cannot provide on its own.

### John Gill:
1. "By the 'law' here, is not meant the ceremonial law, of which, indeed, they were all very zealous, and of which Christ also was the end in many respects; he was the final cause of it, or that for the sake of which it was; it had not been given had it not been for him; all its institutions, ordinances, and sacrifices were on his account." 

2. "Christ's obedience to it is no part of justifying righteousness, especially not to everyone that believes, not to the Gentiles who never were under any obligation to observe it: the moral law is here designed." 

3. "Christ is the fulfilling end of the law, since it is added, for righteousness: for the bringing in an everlasting righteousness; a righteousness justifying in the sight of God; a righteousness sinners wanted, and could not obtain of themselves, and could never be obtained but by a perfect fulfilling of the law."

### John Wesley:
1. "For Christ is the end of the law - The scope and aim of it."
2. "It is the very design of the law, to bring men to believe in Christ for justification and salvation."
