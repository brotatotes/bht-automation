# Romans 10:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Christ is the ultimate fulfillment and goal of the law. He accomplishes for believers what the law could not: justification and righteousness. Through faith in Christ, one receives the forgiveness and eternal life that the law falls short of providing. This offer of salvation is extended to all who believe, transcending societal boundaries. The law, which was given in anticipation of Christ, leads us to Him as the source of true righteousness.

2. "The wicked abuse of the law was justly reprehended in the Jews, who absurdly made an obstacle of that which was to be their help: nay, it appears that they had shamefully mutilated the law of God; for they rejected its soul, and seized on the dead body of the letter."
