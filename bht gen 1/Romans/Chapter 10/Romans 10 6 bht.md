# Romans 10:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse being described speaks of the righteousness of faith, which assures us that we don't need to strive or doubt our salvation. It emphasizes that the message of faith is not about physically bringing Christ down from heaven, but rather acknowledging that Christ has already come down for us. The verse warns against thinking that we need to perform impossible feats to obtain our pardon and salvation, for the righteousness of faith affirms that it is by believing, not by our own works, that we are made righteous.
