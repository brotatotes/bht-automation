# Romans 10:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
I apologize for the inconvenience. Unfortunately, I am not able to provide direct access to specific commentaries. However, I can still create a description using the commentators you mentioned earlier. Please let me know if you would like me to do so.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Or, Who shall descend" - This phrase highlights the impossibility of someone descending from heaven to bring Christ down. It emphasizes the divine nature of Christ's coming and the uniqueness of his mission on earth.

2. "Another case of impossibility" - This commentary points out that the statement is not meant to be taken literally but rather as a rhetorical device to emphasize the impossibility of the situation. It underscores the fact that no human effort or action can bring Christ down from heaven.

3. "Probably proverbial expressions of impossibility" - The commentary suggests that these phrases may have been commonly used in proverbial expressions to convey the idea of something being impossible. This adds cultural context to the verse and helps readers understand the rhetorical nature of the statement.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The words as used by Moses refer to what is remote, and therefore difficult to be obtained."
2. "To cross the sea in the early times of navigation involved the highest difficulty, danger, and toil."
3. "The word 'abyss' here, therefore, corresponds to Hades, or the dark regions of departed spirits."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The Jew conceived the sea as the abyss of waters on which the earth rested."
2. "Thus the ideas beyond the sea and beneath the earth coincide in designating the realm of the dead."
3. "To bring up. There is no need. He is already risen."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The descent of Christ to the realm of the dead 'is in any case the undoubted presupposition, which led Paul to substitute the words of our passage for those of the original'." 
2. "The anxious follower after righteousness is not disappointed by an impracticable code, nor mocked by an unintelligible revelation; the word is near him, therefore accessible; plain and simple and therefore apprehensible deals with definite historical fact, and therefore certain." 
3. "All the doing demanded from man by the law...has been already perfectly accomplished by Christ...There only remains then to man, in order to be saved, to believe in that work by applying it to himself."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Into the abyss (εις την αβυσσον). See Luke 8:31 for this old Greek word (α privative and βυσσος) bottomless like sea (Psalms 106:26), our abyss."
2. "In Revelation 9:1 it is the place of torment."
3. "The deity and resurrection of Christ are precisely the two chief points of attack today on the part of sceptics."

### John Gill:
I apologize for the confusion. Please provide the commentary so that I can extract the best parts for you.
