# Romans 11:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse being described speaks to the idea of God's rejection of the people of Israel. The commentators assert that God has not completely cast off the nation, as there are still faithful believers among them. They also emphasize that God's promises to Israel still hold true and that there is hope for the salvation of all Israel in the future. The rejection of Israel as a nation is seen as a consequence of their unfaithfulness, rather than a permanent abandonment by God.

2. "That it should fail through any perfidiousness of men, was wholly unreasonable; for Paul holds this as a fixed principle, that since adoption is gratuitous and based on God alone and not on men, it stands firm and inviolable, howsoever great the unfaithfulness of men may be, which may tend to abolish it."
3. "Before he proceeds to the subject, he proves, in passing, by his own example, how unreasonable it was to think that the nation was utterly forsaken by God; for he himself was in his origin an Israelite, not a proselyte, or one lately introduced into the commonwealth of Israel."

1. "The divine act of casting off from Himself is not viewed as the cause, but as the penal consequence, of the disdaining God's loving will."
