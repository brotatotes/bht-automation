# Romans 11:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse described portrays a condition of spiritual blindness and servitude, where the eyes are darkened and the back is bowed down, signifying a weakened and humbled state. This darkness of the eyes reflects both great terror and a weakened, humbled, and servile condition, while the bowing down represents a posture of humility, submission, and defeat. The purpose behind this spiritual blindness is to emphasize the consequences of obstinacy and rejection, leading to a lack of recognition and reverence for God's authority and power. Despite this judgment, there remains hope that God has not ultimately cast away His people.
