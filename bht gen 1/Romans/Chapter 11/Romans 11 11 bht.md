# Romans 11:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the commentators provide insights into the stumbling of the Israelites and its implications. It is emphasized that though the Israelites stumbled, it was not meant to lead to their complete downfall or destruction. Rather, salvation came to the Gentiles to provoke jealousy among the Jews, ultimately leading to their repentance and salvation. The commentators also discuss the divine purpose behind this stumbling, highlighting the possibility of restoration and the preservation of God's covenant with the Jewish nation.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Did they stumble" - The commentary highlights the question of whether the stumbling of the Israelites was meant to cause their complete downfall. This emphasizes the idea that God did not intend for them to fall completely.
2. "through their fall" - The commentary suggests that the word "fall" in this context is better understood as a "false step." This interpretation adds nuance to the understanding of the Israelites' actions and their consequences.
3. "salvation is come to the Gentiles, to provoke them to jealousy" - The commentary points out that the salvation of the Gentiles was meant to provoke jealousy among the Israelites. This highlights the idea that emulation can be a legitimate motivator for positive change.

### John Calvin:
1. "It is then in conformity with this difference that he now speaks; for since the Jews for the most part rejected Christ, so that perverseness had taken hold almost on the whole nation, and few among them seemed to be of a sane mind, he asks the question, whether the Jewish nation had so stumbled at Christ, that it was all over with them universally, and that no hope of repentance remained."
2. "Here he justly denies that the salvation of the Jews was to be despaired of, or that they were so rejected by God, that there was to be no future restoration, or that the covenant of grace, which he had once made with them, was entirely abolished, since there had ever remained in that nation the seed of blessing."
3. "The Apostle asserts two things in this place, — that the fall of the Jews had turned out for salvation to the Gentiles; but to this end — that they might be kindled by a sort of jealousy, and be thus led to repentance."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The fact of stumbling is not, however, denied, since that has been affirmed in chap. Romans 11:32-33, nor yet the existence of a divine purpose (‘that’ = in order that) in connection with that fact, but as the context shows, the Apostle denies that this purpose was the final fall (i.e., eternal destruction) of the nation." 

2. "The first ‘they’ refers to the unbelieving mass of the nation, but the second evidently applies to them as representing the nation as a whole. As individuals they both stumbled and fell, but the design was not that the nation should fall. This view alone accords with the close of the chapter."

3. "The salvation of the Gentiles was therefore the immediate purpose, but there was a further design, namely, bringing about the final salvation of the Jews by stirring them up to emulation, or, zeal."

### John Gill:
1. "The end which God had in view, in suffering the Jews to stumble and fall, was not their destruction, but rather the salvation of the Gentiles."
2. "And at present there appeared nothing ill in view, but rather through their fall, salvation is come unto the Gentiles."
3. "Another end is to be answered hereby; which is to provoke them to jealousy: that is, to provoke the Jews to jealousy... in a good sense, as will appear in the latter day, when being convinced of their sin in rejecting the Messiah, and observing the many advantages the Gentiles have received by embracing him, and they have lost by their contempt of him, will be provoked to an holy emulation of them."

### John Wesley:
1. "Have they stumbled so as to fall â€” Totally and finally? No." 
2. "By their fall - Or slip: it is a very soft word in the original."
3. "Salvation is come to the gentiles â€” See an instance of this, Acts 13:46."
4. "To provoke them â€” The Jews themselves, to jealousy."
