# Romans 11:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the stumbling of the Jewish people, their rejection of the Messiah, is not a sign of their final fall. Rather, God in His gracious purpose allows this stumble to bring salvation to the Gentiles and to provoke the Jews to jealousy. The fall of the Jews served as an opportunity for the Gentiles to receive the gospel, breaking down the barrier between them. It is through this divine plan that both Jews and Gentiles will find salvation and be led to repentance and restoration.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "He regards the λοιποί as the representatives of the Jewish people, who have nationally stumbled, but not in order to their final fall, seeing that God has a gracious purpose towards the Gentiles even in this πταῖσμα of theirs, and intends to raise them nationally from it in the end."
2. "The stress is on πέσωσιν, and it is the fall which is denied: not on ἵνα πέσωσιν, so that the purpose merely should be denied, and the fall admitted)? God forbid: but by their trespass salvation (has come) to the Gentiles, for to provoke them (Israel) to jealousy."
3. "By this stumble of the Jews out of their national place in God’s favour, and the admission of the Gentiles into it, the very people thus excluded are to be stirred up to set themselves in the end effectually to regain, as a nation, that pre-eminence from which they are now degraded."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Did they stumble" - that they should fall? God forbid; but through their fall... [DE WETTE]
2. "through their fall" - best rendered "false step" [DE WETTE]
3. "salvation is come to the Gentiles, to provoke them to jealousy" - emulation is a legitimate stimulus to what is good.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Even admitting that they are now unbelieving, that they have rejected the Messiah, that they have stumbled, is it the purpose of God finally to exclude them from mercy?"
2. "The apostle shows that this last was not the way in which the Jews had fallen that they were not to be cast off forever, but that occasion was taken by their fall to introduce the Gentiles to the privileges of the gospel, and then they should be restored."
3. "The rejection and fall of the Jews contributed to the introduction of the Gentiles in the following manner: (1) It broke down the harrier which had long subsisted between them. (2) It made it consistent and proper, as they had rejected the Messiah, to send the knowledge of him to others."

### John Calvin:
1. "He asks the question, whether the Jewish nation had so stumbled at Christ, that it was all over with them universally, and that no hope of repentance remained."
2. "He now gives a hope of rising again; which two things are wholly different."
3. "The fall of the Jews had turned out for salvation to the Gentiles; but to this end — that they might be kindled by a sort of jealousy, and be thus led to repentance."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The fact of stumbling is not, however, denied, since that has been affirmed in chap. Romans 11:32-33, nor yet the existence of a divine purpose (‘that’ = in order that) in connection with that fact, but as the context shows, the Apostle denies that this purpose was the final fall (i.e., eternal destruction) of the nation." 

2. "The first ‘they’ refers to the unbelieving mass of the nation, but the second evidently applies to them as representing the nation as a whole. As individuals they both stumbled and fell, but the design was not that the nation should fall. This view alone accords with the close of the chapter."

3. "The salvation of the Gentiles was therefore the immediate purpose, but there was a further design, namely, bringing about the final salvation of the Jews by stirring them up to emulation, or zeal."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Did they stumble that they might fall?" - Paul rejects this query in verse Romans 11:11 as vehemently as he did that in verse Romans 11:1.
2. "By their fall" - For the word, a falling aside or a false step from παραπιπτω, see Romans 5:15-20.
3. "For to provoke them to jealousy" - As an historical fact Paul turned to the Gentiles when the Jews rejected his message (Acts 13:45; Acts 28:28, etc.).

### John Gill:
1. "The end which God had in view, in suffering the Jews to stumble and fall, was not their destruction, but rather the salvation of the Gentiles."
2. "That is, the Gospel; which is sometimes called salvation, the Gospel of our salvation, the word of 'salvation'; because it is a declaration of salvation by Christ, and is the power of God unto it."
3. "And another end is to be answered hereby; which is to provoke them to jealousy: that is, to provoke the Jews to jealousy; not in an ill sense, but in a good sense, as will appear in the latter day, when being convinced of their sin in rejecting the Messiah, and observing the many advantages the Gentiles have received by embracing him, and they have lost by their contempt of him, will be provoked to an holy emulation of them."

### John Wesley:
1. "Have they stumbled so as to fall — Totally and finally? No." 
2. "By their fall - Or slip: it is a very soft word in the original."
3. "Salvation is come to the gentiles — See an instance of this, Acts 13:46."
4. "To provoke them — The Jews themselves, to jealousy."
