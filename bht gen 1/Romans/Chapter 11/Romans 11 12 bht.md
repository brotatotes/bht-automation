# Romans 11:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Through the fall of the Jewish people, an event that brought about their reduction, the Gentiles were blessed and enriched with the riches of the Gospel. The unexpected outcome of Israel's unbelief led to the spreading of the Gospel and the salvation of the Gentile world. The anticipation of the full recovery and conversion of the Jewish people is a cause for great hope, as it will serve as a powerful confirmation of the prophecies and a testament to the truth of the Old and New Testament revelations.
