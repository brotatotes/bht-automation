# Romans 11:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this passage, we read about a temporary rejection and subsequent reception of a certain group. Their casting away led to the preaching of reconciliation to the Gentiles, while their eventual reception will be a manifestation of God's power. This reception will bring about profound changes in their thinking and feeling, akin to a resurrection from the dead. It is part of a larger plan that goes beyond the conversion of the Gentiles, bringing unexpected joy and life to those who were once spiritually lost.

### Marvin Vincent:

3. "Life from the dead...some refer it to the resurrection to follow the conversion of Israel, including the new life which the resurrection will inaugurate."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Their unbelief occasioned the preaching of 'reconciliation' to the Gentiles; many Gentiles were actually reconciled to God, and this was the token of the design and adaptation of the Gospel for the whole world."
2. "The reception to salvation of the Jewish nation as a whole; that they would be thus received, is the leading thought of the entire chapter."
3. "The Apostle has in mind something beyond 'the reconciliation of the world,' some greater blessing than the gradual conversion of the Gentiles through the gospel, and this he terms 'life from the dead.'"

### John Gill:
1. "By the receiving of them is meant the conversion of the Jews in the latter day, when they will be received by Christ, on whom they will look with an eye of faith, and mourn in an evangelical manner for their sins against him."
2. "This their restoration will be as 'life from the dead'; which regards not so much the quickening of the Jews themselves, though their conversion will be, as the conversion of every sinner is, a resurrection from the death of sin to a life of grace."
3. "It will be as unexpected by them, and as surprising to them, as a person's being raised from the dead would be; yea as joyful, and as welcome to them, as if a man received his nearest relation and friend from the dead."

### John Wesley:
1. "Life from the dead" refers to the resurrection power of Jesus, bringing life to a world that was spiritually dead. 

2. This overflowing life is not limited to just a few individuals, but it is meant to be shared with the entire world. 

3. The phrase "life from the dead" also reminds us of the ultimate victory over death that Jesus achieved through His resurrection, offering hope and eternal life to all who believe in Him.
