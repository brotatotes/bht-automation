## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "if the rejection of them be the reconciliation of the world, what will be their reception, but life from the dead!"
2. "it may mean that 'life from the dead' literally should follow on the restoration of the Jewish people; i.e. that the Resurrection, the great consummation, is bound up with it."
3. "standing as it does, it must be qualitative, implying some further blessed state of the reconciled world, over and above the mere reconciliation."

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "They were cast away, though neither totally nor finally, and it is of this partial and temporary rejection that the apostle here speaks."
2. "The reception of the whole family of Israel, scattered as they are among all nations under heaven, will be such a stupendous manifestation of the power of God upon the spirits of men."
3. "It will so change the dominant mode of thinking and feeling on all spiritual things as to seem like a resurrection from the dead."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It means that many of the Gentiles - the world - had become reconciled to God as the result of the casting off of the Jews."
2. "If the casting them off, an event so little likely, apparently, to produce any good effect, was nevertheless overruled so as to produce important benefits in the spread of the gospel, how much more may we expect will be accomplished by their conversion and return."
3. "The resurrection of the dead was an image of the most vast and wonderful event that could take place. This image, therefore, in the apostle’s mind, was a striking illustration of the great change and reformation which should take place when the Jews should be restored, and the effect should be felt in the conversion also of the Gentile world."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The casting away...exclusion from God's people." 
2. "Reconciling of the world...defining the phrase riches of the world." 
3. "Life from the dead...resurrection to follow the conversion of Israel, including the new life which the resurrection will inaugurate."

### John Calvin:
1. "Since the rejection of the Jews has availed so much as to occasion the reconciling of the Gentiles, how much more effectual will be their resumption? Will it not be to raise them even from the dead?"
2. "Since then God has wonderfully drawn forth life from death and light from darkness, how much more ought we to hope, he reasons, that the resurrection of a people, as it were, wholly dead, will bring life to the Gentiles."
3. "The restoration of the Jews unto God’s favor will occasion the revival and spread of true religion through the whole Gentile world."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Their unbelief occasioned the preaching of ‘reconciliation’ to the Gentiles; many Gentiles were actually reconciled to God, and this was the token of the design and adaptation of the Gospel for the whole world."
2. "That they would be thus received, is the leading thought of the entire chapter."
3. "The Apostle has in mind something beyond ‘the reconciliation of the world,’ some greater blessing than the gradual conversion of the Gentiles through the gospel, and this he terms ‘life from the dead.’"

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "The casting away of them (η αποβολη αυτων). Objective genitive (αυτων) with αποβολη, old word from αποβαλλω, to throw off (Mark 10:50), in N.T. only here and Acts 27:22."
2. "The reconciling of the world (καταλλαγη κοσμου). See Romans 5:10 for καταλλαγη (reconciling). It explains verse Romans 11:12."
3. "Life from the dead (ζωη εκ νεκρων). Already the conversion of Jews had become so difficult. It is like a miracle of grace today, though it does happen."

### John Gill:
1. "By the receiving of them is meant the conversion of the Jews in the latter day, when they will be received by Christ, on whom they will look with an eye of faith, and mourn in an evangelical manner for their sins against him."
2. "Their restoration will be as 'life from the dead'; which regards not so much the quickening of the Jews themselves, though their conversion will be, as the conversion of every sinner is, a resurrection from the death of sin to a life of grace."
3. "It will be as unexpected by them, and as surprising to them, as a person's being raised from the dead would be; yea as joyful, and as welcome to them, as if a man received his nearest relation and friend from the dead."

### John Wesley:
1. "Life from the dead" refers to the resurrection power of Jesus, bringing new life to a world that was spiritually dead. It is a reminder of the transformative and life-giving nature of the Gospel message.

2. This phrase also highlights the contrast between the old life of sin and death and the new life found in Christ. It signifies a complete and radical change, where the old self is crucified and a new self is raised to walk in the power of the Holy Spirit.

3. "Overflowing life to the world" emphasizes the abundant and limitless nature of the life that Christ offers. It is not just a personal experience, but a life that overflows and impacts others, bringing hope, healing, and restoration to a broken world.
