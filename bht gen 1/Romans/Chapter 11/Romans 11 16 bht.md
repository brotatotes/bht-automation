### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "The Israelites were required to offer to God the first-fruits of the earth—both in their raw state, in a sheaf of newly reaped grain, and in their prepared state, made into cakes of dough—by which the whole produce of that season was regarded as hallowed."
2. "The argument of the apostle is, that as the separation unto God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, from the rest of mankind, as the parent stem of their race, was as real an offering of first-fruits as that which hallowed the produce of the earth."
3. "The figure of the 'root' and its 'branches' is of like import—the consecration of the one of them extending to the other."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The apparent confusion of metaphor, first - fruit, lump, is resolved by the fact that first - fruit does not apply exclusively to harvest, but is the general term for the first portion of every thing which was offered to God."
2. "The reference here is to Numbers 14:18-21; according to which the Israelites were to set apart a portion of the dough of each baking of bread for a cake for the priests. This was called ajparch, first - fruits."
3. "The thought of both figures centres in holy. Both the first - fruits and the root represent the patriarchs (or Abraham singly, compare ver. 28). The holiness by call and destination of the nation as represented by its fathers (first - fruits, root) implies their future restoration, the holiness of the lump and branches."

### Philip Schaff:

### John Wesley:
