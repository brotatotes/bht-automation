# Romans 11:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the commentators shed light on the concept of holiness and its implications for the conversion of the Jewish nation. The consecration of the patriarchs and their separation unto God symbolizes the future consecration of all the descendants of Israel, signifying a divine plan for their holiness. The metaphor of the firstfruit and the lump illustrates the connection between the holiness of the initial converts and the eventual holiness of the entire nation. It is through the sanctification of the root that the branches, representing future generations, are also made holy.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The argument of the apostle is, that as the separation unto God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, from the rest of mankind, as the parent stem of their race, was as real an offering of first-fruits as that which hallowed the produce of the earth."
2. "In the divine estimation, it was as real a separation of the mass or 'lump' of that nation in all time to God."
3. "The figure of the 'root' and its 'branches' is of like import—the consecration of the one of them extending to the other."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The offering of this was regarded as rendering the mass holy, that is, it was lawful then to partake of it." 
2. "Be set apart, or consecrated to God, as he commanded." 
3. "By this illustration Paul doubtless means to say that the Jewish nation, as a people, were set apart to the service of God, and were so regarded by him."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The reference here is to Numbers 14:18-21; according to which the Israelites were to set apart a portion of the dough of each baking of bread for a cake for the priests." 
2. "The second figure is more comprehensive, since it admits an application to the conversion of the Gentiles."
3. "The holiness by call and destination of the nation as represented by its fathers (first - fruits, root) implies their future restoration, the holiness of the lump and branches."

### John Calvin:
1. "He shows that the Gentiles, if they pretended any prerogative of honor of their own, did in no respect excel the Jews, nay, that if they came to a contest, they should be left far behind."
2. "The first-fruits which were offered sanctified the whole lump, in like manner the goodness of the juice diffuses itself from the root to the branches; and posterity hold the same connection with their parents from whom they proceed as the lump has with the first-fruits, and the branches with the tree."
3. "The holiness here mentioned is external and relative, and not personal and inward, is evident from the whole context. The children of Israel were denominated holy in all their wickedness and disobedience, because they had been consecrated to God, adopted as his people, and set apart for his service."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "This suggests a reason for expecting this ‘receiving’ of the Jews, namely, the consecrated character impressed on this people, when they were separated from other nations."
2. "The ‘firstfruit,’ it is generally agreed, refers to the patriarchs (some limit the application to Abraham), with whom the covenant was made by which Israel became the theocratic people."
3. "The attempts to explain the two clauses differently have not been successful... 'God, in selecting the Hebrew patriarchs, and setting them apart for His service, had reference to their descendants, as well as to themselves; and designed that the Jews, as a people, should, to the latest generations, be specially devoted to Himself."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "The metaphor is from Numbers 15:19. The LXX has απαρχην φυραματος, first of the dough as a heave offering." 

2. "The lump (το φυραμα). From which the first fruit came."

3. "The root (η ριζα). Perhaps Abraham singly here. The metaphor is changed, but the idea is the same."

### John Gill:
1. "if the firstfruit be holy, the lump is also holy, and if the root be holy, so are the branches" - The commentary explains that the holiness of the first converts among the Jews is a pledge and presage of the holiness that will come upon the whole nation in the future. This quote highlights the connection between the holiness of the firstfruit and the holiness of the entire group.

2. "these were but few in number, as the 'firstfruit' is but small in comparison of 'the lump'" - The commentary emphasizes that the initial number of converted Jews was small, just like the firstfruit is small compared to the whole lump. This quote helps to illustrate the humble and insignificant beginnings of the holiness that will eventually spread.

3. "they were truly sanctified by the Spirit of God" - The commentary affirms that the first converts among the Jews were genuinely sanctified by the Holy Spirit. This quote emphasizes the spiritual transformation that took place in these individuals and serves as a reminder of the divine power at work in their lives.

### John Wesley:
1. "The consecration of them was esteemed the consecration of all and so the conversion of a few Jews is an earnest of the conversion of all the rest."

2. "The patriarchs from whom they spring, surely God will at length make their descendants also holy."

3. "And if the root be holy..."
