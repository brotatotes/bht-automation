### Henry Alford:
1. "If some of the branches were broken out, and you being a wild olive, were grafted in among them." 
2. "The Apostle reverses the natural process. It is the wilding, in practice, which is the stock, and the graft inserted is a sprout of the better tree."
3. "A wilding graft on being inserted into a good tree, thereby becomes partaker of its qualities."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "If notwithstanding this consecration of Abraham's race to God, some of the branches—the mass of the unbelieving and rejected Israelites are here called 'some,' not, as before, to meet Jewish prejudice, but with the opposite view of checking Gentile pride."
2. "Though it is more usual to graft the superior cutting upon the inferior stem, the opposite method, which is intended here, is not without example."
3. "You, being a wild olive, were made partaker, along with the branches left, the believing remnant, of the root and fatness of the olive tree—the rich grace secured by covenant to the true seed of Abraham."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "If some of the natural descendants of Abraham, the holy root, are cast off because they are unfruitful, that is, because of unbelief and sin."
2. "The Gentiles had been like the wild olive, unfruitful in holiness; that they had been uncultivated by the institutions of the true religion, and consequently had grown up in the wildness and sin of nature."

3. "It is only in the kingdom of grace that a process thus contrary to nature can be successful; and it is this circumstance which the apostle has seized upon to magnify the mercy shown to the Gentiles by grafting them, a wild race, contrary to the nature of such operations, into the good olive tree of the church, and causing them to flourish there and bring forth fruit unto eternal life."
