# Romans 11:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this passage, the commentators describe a process of grafting, where the wild olive tree (representing the Gentiles) is grafted onto the good olive tree (representing the Jews). This reversal of the natural order highlights the unity between Jewish and Gentile Christians, overturning assumptions of division. The commentators emphasize that the Gentiles should not boast against the Jews, as their dependence on the root signifies their shared faith and the need to receive spiritual nourishment. The overall message conveys the concept of unity in the church across both Jewish and Gentile believers.
