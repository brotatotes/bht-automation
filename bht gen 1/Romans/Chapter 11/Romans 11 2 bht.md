# Romans 11:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Despite the disobedience and unfaithfulness of his chosen people, God has not cast them off completely. The Old Testament bears witness to God's enduring love and concern for his people, as seen in the intercession of the prophet Elijah. The complexity of intercession and God's response is highlighted, as Elijah's plea was against Israel, yet God preserved a remnant of true worshippers amidst the apostasy. This truth should remain fixed in our hearts, reminding us of God's unchangeable love, purpose, and faithfulness towards his people.
