It is a call to guard against pride and arrogance, recognizing that we are not infallible and that we should approach life with a healthy reverence and respect for God.

2. "This fear is not opposed to trust, but to pride and security" - The fear mentioned here is not a fear that leads to doubt or lack of trust in God.

It is a reminder that we should never become so confident in our own abilities that we lose sight of our need for God's guidance and grace.

3. "It is a call to guard against pride and arrogance" - This verse serves as a warning against the dangers of pride and arrogance.
