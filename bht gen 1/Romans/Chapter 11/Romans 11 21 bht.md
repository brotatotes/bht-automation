# Romans 11:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This verse reminds us to cultivate humility and a healthy fear of God, rather than being prideful and self-assured. The fear mentioned here is not a fear of punishment or harm, but a reverence and awe for God. It serves as a reminder to stay humble and not become complacent in our faith. By embracing a fear of God, we acknowledge His sovereignty and our dependence on Him, which keeps us grounded and prevents us from becoming prideful or self-reliant.
