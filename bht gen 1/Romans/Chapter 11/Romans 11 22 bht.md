## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Behold therefore the goodness and severity of God: on them that fell, severity—in rejecting the chosen seed." 
2. "but toward thee, goodness—'God's goodness' is the true reading, that is, His sovereign goodness in admitting thee to a covenant standing who before wert a 'stranger to the covenants of promise' (Ephesians 2:12-20)." 
3. "if thou continue in his goodness—in believing dependence on that pure goodness which made thee what thou art."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The goodness and severity of God. The former word is rendered 'kindness' in Ephesians 2:7 and elsewhere; the latter is the inflexible rigor of justice; both refer to the manifestations of God's attributes, rather than to the attributes themselves."

2. "On them that fell; the unbelieving Jews, the figure of the branches being dropped for the moment."

3. "Thou also shalt be cut off. The word is a strong one, as if the branch were taken off with a sudden stroke of the axe. The warning is for every one of us Gentile Christians, and the wider application seems more appropriate than ever."

### John Gill:
1. "The consideration of both the grace and kindness of God to some, and his severity or strict justice towards others, is recommended by the apostle as very proper to abate pride, vain glory, and haughtiness of spirit."
2. "The Jews who stumbled at Christ and his Gospel, and fell by unbelief, God in strict justice and righteous judgment not only destroyed, as afterwards their nation, city, and temple, and scattered them abroad in the world to be a reproach, a proverb, a taunt, and a curse in all places."
3. "The Gentiles, who not only share in the goodness and grace of God, displayed in the election of many of them to eternal life, in their redemption by Christ, and the effectual calling of them by the grace of God; but in their church state, they being made fellow citizens with the saints, fellow heirs, and of the same body, and having a place and a name in God's house, better than that of sons and daughters."

### John Wesley:
