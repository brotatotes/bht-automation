# Romans 11:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the commentaries highlight the unexpected and contrary nature of the grafting process. One commentator emphasizes that the excision of the Gentiles, who were engrafted through unbelief, is more anticipated than the excision of the natural Israel. Another commentator explains how the phrase "contrary to nature" refers to actions or behaviors that deviate from the normal order, suggesting a standard of inherent order in nature that should be followed. Lastly, the reversal of the usual grafting process, where the wild branch is grafted into the fruitful stock, is emphasized as a significant departure from the natural order.
