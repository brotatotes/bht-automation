# Romans 11:25 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse being described is a message to the Gentile believers, emphasizing that their inclusion in God's plan is not to be taken lightly. It unveils the previously hidden truth that a partial hardening has occurred to Israel, until the full number of Gentiles has come in. The use of the word "mystery" underscores the extraordinary nature of this revelation and cautions against arrogance. Though the Jews are presently hardened, there remains hope for their future restoration.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "I would not have you ignorant, brethren, of this mystery that ye be not wise in your own conceits."
2. "That hardening has happened in part to Israel."
3. "The completion of the Gentiles shall have come in."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The word 'mystery,' so often used by our apostle, does not mean (as with us) something incomprehensible, but 'something before kept secret, either wholly or for the most part, and now only fully disclosed.'"
2. "lest ye should be wise in your own conceits—as if ye alone were in all time coming to be the family of God."
3. "until the Gentiles have had their full time of the visible Church all to themselves while the Jews are out, which the Jews had till the Gentiles were brought in."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The word 'mystery' means properly what is 'concealed, hidden, or unknown.' And it especially refers, in the New Testament, to the truths or doctrines which God had reserved to himself, or had not before communicated."
2. "Paul communicated the truth in regard to this, lest they should attempt to inquire into it; should speculate about the reason why God had rejected the Jews; and should be elated with the belief that they had, by their own skill and genius, ascertained the cause."
3. "The word 'fulness' in relation to the Jews is used in Romans 11:12. It means until the abundance or the great multitude of the Gentiles shall be converted. The word is not used elsewhere in respect to the Gentiles; and it is difficult to fix its meaning definitely."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Mystery [μυστηριον]... secret purposes or counsels which God intends to carry into effect in His kingdom." 
2. "In early ecclesiastical Latin musthrion was rendered by sacramentum, which in classical Latin means the military oath."
3. "Wise [φρονιμοι]... practical wisdom, prudence; thus distinguished from sofia which is mental excellence in its highest and fullest sense."

### John Calvin:
1. "Let us remember this word mystery; by which Paul clearly reminds us, that the mode of their conversion will neither be common nor usual; and hence they act absurdly who attempt to measure it by their own judgment; for what can be more unreasonable than to regard that as incredible which is far removed from our view?"
2. "That blindness in part, etc. 'In part,' I think, refers not simply to time, nor to the number, but means, in a manner, or in a measure; by which expression he intended, as it seems to me, only to qualify a declaration which in itself was severe."
3. "The fullness of the Gentiles is to be taken for a great number: for it was not to be, as before, when a few proselytes connected themselves with the Jews; but such was to be the change, that the Gentiles would form almost the entire body of the Church."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The decisive proof (‘for’) that the Jews shall be grafted in again is found in the prophetic announcement now made by the Apostle."
2. "On the New Testament use of the word ‘mystery,’ see notes on Ephesians 1:9. It does not have the classical sense, but usually refers to a matter of fact, undiscovered by men themselves, which is made known to them by revelation from God."
3. "The ‘hardening’ has been spoken of in Romans 11:7, but the extent of it is here revealed. This thought would check the pride of the Gentiles."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Not in the pagan sense of an esoteric doctrine for the initiated, unknown secrets, or like the mystery religions of the time, but the revealed will of God now made known to all." 

2. "Paul has covered every point of difficulty concerning the failure of the Jews to accept Jesus as the Messiah and has shown how God has overruled it for the blessing of the Gentiles with a ray of hope still held out for the Jews." 

3. "Paul refuses to believe that no more Jews will be saved."

### John Gill:
1. "The apostle in order to raise the attention of the Gentiles to what he was about to deliver to them, not only styles them 'brethren', expressing his affection for them, and their relation to him and other believing Jews, and to one another, being all one in Christ Jesus, partakers of the same grace, and heirs of the same glory." 

2. "The thing he had to inform them of is, that blindness in part is happened to Israel, until the fulness of the Gentiles be come in; by Israel is meant the Jews, the descendants of Jacob, whose name was Israel." 

3. "This blindness 'happened' to them not by chance, but befell them by the decree, and according to the will of God, who hardens whom he pleases; and according to various predictions in the Old Testament."

### John Wesley:
1. "St. Paul calls any truth known but to a few, a mystery."
2. "Lest ye should be wise in your own conceits - Puffed up with your present advantages."
3. "Hardness in part is happened to Israel, till - Israel therefore is neither totally nor finally rejected."
