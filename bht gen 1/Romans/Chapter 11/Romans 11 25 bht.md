# Romans 11:25 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Bible verse being described talks about a previously hidden truth that is now fully revealed. It warns against arrogance and the belief that one group alone is chosen by God. The verse also speaks of a temporary hardening of hearts and the eventual grafting back of the Jews into the family of God. There is a mention of Gentiles having their time in the Church while the Jews are excluded, but this exclusion is not permanent. Ultimately, the verse expresses the idea that God's plan includes the redemption of both Jews and Gentiles.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "The word 'mystery,' so often used by our apostle, does not mean (as with us) something incomprehensible, but 'something before kept secret, either wholly or for the most part, and now only fully disclosed'." 
2. "Lest ye should be wise in your own conceits - as if ye alone were in all time coming to be the family of God."
3. "Until the Gentiles have had their full time of the visible Church all to themselves while the Jews are out, which the Jews had till the Gentiles were brought in."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The decisive proof (‘for’) that the Jews shall be grafted in again is found in the prophetic announcement now made by the Apostle."
2. "On the New Testament use of the word ‘mystery,’ see notes on Ephesians 1:9. It does not have the classical sense, but usually refers to a matter of fact, undiscovered by men themselves, which is made known to them by revelation from God."
3. "This is the second fact revealed, namely, that this hardening (‘in part’) will continue until another event occurs."

### John Wesley:
1. "St. Paul calls any truth known but to a few, a mystery."
2. "Lest ye should be wise in your own conceits - Puffed up with your present advantages; dreaming that ye are the only church; or that the church of Rome cannot fail."
3. "Hardness in part is happened to Israel, till - Israel therefore is neither totally nor finally rejected."
4. "The fullness of the gentiles be come in - Till there be a vast harvest amongst the heathens."
