## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "To understand this great statement, as some still do, merely of such a gradual inbringing of individual Jews, that there shall at length remain none in unbelief, is to do manifest violence both to it and to the whole context."
2. "The apostle, having drawn his illustrations of man's sinfulness chiefly from Psalms 14:1-7; Isaiah 59:1-21, now seems to combine the language of the same two places regarding Israel's salvation from it."
3. "But as all the glorious manifestations of Israel's God were regarded as issuing out of Zion, as the seat of His manifested glory, the turn which the apostle gives to the words merely adds to them that familiar idea."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The view now generally adopted is: that the ancient people of God shall be restored, as a nation, to God's favor."
2. "The attempt to fill it out has always produced a reaction, which has opposed even the obvious literal sense of the clause."
3. "The prophecies are introduced to confirm the last statement: 'and thus all Israel shall be saved.'"
