## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "And thus (when this condition shall have been fulfilled) all Israel shall be saved (Israel as a nation, see above: not individuals, nor is there the slightest ground for the notion of the ἀποκατάστασις)."

2. "The Redeemer was to come for the behoof of God’s own chosen people."

3. "The Apostle frequently varies from the LXX, and a sufficient reason can generally be assigned for the variation: here, though this reason is not apparent, we cannot doubt that such existed, for the LXX would surely have suited his purpose even better than ἐκ, had there been no objection to it."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "To understand this great statement, as some still do, merely of such a gradual inbringing of individual Jews, that there shall at length remain none in unbelief, is to do manifest violence both to it and to the whole context."
2. "The apostle, having drawn his illustrations of man's sinfulness chiefly from Psalms 14:1-7; Isaiah 59:1-21, now seems to combine the language of the same two places regarding Israel's salvation from it."
3. "And whereas the prophet announces that He 'shall come to (or, 'for') them that turn from transgression in Jacob,' while the apostle makes Him say that He shall come 'to turn away ungodliness from Jacob,' this is taken from the Septuagint version, and seems to indicate a different reading of the original text."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "All Israel - All the Jews... He does not mean to say that every Jew of every age would be saved; for he had proved that a large portion of them would be, in his time, rejected and lost. But the time would come when, as a people, they would be recovered; when the nation would turn to God; and when it could be said of them that, as a nation, they were restored to the divine favor."
2. "Shall be saved - Shall be recovered from their rejection; be restored to the divine favor; become followers of the Messiah, and thus be saved as all other Christians are."
3. "And shall turn away ... - The Hebrew is, 'to those forsaking ungodliness in Jacob.' The Septuagint has rendered it in the same manner as the apostle."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The deliverer [ο ρυομενος] . The Hebrew is goel redeemer, avenger."
2. "The goel was the nearest kinsman of a childless widow, and was required to marry her."
3. "It is the word used by Job in the celebrated passage Job 19:25."

### John Calvin:
1. "When the Gentiles shall come in, the Jews also shall return from their defection to the obedience of faith; and thus shall be completed the salvation of the whole Israel of God."
2. "The Israel of God is what he calls the Church, gathered alike from Jews and Gentiles; and he sets the people, thus collected from their dispersion, in opposition to the carnal children of Abraham, who had departed from his faith."
3. "Paul thought it enough to regard this point only, — that as it is Christ’s peculiar office to reconcile to God an apostate and faithless people, some change was surely to be looked for, lest they should all perish together."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The view now generally adopted is: that the ancient people of God shall be restored, as a nation, to God’s favor."
2. "The attempt to fill it out has always produced a reaction, which has opposed even the obvious literal sense of the clause."
3. "The prophecies are introduced to confirm the last statement: ‘and thus all Israel shall be saved.’"

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "All Israel (πας Ισραηλ). What does Paul mean? The immediate context argues for the Jewish people 'as a whole.'"
2. "But the spiritual Israel (both Jews and Gentiles) may be his idea in accord with Romans 9:6 as the climax of the argument."
3. "The Deliverer (ο ρυομενος). Present middle articular participle of ρυομα, to rescue, to deliver. Paul interprets it of Jesus as Messiah."

### John Gill:
1. "Meaning not the mystical spiritual Israel of God, consisting both of Jews and Gentiles, who shall appear to be saved in the Lord with an everlasting salvation, when all God's elect among the latter are gathered in, which is the sense many give into; but the people of the Jews, the generality of them, the body of that nation."
2. "There is a common saying among them, 'all Israel shall have a part', or 'portion in the world to come'; and in support of this they usually produce the passage in Isaiah 60:21: 'thy people also shall be all righteous'."
