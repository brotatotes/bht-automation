# Romans 11:28 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the Bible verse, there is a contrast between those who are enemies of the gospel and those who are beloved by God. The enemies are those who reject the gospel and are excluded from the family of God, but this exclusion serves a purpose for the benefit of the Gentiles. Despite their enmity, the Jews are still beloved by God, not because of their own merits, but because of the covenant with their forefathers. The verse highlights the divine plan and purpose behind the state of enmity and the chosen status of Abraham's descendants.
