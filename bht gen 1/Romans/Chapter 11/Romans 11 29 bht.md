## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The gifts and calling of God cannot be repented of, i.e. are irretractable." 
2. "The Jews being once chosen as God's people, will never be entirely cast off." 
3. "The words are true not only of this calling, but of every other."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Both these, says the apostle, are irrevocable; and as the point for which he refers to this at all is the final destiny of the Israelitish nation, it is clear that the perpetuity through all time of the Abrahamic covenant is the thing here affirmed."
2. "And lest any should say that though Israel, as a nation, has no destiny at all under the Gospel, but as a people disappeared from the stage when the middle wall of partition was broken down, yet the Abrahamic covenant still endures in the spiritual seed of Abraham, made up of Jews and Gentiles in one undistinguished mass of redeemed men under the Gospel—the apostle, as if to preclude that supposition, expressly states that the very Israel who, as concerning the Gospel, are regarded as 'enemies for the Gentiles' sakes,' are 'beloved for the fathers' sakes.'"
3. "But in what sense are the now unbelieving and excluded children of Israel 'beloved for the fathers' sakes?' Not merely from ancestral recollections, as one looks with fond interest on the child of a dear friend for that friend's sake [DR. ARNOLD]—a beautiful thought, and not foreign to Scripture, in this very matter—but it is from ancestral connections and obligations, or their lineal descent from and oneness in covenant with the fathers with whom God originally established it."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The word χάρισμα charisma properly denotes any benefit which is conferred on another as a mere matter of favor, and not of reward... Such are all the favors which God bestows on sinners including pardon, peace, joy, sanctification, and eternal life." 

2. "The word 'calling' κλῆσις klēsis here denotes that act of God by which he extends an invitation to people to come and partake of his favors... All such invitations or callings imply a pledge that he will bestow the favor, and will not repent, or turn from it."

3. "God never draws or invites sinners to himself without being willing to bestow pardon and eternal life... God does not bestow the gift of repentance and faith, of pardon and peace, on people, for a temporary purpose; nor does he capriciously withdraw them, and leave the soul to ruin."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Without repentance [αμεταμελητα]. Only here and 2 Corinthians 7:10." 
2. "See on repented, Matthew 21:29." 
3. "Not subject to recall."

### John Calvin:
1. "The purpose of God stands firm and immovable, by which he had once deigned to choose them for himself as a peculiar nation."
2. "He does not oppose the gospel to election, as though they were contrary the one to the other, for whom God has chosen he calls."
3. "What is substantially said then is, — that as God purposed to show mercy to the Gentiles, the Jews were on this account deprived of the light of faith."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The fact that God had once bestowed His gifts upon Israel, and called them to become His people, proves, on this principle, that they are still beloved for the sake of their fathers."
2. "The principle is universal, but here the application is national, hence both ‘gifts’ and ‘calling’ are not to be limited to spiritual gifts to individuals, and to effectual calling, or to election."
3. "The Jewish nation had special endowments from God, chief among these, or rather the cause of all these, was the calling of the nation as the theocratic people to whom the Messiah was promised."

### Archibald T Robertson:

3. This verse clarifies that God does not regret or feel sorry for the gifts and calling He has bestowed upon the Jews. (Quote 3)

### John Gill:
1. "By 'gifts' are meant... the special and spiritual gifts of God's free grace, which relate to the spiritual and eternal welfare of the souls of men."
2. "These gifts are without repentance; that is, they are immutable and unalterable; God never revokes them, or calls them in again, or takes them away from the persons to whom he has made such a previous donation."
3. "Whatever God purposes, or promises to give, or really does give to his people, whether into the hands of Christ for them, or into their own, he never repents of or reverses."
