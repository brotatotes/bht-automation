## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "The phrase 'I am left alone' conveys a sense of isolation and loneliness, highlighting the prophet's feelings of being the sole survivor and the weight of his responsibility."
2. "By emphasizing that he is 'only' left, the prophet underscores his sense of being the last faithful servant of God, standing apart from the rest of the people who have turned away from Him."
3. "This statement also reveals the prophet's deep sense of personal commitment and dedication to God, as he recognizes that he is the sole representative of God's truth and righteousness in a world that has strayed from His path."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The fact was true that they had killed the prophets, etc.; 1 Kings 18:4, 1 Kings 18:13; but the inference which Elijah seems to have drawn from it, that there were no pious people in the nation, was not well founded."
2. "Altars, by the Law of Moses, were required to be made of earth or unhewn stones; Exodus 20:24-25. Hence, the expression to dig them down means completely to demolish or destroy them."
3. "There could scarcely be conceived a time of greater distress and declension in religion than this. It has not often happened that so many things that were disheartening have occurred to the church at the same period of time."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Thine altars. The plural points to the altars as the high places in the kingdom of Israel where Elijah lived. Although it was originally forbidden to erect such altars, they became the only places in Israel where Jehovah was publicly worshipped. Hence in the time of Elijah neglect of these was really neglect of worship."
2. "I am left alone, or, 'the only one.' The latter rendering corresponds better with the LXX., but is somewhat stronger than Paul's citation. The language of Elijah meant that he was the only prophet left; while the transposition of the clauses suggests here the further notion: I am the only true worshipper of Jehovah. It is not necessary to suppose that the Apostle has departed from the original sense."
3. "They seek my life. See 1 Kings 19:1-2."

### John Gill:
1. "This sin of slaying the prophets of the Lord is charged upon the Jews by Christ, Matthew 23:31, and by the apostle, 1 Thessalonians 2:15."
2. "The pulling down of the altars was done in contempt of them, and of the worship of God, which had been formerly performed there."
3. "And I am left alone: meaning either as a prophet, not knowing that Obadiah had hid an hundred prophets by fifty in a cave, 1 Kings 18:4; or else as a worshipper of the true God, imagining that he was the only person in Israel, that had a true zeal for the Lord of hosts."

### John Wesley:
1. "Elijah's despair and fear in this verse remind us that even the most faithful servants of God can experience moments of doubt and weakness. It is a reminder that we are all human and susceptible to the trials and tribulations of life."

2. "The question 'What are you doing here, Elijah?' is not just a simple inquiry from God. It is a profound invitation for Elijah to reflect on his purpose and calling. It challenges him to examine his motives and reevaluate his actions."

3. "God's response to Elijah's despair is not a rebuke, but an affirmation of His presence and power. It is a reminder that even in our darkest moments, God is with us and will provide the strength and guidance we need to carry on."

4. "Elijah's encounter with God in the still small voice teaches us that sometimes, God speaks to us not in grand displays of power, but in the quiet whispers of our hearts. It is a reminder to be attentive and listen for His gentle guidance in our lives."

5. "This verse serves as a reminder that God's work is not limited to the grand and spectacular. He can accomplish His purposes through the seemingly insignificant and ordinary. It encourages us to trust in His wisdom and sovereignty, even when things may not go according to our expectations."
