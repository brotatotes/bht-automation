# Romans 11:30 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the Bible verse being described, it speaks of the transformation from a state of disobedience to receiving mercy. The Gentiles, who were once disobedient to God, have now obtained mercy through the disobedience of the Jews. This mercy is a result of the unbelief and rejection of the Jews, allowing the Gentiles to be grafted into the favor of God. These blessings of mercy come through the application of pardoning grace, granting them the opportunity to believe and know the true God.
