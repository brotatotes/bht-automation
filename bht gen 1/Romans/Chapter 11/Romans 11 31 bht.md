# Romans 11:31 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Through their disobedience to the gospel, the Jews have been blind to the truth, while the Gentiles have shown mercy and belief. The eventual redemption of the Jews will come through the compassion and pity of the Gentiles, who will bring the knowledge of the Messiah to them. Both Jews and Gentiles have had their struggles with unbelief, but this does not hinder the mercy and salvation that can be obtained through faith. The call for the Jews to obtain mercy is just as powerful as it was for the Gentiles.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "The apostle has hitherto dwelt upon the unbelief of the Jews as making way for the faith of the Gentiles." 
2. "Now, opening a more cheering prospect, he speaks of the mercy shown to the Gentiles as a means of Israel's recovery."
3. "It will be by the instrumentality of believing Gentiles that Israel as a nation is at length to 'look on Him whom they have pierced and mourn for Him,' and so to 'obtain mercy.'"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Through the mercy, that is, the compassion or deep feeling of the converted Gentiles; through the deep and tender pity which they would feel for the blinded and degraded Jews: the gospel should be again carried to them, and they should be recalled to the long lost favor of God."
2. "Each party should thus cause salvation to come to the other - the Jews to the Gentiles by their unbelief; but the Gentiles, in their turn, to the Jews by their belief."
3. "It may be asked here whether the time is not approaching for the Gentiles to make efforts to bring the Jews to the knowledge of the Messiah. Hitherto those efforts have been unsuccessful; but it will not always be so; the time is coming when the promises of God in regard to them shall be fulfilled."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Have these (Jews) now, since the gospel of Christ was preached, been disobedient; lit., 'were disobedient,' as in Romans 11:30, but 'now' compels us to render 'have been disobedient.'" 
2. "That, in order that, by the mercy shown to you (lit. 'your mercy;' in emphatic position in the original) they also may now obtain mercy." 
3. "The leading thought of the section (Romans 11:11) is here repeated, in the final summing up. This view is so natural and accords so entirely with the parallelism as to forbid the explanations of the Vulgate, Luther, and others; 'they have not believed in the mercy shown to you,' or, 'were disobedient through the mercy shown to you.'"

### John Gill:
1. "Blindness has happened to them, the vail is over their hearts; as the Gentiles formerly did not believe God, so the Jews do not now." 
2. "They do not believe God in Christ; nor that he is the Father of Christ; or that Christ is the Son of God, the true Messiah, and Saviour of the world." 
3. "The apostle's argument in favor of the call and conversion of the Jews, upon the whole is this, that since the unbelief of the Gentiles was no bar to their obtaining mercy, and that through the infidelity of the Jews; then it cannot be thought, that the present blindness, hardness of heart, enmity, and unbelief, which now attend the Jews, can be any obstacle to their obtaining mercy in the same way the Gentiles have; but as the one has been, the other also will be."
