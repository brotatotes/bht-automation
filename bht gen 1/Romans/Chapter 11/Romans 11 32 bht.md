## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The Apostle is speaking of the divine arrangement by which the guilt of sin and the mercy of God were to be made manifest."
2. "But the ultimate difference between the all men who are shut up under disobedience, and the all men upon whom mercy is shown is, that by all men this mercy is not accepted, and so men become self-excluded from the salvation of God."
3. "GOD'S ACT remains the same, equally gracious, equally universal, whether men accept His mercy or not."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

2. "That he might have mercy upon all" - God's purpose in allowing unbelief is to ultimately extend His mercy to both Jews and Gentiles.
3. "Certainly it is not 'all mankind individually'" - The apostle is not referring to every individual, but rather to the divisions of mankind, specifically Jews and Gentiles.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The Scripture is declared to have shut them up under sin, that is, declared them to be sinners; gave no hope of rescue by any works of their own."
2. "All are represented, therefore, as in prison, enclosed or confined by God, and to be liberated only in his own way and time."
3. "The emphasis in this verse is on the word 'mercy.' It signifies that God is under obligation to no one, and therefore that all are saved by grace, because all are equally ruined."

2. "If they have emerged from unbelief through God’s mercy alone, they ought to leave place for it as to others also."
3. "Paul intends here to teach two things — that there is nothing in any man why he should be preferred to others, apart from the mere favor of God; and that God in the dispensation of his grace, is under no restraint that he should not grant it to whom he pleases."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "God shut up all; not, ‘hath concluded them all.’ The verb means ‘to shut up’ as in a prison (not necessarily ‘shut up together’); ‘hath’ is unnecessary, and ‘them’ is improperly supplied, as if the Jews only were meant." 
2. "This shutting up of all unto disobedience is an effective, not simply a declarative or permissive, activity of God. In the development and punishment of sin not in its origin."
3. "The universality of sin is overborne by the universality of Divine grace; comp. chap. Romans 5:12 ff.; 1 Corinthians 15:21-22. Here this universality is presented mainly with reference to the proffering of mercy, not its efficiency."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "First aorist active indicative of συνκλειω, to shut together like a net (Luke 5:6)."

### John Gill:
1. "God does not put unbelief into people, but if He finds them in unbelief, He leaves them in that state for a time, not yet delivering them from it."
2. "To be 'concluded in unbelief' means to be thoroughly convinced of it, held down by a sense of it in the conscience, and seeing no way to escape punishment or obtain salvation except through God's mercy in Christ."
3. "God's mercy is not upon all individuals, but upon His elect among the Jews and Gentiles, for whom He has mercy in store and will bestow it on them, revealing their need for it and displaying the richness of His mercy."
