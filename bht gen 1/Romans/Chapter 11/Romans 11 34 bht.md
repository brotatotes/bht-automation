# Romans 11:34 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Who can fathom the depths of God's wisdom and knowledge? No one can claim to have counseled or understood the mind of the Lord. Our understanding of God is limited to what He has revealed to us, and even then, we see only a glimpse, a reflection of His truth. Like the prophet Isaiah recognized, we must humbly acknowledge the vastness of God's understanding and depend on Him for true wisdom and guidance.
