# Romans 11:36 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Through the words of various commentators, we gain a richer understanding of a Bible verse. It reveals that everything in the world, both in nature and in grace, is from God. He is the ultimate source, creator, preserver, and goal of all things. This verse also highlights the humbling truth that God's sovereignty is above all human understanding, and yet it is through this humility that we are exalted. The verse prompts us to acknowledge God's glory and the intricate workings of His divine plan for all creation.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "OF Him are all things," as their eternal Source: "THROUGH Him are all things," inasmuch as He brings all to pass which in His eternal counsels He purposed: "To Him are all things," as being His own last End; the manifestation of the glory of His own perfections being the ultimate, because the highest possible, design of all His procedure from first to last.
2. It is an unspeakable consolation to know that in times of deepest religious declension and most extensive defection from the truth, the lamp of God has never been permitted to go out, and that a faithful remnant has ever existed—a remnant larger than their own drooping spirits could easily believe.
3. God has so ordered His dealings with the great divisions of mankind, "that no flesh should glory in His presence." Gentile and Jew have each in turn been "shut up to unbelief," that each in turn may experience the "mercy" which saves the chief of sinners.

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "All men and things are for His glory." 
2. "The great question which was then agitating the Church was the relation of Judaism to Christianity."
3. "It is aimed at the Jews' national and religious conceit. It is designed to show them that, notwithstanding their claim to be God's elect people, the great mass of their nation has been justly rejected by God; and further, that God's elective purpose includes the Gentiles."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Of him, as the original Source, Author, Creator; and through him, as our Preserver and Governor and Bountiful Benefactor, as superior to nature which He created, controlling and directing it, and that for His own ends."
2. "All things (not simply all persons) will carry out His will, will contribute to His glory. Human thought can rise no higher than this."
3. "The greatest treatise on God's dealings with men ends not only with praise to Him, but with a confession of His sovereignty. This which so exalts God does indeed humble us. But it is through this humility that we too are exalted."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "By these three prepositions Paul ascribes the universe with all the phenomena concerning creation, redemption, providence to God as the Source, the Agent, the Goal."
2. "For ever. 'For the ages.'"
3. "Alford terms this doxology in verses Romans 11:33-36 'the sublimest apostrophe existing even in the pages of inspiration itself.'"

### John Gill:
1. "Not only all things in nature and providence, he being the Maker and efficient cause of things, and the preserver and supporter of them their beings, and to whose glory they are all designed and directed."
2. "All things in grace owe their original to him, as their first cause; they are produced by him, and make for his glory; they all spring from his sovereign will, are brought about by his almighty power, and tend to the glory of his grace."
3. "Particularly the counsels and purposes of God respecting men may be here meant; which all rise out of his own heart, without any motive or inducement to them in the creature; are accomplished by his divine power, notwithstanding all the opposition of men and devils; and all issue in his glory."

### John Wesley:
1. "Of him â€” As the Creator."
2. "Through him â€” As the Preserver."
3. "To him â€” As the ultimate end, are all things."
