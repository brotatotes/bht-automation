# Romans 11:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, there is a mention of a faithful remnant chosen by God's grace, not based on their own merits. This remnant is not limited to a specific group, but rather individuals who have been preserved and reserved by God. The election of grace is the result of God's sovereign choice, unrelated to human effort or foreseen qualities. The key to receiving salvation lies in the act of believing, as God's gracious purpose of salvation is extended to all who have faith in Him.
