# Romans 11:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Even in the present time, there is a remnant according to the election of grace. A part has remained faithful, a testimony to God's unmerited favor. The remnant is not chosen based on their own merit, but solely by God's free and undeserved favor. As in Elijah's time, the rejection of Christ by Israel is not as universal as it appears, as there is a faithful remnant. This election is not based on human merit, but on God's grace and sovereign choice. The emphasis is on faith, as it is through belief in God that one is justified and saved.
