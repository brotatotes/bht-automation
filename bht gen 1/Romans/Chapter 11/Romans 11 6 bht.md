## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "The general position here laid down is of vital importance: That there are but two possible sources of salvation - men's works, and God's grace and that these are so essentially distinct and opposite, that salvation cannot be of any combination or mixture of both, but must be wholly either of the one or of the other."

2. "If it (the election) be by grace, it is no more of works for [then] grace becomes no more grace."

3. "The authority of ancient manuscripts against this latter clause, as superfluous and not originally in the text, though strong, we think, is not sufficient to justify its exclusion."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Grace is no more, etc.": This quote suggests that when the focus is on works, grace loses its significance or is no longer emphasized. It implies that relying solely on works can diminish the importance of grace in one's life.

2. "No longer comes into manifestation as what it really is": This quote highlights that when works take precedence, grace is no longer revealed or displayed in its true nature. It implies that grace is best understood and experienced when it is not overshadowed by works.

3. "The best texts omit to the end of the verse": This quote suggests that there may be variations in the textual evidence for this verse, indicating that the exact wording or content of the verse may not be universally agreed upon.

2. "In such a case grace would fail to show itself as what it is...it gives up its specific character." - This quote emphasizes the significance of grace maintaining its essence and specific character, suggesting that if it were based on works, it would cease to be true grace.

3. "The emphasis placed at this point on the doctrine of free grace is doubtless to prepare for what follows: the reference to the many rejected...are based on the sovereignty of God in His dealings." - This quote explains that the emphasis on free grace in this verse serves as a foundation for understanding God's sovereignty in His dealings with the rejected and the ultimate solution.

2. Augustine: Gratia nisi gratis sit gratia non est. (Grace, unless it is freely given, is not grace.)
3. "Since, in that case."

### John Gill:
1. "If election is 'by grace', as it certainly is; for no other reason can be given why God has chose one, and not another, but his own sovereign pleasure, or that free favour and unmerited love, with which he loves one and not another."
2. "Grace is not grace, unless it is altogether freed."
3. "If election springs from, and depends upon the works of men, let no man ascribe it to the grace of God; for there is nothing of grace in it, if this be the case."

### John Wesley:
1. "And if by grace, then it is no more of works — Whether ceremonial or moral.Else grace is no longer grace — The very nature of grace is lost." 

2. "And if it be of works, then it is no more grace: else work is no longer work — But the very nature of it is destroyed." 

3. "There is something so absolutely inconsistent between the being justified by grace, and the being justified by works, that, if you suppose either, you of necessity exclude the other."
