# Romans 11:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this passage, the commentators emphasize the exclusive nature of salvation through grace and the utter contradiction between works and grace. They assert that salvation cannot be a combination of human effort and divine favor, but rather, it is wholly dependent on the free and unmerited love of God. If salvation were based on works, it would nullify and lose the very essence of grace. The verse affirms the primacy of God's grace, constraining any attempts to compromise between God's freely given favor and human merit.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Let us remember, when we say an election of grace, how much those words imply: viz. nothing short of the entire exclusion of all human work from the question." 
2. "The object being precision, it is much more probable that the Apostle should have written both clauses in their present formal parallelism, and that the second should have been early omitted from its seeming superfluity, than that it should have been inserted from the margin."
3. "These cautions of the Apostle are decisive against all attempts at compromise between the two great antagonist hypotheses, of salvation by God’s free grace, and salvation by man’s meritorious works."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The general position here laid down is of vital importance: That there are but two possible sources of salvation—men's works, and God's grace and that these are so essentially distinct and opposite, that salvation cannot be of any combination or mixture of both, but must be wholly either of the one or of the other."

2. "If it (the election) be by grace, it is no more of works for [then] grace becomes no more grace."

3. "The authority of ancient manuscripts against this latter clause, as superfluous and not originally in the text, though strong, we think, is not sufficient to justify its exclusion. Such seeming redundancies are not unusual with our apostle."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "If the fact that any are reserved be by grace, or favor, then it cannot be as a reward of merit."
2. "The idea of being saved by merit contradicts the very idea of grace."
3. "Salvation cannot be partly by grace and partly by works. It is not because people can advance any claims to the favor of God; but from his mere unmerited grace."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Grace is no more... It gives up its specific character." 
2. "No longer comes into manifestation as what it really is."
3. "If of works... The best texts omit to the end of the verse."

### John Calvin:
1. "For whether you introduce works future or past, this declaration of Paul opposes you; for he says, that grace leaves nothing to works."
2. "It hence follows, that it is absurd to blend foreknowledge of works with election."
3. "Whenever it is declared that there are no merits of works, our salvation is ascribed to the grace of God."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Since the remnant exists by grace, let us understand what this involves, negatively... 'works' are entirely excluded in this matter of the remnant existing according to the election of grace."
2. "In such a case grace would fail to show itself as what it is; it gives up its specific character."
3. "The emphasis placed at this point on the doctrine of free grace is doubtless to prepare for what follows: the reference to the many rejected, as well as the statement of the final solution, are based on the sovereignty of God in His dealings."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "No longer becomes" grace, loses its character as grace.
2. Augustine: Gratia nisi gratis sit gratia non est.
3. "Grace, unless it is freely given, is not grace."

### John Gill:
1. "If election is 'by grace', as it certainly is; for no other reason can be given why God has chose one, and not another, but his own sovereign pleasure, or that free favour and unmerited love, with which he loves one and not another."
2. "Grace is not grace, unless it is altogether freed."
3. "If election springs from, and depends upon the works of men, let no man ascribe it to the grace of God; for there is nothing of grace in it, if this be the case."

### John Wesley:
1. "Whether ceremonial or moral.Else grace is no longer grace — The very nature of grace is lost." 
2. "But the very nature of it is destroyed. There is something so absolutely inconsistent between the being justified by grace, and the being justified by works, that, if you suppose either, you of necessity exclude the other." 
3. "For what is given to works is the payment of a debt; whereas grace implies an unmerited favour."
