### Philip Schaff:
1. "That which Israel (as a mass) is seeking for, now as formerly; chaps. Romans 9:31; Romans 10:3 show that 'righteousness' is the object sought."
2. "The connection with Romans 11:5-6 shows that this took place, because the mass of the nation sought the end 'as of works' (chap. Romans 9:32), a method opposed to 'grace.'"
3. "The word denotes in its primary meaning: 'to deprive an organ of its natural sensibility; in the moral: to take from the heart the faculty of being touched by what is good or divine, from the intelligence the faculty of discerning between the true and the false, the good and the evil."

### John Gill:
1. "God has not cast away all the people of the Jews, nor any whom he foreknew, any age or period of time; neither in the time Elijah, nor in the apostle's, he always having a reserve of some for himself; which reserve is owing to a previous choice of them, and that previous choice to ascribed not to any works of theirs, but to his free grace and sovereign pleasure."

2. "Indeed Israel hath not obtained that which he seeketh for; that is, carnal Israel, the body and bulk of that people; who sought for life and righteousness by their obedience to the law, and which they in general were in quest of, and pursuit after, but did not obtain, though, some of them might imagine they did; for the thing was impracticable and impossible, no life nor righteousness are ever to be had by the law of works."

3. "The apostle divides Israel into two parts, 'the election and the rest': by 'the election' he means, elect men, the remnant among them, whom God had reserved for himself... Now these chosen ones obtained mercy, grace, life, and righteousness in Christ, as the apostle himself did, who was one of them; and that by virtue, and in consequence of their election, for which reason the word is here used."
