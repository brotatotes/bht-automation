# Romans 11:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we see that Israel, as a whole, failed to find favor and justification with God because they sought it through their own merits, which was impossible. However, there is a remnant, the elect, who did obtain justification. The majority of Israel was hardened and blinded due to their obstinacy and rejection of God's offer. The lack of belief in Jesus as the way to obtain righteousness is the reason for Israel's failure in finding justification.
