# Romans 11:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In a Messianic psalm, there are rejecters of Christ who experience the consequences of their actions. Their blessings become a curse, as their table, symbolizing their altars and sacrifices, brings them no true satisfaction. Not understanding the prophecies and misapplying the teachings of the sacred writings, they stumble and fall. Their enjoyments turn into sources of pain and vengeance, as the very gospel that should have nourished their souls becomes a means of destruction.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "In such a Messianic psalm, [the phrase 'And David saith'] must be meant of the rejecters of Christ."
2. "Let their table, &c. - that is, let their very blessings prove a curse to them."
3. "Their enjoyments only sting and take vengeance on them."

### John Gill:
1. "By their 'table' may be meant, the altar; see Malachi 1:7; and the sacrifices offered up upon it, their meat offerings and drink offerings, and all others; likewise the laws concerning the difference of meats, and indeed the whole ceremonial law may be intended."
2. "Moreover, the sacred writings, which are full of spiritual food and divine refreshment, the prophecies of the Old Testament, which clearly pointed out Christ, not being understood, but misapplied by them, proved a trap, a snare, and a stumbling block to them."
3. "Though these words may be literally understood of their table mercies, the necessary provisions of life, their common food and drink, of which they had great scarcity in their last wars; so that they not only by wicked methods stole it from one another, but ate what was forbidden by their law, and what was abhorrent to nature."

### John Wesley:
1. "In that prophetic imprecation, which is applicable to them, as well as to Judas."
2. "A recompence - Of their preceding wickedness. So sin is punished by sin."
3. "The gospel, which should have fed and strengthened their souls, is become a means of destroying them."
