# Romans 12:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
By the death of Jesus, believers are transformed from dead victims to living sacrifices, offering themselves as pure and acceptable offerings to God. They respond to the appeal, being moved by God's mercy, living according to His will. These exhortations are drawn from the preceding chapter and are addressed to the brethren, who present themselves willingly and devotedly to God's service, without placing confidence in themselves. This sacrifice is a result of the entire gospel, freeing us from God's wrath and empowering our holy and transformed lives.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "The death of the one 'Lamb of God, taking away the sin of the world,' has swept all dead victims from off the altar of God, to make room for the redeemed themselves as 'living sacrifices' to Him."
2. "Every outgoing of their grateful hearts in praise, and every act prompted by the love of Christ, is itself a sacrifice to God of a sweet-smelling savor."
3. "Believers, 'yielding themselves to God as those that are alive from the dead, and their members as instruments of righteousness unto God,' are, in His estimation, not ritually but really 'holy,' and so acceptable."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Beseech is not a word of legal command, but an appeal addressed to Christians whose hearts, it is assumed, will respond to the motives on which the appeal is based." 
2. "He who is rightly moved by the mercy of God, enters into the entire will of God." 
3. "This offering is 'holy,' morally pure over against the ceremonial purity of the Levitical offerings, as well as in opposition to the previous devotion to sin; it is 'well-pleasing to God,' as 'a savor of a sweet smell'."

### John Gill:
1. "The illative particle 'therefore', shows that the following exhortations are so many conclusions, consequences, and inferences, deduced from what had been said in the latter part of the preceding chapter."
2. "The introduction to these exhortations, is in a very kind and affectionate manner; the saints are addressed as 'brethren', and very appropriately; since this expresses the relation they stood in to the apostle, for whom he had an hearty love and concern."
3. "The presenting of them [bodies], designs a devoting of them, with all readiness and willingness, to the service of God for his honour and glory, without putting any confidence in, or placing any dependence upon them."

### John Wesley:
1. "By the tender mercies of God" - It has a reference here to the entire gospel, to the whole economy of grace or mercy, delivering us from "the wrath of God," and exciting us to all duty.

2. "To present...your bodies" - That is, yourselves; a part is put for the whole; the rather, as in the ancient sacrifices of beasts, the body was the whole.

3. "A sacrifice" - Dead to sin and living - By that life which is mentioned, Romans 1:17; 6:4, etc.
