# Romans 12:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, Paul closes his letter by urging believers to offer their entire beings as living sacrifices to God. This sanctification of life includes dedicating our bodies, practical actions, and the best affections of our hearts. Motivated by the mercies of God and the redemptive sacrifice of Jesus, we are called to present ourselves to God as living sacrifices, no longer relying on blood sacrifices. Devoting ourselves to purity and holiness, our worship becomes a rational and spiritual service pleasing and acceptable to God.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The sanctification of Christian life is to extend to that part of man’s nature which is most completely under the bondage of sin."
2. "Our great sacrifice, the Lord Jesus, having been slain for us, and by the shedding of His Blood perfect remission having been obtained, we are now enabled to be offered to God no longer by the shedding of blood, but as living sacrifices."
3. "The sacrifice of our bodies should be accompanied by the dedication of our practical activities, such as acts of charity, words of blessing, and attentive listening to divine teachings."

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "The death of the one 'Lamb of God, taking away the sin of the world,' has swept all dead victims from off the altar of God, to make room for the redeemed themselves as 'living sacrifices' to Him."
2. "Every outgoing of their grateful hearts in praise, and every act prompted by the love of Christ, is itself a sacrifice to God of a sweet-smelling savor."
3. "Believers, 'yielding themselves to God as those that are alive from the dead, and their members as instruments of righteousness unto God,' are, in His estimation, not ritually but really 'holy,' and so acceptable—'well-pleasing' unto God."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The apostle, having finished the argument of this Epistle, proceeds now to close it with a practical or hortatory application, showing its bearing on the duties of life, and the practical influence of religion."
2. "The particular mercy to which the apostle here refers, is that shown to those whom he was addressing. He had proved that all were by nature under sin; that they had no claim on God; and that he had showed great compassion in giving his Son to die for them in this state, and in pardoning their sins. This was a ground or reason why they should devote themselves to God."
3. "The sacrifice is to be free from sin. It is not to be a divided, and broken, and polluted service. It is to be with the best affections of our hearts and lives."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "By the mercies of God" - presenting the motive for obedience.
2. "Present your bodies" - the technical term for presenting offerings.
3. "Living sacrifice" - in contrast with the slain Levitical offerings.

### John Calvin:
1. "Until men really apprehend how much they owe to the mercy of God, they will never with a right feeling worship him, nor be effectually stimulated to fear and obey him."
2. "It is an indignity to God’s holiness, that anything, not first consecrated, should be offered to him."
3. "Our work is pleasing and acceptable to God when we devote ourselves to purity and holiness."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The notion that Paul would not thus exhort the Christians of a church he had not founded, is altogether unsupported."
2. "'He who is rightly moved by the mercy of God, enters into the entire will of God.'"
3. "This cannot be referred to the body as the seat of sin. It is either a designation of the entire personality, chosen to suit the figure of a sacrificial thank-offering, or the body is specially referred to as the organ of practical activity, the instrument by which the living to God is to manifest itself."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "By means of the mercies of God" as shown in his argument and in our lives. (quote 1)
2. "A living sacrifice... Not a propitiatory sacrifice, but one of praise." (quote 2)
3. "Your rational (spiritual) service (worship)." (quote 3)

### John Gill:
1. "The illative particle 'therefore', shows that the following exhortations are so many conclusions, consequences, and inferences, deduced from what had been said in the latter part of the preceding chapter."
2. "The introduction to these exhortations, is in a very kind and affectionate manner; the saints are addressed as 'brethren', and very appropriately; since this expresses the relation they stood in to the apostle, for whom he had an hearty love and concern."
3. "The presenting of them [bodies], designs a devoting of them, with all readiness and willingness, to the service of God for his honour and glory, without putting any confidence in, or placing any dependence upon them; which would be sacrificing to their own net, and burning incense to their drag."

### John Wesley:
1. "The whole sentiment is derived from Rom. i.-v. The expression itself is particularly opposed to 'the wrath of God,' Romans 1:18."
2. "To present — So Romans 6:13; 16:19; now actually to exhibit before God."
3. "A sacrifice — Dead to sin and living - By that life which is mentioned, Romans 1:17; 6:4, etc."
