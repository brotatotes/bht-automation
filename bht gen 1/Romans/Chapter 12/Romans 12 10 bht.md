# Romans 12:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In brotherly love, we are called to be tenderly affectionate and show honor to one another. This love should be characterized by kindness, like the love that exists between close family members. It encourages us to prioritize and esteem each other, valuing the good in others while being aware of our own imperfections. By treating one another with respect and showing mutual honor, we create an atmosphere of love that reflects the bonds of a united Christian family.
