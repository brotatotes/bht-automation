In whatever we do, we are called to give it our all, approaching our tasks with enthusiasm and dedication.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "In zeal (not 'business,' as E.V., which seems to refer it to the affairs of this life, whereas it relates, as all these in Romans 12:11-13, to Christian duties as such: as 'fervency of spirit,' 'acting as God's servants,' 'rejoicing in hope,' &c.) not slothful." 
2. "The Holy Spirit lights this fire within: see Luke 12:49; Matthew 3:11."
3. "The present subject is, the character of our zeal for God. In it we are not to be ὀκνηροί, but fervent in spirit, and that, as servants of God."

3. "Another reading—'serving the time,' or 'the occasion'—which differs in form but very slightly from the received reading, has been adopted by good critics [LUTHER, OLSHAUSEN, FRITZSCHE, MEYER].
