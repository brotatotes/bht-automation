### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "not slothful in business—The word rendered 'business' means 'zeal,' 'diligence,' 'purpose'; denoting the energy of action."
2. "serving the Lord—that is, the Lord Jesus."
3. "Another reading—'serving the time,' or 'the occasion'—which differs in form but very slightly from the received reading, has been adopted by good critics [LUTHER, OLSHAUSEN, FRITZSCHE, MEYER]. But as manuscript authority is decidedly against it, so is internal evidence; and comparatively few favor it. Nor is the sense which it yields a very Christian one."
