# Romans 12:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we are reminded of the radical command given by Jesus in the Sermon on the Mount to bless those who persecute us. This departure from natural human response of seeking revenge or harboring bitterness is one of the most severe and difficult duties of the Christian religion. Instead of cursing our enemies, we are called to pray for their well-being and show kindness. Through this, we align ourselves with God's heart and invite His grace and mercy to flow through us, transforming our relationships and bringing healing and restoration.
