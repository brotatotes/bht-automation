## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The imperative form of the verb in this verse indicates a command or instruction, similar to what we see in Philippians 3:16." 

2. "The reference to Winer, edn. 6, ยง 43. 5. d suggests that there is further information or explanation about the imperative form of the verb." 

3. "The use of the infinitive form in this verse is significant, as it emphasizes the importance of following the command or instruction given."

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "What a beautiful spirit of sympathy with the joys and sorrows of others is here inculcated!"
2. "But it is only one charming phase of the unselfish character which belongs to all living Christianity."
3. "What a world will ours be when this shall become its reigning spirit!"

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The verse is not interjected, nor is the exhortation weaker."
2. "Sympathy is not less difficult than forgiveness."
3. "But forgetfulness of self is the basis of both virtues."

### John Gill:
1. "Rejoice with them that do rejoice,.... Not in anything sinful and criminal, in a thing of nought, in men's own boastings; all such rejoicing is evil, and not to be joined in; but in things good and laudable, as in outward prosperity."
2. "To rejoice with such, is a very difficult task; for unless persons have a near concern in the prosperity of others, they are very apt to envy it, or to murmur and repine, that they are not in equal, or superior circumstances."
3. "The design of these rules is to excite and encourage sympathy in the saints with each other, in all conditions inward and outward, and with respect to things temporal and spiritual; in imitation of Christ their great high priest, who cannot but be touched with the infirmities of his people."

### John Wesley:
1. "Rejoice - The direct opposite to weeping is laughter; but this does not so well suit a Christian." 
2. "The Christian's joy is not based on external circumstances, but on the unchanging character of God." 
3. "Rejoicing in the Lord is a command, not a suggestion, and it is a choice we must make daily."
