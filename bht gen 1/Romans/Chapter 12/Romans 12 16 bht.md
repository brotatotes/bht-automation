## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "The feeling of the common bond which binds all Christians to each other, whatever diversity of station, cultivation, temperament, or gifts may obtain among them, is the thing here enjoined."
2. "Cherish not ambitious or aspiring purposes and desires. As this springs from selfish severance of our own interests and objects from those of our brethren, so it is quite incompatible with the spirit inculcated in the preceding clause."
3. "Be not wise in your own conceits. This is just the application of the caution against high-mindedness to the estimate we form of our own mental character."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "This precept refers to concord in feeling, though not to the exclusion of corresponding thought and endeavor."
2. "This may be taken as a general warning against ambition, or 'high things' may refer to the distinctions which arise among Christians, whether social or official, and which are so naturally sought after."
3. "Nothing destroys Christian fellowship more effectually than this conceit of wisdom."

### John Gill:
1. "Think of one another, as equally interested in the love of God, redeemed by the blood of Christ, blessed with the same spiritual blessings in him, and called in the same hope of your calling."
2. "Condescend to men of low estate or 'to low things'; be content with mean and low things in life, and disdain not to take notice of and converse with, men in a low condition."
3. "Be not wise in your own conceits; spoils a man's usefulness, prevents his improvement in knowledge, tempts him to reject all counsel and advice given him, and exposes him to the scorn and contempt of men."
