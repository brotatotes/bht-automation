3. "But when we are bidden to prepare good things before men, we must at the same time notice for what purpose: it is not indeed that men may admire and praise us, as this is a desire which Christ carefully forbids us to indulge, since he bids us to admit God alone as the witness of our good deeds, to the exclusion of all men; but that their minds being elevated to God, they may give praise to him, that by our example they may be stirred up to the practice of righteousness, that they may, in a word, perceive the good and the sweet odor of our life, by which they may be allured to the love of God."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Recompense to no man evil for evil." - The Apostle emphasizes the importance of not seeking revenge or returning evil for evil, regardless of whether the person is a Christian brother or not. This principle is clear, but the temptation to disobey is often strong.

2. "Have a care for things honorable in the sight of all men." - The phrase "in the sight of all men" should be understood as being connected with the verb, not with honorable. It means that others should see that our efforts are directed towards what is honorable, not that we are simply providing for ourselves and our families in an honest way.

3. "The care for things honorable might serve to dispossess the desire for retaliation." - The focus on pursuing what is honorable can help to overcome the desire for revenge. It is a reminder to prioritize the honor of religion and our own character, preventing us from returning evil for evil.

### John Gill:
1. "Recompence to no man evil for evil,.... Neither evil words for evil words, railing for railing; nor evil deeds for evil deeds, one ill turn for another; nor the evil of punishment for the evil of fault, unless it be by persons, who under God have an authority to inflict it; as the civil magistrate, who 'is the minister of God, a revenger to execute wrath upon him that doth evil', Romans 13:4; but private revenge is what is here forbidden."

2. "The words are not to be understood of a man's providing things honest, decent, and commendable, as suitable food and raiment for his family, in the sight of all men, to the honour of religion, and the credit of his profession, which is right to be done; but of a provident, thoughtful, and studious concern, to do everything that is laudable and of good report among men."

3. "Either restraining it to acts of beneficence, even to them that do us ill, in opposition to rendering evil to them; or applying it to all offices of humanity, and every good work, which are to be done in the sight of men; not merely to be seen of them, and in a vainglorious way, in order to obtain their esteem and applause, as did the Pharisees; but to avoid offence; to put, to silence, by well doing, the ignorance of wicked men; and to shame them that falsely accuse the good conversation of the saints; and to recommend the Gospel and true religion, and win men over to it thereby, and give an occasion to them of glorifying God."

### John Wesley:
1. "Provide - This word signifies to think beforehand, to contrive, to make provision for something. In this context, it implies that we should carefully consider our actions and words, planning ahead to give as little offense as possible to others."

2. "Think beforehand - This phrase reminds us to be intentional in our interactions with others. It encourages us to pause and reflect on how our words and actions may impact those around us, taking into consideration their feelings and sensitivities."

3. "Contrive to give as little offence as may be to any - This phrase emphasizes the importance of avoiding unnecessary offense. It encourages us to be mindful of our behavior and strive to minimize causing harm or hurt to others.
