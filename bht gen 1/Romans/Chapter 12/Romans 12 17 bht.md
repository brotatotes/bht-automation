### Philip Schaff:
1. "No man’ who injures us, whether Christian brother or one without, so in Romans 12:14. The Apostle ‘knew too well by experience that in the bosom of the Church itself one could encounter malevolence, injustice, jealousy, hate’ (Godet)."
2. "The principle is plain, but the temptation to disobey is often very strong."
3. "‘In the sight of all men’ is to be joined with the verb, not with honorable. ‘Man’s estimate of what is ‘honorable’ is not the standard; but all should see that our effort is for what is ‘honorable.’"

### John Wesley:
1. "Provide - Think beforehand; contrive to give as little offence as may be to any."
