# Romans 12:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the emphasis is on seeking and pursuing peace, to the extent that it depends on us and what proceeds from us. It is not solely about our ability to achieve peace, as it also depends on how others behave towards us. While it may not always be possible to live peaceably with everyone, our part is to actively strive for peace, both internally and in our interactions with others. This includes living peaceably in our communities and showing ourselves to be peaceful and harmonious individuals.
