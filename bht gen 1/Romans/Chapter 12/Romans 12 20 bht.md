# Romans 12:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, believers are encouraged to show kindness and provide practical assistance to their enemies. They are instructed to go beyond surface-level gestures and actually feed and nourish those in need. This act of generosity is likened to heaping burning coals on their enemies' heads, symbolizing the burning conviction and shame that may lead them to repentance. This advice, although contrary to human nature, demonstrates the transformative power of love and compassion in melting hardened hearts and fostering reconciliation.

3. "I take a simpler view, that his mind shall be turned to one side or another; for doubtless our enemy shall either be softened by our benefits, or if he be so savage that nothing can tame him, he shall yet be burnt and tormented by the testimony of his own conscience, on finding himself overwhelmed with our kindness."
