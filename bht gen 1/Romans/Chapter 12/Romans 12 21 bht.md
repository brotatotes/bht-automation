# Romans 12:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we are reminded to resist and not be provoked into revenge, for that would mean yielding to the enemy. Instead, we are called to overcome evil with good, not conforming to the ways of the world, but transforming ourselves through the truth of Jesus. This victory is not just intellectual, but a true and glorious triumph, achieved by returning good for evil and exhibiting a renewal of heart and life. By persisting in doing good and not being overcome by evil, we can overcome the evil within ourselves and in the world around us.
