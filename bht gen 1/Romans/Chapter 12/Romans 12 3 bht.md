## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "as an apostle of Jesus Christ; thus exemplifying his own precept by modestly falling back on that office which both warranted and required such plainness towards all classes."
2. "It is impossible to convey in good English the emphatic play, so to speak, which each word here has upon another: 'not to be high-minded above what he ought to be minded, but so to be minded as to be sober-minded'"
3. "Faith is here viewed as the inlet to all the other graces, and so, as the receptive faculty of the renewed soul"

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The special requirement which he is now to make serves in fact by way of confirmation to the general exhortation of Romans 12:2." (Meyer)
2. "To every man that is among you; applying the precept to each and all without exception." (Unknown)

### John Gill:
1. "By which the apostle intends, not that internal grace which was wrought in his soul; nor the Gospel of the grace of God, which he preached; nor the gifts of grace, which qualified him for that service; but the grace of apostleship, or that authoritative power, which he, as the apostle, received from Christ to say, command, give orders and instructions to churches, and particular persons."

2. "Not to think [of himself] more highly than he ought to think; that is, either not to arrogate to himself what does not belong to him, and detract from others, who may have equal, if not superior, abilities to him; or not to glory in what he has, as if he had not received it, and as if it was altogether owing to his own sagacity, penetration, diligence, and industry."

3. "Such ought to consider that what gifts, abilities, light, and knowledge they have, they have then, not of themselves, but from God; that they have not all faith, and all knowledge, or do not know the whole of the faith of the Gospel only a measure of it, which is dealt out, divided, and parted to every man, some having a greater degree of evangelical light than others; and that all have some, but none all."

### John Wesley:
1. "He now proceeds to show what that will of God is."
2. "Through the grace which is given to me."
3. "The measure of faith - Treated of in the first and following chapters, from which all other gifts and graces flow."
