# Romans 12:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this passage, the apostle emphasizes the importance of humility and sound judgment. He cautions against self-conceit and overestimating oneself, urging believers to have a balanced perspective of themselves. The standard to evaluate oneself is not based on worldly achievements or abilities, but rather on the grace of God and one's Christian character. The measure of faith plays a vital role in discerning and utilizing one's gifts and graces. Ultimately, the apostle calls for surrendering oneself to be guided by God's will and wisdom.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "I command: enforced as a command by διὰ τ. χ.… ‘by means of my apostolic office,’ of the grace conferred on me to guide and exhort the Church."
2. "A strong bringing out of the individual application of the precept."
3. "Not to be highminded, above that which he ought to be minded, but to be so minded, as to be soberminded."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "For I say—authoritatively through the grace given unto me—as an apostle of Jesus Christ; thus exemplifying his own precept by modestly falling back on that office which both warranted and required such plainness towards all classes."
2. "It is impossible to convey in good English the emphatic play, so to speak, which each word here has upon another: 'not to be high-minded above what he ought to be minded, but so to be minded as to be sober-minded.' This is merely a strong way of characterizing all undue self-elevation."
3. "Faith is here viewed as the inlet to all the other graces, and so, as the receptive faculty of the renewed soul—that is, 'as God hath given to each his particular capacity to take in the gifts and graces which He designs for the general good.'"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Not to think ... - Not to over-estimate himself, or to think more of himself than he ought to. What is the true standard by which we ought to estimate ourselves he immediately adds. This is a caution against pride; and an exhortation not to judge of ourselves by our talents, wealth, or function, but to form another standard of judging of ourselves, by our Christian character."
2. "But to think soberly - Literally, 'to think so as to act soberly or wisely.' So to estimate ourselves as to act or demean ourselves wisely, prudently, modestly. Those who over-estimate themselves are proud, haughty, foolish in their deportment. Those who think of themselves as they ought, are modest, sober, prudent."
3. "The meaning is, judge yourselves, or estimate yourselves, by your piety. The propriety of this rule is apparent: (1) Because no other standard is a correct one, or one of value. Our talent, learning, rank, or wealth, is a very improper rule by which to estimate ourselves. All may be wholly unconnected with moral worth; and the worst as well as the best people may possess them."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Not to be high-minded above what he ought to be minded, but to be minded unto the being sober-minded." 
2. "The point of the passage is a warning against an undue self-estimate, and a corresponding exhortation to estimate one's self with discrimination and sober judgment."
3. "The measure applied is distinctively a measure of faith. With faith, the believer receives a power of discernment as to the actual limitations of his gifts."

### John Calvin:
1. "I speak not of myself; but, as God’s ambassador, I bring to you the commands which he has entrusted to me."
2. "He draws us away from the investigation of those things which can bring nothing but harassment to the mind, and no edification."
3. "It is a part of our reasonable sacrifice to surrender ourselves, in a meek and teachable spirit, to be ruled and guided by God."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The special requirement which he is now to make serves in fact by way of confirmation to the general exhortation of Romans 12:2." (Meyer)
2. "To every man that is among you; applying the precept to each and all without exception." (Unknown)
3. "The aim of one’s self-knowledge should be wise discretion. Practically self-esteem leads to indiscretion." (Unknown)

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Self-conceit is here treated as a species of insanity."
2. "Each has his gift from God. There is no occasion for undue pride."
3. "To each man...emphasizes the diversity."

### John Gill:
1. "By which the apostle intends, not that internal grace which was wrought in his soul; nor the Gospel of the grace of God, which he preached; nor the gifts of grace, which qualified him for that service; but the grace of apostleship, or that authoritative power, which he, as the apostle, received from Christ to say, command, give orders and instructions to churches, and particular persons."

2. "Not to think [of himself] more highly than he ought to think; that is, either not to arrogate to himself what does not belong to him, and detract from others, who may have equal, if not superior, abilities to him; or not to glory in what he has, as if he had not received it, and as if it was altogether owing to his own sagacity, penetration, diligence, and industry."

3. "Such ought to consider that what gifts, abilities, light, and knowledge they have, they have then, not of themselves, but from God; that they have not all faith, and all knowledge, or do not know the whole of the faith of the Gospel only a measure of it, which is dealt out, divided, and parted to every man, some having a greater degree of evangelical light than others; and that all have some, but none all."

### John Wesley:
1. "He now proceeds to show what that will of God is."
2. "Through the grace which is given to me."
3. "The measure of faith - Treated of in the first and following chapters, from which all other gifts and graces flow."
