# Romans 12:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the Bible, there is a powerful analogy comparing the body of Christ to the human body. Just as the human body is made up of diverse parts, each with its own unique function, the body of Christ is composed of believers with different roles and gifts. This serves as a reminder of our interdependence and the importance of unity within the church. Each member is called to humbly embrace their individual role, recognizing the value and contribution of others. God has designed this diversity to bring about a harmonious body that glorifies Him.

1. "The same diversity and yet unity obtains in the body of Christ, whereof all believers are the several members, as in the natural body."
2. "Just as the human body is made up of many different parts, each with its own unique function, so too is the body of Christ composed of many believers, each with their own unique role to play."
3. "This analogy reminds us that we are all interconnected and dependent on one another, just as the various parts of the body rely on each other for proper functioning."

### Albert Barnes:

2. "To produce proper humility, he shows them that God has appointed certain orders or grades in the church; that all are useful in their proper place."
3. "The church is one body, consisting of many members, and each is suited to be useful and comely in its proper place."

### John Calvin:
1. "We are called for this end, that we may unite together in one body, since Christ has ordained a fellowship and connection between the faithful similar to that which exists between the members of the human body."
2. "By applying this similitude he proves how necessary it is for each to consider what is suitable to his own nature, capacity, and vocation."
3. "God has distributed various gifts to us, by which diversity he has determined the order which he would have to be observed among us, so that every one is to conduct himself according to the measure of his capacity, and not to thrust himself into what peculiarly belongs to others."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The parallel here set forth (Romans 12:4-5) is more fully carried out in 1 Corinthians 12:12, etc." 
2. "In Ephesians (throughout) the unity is emphasized, here the variety."
3. "This variety is introduced as an explanation of the variety in the measure of faith, and hence as a motive for the humility enjoined."

### John Gill:
1. "The apostle illustrates what he said last concerning God's dealing to every man the measure of faith, by comparing the church of Christ to a human body, which is but one, and has many members in union with it, and one another."
2. "All members have not the same office, or 'action'; they do not exercise the same function, and perform the same operation, but each that which is peculiar to itself."
3. "The eye only sees, but does not hear, nor taste, nor smell; the ear only hears, but neither sees, or does any of the aforesaid things; the palate tastes, the nose smells, the hand handles, the foot walks, and the same may be observed of the other members of the body, which have not the same, but their particular offices, and all and each of them their usefulness."
