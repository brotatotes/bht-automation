# Romans 12:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Believers, though individually numerous, are intricately united as one body in Christ. This collective body, comprising the chosen, redeemed, justified, and sanctified, represents the church, with Christ as its head. Each diverse community is a part of this body, joined together under Christ's leadership. As members of this body, believers are called to support and encourage one another, fostering a spirit of unity and fellowship.
