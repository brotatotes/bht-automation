# Romans 12:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the Bible, believers are blessed with different gifts, all of which are expressions of God's grace. The role of prophets is not limited to predicting future events, but to deliver divine authority and guidance through warnings, exhortations, and instruction. These gifts, including prophecy, are not meant to inflate pride but to be used in accordance with the measure of faith given by God. By interpreting Scripture in light of the overarching truths it conveys, we can prophesy in line with the analogy of faith.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "All the gifts of believers alike are viewed as communications of mere grace."
2. "Anyone speaking with divine authority—whether with reference to the past, the present, or the future—was termed a prophet."
3. "They are not to be puffed up on account of them, but to use them purely for their proper ends."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "In the New Testament, as in the Old, the prominent idea is not prediction, but the inspired delivery of warning, exhortation, instruction, judging, and making manifest the secrets of the heart." 
2. "The New - Testament prophets are distinguished from teachers, by speaking under direct divine inspiration."
3. "The phrase here is related to the measure of faith. It signifies, according to the proportion defined by faith."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The 'charisms' are different, but all having one origin, according to the grace that was given to us." 
2. "In the Bible 'prophecy' on the one hand, includes more than the prediction of future events, it is a speaking for God not merely beforehand; on the other hand, it is not identical with preaching."
3. "The entire phrase, with which 'let us prophesy' is properly supplied, is equivalent to 'the measure of faith.' This view is favored by the context, 'which aims at showing that the measure of faith, itself the gift of God, is the receptive faculty for all spiritual gifts, which are therefore not to be boasted of, nor pushed beyond their provinces, but humbly exercised within their own limits'."

### John Wesley:
1. "Gifts are various: grace is one."
2. "Let us prophesy according to the analogy of faith."
3. "Every doubtful scripture interpreted according to the grand truths which run through the whole."
