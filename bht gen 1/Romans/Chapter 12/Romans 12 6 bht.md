# Romans 12:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this descriptive passage, we explore a Bible verse with insights from commentators. The verse emphasizes the diverse gifts and graces bestowed upon believers by God. These gifts, though varying in nature and intensity, are not to be seen as fruits of human effort but rather as expressions of God's grace. The importance lies in using these gifts within their appropriate sphere, understanding the measure of one's own faith, and interpreting Scripture in alignment with the overarching principles of the faith. Consequently, this verse calls for humility and the mutual sharing of God-given gifts within the body of Christ.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The two first accusatives are grammatically dependent on ἔχοντες: by degrees the Apostle loses sight of the construction, and continues with the concrete ὁ διδάσκων, which still he binds on to the foregoing by εἴτε, but at ὁ μεταδιδούς, omits this also, and, at Romans 12:9, introduces the abstract ἡ ἀγάπη." 
2. "This construction must however be dropped at ἐν ἁπλότητι, which is manifestly to be rendered with a verb supplied: and (2) it reduces the four first mentioned gifts to a bare catalogue, and deprives the passage of its aim, which is to keep each member of the body in its true place and work without any member boasting against another."
3. "The comparison of μέτρον πιστεως above, and the whole context, determine it to be the latter; the measure of our faith: 'quisque se intra sortis suæ metas contineat, et revelationis suæ modum teneat, ne unus sibi omnia scire videatur.'"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "All the gifts of believers alike are viewed as communications of mere grace."
2. "Anyone speaking with divine authority—whether with reference to the past, the present, or the future—was termed a prophet."
3. "They are not to be puffed up on account of them, but to use them purely for their proper ends."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "All the endowments which Christians have are regarded by the apostle as gifts. God has conferred them; and this fact, when properly felt, tends much to prevent our thinking of ourselves more highly than we ought to think."
2. "It was never designed that all Christians should be equal. God designed that people should have different endowments. The very nature of society supposes this."
3. "True honor consists not in splendid endowments, or great wealth and function. It consists in rightly discharging the duties which God requires of us in our appropriate sphere."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The prominent idea is not prediction, but the inspired delivery of warning, exhortation, instruction, judging, and making manifest the secrets of the heart."
2. "The New - Testament prophets are distinguished from teachers, by speaking under direct divine inspiration."
3. "The phrase here is related to the measure of faith (ver. 3). It signifies, according to the proportion defined by faith."

### John Calvin:
1. "Every one desires to have so much himself, so as not to need any help from others; but the bond of mutual communication is this, that no one has sufficient for himself, but is constrained to borrow from others."
2. "By this most beautiful order, and as it were symmetry, is the safety of the Church indeed preserved; that is, when every one imparts to all in common what he has received from the Lord, in such a way as not to impede others."
3. "Let him who excels in teaching know that the end is, that the Church may be really instructed; and let him study this one thing, that he may render the Church more informed by his teaching: for a teacher is he who forms and builds the Church by the word of truth."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The 'charisms' are different, but all having one origin, according to the grace that was given to us." 
2. "In the Bible 'prophecy' on the one hand, includes more than the prediction of future events, it is a speaking for God not merely beforehand; on the other hand, it is not identical with preaching."
3. "The entire phrase, with which 'let us prophesy' is properly supplied, is equivalent to 'the measure of faith.' This view is favored by the context, 'which aims at showing that the measure of faith, itself the gift of God, is the receptive faculty for all spiritual gifts, which are therefore not to be boasted of, nor pushed beyond their provinces, but humbly exercised within their own limits'."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "According to the proportion of our faith" - This phrase suggests that the measure of our faith determines the extent to which we experience the benefits and blessings of God's promises.
2. "The measure of faith" - This phrase implies that faith is not a one-size-fits-all concept, but rather varies in intensity and depth from person to person.
3. "The subjective meaning of 'faith'" - This highlights that faith is not merely an outward standard or set of beliefs, but a personal and inward conviction that shapes our actions and attitudes.

### John Gill:
1. "As in a natural body, the various members of it have not the same office, and do not perform the same actions, thus they have not the same, but different faculties."
2. "For all these gifts are not the effects of nature, the fruits of human power, diligence, and industry, but flow from the grace of God."
3. "A Gospel minister ought not to be a sceptic, or in doubt about the main principles of religion; such as concern the three divine persons, the office, grace, and righteousness of Christ, and the way of salvation by him."

### John Wesley:
1. "Gifts are various: grace is one."
2. "Let us prophesy according to the analogy of faith."
3. "Every doubtful scripture interpreted according to the grand truths which run through the whole."
