## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "The word here used imports any kind of service, from the dispensing of the word of life to the administering of the temporal affairs of the Church."
2. "Teachers are expressly distinguished from prophets, and put after them, as exercising a lower function."
3. "Probably it consisted mainly in opening up the evangelical bearings of Old Testament Scripture; and it was in this department apparently that Apollos showed his power and eloquence."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Ministering [διακονια] . Let us wait on is supplied. Lit., or ministry in our ministry. The word appears in the New Testament always in connection with the service of the Christian Church, except Luke 10:40, of Martha 's serving; Hebrews 1:14, of the ministry of angels, and 2 Corinthians 3:7, of the ministry of Moses."
2. "Within this limit it is used, 1. Of service in general, including all forms of christian ministration tending to the good of the christian body (1 Corinthians 12:5; Ephesians 4:13; 2 Timothy 4:11). Hence, 2. Of the apostolic office and its administration; (a) generally (Acts 20:24; 2 Corinthians 4:1; 1 Timothy 1:12); or (b) defined as a ministry of reconciliation, of the word, of the Spirit, of righteousness (2 Corinthians 5:18; Acts 6:4; 2 Corinthians 3:8, 2 Corinthians 3:9)."
3. "As the word is employed in connection with both the higher and lower ministrations in the Church (see Acts 6:1, Acts 6:4), it is difficult to fix its precise meaning here; yet as it is distinguished here from prophecy, exhortation, and teaching, it may refer to some more practical, and, possibly, minor form of ministry."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The usual view refers it to the diaconate (which the Greek term may mean), namely, the gift of oversight of the external affairs of the church."
2. "Let us wait on our ministry, lit., 'in the ministry,' just spoken of. We might supply, 'let us be,' since the exhortation means let us render service in our appointed sphere, therein 'be instant' (comp. 1 Timothy 4:15)."
3. "This refers to the gift of teaching by ordinary methods and need not be limited to any special office. Paul was himself a teacher. This gift is a permanent one, and cannot be too highly prized; the danger now as then, is the possessor's mistaking his gift, or stepping outside of it to exercise functions for which he is not adapted."

### John Gill:
1. "The word 'diakonia' sometimes signifies the whole ecclesiastical ministry, even the office of apostleship, as well as the ordinary ministration of the Gospel." 
2. "The office of ministering to the poor saints should be used, exercised, and attended to with diligence, care, and constancy."
3. "The gift of prophesying or preaching is subdivided into 'teaching' and 'exhorting'; the one belongs to 'teachers' or doctors, the other to 'pastors'."
