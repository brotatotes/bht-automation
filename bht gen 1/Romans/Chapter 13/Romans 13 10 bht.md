# Romans 13:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Love, which is the fulfilling of the law, is an all-encompassing principle that guides our actions towards our neighbors. It not only prohibits us from doing harm but also motivates us to do good. Love serves as a powerful force that restrains us from engaging in sinful behavior and instead propels us towards acts of kindness and compassion. By embodying love, we find fulfillment in both refraining from evil and actively seeking opportunities to promote the well-being of others.
