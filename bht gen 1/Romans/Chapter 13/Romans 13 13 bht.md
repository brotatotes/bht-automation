2. "The word refers more particularly to the outward life, and thus accords with walk, and in the day the time of observation."
3. "All these three are plural: riotings, drunkennesses, wantonnesses."

### John Calvin:
1. "If these have in them so much filthiness, that even carnal men are ashamed to commit them before the eyes of men, it behooves us, who are in the light of God, at all times to abstain from them; yea, even when we are withdrawn from the presence of men."
2. "As to the third vice, though contention is put before envying, there is yet no doubt but that Paul intended to remind us, that strifes and contests arise from this fountain; for when any one seeks to excel, there is envying of one another; but ambition is the source of both evils."
3. "Revelling is first mentioned, though drunkenness goes before it; and 'chambering,' or concubinage, or indulgence in unlawful lusts is first stated, though lasciviousness or wantonness is the source from which it proceeds."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Let us walk seemly, as in the day. Both 'honestly' (E. V.) and 'decently' (E. V. margin) are too limited, the reference being to decorum, such as befits the day when conduct is open to observation."
2. "Not in rioting and drunkenness. The former refers to nocturnal revels, and was probably suggested by the figures of 'night' and 'day;' the latter means drunken carousals; both are plural in the original."

2. "Banqueting is not just about satisfying physical hunger, but it also symbolizes a spiritual feast. It represents the soul being nourished and satisfied by the goodness and grace of God. It is a reminder that God not only meets our physical needs but also satisfies the deepest longings of our hearts."

3. "The concept of banqueting also suggests a sense of community and fellowship. It speaks to the joy of sharing a meal with others, of coming together in unity and love.
