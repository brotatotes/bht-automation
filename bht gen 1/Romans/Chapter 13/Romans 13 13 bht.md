## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Let us walk honestly—'becomingly,' 'seemingly' as in the day—'Men choose the night for their revels, but our night is past, for we are all the children of the light and of the day: let us therefore only do what is fit to be exposed to the light of such a day.'" 
2. "Not in rioting and drunkenness—varied forms of intemperance; denoting revels in general, usually ending in intoxication." 
3. "Not in chambering and wantonness—varied forms of impurity; the one pointing to definite acts, the other more general." 
4. "Not in strife and envying—varied forms of that venomous feeling between man and man which reverses the law of love."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Honest is originally honorable, and so here."
2. "The word refers more particularly to the outward life, and thus accords with walk, and in the day the time of observation."
3. "All these three are plural: riotings, drunkennesses, wantonnesses."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Let us walk seemly, as in the day. Both 'honestly' (E. V.) and 'decently' (E. V. margin) are too limited, the reference being to decorum, such as befits the day when conduct is open to observation."
2. "Not in rioting and drunkenness. The former refers to nocturnal revels, and was probably suggested by the figures of 'night' and 'day;' the latter means drunken carousals; both are plural in the original."
3. "Not in chambering and wantonness. Various forms of secret vice are here indicated by the plural. These sins are closely connected with the preceding, often caused by them. It points to an abandoned sensuality."

### John Gill:
1. "Being under the day of the Gospel dispensation, and the day of grace having dawned, and the daystar of spiritual light and knowledge being risen in our hearts, and we being exposed to the view of all men in broad daylight, ought not to lie down and sleep, but to arise and be active, and walk decently with the armour of light on us, as becomes the Gospel of Christ."
2. "Not in rioting; the Syriac and Arabic versions read, 'in singing', or 'songs'; meaning lewd ones, sung at riotous feasts and banquets, made not for refreshment, but for pleasure and debauchery."
3. "Not in chambering; in unlawful copulations, fornication, adultery, and all the defilements of the bed: and wantonness; lasciviousness, unnatural lusts, as sodomy."

### John Wesley:
1. "The concept of banqueting in this verse conveys the idea of indulgence and extravagance, suggesting a lavish and opulent feast."
2. "The use of the term banqueting in this context implies a sense of abundance and excess, highlighting the luxurious and extravagant nature of the feast."
3. "The mention of banqueting in this verse suggests a celebration characterized by sumptuous food, fine wines, and a grand display of wealth and opulence."
