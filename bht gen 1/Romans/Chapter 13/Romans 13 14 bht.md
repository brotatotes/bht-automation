# Romans 13:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Putting on the Lord Jesus Christ involves a transformative union with Him, where His virtues and graces become our own. It goes beyond imitation, as we are adorned with His divine qualities. This act encompasses purity, sobriety, peacefulness, benevolence, and more, representing the entirety of our salvation and our commitment to imitate Christ in all aspects of life. We are called to be a reflection of Christ to the world, with Him seen in us.

1. "Put ye on the Lord Jesus Christâ€”in such wise that Christ only may be seen in you."
2. "Direct none of your attention to the cravings of your corrupt nature, how you may provide for their gratification."
3. "Christianity is the grand specific for the purification and elevation of all the social relations; inspiring a readiness to discharge all obligations, and most of all, implanting in its disciples that love which secures all men against injury from them, inasmuch as it is the fulfilling of the law."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "In both cases vital fellowship is meant, but each step in the growing conformity to Christ is a new putting on of Him, so that we present Him, not ourselves, in our conduct."
2. "Make no provision whatever for the flesh (the depraved nature), so as to fulfill its lusts, and also because such provision would fulfill them."

### John Gill:
1. "The righteousness of Christ is compared to a garment, it is the best robe, it is fine linen, clean and white, and change of raiment; which being put on by the Father's gracious act of imputation, covers the sins and deformities of his people, defends them from divine justice, secures them from wrath to come, and renders them beautiful and acceptable in his sight."
2. "To put on Christ... is not only to exercise faith on him as the Lord our righteousness, and to make a profession of his name, but to imitate him in the exercise of grace and discharge of duty; to walk as he walked, and as we have him for an example, in love, meekness, patience, humility, and holiness."
3. "We should not provide, or be caterers for the flesh; and, by pampering it, stir up and satisfy its corrupt inclinations and desires."
