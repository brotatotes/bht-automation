# Romans 13:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Resisting the authority of the government is seen as resisting God's ordained authority, as it goes against the will and appointment of God. While magistrates are not above the law, resistance is justified only when they abuse their power and act against the laws of God and the land. The consequences of resisting lawful authority can result in temporal or eternal punishment, highlighting the need to respect and obey the established authorities and follow the laws of the community.
