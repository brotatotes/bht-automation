# Romans 13:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Resisting the authority and power established by God is equivalent to opposing His divine order. Such opposition not only invites punishment and condemnation from earthly authorities but also from God Himself. The consequences of resisting authority extend beyond temporal consequences, and disobedience to the ordinances of God may lead to both temporal and eternal punishment. It is important to recognize the divine origin and significance of government authority and submit to it, for opposing it means setting oneself against God's ordained order.
