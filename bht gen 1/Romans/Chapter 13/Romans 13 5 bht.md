# Romans 13:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The command to be subject to authority is not merely driven by fear of punishment, but also by a recognition of God's ordained ordinance and a moral duty to uphold principles of justice. The urgency and obligation of this command are emphasized, leaving no other option but to fulfill it. Obedience is not solely based on external rules, but also on an internal moral compass and a sense of what is right. It is motivated by a desire to keep one's conscience clear, align with God's will, and exercise obedience out of a genuine faith and reverence for God.
