# Romans 13:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
We are called to fulfill our obligation of love, which is a debt that can never be fully paid. Love encompasses all the commandments, as it is the essence of the law itself. This love extends to all people, not just our family or friends, but even to our enemies and strangers. When we love others as ourselves, we have fulfilled the entire law, demonstrating our devotion to God and our fellow human beings.

2. "Love is a debt we owe to every man, as a man, being all made of one blood, and in the image of God; so that not only such as are of the same family, live in the same neighbourhood, and belong to the same nation, but even all the individuals of mankind, yea, our very enemies are to share in our love."
3. "For he that loveth another hath fulfilled the law; that is, not who loves some one particular person, but every other person besides himself, even his neighbour, in the largest sense of the word, including all mankind, and that as himself; such an one has fulfilled the law, the law of the decalogue."
