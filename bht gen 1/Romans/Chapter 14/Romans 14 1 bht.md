# Romans 14:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, the weak in faith refers to those who lack firmness and breadth in their belief, with small scruples causing doubt. We are called to receive them with open arms, welcoming them into Christian fellowship and treating them as equals. Instead of arguing or criticizing their doubts, we should draw them closer, building brotherly trust and fostering an exchange of Christian affection. This passage emphasizes the importance of accepting and supporting those who may struggle with their faith, rather than engaging in divisive debates.

1. "Him that is weak in the faith... not 'him that is weak in the truth believed'... but 'him whose faith wants that firmness and breadth which would raise him above small scruples.'" 
2. "Receive ye... to cordial Christian fellowship." 
3. "Not to the deciding of doubts... not for the purpose of arguing him out of them... to receive him to full brotherly confidence and cordial interchange of Christian affection is the most effectual way of drawing them off."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The phrase might be rendered 'weak in faith,' or even, 'in his faith,' since faith in Christ is meant, not Christian doctrine, or moral conviction, or knowledge."
