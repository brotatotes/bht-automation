# Romans 14:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, we are advised to be compassionate towards those who may have different beliefs or weaker faith. Rather than harboring intolerance or judgment, we should embrace them as part of our Christian community. It is important to receive them with kindness, understanding, and patience, seeking to build them up in their faith rather than engaging in contentious debates. By doing so, we foster an environment of love and unity among believers.

2. "The Gentiles were apt to boast against, and look with some contempt upon the Jews, and were ready to object to their communion, because of their want of light and knowledge in these matters; but this was no bar of communion, nor ought a person to be rejected on account of his weakness, either in the grace, or in the doctrine of faith, when it appears he has the true grace of God."

3. "Since Christ does not break the bruised reed, nor quench the smoking flax, nor despise the day of small things, churches should not: it may also intend a receiving of such into intimate conversation, at their private meetings and conferences; taking particular notice of them; giving them proper instructions; praying with them and for them; endeavoring to build them up in their most holy faith, and to bring them into the knowledge of those things they are weak in; bearing their weaknesses patiently, and bearing with them in great tenderness."
