# Romans 14:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we are reminded of our individual accountability to God. The emphasis is on not judging one another, but on examining ourselves, as Christ is the absolute Master and Judge. Every work and purpose will be brought forth and tried by the unerring standard of justice in the fearful arraignment of the last judgment. It is a call to humility and self-examination, recognizing that we will all stand before the judgment-seat of God.
