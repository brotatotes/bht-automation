# Romans 14:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the commentators shed light on the perspective of the author, who is confidently convinced by the Lord Jesus that nothing is inherently impure or unclean. They explain that this understanding challenges the ritual distinctions emphasized by the Jews and ascetics. While recognizing the freedom in the Gospel, the practical application is guided by love and respect for others' convictions. This verse emphasizes the importance of not judging or imposing personal preferences on matters of food or practices.
