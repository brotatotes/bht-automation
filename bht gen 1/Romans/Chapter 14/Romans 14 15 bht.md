## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "The word 'meat' is purposely selected as something contemptible in contrast with the tremendous risk run for its sake."
2. "The worth of even the poorest and weakest brother cannot be more emphatically expressed than by the words, 'for whom Christ died.'"
3. "Whatever tends to make anyone violate his conscience tends to the destruction of his soul; and he who helps, whether wittingly or no, to bring about the one is guilty of aiding to accomplish the other."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Love limits liberty, and substitutes for it self-denial, even when the scruple is an incorrect one."
2. "The weak brother may be so influenced as to act against his conscience, and so sin as to fall into eternal destruction."
3. "If Christ gave up life for him, canst not thou give up a kind of food for him."

### John Gill:
1. "If a brother should be grieved by it, that is, either should be concerned and troubled at it inwardly, both because the person that eats is thought by him to have transgressed a command of God, and because he himself is not only despised as a weak brother, but as if he was a 'judaizing' Christian, and walked not uprightly, according to the truth of the Gospel." 
2. "This is a breach of the rule of charity or brotherly love; such an one is a brother, and though a weak one, yet he is to be loved as a brother, and to be charitably walked with: true charity, or love, vaunts not itself over, nor is it puffed up against a weak brother; nor is it unconcerned for his peace, but bears with his weaknesses, and forbears the use of things grieving to him."
3. "This is to be understood of the destruction of such a man's peace and comfort, which is signified by grieving, stumbling, offending, and making him weak; and the words are a fresh reason, why they that are strong in the faith of Christian liberty, should nevertheless forbear the use of it, to preserve the peace of a weak brother."

### John Wesley:
1. "If thy brother is grieved - That is, wounded, led into sin." 
2. "Destroy not him for whom Christ died - So we see, he for whom Christ died may be destroyed." 
3. "With thy meat - Do not value thy meat more than Christ valued his life."
