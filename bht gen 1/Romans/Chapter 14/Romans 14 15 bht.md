# Romans 14:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, we learn about the importance of love and consideration for our brothers and sisters. The verse reminds us that causing grief or offense to our fellow believers is contrary to love. It emphasizes that even the weakest and humblest among us, for whom Christ sacrificed Himself, should not be destroyed or harmed by our actions. The verse also encourages us to prioritize the well-being and happiness of others over our own personal liberties and desires.

3. "‘Ne pluris feceris tuum cibum, quam Christus vitam suam.’ Bengel."

### John Gill:
1. "if a brother should be grieved by it, that is, either should be concerned and troubled at it inwardly, both because the person that eats is thought by him to have transgressed a command of God, and because he himself is not only despised as a weak brother, but as if he was a 'judaizing' Christian, and walked not uprightly, according to the truth of the Gospel"
2. "this is a breach of the rule of charity or brotherly love; such an one is a brother, and though a weak one, yet he is to be loved as a brother, and to be charitably walked with: true charity, or love, vaunts not itself over, nor is it puffed up against a weak brother; nor is it unconcerned for his peace, but bears with his weaknesses, and forbears the use of things grieving to him"
3. "This is to be understood, not of eternal destruction, that can never be thought to be either in the will or power of any man; such a degree of malice can never arise in the heart of any, to wish for, desire, or take any step towards the eternal damnation of another"

### John Wesley:
1. "If thy brother is grieved — That is, wounded, led into sin."
2. "Destroy not him for whom Christ died — So we see, he for whom Christ died may be destroyed."
3. "Do not value thy meat more than Christ valued his life."
