# Romans 14:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, commentators elaborate on the concept of the "kingdom of God." They emphasize that this kingdom is not about external rituals or worldly possessions, but rather about the reign of God in the heart. It is a present spiritual kingdom, where righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit are paramount. This kingdom is not attained through external factors like food and drink, but through spiritual qualities and graces. It is about true holiness, peace of conscience, and the Gospel's message of righteousness, peace, and love.

### John Gill:
1. "Neither the kingdom of glory, nor the ultimate glory and happiness of the saints in the other world, is attained to by any such things; for neither eating and drinking, nor not eating and drinking, can recommend to the divine favour, or give a meetness for heaven." 
2. "The kingdom of grace, or the governing principle of grace in the soul, and which is of God's implanting there, lies in righteousness and true holiness, in which the new man is created; in truth and uprightness in the inward parts, where the laws of God are put and written; and in peace of conscience, arising from the blood and righteousness of Christ."
3. "The Gospel, which gives an account both of the kingdom of grace and of glory, reveals the righteousness of Christ, and teaches men to live soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present evil world: it is a publication of peace by the blood of Christ; it calls men to peace, to cultivate peace one among another, and to seek those things which make for it."
