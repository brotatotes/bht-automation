# Romans 14:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Bible verse emphasizes that the kingdom of God is not dependent on material things like food and drink, nor external observances. Instead, it is found in spiritual qualities such as righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost. This spiritual kingdom is governed by God and manifested in the hearts of believers. It involves living righteously, cultivating peace, and experiencing the joy that comes from a deep connection with God and others.

"The kingdom of grace, or the governing principle of grace in the soul, and which is of God's implanting there, lies in righteousness and true holiness, in which the new man is created; in truth and uprightness in the inward parts, where the laws of God are put and written; and in peace of conscience, arising from the blood and righteousness of Christ."
3. "The Gospel, which gives an account both of the kingdom of grace and of glory, reveals the righteousness of Christ, and teaches men to live soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present evil world: it is a publication of peace by the blood of Christ; it calls men to peace, to cultivate peace one among another, and to seek those things which make for it; and when it comes in power, is attended with joy in the Holy Ghost."
