# Romans 14:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, Christians are described as a building of God's raising, a workmanship created by God. The verse emphasizes the importance of not causing offense to fellow believers, specifically weaker brothers, as this can hinder the work of God. While all things are pure, it is considered evil to partake in something that may cause a stumbling block for others. It is crucial for the stronger believers to be cautious with their actions, ensuring they do not destroy the work of God or lead others astray.
