## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Let not him that eateth despise—look down superciliously upon 'him that eateth not.'" 
2. "Let not him that eateth not judge—sit in judgment censoriously upon 'him that eateth.'" 
3. "For God hath received him—as one of His dear children, who in this matter acts not from laxity, but religious principle."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The self-consciousness of strength misleads into looking down with contempt on the weak." 
2. "The weak brother fails to comprehend the liberty of the stronger one; his misjudgment leads to false judgment, namely, in condemning the person whose conduct he fails to reconcile with the scruples of his weak faith."
3. "This clause gives a reason for not judging, though some would prefer it to both the preceding prohibitions. But it is far more pertinent to the weak brethren, since they are apt to excommunicate, withdraw from fellowship on trivial grounds of external observance, thus rejecting him whom God received."

### John Gill:
1. "Such who had a greater degree of Gospel light and knowledge... were not to despise... such as abstained therefrom on account of the ceremonial law... but, on the other hand, were to consider them as brethren in Christ." 

2. "Those who used their liberty... were not to censure and condemn... but leave them to the last and righteous judgment... for God hath received him." 

3. "God had received both the one and the other into his heart's love and affection, into the covenant of grace, and into his family by adoption."

### John Wesley:
1. "Despise him that eateth not" - The commentary suggests that we should not look down on those who have different dietary practices or restrictions. We should not judge or criticize them for being overly cautious or superstitious in their choices.

2. "Judge him that eateth" - The commentary highlights that we should also refrain from judging those who have more liberal or relaxed dietary habits. We should not view them as profane or disrespectful, but rather recognize that they may have different perspectives and understandings.

3. "For God hath received him" - The commentary emphasizes that despite these differences, God has accepted both the one who eats and the one who abstains. God sees beyond our external practices and embraces us as His children, regardless of our individual choices.
