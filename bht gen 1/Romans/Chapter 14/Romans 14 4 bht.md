# Romans 14:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we are reminded that as followers of Christ, we should refrain from judging or criticizing others. It is not our place to pass judgment on the actions of fellow believers, as each of us is accountable to our own master. Instead, we should focus on our own actions and trust in God's ability to uphold and strengthen His servants. By maintaining unity and fellowship within the Church, we can support and encourage one another in our journey of faith, knowing that God will ensure the perseverance of those He loves.
