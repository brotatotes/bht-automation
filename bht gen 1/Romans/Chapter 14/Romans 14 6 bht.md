1. "He that regardeth the day, regardeth it to the Lord—the Lord CHRIST, as before." 
2. "He that eateth not, to the Lord he eateth not, and giveth God thanks." 
3. "Certainly it could not, if the sabbath were merely one of the Jewish festival days; but it will not do to take this for granted merely because it was observed under the Mosaic economy."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The verse emphasizes the importance of paying attention to instruction or correction. It implies that those who ignore or disregard it will suffer the consequences."
2. "The phrase 'he that regardeth not' suggests a deliberate choice to neglect or dismiss the instruction being given. It highlights the responsibility of the individual to actively engage with wisdom and guidance."
3. "By omitting the instruction, one not only misses out on the potential benefits and growth but also exposes themselves to the potential dangers and pitfalls that could have been avoided."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "He that regardeth the day, regardeth it unto the Lord." - Meyer
2. "The presence of the Fourth Commandment in the Decalogue, the recognition (and explanation) of the obligation to keep the Sabbath by our Lord, as well as the relation of the law to the Christian life, suggest for the observance of the Lord's day a higher sanction than is afforded by 'considerations of humanity and religious expediency' or by ecclesiastical enactment." - Godet
3. "And he that eateth, eateth unto the Lord, for he giveth thanks unto God, etc." - Commentary

### John Gill:
1. "The weak brother that esteems one day above another, and regards the passover, pentecost, and feast of tabernacles, a new moon, or a seventh day sabbath, does it in obedience to the commands of the Lord, which he thinks are still binding, not knowing that they are disannulled by Christ." 
2. "To regard the days of the feast of tabernacles, is tacitly to say, that the Word has not tabernacled among us; and to observe the days of the passover, is virtually to deny that our passover is sacrificed for us; and to keep the day of Pentecost, is all one as to affirm, that the firstfruits of the Spirit have not been given."
3. "The man that is strong in faith, and is fully persuaded by the Lord Jesus that all distinction of meats, as of days, is ceased, eats any thing, and every sort of food, that comes in his way, without making any difference; and when he eats or drinks at any time, it is all to the glory of God; which is a clear case, by his giving God thanks, as becomes him, for the food he eats."

### John Wesley:
1. "Regardeth it to the Lord" - This phrase emphasizes the importance of acting out of a sense of duty and reverence towards God, rather than personal preference or societal pressure.
2. "To the Lord he doth not regard it" - This highlights the consistency of one's actions when they are driven by a genuine conviction and commitment to God, regardless of external influences.
3. "Giveth God thanks" - This reminds us of the gratitude we should have towards God for providing us with sustenance, whether it be through meat or vegetables. It encourages us to acknowledge and appreciate God's blessings in our lives.
