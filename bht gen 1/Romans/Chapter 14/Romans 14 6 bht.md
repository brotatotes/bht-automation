## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The words in brackets were probably omitted from the similar ending φρονεῖ of both clauses having misled some early copyists; but perhaps it may have been intentionally done, after the observation of the Lord’s Day came to be regarded as binding."
2. "φρονῶν, taking account of, 'regarding.'"
3. "εὐχαριστεῖ, adduced as a practice of both parties, shews the universality among the early Christians of thanking God at meals: see 1 Timothy 4:3-4. The εὐχαριστία of the μὴ ἐσθίων was over his 'dinner of herbs.'"
4. "κυρίῳ is CHRIST."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "He that regardeth the day, regardeth it to the Lord—the Lord CHRIST, as before." 
2. "He that earth, eateth to the Lord, for he giveth God thanks; and he that eateth not, to the Lord he eateth not, and giveth God thanks." 
3. "Certainly it could not, if the sabbath were merely one of the Jewish festival days; but it will not do to take this for granted merely because it was observed under the Mosaic economy."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He that regardeth it as 'holy,' or as set apart to the service of God."
2. "The Gentile Christian, who freely eats all kinds of meat, because he believes that God does not forbid it."
3. "He abstains from eating because he believes that God requires him to do it, and with a desire to obey and honor him."

### Marvin Vincent:
I apologize for the confusion, but I am unable to receive or process messages. However, if you provide the commentary in your response, I will be able to assist you in extracting the best parts.

### John Calvin:
1. "He who regarded days committed no sin; for nothing but good can be accepted by God."
2. "He who refrained from unclean meats...will thus give thanks to God; which he could not do, except he was persuaded that he is fed by God’s kindness."
3. "There is nothing more fitted to restrain licentiousness in judging and to correct superstitions, than to be summoned before the tribunal of God."

Note: The commentary does not provide a clear and concise explanation of the Bible verse, but rather offers various interpretations and insights into the topic of observing days and refraining from certain foods.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "He that regardeth the day, regardeth it unto the Lord." - Meyer
2. "The presence of the Fourth Commandment in the Decalogue, the recognition (and explanation) of the obligation to keep the Sabbath by our Lord, as well as the relation of the law to the Christian life, suggest for the observance of the Lord’s day a higher sanction than is afforded by ‘considerations of humanity and religious expediency’ or by ecclesiastical enactment." - Godet
3. "And he that eateth, eateth unto the Lord, for he giveth thanks unto God, etc."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Paul's principle of freedom in non-essentials is most important."
2. "The Jewish Christians still observed the Seventh day (the Sabbath). The Gentile Christians were observing the first day of the week in honour of Christ's Resurrection on that day."
3. "Paul pleads for liberty."

### John Gill:
1. "The weak brother that esteems one day above another, and regards the passover, pentecost, and feast of tabernacles, a new moon, or a seventh day sabbath, does it in obedience to the commands of the Lord, which he thinks are still binding, not knowing that they are disannulled by Christ." 
2. "To regard the days of the feast of tabernacles, is tacitly to say, that the Word has not tabernacled among us; and to observe the days of the passover, is virtually to deny that our passover is sacrificed for us; and to keep the day of Pentecost, is all one as to affirm, that the firstfruits of the Spirit have not been given." 
3. "The man that is strong in faith, and is fully persuaded by the Lord Jesus that all distinction of meats, as of days, is ceased, eats any thing, and every sort of food, that comes in his way, without making any difference; and when he eats or drinks at any time, it is all to the glory of God; which is a clear case, by his giving God thanks."

### John Wesley:
1. "Regardeth it to the Lord" - This phrase highlights the importance of acting out of a sense of duty and reverence towards God, rather than simply following personal desires or societal norms.
2. "To the Lord he doth not regard it" - This emphasizes that one's actions should be guided by a genuine commitment to God, rather than being influenced by external pressures or opinions.
3. "Giveth God thanks" - This reminds us of the importance of expressing gratitude to God for all things, even the simplest and most basic provisions like herbs. It encourages a mindset of appreciation and recognition of God's blessings.
