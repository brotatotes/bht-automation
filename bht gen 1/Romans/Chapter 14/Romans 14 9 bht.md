# Romans 14:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Through His death and resurrection, Jesus demonstrated Himself as the righteous Head over humanity, acquiring absolute Lordship over His redeemed, both in life and death. He is the ruler of the dead, having conquered death through His resurrection, and the Lord of the living, guiding and ruling over His redeemed in their daily lives. His death and resurrection justified His title as Lord, providing Him the authority and dominion over us, an authority that cannot be destroyed by death and that rightly claims our devotion and allegiance, regardless of our state - alive or in the grave.
