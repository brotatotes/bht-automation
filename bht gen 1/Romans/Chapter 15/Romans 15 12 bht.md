### John Calvin:
1. "This prophecy is the most illustrious of them all: for in that passage, the Prophet, when things were almost past hope, comforted the small remnant of the faithful, even by this, — that there would arise a shoot from the dry and the dying trunk of David’s family, and that a branch would flourish from his despised root, which would restore to God’s people their pristine glory."
2. "But twice in this prophecy is the calling of the Gentiles confirmed, — by the expression, that Christ was to be raised up as a sign, and he reigns among the faithful alone, — and by the declaration, that they shall hope in Christ, which cannot take place without the preaching of the word and illumination of the Spirit."
3. "It may be further added, that hope in Christ is an evidence of his divinity."

### John Gill:
1. "This character, 'the root of Jesse', may be understood of Christ with respect to his divine nature, who, as God, was before Jesse, and the author of his being, as of all creatures just in such sense as he is called 'the root and offspring of David', Revelation 5:5; the root of David, as he is God, and the offspring of David, as he is man."
2. "This character may be applied to Christ as Mediator, who as a root is unseen and unknown to carnal men, and mean, abject, and of no account in the eyes of the world; the root that not only bears Jesse, David, and other good men, but all the branches of God's elect, from whom they have their beings, both in a natural and spiritual sense."
3. "In the Hebrew text in Isaiah, this is said of the root, and to be read thus, 'which shall stand for an ensign of the people', Isaiah 11:10; because mention is made of a root, the apostle expresses the standing of it by rising out of it, which signifies both the incarnation and exaltation of Christ; and because an ensign is a token of power and government, therefore he has rendered it to 'reign', agreeably enough to the sense."

### John Wesley:
1. "That kings and the Messiah should spring from his house, was promised to Jesse before it was to David."
2. "In him shall the gentiles hope, who before had been 'without hope.'"
3. "Isaiah 11:10 signifies the calling of the Gentiles, and the bringing of them into the church."
