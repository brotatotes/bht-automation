# Romans 15:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we are reminded of our duty to please and serve others, particularly our neighbors and fellow believers. The emphasis is placed on acting for their good, with the ultimate aim of edification - the building up and strengthening of their faith. This involves selflessness, considering their welfare and seeking to promote their spiritual growth and maturity. It is important to prioritize what is morally right and beneficial, and not to seek personal gain or popularity. By doing so, we faithfully serve Christ and contribute to the well-being and development of our brethren.
