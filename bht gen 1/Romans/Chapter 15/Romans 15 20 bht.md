# Romans 15:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse described emphasizes the noble and selfless ambition of spreading the Gospel to places where Christ is not yet known. It is a point of honor for the apostle to make the first proclamation of the Gospel in these unheard-of places, rather than building upon the foundation laid by others. This choice is driven by the desire to avoid any accusations or opposition and to fulfill the duty of laying the foundation of a universal Church. Despite the difficulty and dangers, the apostle remains committed to this mission.

2. "Lest I should only build upon another man's foundation - The providence of God seemed in a special manner, generally, to prevent this, though not entirely, lest the enemies of the apostle, who sought every occasion to set light by him, should have had room to say that he was behind other apostles."
3. "Not being sufficient for planting of churches himself, but only for preaching where others had been already; or that he declined the more difficult part of the ministry."
