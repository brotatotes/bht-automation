# Romans 15:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Bible verse being described is about an apostle's burning desire to spread the Gospel in unreached regions, not relying on the foundation laid by others. This ambition is seen as a point of honor and a noble goal, different from worldly ambition. The apostle's choice reflects a deep sense of duty and a zeal to lay the foundation of a universal Church. It involves preaching where Christ had not been previously named and reaching out to those who had no knowledge of Him. This work requires bravery, energy, and a willingness to face difficulties and dangers.
