# Romans 15:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse being described speaks of the apostle's principle and the divine revelation that the gospel should be preached to the Gentiles. The astonishment of the nations is due to the fact that they had not previously seen the glory of God revealed through the Servant's work. This wide extension of the Messiah's kingdom is the main thought, where His suffering and exaltation are not separate events, but intricately intertwined. Ultimately, the Servant's exaltation is a public proclamation of God's power and faithfulness to all people.
