1. "διό refers to the primary, viz. his having been so earnestly engaged in preaching elsewhere."
2. "τὰ πολλά, these many times: ot [‘for the most part,’ or], as Meyer, Fritz., ‘the greater number of times,' which would suggest the idea that there had been other occasions on which this hindrance had not been operative."
3. "διό, not, because a foundation had been already laid at Rome by another: this would refer to merely a secondary part of the foregoing assertion."

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Being so long occupied with this missionary work, I have been much hindered." This quote highlights the Apostle Paul's dedication to his missionary work and the obstacles he faced in fulfilling his calling.

2. "For the most part hindered." This phrase emphasizes that Paul's hindrances were not occasional or minor, but rather a consistent and significant challenge to his mission.

### John Gill:
1. "By reason of being employed for so many years, in preaching the Gospel from Jerusalem, round about to Illyricum; taking so large a compass to minister in, and striving to introduce, propagate, and spread the Gospel, where Christ was never named before." 

2. "The frequent calls to different and distant places, and the great work of preaching the Gospel in those dark parts of the world, and settling churches there, which was upon his hands, prevented his giving them a visit at Rome, which he much and often desired."
