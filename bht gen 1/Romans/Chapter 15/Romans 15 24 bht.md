# Romans 15:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the purpose of the speaker's desire to visit and become known to the people is debated. Some argue that there is no record or mention of this purpose being fulfilled, while others believe it was accomplished through a second imprisonment. The speaker expresses gratitude for the kindness and support of the listeners, and emphasizes the benevolence of his intentions towards them. It is clear that the speaker's visit was motivated by a desire to spread the gospel to those who had not yet heard it, and to satisfy the spiritual hunger within their souls.

2. "By saying, to be brought on my way thither by you, he intimates how much he expected from their kindness; and this, as we have already observed, is the best way for conciliating favor."
