### Henry Alford:
1. "ἀπὸ μέρους is an affectionate limitation of ἐμπλησθῶ" - This quote explains that the phrase "ἀπὸ μέρους" is used to express affectionate limitation, indicating a desire to stay longer than expected.

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Those who think our apostle was never at large after his first imprisonment at Rome will of course hold that it never was; while those who are persuaded, as we are, that he underwent a second imprisonment, prior to which he was at large for a considerable time after his first, incline naturally to the other opinion."
2. "If these words were not originally in the text, and there is weighty evidence against them, they must at least be inserted as a necessary supplement."
3. "I should indeed like to stay longer with you than I can hope to do, but I must, to some extent at least, have my fill of your company."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It is remarkable, even here, that the apostle does not say that his principal object was to visit the church at Rome, much as he desired that, but only to 'take it in his way' in the fulfillment of his higher purpose to preach the gospel in regions where Christ was not named."
2. "To be brought on my way ... - To be assisted by you in regard to this journey; or to be accompanied by you. This was the custom of the churches."
3. "Filled - This is a strong expression, meaning to be 'satisfied,' to enjoy. To be 'filled' with a thing is to have great satisfaction and joy in it."

"He refers to the reason why he had for a long time wished to come to them, and now intended to do so, — even that he might see them, enjoy an interview and an intercourse with them, and make himself known to them in his official character; for by the coming of the Apostles the gospel also came."
2. "By saying, to be brought on my way thither by you, he intimates how much he expected from their kindness; and this, as we have already observed, is the best way for conciliating favor."
