# Romans 15:26 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we see a voluntary contribution made by the churches in Macedonia and Achaia to support the poor saints in Jerusalem. These contributions were made cheerfully and out of a sense of fellowship and unity. While the community of goods in Jerusalem may not have continued for long, it is evident that the Gentile believers recognized their indebtedness to their Jewish brethren and sought to promote solidarity and alleviate their needs. The act of giving not only relieved the material needs of the saints but also fostered a sense of unity and love within the early Christian community.
