# Romans 15:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This verse describes the selflessness of Christ, who did not live to please himself but instead sought to do his Father's will and work, bearing the burdens and weaknesses of others and enduring insults and rejection from those he came to save. He fulfilled the scripture and willingly suffered, exemplifying the prophetic nature of the Old Testament and showing his incredible love and forgiveness. In doing so, he became the new law for believers to follow, and his ultimate purpose was for the salvation of humanity.
