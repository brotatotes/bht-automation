1. "By that Saviour whose name is alike dear to all of us and whose unsearchable riches I live only to proclaim, and by that love one to another which the blessed Spirit diffuses through all the brotherhood, making the labors of Christ's servants a matter of common interest to all—I beseech you."

3. "I beseech you... that ye strive together with me in your prayers to God for me."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Strive together" - The verb used here suggests a sense of intense effort and determination, similar to contending in athletic games. This implies that prayer should not be passive or casual, but rather a fervent and earnest pursuit.

2. "The simple verb is used of contending in the games" - This commentary highlights the connection between the verb used in the verse and the competitive nature of athletic games. It emphasizes the idea that prayer should be approached with a similar level of focus and dedication.

3. "Here earnest prayer" - This phrase emphasizes the importance of sincerity and heartfelt devotion in prayer. It suggests that true prayer involves a genuine and earnest desire to connect with God, rather than simply going through the motions.

1. "He entreats an interest in their prayers; and which he urges from the consideration of their mutual relation as 'brethren'; and therefore should love one another, and show it, among other things, by praying for each other to their common parent." 
2. "He beseeches them that they would pray for the continuance of his life and usefulness; since for him to live was for the good of the churches of Christ, though for him to die would be his own personal gain."

1. "I beseech you by the love of the Spirit" - The love referred to here is not a human love, but the love that is produced by the Holy Spirit within believers. It is a love that surpasses human understanding and enables believers to strive together in prayer.

2. "To strive together with me in your prayers" - Paul emphasizes the importance of personal prayer, but also highlights the need for believers to come together in unity and fervently pray alongside him.

3. "He must pray himself, who would have others strive together with him in prayer" - Paul sets an example by being a man of prayer himself. He understands that in order to lead others in prayer, he must first be committed to a personal prayer life. True leadership in prayer requires personal devotion and dependence on God.

4. "Of all the apostles, St. Paul alone is recorded to desire the prayers of the faithful for himself" - Paul humbly acknowledges his need for the prayers of others. Despite his apostolic authority, he recognizes the power of intercession and the importance of seeking the prayers of fellow believers. This serves as a reminder that no one is exempt from the need for prayer support.
