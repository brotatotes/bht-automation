## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Think not that because such portions of Scripture relate immediately to Christ, they are inapplicable to you for though Christ's sufferings, as a Saviour, were exclusively His own, the motives that prompted them, the spirit in which they were endured, and the general principle involved in His whole work - self-sacrifice for the good of others - furnish our most perfect and beautiful model." 

2. "All Scripture relating to these is for our instruction; and since the duty of forbearance, the strong with the weak, requires 'patience,' and this again needs 'comfort,' all those Scriptures which tell of patience and consolation, particularly of the patience of Christ, and of the consolation which sustained Him under it, are our appointed and appropriate nutriment."

3. "Ministering to us 'hope' of that blessed day when these shall no more be needed."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Whatsoever things were written aforetime. Evidently including the whole Old Testament."
2. "Were written for our learning; to instruct us also; the immediate design does not preclude this further and permanent one, a principle which underlies many other citations made by the Apostle."
3. "That we through the patience and through the comfort of the Scriptures. This is the literal rendering of the better established reading. 'Of the Scriptures' qualifies both words: 'the patience and comfort produced by a study of the Scriptures; the repeated 'through' does not disconnect them, but gives rhetorical emphasis."

### John Gill:
1. "Whatever is written anywhere in the sacred Scriptures were written for our learning; to instruct in the knowledge of Christ, of his person, offices, grace, righteousness, obedience, sufferings, death, resurrection, and ascension."
2. "The Scriptures are not only written for our present instruction, but for the ingenerating, encouraging, and establishing, an hope of eternal Life in another world."
3. "The comfort of the Scriptures is such as is not to be met with elsewhere. These writings abound with exceeding great and precious promises, and excellent doctrines, big with consolation to the saints."
