# Romans 16:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the early Christian churches, there were deaconesses who attended to the wants of female members, often being widows. These deaconesses played a significant role in the church, taking care of the sick, the poor, and strangers. One notable deaconess, Phoebe, carried the future of Christian theology within her, and was commended by Paul. Though the revival of this office has been scarce in modern times due to changes in society and past abuses, the historical significance and impact of these deaconesses cannot be denied.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "That in the earliest churches there were deaconesses, to attend to the wants of the female members, there is no good reason to doubt."
2. "So early at least as the reign of Trajan, we learn from PLINY'S celebrated letter to that emperor that they existed in the Eastern churches."
3. "Modern attempts, however, to revive this office have seldom found favor; either from the altered state of society, or the abuse of the office, or both."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Phoebe carried under the folds of her robe the whole future of Christian theology." 
2. "The office [of deaconess] seems to have been confined mainly to widows, though virgins were not absolutely excluded."
3. "Cenchreae was nine miles from Corinth. It was a thriving town, commanding a large trade with Alexandria, Antioch, Ephesus, Thessalonica, and the other cities of the Aegean."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Phebe our sister; a Christian believer; this is the general ground for receiving her."
2. "The word here used may mean 'servant' but it is unlikely that this is the sense, since there were deaconesses in the Christian church during the first century, their duty being to take care of the sick and poor, and of strangers, in the female portion of the churches."
3. "The Roman Catholic church has, as is well known, special orders of celibate women to perform the duties properly belonging to this office."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "I commend (συνιστημ). The regular word for letters of commendation as in 2 Corinthians 3:1 (συστατικων επιστολων). See also Romans 3:5."
2. "Phoebe, the bearer of the Epistle. Nothing else is known of her, though her name (Φοιβη) means bright or radiant."
3. "In some sense Phoebe was a servant or minister of the church in Cenchreae. Besides, right in the midst of the discussion in 1 Timothy 3:8-13 Paul has a discussion of γυναικας (verse Romans 16:11) either as women as deaconesses or as the wives of deacons (less likely though possible)."

### John Wesley:
1. "Phebe, the bearer of this letter, is commended to you." 
2. "The Greek word for servant used here refers to a deaconness." 
3. "In the early church, women were appointed as deaconnesses to serve the community, particularly in ministering to the sick and meeting their needs."
