# Romans 16:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This Bible verse speaks of a woman named Phebe, who is described as a beloved sister in the faith. Phebe is commended for her role as a servant or minister in the church at Cenchrea, possibly as a deaconess. In the early church, deaconesses were appointed to provide care and support to female members, attending to their physical and spiritual needs. Phebe's service exemplifies the importance of embracing and honoring those who perform public offices in the Church.

3. "Modern attempts, however, to revive this office have seldom found favor; either from the altered state of society, or the abuse of the office, or both."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It was common then, as now, to bear letters of introduction to strangers, commending the person thus introduced to the favorable regards and attentions of those to whom the letters were addressed."
2. "The mention of Phebe in this manner leaves it beyond a doubt that she was either the bearer of this Epistle, or accompanied those who bore it to Rome."
3. "The females were usually separate from the men. They were kept secluded, for the most part, and not permitted to mingle in society with men as is the custom now."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Phoebe carried under the folds of her robe the whole future of Christian theology." 
2. "The office [of deaconess] seems to have been confined mainly to widows, though virgins were not absolutely excluded."

### John Calvin:
1. "And since it behooves us to embrace in love all the members of Christ, we ought surely to regard and especially to love and honor those who perform a public office in the Church."
2. "But this service, of which he speaks as to what it was, he teaches us in another place, in 1 Timothy 5:9, for as the poor were supported from the public treasury of the Church, so they were taken care of by those in public offices."
3. "This most sacred function, and very useful to the Church, when the state of things had become worse, degenerated into the idle order of Nuns; which, though corrupt at its beginning, and contrary to the word of God, has yet so fallen away from what it was at its commencement, that there is no difference between some of the sanctuaries of chastity and a common brothel."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Phebe our sister; a Christian believer; this is the general ground for receiving her."
2. "The word here used may mean ‘servant’ but it is unlikely that this is the sense, since there were deaconesses in the Christian church during the first century, their duty being to take care of the sick and poor, and of strangers, in the female portion of the churches."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "I commend (συνιστημ). The regular word for letters of commendation as in 2 Corinthians 3:1 (συστατικων επιστολων). See also Romans 3:5. So here verses Romans 16:1; Romans 16:2 constitute Paul's recommendation of Phoebe, the bearer of the Epistle." 
2. "Sister (αδελφην). In Christ, not in the flesh."
3. "Who is a servant of the church (ουσαν διακονον της εκκλησιας). The etymology of διακονος we have had repeatedly. The only question here is whether it is used in a general sense or in a technical sense as in Philippians 1:1; 1 Timothy 3:8-13."

### John Gill:
1. "She is recommended as a sister, 'our sister'; not in a natural, but spiritual relation; one that was a member of the church at Cenchrea, and in full communion with it; for as it was usual to call the men brethren, it was common to call the women sisters."
2. "Of this church Phebe was a servant, or, as the word signifies, a minister or deacon; not that she was a teacher of the word, or preacher of the Gospel, for that was not allowed of by the apostle in the church at Corinth, that a woman should teach."
3. "Rather, as some think, she was a deaconess appointed by the church, to take care of the poor sisters of the church; though as they were usually poor, and ancient women; that were put into that service, and this woman, according to the account of her, being neither poor, nor very ancient; it seems rather, that being a rich and generous woman, she served or ministered to the church by relieving the poor."

### John Wesley:
1. "Phebe, the bearer of this letter, is commended to you." 
2. "She is a servant, a deaconness, of the church in Cenchrea."
