# Romans 16:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we see the recognition of someone who has been tested and proven faithful in their commitment to Christ. It highlights the significance of discerning true believers who are approved by God and Christ, rather than relying on human commendations. This approval in Christ is not limited to status or background, as it extends even to individuals from influential households. It is a reminder of the enduring theme in the Bible that true faith is tested and proven, and holds great value in the eyes of God, Christ, and fellow believers.

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Salute Apelles approved—"the approved" in Christ—or, as we should say, "that tried Christian"; a noble commendation."
2. "Salute them which are of Aristobulus' household —It would seem, from what is said of Narcissus in Romans 16:11, that this Aristobulus himself had not been a Christian; but that the Christians of his household simply were meant."
3. "Very possibly some of his slaves."

### Albert Barnes:

### Marvin Vincent:

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "The approved (τον δοκιμον)." - This phrase highlights the idea that there are individuals who have been tested and proven to be trustworthy or reliable in their faith. It implies that not everyone can be considered "approved" and emphasizes the importance of discernment in identifying those who are truly faithful.

2. "Them which are of the household of Aristobulus (τους εκ των Αριστοβουλου)." - This phrase suggests that even within influential households, there may be individuals who have embraced Christianity. It reminds us that faith can transcend social status and familial ties, and that the message of the Gospel can reach people from all walks of life.

3. "The tried and true (1 Corinthians 11:19; 2 Corinthians 10:18; 2 Corinthians 13:7)." - This phrase emphasizes the idea that being "tried and true" is not limited to one instance or one verse, but is a recurring theme in the Bible. It reinforces the concept that genuine faith is tested and proven over time, and that it is a characteristic that should be sought after and valued.

1. "He was one that was approved in Christ; approved of God in Christ, who approves of none but in Christ; not of any on account of their own commendations, or those of others."
2. "He was also proved to be in Christ; he had proved it to himself, to his own satisfaction, by observing, upon self-examination, that Christ was in him; and he had made it appear to others, by his faith in Christ, love to him, zeal for him, and close attachment to his Gospel."
3. "This character shows that he was not only approved of God and Christ, but of all good men, and particularly the apostle; and that on account of his being in Christ, united to him, and closely attached to his service and interest, and was an honour to it."
