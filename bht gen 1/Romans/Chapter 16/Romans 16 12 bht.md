Salute Tryphena and Tryphosa, two active women who labored much in the Lord, possibly as deaconesses ministering to the sick.

Tryphena and Tryphosa, along with Persis, a beloved freedwoman, exemplify the diversity within the early Christian community and highlight the importance of family relationships and the role of individuals, no matter how seemingly ordinary, in the body of Christ. Their unwavering devotion and service remind us of the call to actively live out our faith and labor for the kingdom of Christ.
