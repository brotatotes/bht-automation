2. "From this we naturally conclude that when Mark wrote his Gospel, Alexander and Rufus must have been well known as Christians among those by whom he expected his Gospel to be first read; and, in all likelihood, this was that very 'Rufus'; in which case our interest is deepened by what immediately follows about his mother."

3. "The apostle calls her 'his own mother,' not so much as our Lord calls every elderly woman believer His mother, but in grateful acknowledgment of her motherly attentions to himself, bestowed no doubt for his Master's sake, and the love she bore to his honored servants."
