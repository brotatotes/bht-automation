# Romans 16:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we catch a glimpse of the early forms of Christian fellowship in cities, marked by intimate associations and specific groups of Christians meeting together. The Apostle is well-informed about the church and its members, and adjusts his salutations accordingly, encouraging those who may have felt unnoticed. This verse highlights the potential for growth and transformation, even in challenging circumstances, and reminds us that Christian fellowship extends beyond personal connections to encompass shared goals and Christian objects.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "These little peeps into the rudimental forms which Christian fellowship first took in the great cities, though too indistinct for more than conjecture, are singularly interesting."
2. "Our apostle would seem to have been kept minutely informed as to the state of the church at Rome, both as to its membership and its varied activities, probably by Priscilla and Aquila."
3. "It would seem to indicate that they were each a center of some few Christians who met at his houseâ€”it may be for further instruction, for prayer, for missionary purposes, or for some other Christian objects."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Hermes, or Hermas, was a common slave-name, suggesting that the author of this commentary may have been a person of humble origins." 
2. "The name Hermes is a contraction of several different names, indicating that the person bearing this name may have been a composite of various characteristics and qualities." 
3. "The significance of the name Hermas lies in its association with servitude, highlighting the potential for transformation and growth even in the midst of challenging circumstances."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The numerous group here referred to was probably intimately associated, and less known to the Apostle."
2. "The last named person can scarcely be the author of the Shepherd of Hermas, since that work was probably not written before the middle of the second century."
3. "The two phrases may refer to household churches, or to associations of Christians for business purposes. The former seems more probable."

### John Wesley:
1. "It could not but encourage the poor especially, to be saluted by name, who perhaps did not know that the apostle had ever heard of them."
2. "Whilst the apostle forgets none who are worthy, yet he adjusts the nature of his salutation to the degrees of worth in those whom he salutes."
3. "He seems to join those together, who were joined by kindred, nearness of habitation, or any other circumstance."
