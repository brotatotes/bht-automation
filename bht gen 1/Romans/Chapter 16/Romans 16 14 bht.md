# Romans 16:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, the apostle Paul mentions a group of Christians who are less known and possibly of lower social status. The mention of names like Hermes and Asyncritus, which were common slave names, suggests that some of these individuals may have come from humble backgrounds. There are also hints of separate associations or assemblies within the church, possibly for missionary purposes or further instruction. Paul's personalized greetings to each individual highlight his care and consideration for all members, adjusting the nature of his salutation based on their worth and connection within the community.
