# Romans 16:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Deceivers, referred to as false prophets, are highlighted in this Bible verse. They prioritize their own desires rather than the glory of Christ. With their cunning tactics of flattery and persuasive words, they manipulate and mislead the unsuspecting and innocent. They are driven by their own self-interest, seeking worldly gain instead of the true teachings of Christ. This verse serves as a warning about the dangers of falling prey to deceit and encourages believers to stay steadfast in their devotion to Christ.
