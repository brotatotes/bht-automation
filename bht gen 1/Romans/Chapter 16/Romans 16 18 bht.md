# Romans 16:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This verse describes individuals who are skilled in speaking persuasively and using flattery to manipulate others for their own gain. They are not genuinely devoted to serving Christ, but instead seek personal gratification and worldly ambitions. Their smooth words and compliments deceive those who are unsuspecting and innocent, luring them away from the simplicity and truth of the Gospel. It serves as a cautionary reminder to be discerning and aware of those who use charm and empty promises to lead others astray.
