# Romans 16:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the apostle encourages the Romans to stand firm and resist the wiles of the devil, assuring them that they will ultimately be victorious over their formidable enemy. This promise echoes the first great promise of the Bible, that the Seed of the woman would crush the serpent's head. The assurance of triumph over the works of the devil is a reminder that through Christ, believers can have confidence that they will overcome and be united in love, as the God of peace brings His blessing upon their discretion.
