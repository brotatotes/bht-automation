2. "Though the apostle here styles Him who is thus to bruise Satan, the God of peace,' with special reference to the 'divisions' by which the church at Rome was in danger of being disturbed, this sublime appellation of God has here a wider sense, pointing to the whole 'purpose for which the Son of God was manifested, to destroy the works of the devil.'"
