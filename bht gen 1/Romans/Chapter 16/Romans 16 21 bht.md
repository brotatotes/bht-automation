# Romans 16:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the mention of Timothy as Paul's fellow laborer emphasizes their close partnership in ministry. The fact that Timothy is named before Paul's kinsmen highlights his significance and the special place he held in Paul's heart. The absence of Timothy's name in the beginning of the epistle suggests that he had not yet visited Rome, but his later mention acknowledges his important role and contribution to the ministry, even in his absence.

2. "He ascribes first all the glory to God alone; and then, in order to show that it is rightly due to him, he by the way mentions some of his attributes; whence it appears that he alone is worthy of all praise."
3. "The gospel not only promises to us present grace, but also brings to us an assurance of that grace which is to endure for ever; for God declares in it that he is our Father, not only at present, but that he will be so to the end: nay, his adoption extends beyond death, for it will conduct us to an eternal inheritance."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Timothy, my fellow-worker, saluteth you." - This verse confirms that Timothy was with Paul at the time of writing, as mentioned in Acts 20:4.

2. "Lucius. Not 'Luke' but possibly 'Lucius of Cyrene' (Acts 13:1)." - The mention of Lucius could refer to the person named in Acts 13:1, who was from Cyrene.

3. "Jason. This may refer to the person named in Acts 17:5, as a resident of Thessalonica." - The mention of Jason could be the same person mentioned in Acts 17:5, who was a resident of Thessalonica.

4. "Sosipater. The same name as 'Sopater' (Acts 20:4), and possibly the same person." - The name Sosipater might be the same person as Sopater mentioned in Acts 20:4, as both names were common.

5. "My kinsmen. Comp. Romans 16:7; Romans 16:11. Here also the term probably means more than 'countrymen.'" - The term "kinsmen" likely refers to Paul's relatives who became Christians and were associated with him, as seen in Romans 16:7 and Romans 16:11.

2. "Lucius may be the one mentioned in Acts 13:1." 
3. "Jason was once Paul's host (Acts 17:5-9) in Thessalonica, Sosipater may be the longer form of Sopater of Acts 20:4."

### John Gill:
1. "Timotheus...his dear and well beloved son, having a great affection for him, because as a son with a father he served with him in the Gospel of Christ."
2. "Jason...received Paul and Silas into his house, and when an uproar was made concerning them, was brought before the rulers of the city, and gave security for them."
3. "Sosipater...accompanied the apostle into Asia...his Jewish name...might be Abisha, or rather Abishua, the name of the son of Phinehas the high priest."

These quotes provide insights into the close relationships and significant contributions of Timothy, Jason, and Sosipater to the work of the apostle Paul.
