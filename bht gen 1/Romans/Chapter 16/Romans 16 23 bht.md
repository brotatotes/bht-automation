# Romans 16:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we encounter a group of individuals who played significant roles within the early Christian community in Corinth. Gaius is praised for his exceptional hospitality and generosity towards both Paul and fellow believers. He may have held a position of responsibility in providing for the needs of travelers and strangers. Erastus, on the other hand, held an influential role as the chamberlain of the city, responsible for overseeing the city's affairs and finances. These individuals remind us of the importance of hospitality, administration, and governance within the early church.

2. "The host of the whole church probably implies that the assemblies of the church were held in his house: or perhaps, that his hospitality to Christians was universal."

3. "Nothing more is known of this Quartus."

### Albert Barnes:
