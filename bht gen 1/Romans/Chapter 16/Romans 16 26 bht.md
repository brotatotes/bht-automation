# Romans 16:26 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the commentators emphasize the unveiling of a mystery and the equality between Jewish and Gentile believers. The revelation of this mystery brings a new form to the Kingdom of God, surprising the Jews. It is through the preaching of the Gospel that this mystery is made known to all nations, as commanded by God. The Gospel, fully disclosed through the prophetic Scriptures, has been manifested in these last days through Jesus Christ, bringing salvation and righteousness to those who believe.
