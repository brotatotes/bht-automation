# Romans 16:26 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The prophetic writings, containing the hidden mysteries of God's plan for salvation, served as the basis for proclaiming Jesus as the Christ. These writings, coupled with the preaching of the gospel, revealed the unexpected equality between Jewish and Gentile believers and reshaped the Kingdom of God. Now, the revelation of this mystery has been fully unfolded, affirming that it was God's commandment to make known His redemptive plan to all nations. This universal scope of the gospel is emphasized as a clear expression of God's divine order.
