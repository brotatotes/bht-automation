# Romans 16:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This verse mentions the couple Prisca and Aquila, known for their active involvement in the Christian community. Despite the wife being mentioned before the husband, commentators note that no significant meaning should be derived from this order. Prisca and Aquila were both skilled in tent making, and their shared profession contributed to their close partnership and joint ministry. They were esteemed by the apostle Paul, referred to as "helpers in Christ Jesus," for their dedicated service in promoting the Gospel and advancing the kingdom of Christ.
