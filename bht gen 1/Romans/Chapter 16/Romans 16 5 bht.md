# Romans 16:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the early days of the Christian faith, believers would gather in the homes of prominent brethren, as they did not have designated places of worship. These houses served as sacred spaces, often forming a household parish. One such beloved individual mentioned in the salutation is Epaenetus, who holds a special place as a first-fruit, possibly being one of the earliest converts in his region. This recognition highlights the significance of individuals chosen by God as the "first in time to the faith," as their faithfulness and endurance over time attest to the authenticity of their calling.
