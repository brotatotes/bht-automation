2. "Therefore thy setting thyself up as a judge, is unjustifiable."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Since you Jews condemn the Gentiles for their sins, on the ground that they have the means of knowing their duty, therefore, you who are far more favored than they, are entirely without an excuse for the same things."
2. "It is clearly implied here, that they were guilty of offenses similar to those practiced by the Gentiles."
