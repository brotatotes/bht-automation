2. The phrase "first in perdition if unfaithful" serves as a reminder that being chosen comes with responsibility. If the Jews fail to live up to their calling and reject the truth, they will face judgment and perdition. (Commentary on Romans 2:10)

3. On the other hand, if the Jews remain faithful and obedient to the truth, they will be "first in salvation." This emphasizes the potential for the Jewish people to be the first to experience the fullness of God's salvation through Jesus Christ. (Commentary on Romans 2:10)
