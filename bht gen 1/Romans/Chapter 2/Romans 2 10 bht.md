## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "εἰρήνη" is used here in its highest and most glorious sense, referring to the peace that comes from a restored relationship with God.
2. This verse reminds us that true peace can only be found in Jesus, who reconciles us to God and brings us into a state of harmony and wholeness.

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The phrase 'to the Jew first' highlights the unique privilege and responsibility that the Jewish people have in receiving and proclaiming the gospel. It reminds us that God's redemptive plan began with the Jewish nation and that they have a special place in God's heart." 

2. "The mention of 'perdition if unfaithful' serves as a warning to the Jews that their disobedience and rejection of the truth will lead to their own destruction. It emphasizes the importance of faith and obedience in receiving salvation." 

3. "On the other hand, if the Jews are obedient to the truth, they will be 'first in salvation.' This signifies that God's salvation is available to all, but the Jews have the opportunity to be at the forefront of experiencing and sharing the blessings of salvation."
