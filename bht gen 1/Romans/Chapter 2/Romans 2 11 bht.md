### Philip Schaff:
1. "This is not a mere repetition of Romans 2:6; but shows the reason why 'the Jew first, and also of the Greek.'"
2. "Since God has no respect of persons, He must judge the Jew first."
3. "The phrase 'respect of persons' is represented in the original by one word. The conception is from the Hebrew (to lift up, or accept, the face), and in the New Testament is always used in a bad sense, of unjust partiality."

### John Gill:
1. "It will not come into consideration, at the day of judgment, of what nation men are; or from what parents they are descended; nor of what age and sex persons be; nor in what state and condition they have lived in this world; nor will it be asked to what sect they have belonged, and by what denomination they have been called; or whether they have conformed to such and such externals and rituals in religion; but only whether they are righteous men or sinners."
2. "A judge, as such, is to regard no man's person, but to proceed in matters before him, according to the rules of law and justice should he do otherwise, he would be chargeable with being a respecter of persons; but then he may bestow alms on what objects he pleases; and forgive one man who is personally indebted to him, and not another, without any such imputation."
3. "Besides, God is not bound to any person by any laws, but acts as a Sovereign; he is not moved by anything in the creature; as his choice is not confined to persons of any particular nation, family, sex, or condition, so neither does it proceed upon anything, or a foresight of anything in them, or done by them; and as there is no worthiness in them that are chosen, and saved above others, so no injury is done to the rest."
