## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "For as many as have sinned without (the) law (of Moses): shall also perish without (the) law (of Moses): i.e. it shall not appear against them in judgment." 
2. "ἀπολοῦνται, the result of the judgment on them, rather than κριθήσονται, its process, because the absence of the law would thus seem as if it were the rule by which they are to be judged, whereas it is only an accident of that judgment, which depends on other considerations."
3. "ἐν νόμῳ, under (in, as a status) the (Mosaic) law; not ‘a law,’ which would make the sentence a truism: it is on that very undeniable assumption, ‘that all who have had a law given shall be judged by that law,’ that the Apostle constructs his argument, asserting it with regard to the Mosaic law in the case of the Jews, and proving that the Gentiles have had a law given to them in the testimony of their consciences."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "For as many as have sinned... as many as are found in sin at the judgment of the great day." 
2. "Without law... without the advantage of a positive Revelation." 
3. "And as many as have sinned in the law... shall be judged by the law."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "This includes all who have done it, and evidently has respect to the Gentile world. It is of the more importance to remark this, because he does not say that it is applicable to a few only, or to great and incorrigible instances of pagan wickedness, but it is a universal, sweeping declaration, obviously including all."
2. "The strain of the argument, as well as this express declaration, shows that they who had sinned - and in the first chapter he had proved that all the pagan were sinners - would be punished. If any of the pagan are saved, it will be, therefore, an exception to the general rule in regard to them."
3. "According to this, it is not to be apprehended that they will suffer as much as those who have the revealed will of God; compare Matthew 10:15; Matthew 11:24; Luke 10:12."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The article is usually wanting when the stress is laid, not upon the historical impress and outward form of the law, but upon the conception itself."
2. "Law considered as a principle, exemplified no doubt chiefly and signally in the Mosaic law, but very much wider than this in its application."
3. "The Jews alone will be, strictly speaking, subjected to a detailed inquiry such as arises from applying the particular articles of a code."

### John Calvin:
1. "The knowledge of a written law was not necessary for the just condemnation of a sinner."
2. "See then what kind of advocacy they undertake, who through misplaced mercy, attempt, on the ground of ignorance, to exempt the nations who have not the light of the gospel from the judgment of God."
3. "A worse condition then awaits the Jewish sinners, since their condemnation is already pronounced in their own law."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Since God is no respecter of persons it follows that He will judge according to light."
2. "The verse teaches that the immoral heathen will not be punished, however, with the rigor of the written law, as in the case of disobedient Jews and unfaithful Christians, but according to their light."
3. "The unfaithful Christians will be judged more severely than the disobedient Jews, and the disobedient Jews than the immoral Gentiles."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "The heathen who sin are lost, because they do not keep the law which they have, not because they do not have the Mosaic law or Christianity."
2. "The Jew has to stand or fall by the Mosaic law."
3. "The heathen who sin are lost, because they do not keep the law which they have, not because they do not have the Mosaic law or Christianity."

### John Gill:
1. "This is an instance of the strict justice of God, and proves him to be no respecter of persons."
2. "Their not having the written law of Moses will be no plea in their favour, or be a reason why they should not be condemned."
3. "Their having this law will be no bar against their condemnation, but rather an aggravation of it; their hearing of it will be no plea in their favour."

### John Wesley:
1. "For as many as have sinned...shall also perish without the law." - This quote highlights the consequence of sinning without having any written law. It emphasizes that those who transgress without external guidance will face condemnation and ultimate destruction.

2. "Without regard had to any outward law; being condemned by the law written in their hearts." - This quote emphasizes the significance of the internal moral compass within individuals. It suggests that even without explicit external laws, people are held accountable by the innate sense of right and wrong written in their hearts.

3. "The word also shows the agreement of the manner of sinning, with the manner of suffering." - This quote draws attention to the correlation between the way one sins and the subsequent suffering they experience. It implies that the consequences of sin are aligned with the nature and severity of the transgression.
