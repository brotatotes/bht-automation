# Romans 2:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This verse discusses the universal accountability for sin, regardless of whether one has the written law or not. It emphasizes the future judgment and the distinction between those who have sinned within a written law and those who have sinned without it. While all will face judgment, the severity may vary based on the knowledge and understanding of God's law.

2. "without law—that is, without the advantage of a positive Revelation."
3. "and as many as have sinned in the law—within the pale of a positive, written Revelation."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Since God is no respecter of persons it follows that He will judge according to light."
2. "The verse teaches that the immoral heathen will not be punished, however, with the rigor of the written law, but according to their light."
