# Romans 2:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the given Bible verse, commentators emphasize the distinction between the Gentiles and the Jews in regards to the law. The Gentiles, while not having the Mosaic law, still have a moral compass and a sense of right and wrong within themselves. Their actions and conscience serve as their own law. This understanding of moral principles is natural to them, and it serves as a substitute for the written law. The commentary addresses the misconceptions held by the Jews and aims to highlight the just judgment of God.
