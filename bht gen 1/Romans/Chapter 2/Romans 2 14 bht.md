# Romans 2:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, it is highlighted that the Gentiles, although lacking the Mosaic law, still have a moral compass and a sense of right and wrong within themselves. They possess a law that is based on the principles of nature and reason. This acknowledgement serves both to show that obedience to the law must be complete and perfect, and to counter the argument made by Jews. The Gentiles, in their actions, demonstrate their understanding of moral principles, and this understanding serves as a guide for their conduct.
