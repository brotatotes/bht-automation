# Romans 2:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
On the day of judgment, the hidden desires and motives of people will be exposed, as God sees through their outward actions and even the thoughts of their hearts. This judgment will be based on the teachings of the Gospel, the true standard of righteousness. Paul, as a proclaimer of the Gospel, speaks with authority and confidence, knowing that his message aligns with the authentic and authoritative gospel revealed by God. Jesus Christ is the appointed Judge, who will bring to light all secret thoughts and purposes and carry out a just judgment based on the truth of the Gospel.
