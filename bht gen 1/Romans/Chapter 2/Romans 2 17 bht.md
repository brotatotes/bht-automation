## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "But if thou art denominated a Jew, and &c.…, thou that teachest thy neighbour, dost thou not teach thyself?"
2. "No stress on ἐπ -, art named, ‘denominated,’ ‘hast the name put on thee.'"
3. "The τῷ of the rec. has been inserted in the later MSS. before νόμῳ, because it here clearly applied to the ‘law of Moses,’ and the absence of the article gave offence."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Behold—"But if" is, beyond doubt, the true reading here."

1. "By the use of the word 'behold,' he calls their attention to it, as to an important subject; and with great skill and address, he states their privileges, before he shows them how those privileges might enhance their condemnation."
2. "Thou art called - Thou art named Jew, implying that this name was one of very high honor. This is the first thing mentioned on which the Jew would be likely to pride himself."
3. "The Jew leaned on, or relied on the Law for acceptance or favor; on the fact that he had the Law, and on his obedience to it. It does not mean that he relied on his own works, though that was true, but that he leaned on the fact that he had the Law, and was thus distinguished above others."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Thou art called, bringing out the value which attached to the name Jew, the theocratic title of honor."

### John Calvin:
1. "He allows them all those privileges, by which they were beyond measure transported and inflated: and then he shows how insufficient they were for the attainment of true glory, yea, how they turned to their reproach."
2. "Under the name Jew he includes all the privileges of the nation, which they vainly pretended were derived from the law and the prophets; and so he comprehends all the Israelites, all of whom were then, without any difference, called Jews."
3. "He means not that they rested in attending to the law, as though they applied their minds to the keeping of it; but, on the contrary, he reproves them for not observing the end for which the law had been given; for they had no care for its observance, and were inflated on this account only, — because they were persuaded that the oracles of God belonged to them."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The addition of a single letter in the Greek gives this sense, which is without doubt the correct one."
2. "The name of Judah had a religious sense, and the title 'Jew' was regarded as highly honorable."

4. "Thou testest the things that differ"
5. "The Jew's 'ethical discernment was the fruit of catechetical and synagogical instruction in the Old Testament'"

1. "No name, nor outward religion, nor a mere profession, will justify before God."

3. "They boasted of their bare external knowledge of the one God, when the Gentiles around them were ignorant of him."

These quotes highlight the commentary's emphasis on the insufficiency of external religious practices and mere knowledge of God. It emphasizes that true justification before God comes from faith and trust in Christ, rather than relying on outward appearances or self-righteousness.
