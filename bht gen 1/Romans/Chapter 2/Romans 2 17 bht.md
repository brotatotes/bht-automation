# Romans 2:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Behold, if you are called a Jew and rest in the law, thinking it suffices for your glory, think again. For the title "Jew" carried great honor, but it alone cannot save nor bring true righteousness. Don't boast solely in your relationship with God while disregarding others. Instead, acknowledge the insufficiency of the law and humbly seek salvation through faith.
