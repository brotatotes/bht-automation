3. "Thou provest, or, distinguishest things which differ," is the rendering of [Beza], [Pareus], [Doddridge], and [Stuart]: "Thou approvest things excellent or useful," is the rendering of [Erasmus], [Macknight], and others. The first is the most suitable to the context, as knowledge, and not approval, is evidently intended, as proved by the explanatory clause which follows, - "being instructed out of the law."
