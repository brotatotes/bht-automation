## BHT:
This verse describes the significance and limitations of the law in providing knowledge and truth. Commentators explain that the law reflects God's holiness and serves as a foreshadowing of Christ. Believers have access to specific and accurate understanding of divine truths through the law, in contrast to the uncertainty faced by the heathens. The believers are favored with definite and precise information from heaven, enabling them to have a correct delineation of the truth. This knowledge is not superficial or partial but encompasses the fullness and accuracy of the truth, leading to a transformation in one's actions and character.
