# Romans 2:25 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this passage, the commentators discuss the significance of circumcision in relation to the observance of the law. While circumcision held importance among the Jews and symbolized their covenant with God, it alone did not guarantee righteousness. Instead, true circumcision requires obedience to the law and a sincere heart. The commentators emphasize that external religious rituals, such as circumcision or baptism, are of no avail if not accompanied by genuine faith and righteous living. Ultimately, adherence to the law and a transformed heart hold greater weight than external markers of religious identity.

2. "The supposition is of acting according to the law, doing the law."
3. "The Jewish transgressor is no better off than the Gentile transgressor."

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "For circumcision—that is, One's being within the covenant of which circumcision was the outward sign and seal."
2. "Verily profiteth, if thou keep the law—if the inward reality correspond to the outward sign."
3. "Otherwise, thou art no better than the uncircumcised heathen."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The Jews of course affixed a high importance to the rite."
2. "The mere fact of being a Jew is not what God requires."
3. "No external advantages, no name, or rite, or ceremony will save you."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Breaker of the law [παραβατης]. Rev., transgressor." 
2. "Thy circumcision is made uncircumcision." 
3. "But if any citizen be found guilty of any great or unmentionable wrong, either in relation to the gods, or his parents, or the state, let the judge deem him to be incurable, remembering what an education and training he has had from youth upward, and yet has not abstained from the greatest of crimes" (Plato, "Laws," 854).

### John Calvin:
1. "The true character of circumcision was a spiritual promise, which required faith: the Jews neglected both, the promise as well as faith. Then foolish was their confidence."
2. "Circumcision then requires perfection. The same may be also said of our baptism: when any one confidently relies on the water of baptism alone, and thinks that he is justified, as though he had obtained holiness by that ordinance itself, the end of baptism must be adduced as an objection; which is, that the Lord thereby calls us to holiness of life."
3. "But as to the Pharisees, who were satisfied with imitating holiness by an outward disguise, it is no wonder that they so easily deluded themselves. Hence Paul, after having left the Jews nothing, but this poor subterfuge of being justified by circumcision, does now also take from them even this empty pretense."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Circumcision without the keeping of the law is of no avail; true circumcision and true Judaism are not outward matters but of the heart."
2. "The Jew would say: ‘my circumcision profits me, even if I am guilty as you charge.’"
3. "The unholy Jew virtually becomes a Gentile. The same principle applies to Christian baptism, the initiatory rite of the New Dispensation; it avails nothing; in fact, becomes a ground of condemnation, if the baptized person violates the duties implied in the covenant of which it is the sign and seal."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "If thou be a doer of the law...": This phrase highlights the importance of actively living out the principles and commandments of the law, rather than just passively knowing or acknowledging them.

2. "The Jew is then like the Gentile, with no privilege at all": This statement emphasizes that the external act of circumcision does not guarantee any special status or favor with God. It challenges the notion that religious rituals alone can save or set one apart.

3. "Circumcision was simply the seal of the covenant relation of Israel with God": This explanation clarifies that circumcision was a symbolic act that represented the covenant between God and the people of Israel. It underscores the significance of the covenant relationship rather than the physical act itself.

### John Gill:
1. "The apostle allows that circumcision was profitable; which must be understood whilst it was in force, before the abrogation of it, for since, it is not profitable but pernicious."
2. "Circumcision obliged persons to keep the whole law. Now the circumcised Jews did not keep it in such sense; wherefore circumcision was of no use to them."
3. "If thou be a breaker of the law, thy circumcision is made uncircumcision; that is, it is not accounted circumcision; it is of no avail; such a man was all one as an uncircumcised Gentile."

### John Wesley:
1. "Circumcision indeed profiteth — He does not say, justifies. How far it profited is shown in the third and fourth chapters."
2. "Thy circumcision is become uncircumcision — is so already in effect. Thou wilt have no more benefit by it than if thou hadst never received it."
3. "The very same observation holds with regard to baptism."
