# Romans 2:25 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Circumcision, which was seen as a sign of obedience to the covenant, held significance for the Jews. However, mere outward rituals and privileges were not enough to please God. They were called to genuine transformation and obedience to His laws. Circumcision without a life characterized by holiness and righteousness was worthless. This concept also applies to the practice of baptism, emphasizing the need for true faith and obedience.
