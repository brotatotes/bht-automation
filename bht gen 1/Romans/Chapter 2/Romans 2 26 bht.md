# Romans 2:26 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the phrasing used by commentators like Jamieson Fausset Brown, Philip Schaff, and John Gill provides a deeper understanding of the message. It highlights the possibility of Gentiles exemplifying the character of Abraham's children, even without being officially part of the covenant. Additionally, it underscores the significance of obedience to the law, both for Jews and uncircumcised Gentiles. The commentary also emphasizes that God considers the heart and obedience of a person more important than their physical status.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "The case here put is, we think, such as that of Cornelius, who, though outside the external pale of God's covenant, yet having come to the knowledge of the truths contained in it, do manifest the grace of the covenant without the seal of it, and exemplify the character and walk of Abraham's children, though not called by the name of Abraham."
2. "Thus, this is but another way of announcing that God was about to show the insufficiency of the mere badge of the Abrahamic covenant, by calling from among the Gentiles a seed of Abraham that had never received the seal of circumcision."
3. "This interpretation is confirmed by all that follows."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "If therefore. The unholy Jew virtually becomes a Gentile (Romans 2:25), does not the obedient Gentile virtually become a Jew?"
2. "Keep the ordinances of the law. 'Righteousness' is misleading here; the righteous requirements of the law are meant."
3. "At that time the uncircumcised Gentile, who has kept the ordinances of the law, shall be regarded precisely as though he were circumcised, i.e., as a member of God's covenant people."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Keep on keeping" perfectly - Paul means. 
2. Mere supposition like that in verse Romans 2:25. 
3. As often in N.T.

### John Gill:
1. "These words are spoken hypothetically; if any such persons could be found among the Gentiles who keep the whole law of God."
2. "An uncircumcised Gentile, who keeps the law as in the hands of Christ, and under the influences of his Spirit and grace, and keeps it in Christ, is reckoned a circumcised person in a spiritual sense."
3. "Must be preferable to a circumcised Jew that breaks it."

### John Wesley:
1. "If the uncircumcision — That is, a person uncircumcised." This quote clarifies that the term "uncircumcision" refers to someone who is not circumcised.

2. "Keep the law — Walk agreeably to it." This quote emphasizes the importance of obeying and living according to the law.

3. "Shall not his uncircumcision be counted for circumcision — In the sight of God?" This quote suggests that God sees the heart and intentions of a person, and their obedience to the law matters more than their physical circumcision.
