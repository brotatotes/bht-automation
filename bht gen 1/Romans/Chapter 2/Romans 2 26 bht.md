# Romans 2:26 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this passage, various commentators discuss the significance of circumcision in relation to keeping the law. They argue that acceptance with God is not based on external privileges, but on the state of the heart and life. The case presented is hypothetical, illustrating that even an uncircumcised person who keeps the law can be considered as if they were circumcised. The emphasis is placed on the importance of continuous obedience to God's commands, which holds greater value than mere external rituals. Ultimately, acceptance and righteousness are determined by God, who judges the heart and actions of individuals.

"The case here put is, we think, such as that of Cornelius, who, though outside the external pale of God's covenant, yet having come to the knowledge of the truths contained in it, do manifest the grace of the covenant without the seal of it, and exemplify the character and walk of Abraham's children, though not called by the name of Abraham."
