# Romans 2:29 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This verse emphasizes the significance of being identified as a "Jew," not simply in the external sense as a member of God's people, but also in the internal sense of having a circumcised heart, free from impurity. The praise that matters is not from human recognition, but rather from God, who alone knows the true condition of the heart. To truly be a Jew is to have both inward and outward alignment with God's covenant.
