# Romans 2:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse being described speaks of God's long-suffering and goodness, which are often misunderstood and taken for granted. It emphasizes that God's intent in His long-suffering is to lead people to repentance, not to indulge in sin or discount the consequences. Through experiencing God's goodness and mercy, people are meant to be moved to turn away from their sins and seek His forgiveness. However, there is a warning against despising or abusing the goodness of God, as it is contemptuous and could lead to a deeper disregard for His righteous judgement.
