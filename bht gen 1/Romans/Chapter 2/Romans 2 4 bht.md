# Romans 2:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Bible verse describes how the goodness and love of God lead us to repentance, rather than fear or punishment. God's goodness is an active force that draws us towards Him and compels us to turn away from sin. Through His kindness, God desires to convert sinners and demonstrate His mercy, calling us to respond with repentance. The purpose of God's goodness is not to testify to our innocence, but to lead us to a place of humility and reliance on His grace.
