# Romans 2:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the commentators highlight the consequences of accumulating wrath. The verse speaks to the idea that sinners are amassing divine wrath like hoarded treasure, to be unleashed upon them on the day of righteous judgment. It is a warning against complacency and the belief that God's goodness exempts one from punishment. The verse cautions that those who boast of their purity of faith and life may be the authors of their own destruction, ultimately facing judgment in the day of wrath and revelation.
