## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "ἐριθεία, 'ambitus,' 'self-seeking,' 'greed.' It stands opposed to ὑπομονὴ ἔργου ἀγαθοῦ, which requires self-denial and forbearance." 
2. "The mistake of rendering it 'contentiousness,' and imagining a derivation from ἔρις prevailed universally... It appears to have arisen from ἐρεθίζω being somewhat similar in sound."
3. "ὀργὴ κ. θυμός: the former word denotes the abiding, settled mind of God towards them, and the latter, the outbreak of that anger at the great day of retribution."
