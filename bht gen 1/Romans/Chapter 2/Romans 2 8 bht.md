# Romans 2:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we see a powerful portrayal of the consequences of resistance to the Gospel and unrighteousness. Commentators describe this resistance as keen and determined, resulting in God's wrath and indignation. The verse highlights the disobedient, contentious nature of those who reject the truth and refuse to submit to the Gospel. As a result, they will face not only God's judgment but also tribulation and anguish. The intense punishment awaiting them is said to exceed even the plagues inflicted upon the Egyptians.
