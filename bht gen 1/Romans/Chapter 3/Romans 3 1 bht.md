# Romans 3:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse in question concerns the advantage or profit of being a Jew. The commentators explain that this advantage lies not in external practices or lineage, but rather in being entrusted with God's revelation and having the opportunity to know and proclaim His truth. The value of the Jew is seen in their responsibility to be a light to the nations and to represent God's righteousness and faithfulness. It is the spiritual significance, rather than external observances, that truly defines the worth of being a Jew.

### John Calvin:
1. "Though Paul has clearly proved that bare circumcision brought nothing to the Jews, yet since he could not deny but that there was some difference between the Gentiles and the Jews, which by that symbol was sealed to them by the Lord, and since it was inconsistent to make a distinction, of which God was the author, void and of no moment, it remained for him to remove also this objection."

2. "It was indeed evident, that it was a foolish glorying in which the Jews on this account indulged; yet still a doubt remained as to the design of circumcision; for the Lord would not have appointed it had not some benefit been intended."

3. "He therefore, by way of an objection, asks, what it was that made the Jew superior to the Gentile; and he subjoins a reason for this by another question, What is the benefit of circumcision?

1. "If he is not properly a Jew, who is born of Jewish parents, and brought up in the customs, rites, and religion of the Jewish nation, but anyone of whatsoever nation, that is born again of water, and of the Spirit; where is the superior excellency of the Jew to the Gentile?"

3. "What profit is there of circumcision? since that which is outward in the flesh profits not unless the law is kept, otherwise circumcision is no circumcision and if an uncircumcised Gentile keeps the law, he is a better man than a circumcised Jew; yea, he judges and condemns him; for the only true circumcision is internal, spiritual, and in the heart."
