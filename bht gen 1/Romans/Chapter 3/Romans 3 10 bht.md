# Romans 3:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Psalmist, inspired by human depravity, describes the reality of man's condition. None are righteous, for all have sinned and are enemies to righteousness. These statements, pertinent to the apostle's purpose, illustrate the universal presence of sin throughout history. Despite the specific context in which they were first spoken, they accurately reflect the true nature of humanity and our desperate need for God’s grace. From the vices that have raged throughout ages to the dispositions, designs, discourse, and actions of individuals, the Bible verse reveals the depth of humanity's fallen state.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "These statements of the Psalmist were indeed suggested by particular manifestations of human depravity occurring under his own eye." 
2. "This only showed what man, when unrestrained, is in his present condition." 
3. "They were quite pertinent to the apostle's purpose."

### John Gill:
1. "The words are not always literally expressed, but the sense is attended to, as in this passage; for in the original text of Psalms 14:1, it is, 'there is none that doth good'; from whence the apostle rightly infers, 'there is none righteous'; for he that does not do good, is not righteous."
2. "There is none righteous as Adam was, in a state of innocence; for all have sinned, and are filled with unrighteousness, and are enemies to righteousness."
3. "None are righteous by their obedience to the law of works; nor are there any righteous in the sight of God, upon the foot of their own righteousness, however they may appear in their own eyes, and in the sight of others."

### John Wesley:
1. "That all men are under sin appears from the vices which have raged in all ages."
2. "St. Paul therefore rightly cites David and Isaiah, though they spoke primarily of their own age, and expressed what manner of men God sees, when he 'looks down from heaven;' not what he makes them by his grace."
3. "There is none righteous - This is the general proposition. The particulars follow: their dispositions and designs, their discourse, their actions."
