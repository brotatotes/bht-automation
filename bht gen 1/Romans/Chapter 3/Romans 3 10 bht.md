# Romans 3:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the Psalmist's statements reflect the depravity of humanity. The Apostle Paul uses these quotes to show that both Jews and Gentiles are equally dependent on the mercy of God, incapable of being justified by their works. Paul's use of a chain of quotations emphasizes that all are under sin, highlighting the universal nature of human unrighteousness. This verse serves as a summary and sets the tone for the rest of the passage, exposing the absence of righteousness among humanity.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "These statements of the Psalmist were indeed suggested by particular manifestations of human depravity occurring under his own eye." 
2. "This only showed what man, when unrestrained, is in his present condition."
3. "They were quite pertinent to the apostle's purpose."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The point to be proved was, that the Jews, in the matter of justification, had no advantage or preference over the Gentiles; that the Jew had failed to keep the Law which had been given him, as the Gentile had failed to keep the Law which had been given him; and that both, therefore, were equally dependent on the mercy of God, incapable of being justified and saved by their works."
2. "The design of this is to show, that this characteristic of sin was not confined to any particular period of the Jewish history, but pertained to them as a people; that it had characterised them throughout their existence as a nation."
3. "The apostle adduces his Scripture proofs, to establish the doctrine that both Jews and Gentiles are all under sin."


### John Calvin:
1. "And hence let ecclesiastical teachers learn what their office is; for since Paul asserts here no truth but what he confirms by the sure testimony of Scripture, much less ought such a thing to be attempted by those, who have no other commission but to preach the gospel, which they have received through Paul and others."
2. "The Apostle, who gives the meaning rather than the entire words, seems, in the first place, before he comes to particulars, to state generally the substance of what the Prophet declares to be in man, and that is — that none is righteous."
3. "So that the Apostle quotes the meaning, not the words."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Paul here uses a catena or chain of quotations to prove his point...that Jews are in no better fix than the Greeks for all are under sin."
2. "Paul may have used one of them or he may have put these passages together himself."
3. "This sentence is like a motto for all the rest, a summary for what follows."

### John Gill:
1. "The words are not always literally expressed, but the sense is attended to, as in this passage; for in the original text of Psalms 14:1, it is, 'there is none that doth good'; from whence the apostle rightly infers, 'there is none righteous'; for he that does not do good, is not righteous."
2. "There is none righteous as Adam was, in a state of innocence; for all have sinned, and are filled with unrighteousness, and are enemies to righteousness."
3. "None are righteous by their obedience to the law of works; nor are there any righteous in the sight of God, upon the foot of their own righteousness, however they may appear in their own eyes, and in the sight of others."

### John Wesley:
1. "That all men are under sin appears from the vices which have raged in all ages."
2. "St. Paul therefore rightly cites David and Isaiah, though they spoke primarily of their own age, and expressed what manner of men God sees, when he 'looks down from heaven;' not what he makes them by his grace."
3. "There is none righteous — This is the general proposition. The particulars follow: their dispositions and designs, Romans 3:11,12; their discourse, Romans 3:13,14; their actions, Romans 3:16-18; Psalm 14:1, etc."
