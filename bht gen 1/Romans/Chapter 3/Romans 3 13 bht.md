# Romans 3:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
From the depths of their hearts, words flow forth like a pestilent breath, corrupting all who hear. Their tongues, intended for glory, are instead used for deceit and deception. Lips that should nourish and give thanks instead spew forth deadly poison, perpetuating malice. This verse paints a vivid imagery of the power of words, as they travel from the heart, through the throat and tongue, until finally being released with destructive force, leaving no aspect of the mouth untouched by their corruption.
