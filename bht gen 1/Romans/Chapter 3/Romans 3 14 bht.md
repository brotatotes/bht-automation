# Romans 3:14 Commentary Help Text

It emphasizes the contrast between the intended purpose of the mouth, which is to bless and speak words of kindness, and the reality of it being full of burning wrath and negative qualities.

It serves as a call to cultivate love, forgiveness, and humility in our interactions with God and others.

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "That mouth which should be 'most sweet'... is filled with burning wrath against those whom it should only bless."
2. "Being 'set on fire of hell'... implies that the source of this burning wrath is not from a divine origin, but rather from a place of darkness and evil."
3. "It is a stark contrast to the intended purpose of the mouth, which is to speak words of kindness, encouragement, and blessing."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "His mouth is full of oaths, and deceit, and fraud." - The original Hebrew text highlights the abundance of negative qualities in one's speech, including oaths, deceit, and fraud. (Romans 3:14)
2. "Deceit, which occurs in the original, was omitted, because already mentioned." - The omission of the word "deceit" in the translation is justified by the fact that it has already been mentioned earlier in the passage. (Romans 3:14)
3. "The bitterness which prompts the speech is the cause of the cursing." - The bitterness in one's heart leads to the use of curses in their speech. (Romans 3:14)

### John Gill:
1. "By cursing is meant, cursing of God, which is sometimes internal with the heart, and sometimes external with the mouth, as here; and of all good men, though without cause, and to no purpose with respect to the persons they curse."
2. "The mouth [being] full [of it], denotes the frequency of the sin; scarce anything else comes out of it but cursing; which discovers the sad corruption of the heart."
3. "By 'bitterness' is meant, either sin in general, which is 'an evil and bitter [thing]', Jeremiah 2:19, in its nature and effects; or sinful words, such as oaths, curses, imprecations, all wrathful and deceitful words."

### John Wesley:
1. "Cursing against God is a direct rebellion and defiance of His authority and goodness. It is a rejection of His sovereignty and a denial of His power. Such an act reveals a heart that is hardened and resistant to the truth of God's love and grace."

2. "Bitterness against our neighbor is a manifestation of a heart that is filled with resentment, envy, and anger. It is a refusal to forgive and extend grace to others, choosing instead to hold onto grudges and seek revenge. This bitterness not only harms our relationship with others but also hinders our own spiritual growth and peace."

3. "Psalm 10:7 reminds us of the destructive nature of cursing and bitterness. It serves as a warning against the dangers of allowing these negative attitudes to take root in our hearts. Instead, we are called to cultivate a spirit of love, forgiveness, and humility, reflecting the character of Christ in our interactions with both God and our fellow human beings."
