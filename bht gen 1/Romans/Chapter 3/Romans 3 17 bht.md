# Romans 3:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we see a vivid portrayal of individuals who are consumed by their own selfish pursuits and do not consider the well-being of themselves or others. They are blindly focused on their plans of evil, lacking any understanding of what promotes peace and welfare. Their actions are characterized by plunders, violence, and wrong, devoid of kindness and courtesy. However, true peace is only attainable when righteousness is embraced, as it serves as the bedrock for lasting harmony and well-being.
