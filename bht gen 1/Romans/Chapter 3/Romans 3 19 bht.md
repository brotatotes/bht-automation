# Romans 3:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Scriptures, often regarded as a law of duty, condemn all. No one can justify themselves before God, for the law applies not only to the Jews but also to the Gentiles. It is not just the Mosaic law but the Old Testament as a whole that speaks to humanity. St. Paul appeals to both Scripture and reason to show that all stand guilty before God, with no excuse for their wrongdoing. These passages are not meant to make people feel criminal, but to reveal their true state.
