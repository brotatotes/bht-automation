# Romans 3:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse being described emphasizes the applicability of the Jewish Scriptures, including the law, prophets, and Psalms, to the Jews themselves. It reveals that the purpose of the scriptures is to bring the whole world, including the Jews, to recognize their guilt before God. Through the overwhelming evidence and the conviction of the law, every mouth is stopped from making excuses and every wrong ground of justification is cut off. Ultimately, the goal is not to condemn people, but to convict them of their need for forgiveness and redemption.
