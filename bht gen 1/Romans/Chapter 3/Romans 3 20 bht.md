### John Calvin:
1. "Seeing works are so far just before God as we seek by them to render to him worship and obedience, in order expressly to take away the power of justifying from all works, he has mentioned those, if there be any, which can possibly justify; for the law hath promises, without which there would be no value in our works before God."
2. "It is therefore a truth, which deserves to be remembered as the first in importance, — that by keeping the law no one can attain righteousness."
3. "The argument and the reasoning of the Apostle seem to require thatἐξ ἔργων νόμου should be rendered here literally, 'by works of law,' without the article, as the word 'law' seems here, according to the drift of the argument, to mean law in general, both natural and revealed; andδιὰ νόμου in the next clause must be regarded as having the same meaning; the law of nature as well as the written law, though not to the same extent, makes sin known."

3. "The word 'justified'... signifies to be acquitted, discharged, and made righteous in a legal sense, which can never be done by an imperfect obedience to the law."

### John Wesley:
1. "No flesh shall be justified — None shall be forgiven and accepted of God."
2. "By the works of the law — On this ground, that he hath kept the law."
