# Romans 3:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
No one can be justified or considered righteous through their own efforts in obeying the law. The purpose of the law is to reveal and make known our sins, serving as a mirror reflecting our sinful nature and actions. This comprehensive understanding of human guilt and the inability to self-justify highlights the necessity of God's grace for justification, as no one can be declared righteous solely by their adherence to the law. The law can only provide knowledge of sin, but not deliverance from its guilt or power.
