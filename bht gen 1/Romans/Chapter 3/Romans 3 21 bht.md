# Romans 3:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse described speaks of the manifestation of God's righteousness, which stands apart from works of the law and is received by faith alone. This righteousness is not a new discovery but is witnessed by both the Old Testament Scriptures and the law of Moses. It is a righteousness that comes from God, not from human effort, and is made known through the gospel. It is a righteousness that justifies and brings life to those who believe in Christ.
