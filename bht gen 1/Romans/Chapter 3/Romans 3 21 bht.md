# Romans 3:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Bible verse being described is a passage that talks about the righteousness of God. Commentators emphasize that this righteousness is separate from the law, as it does not depend on our obedience to the law. It is a righteousness that is given to believers by God in the act of justification. This righteousness is not a new concept but is predicted and foreshadowed in the Old Testament Scriptures. It is freely bestowed upon believers through Christ, fulfilling the promises found in both the law and the prophets.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "The righteousness of God... without the law... a righteousness to which our obedience to the law contributes nothing whatever."
2. "This justifying righteousness, though new, as only now fully disclosed, is an old righteousness, predicted and foreshadowed in the Old Testament."
3. "The Old Testament Scriptures attest to the manifestation of this righteousness."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The righteousness of God, or, 'God's righteousness.' As in chap. Romans 1:17, the article is wanting. The meaning here is precisely as there, a righteousness which proceeds from God; it is given to the believer for Christ's sake in the act of justification." 
2. "It is here characterized by a series of antitheses; independent of the law, yet authenticated by the law and the prophets (Romans 3:21); freely bestowed on the believer, yet fully paid for by the redemption price of Christ (Romans 3:24); intrinsically holy, yet justifying the sinner (Romans 3:26); thus God is displayed as Himself the righteous Ruler of the universe and the merciful Father who provides free salvation."
3. "This revelation of righteousness is set forth as an accomplished and still continued fact. It was not thus known before, and it is now known independently of the law."

### John Gill:
1. "The righteousness of God is without the law, either in its performance or in its manifestation."
2. "The law reveals sin, but not a righteousness that justifies from sin."
3. "The testimony to the justifying righteousness of Christ is found in both the law and the prophets."

### John Wesley:
1. "The righteousness of God...is manifested in the gospel." 
2. "Without the law...without reference to the law, or dependence on it."
3. "Being attested by the Law itself, and by the Prophets - By all the promises in the Old Testament."
