### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Faith of Jesus Christ." - This phrase is a common form for "faith in Christ," but it carries a subtle difference. It is unique to Paul and is found in Romans 10:12 and 1 Corinthians 14:7. It is better understood as a "distinction" rather than simply "faith in Christ."

2. "Difference [διαστολη]." - The Greek word used here, "διαστολη," can be translated as "difference" or "distinction." This highlights the uniqueness and significance of Paul's use of the phrase "faith of Jesus Christ."

3. "Better, as Rev., distinction." - The Revised Version translates the phrase as "distinction," which captures the essence of Paul's intention. This translation emphasizes the unique nature of the faith that Jesus Christ possessed and invites readers to consider the implications of this distinction.

### John Calvin:
1. "He shows in few words what this justification is, even that which is found in Christ and is apprehended by faith."
2. "When therefore we are justified, the efficient cause is the mercy of God, the meritorious is Christ, the instrumental is the word in connection with faith."
3. "Having been made partakers of Christ, we ourselves are not only just, but our works also are counted just before God, and for this reason, because whatever imperfections there may be in them, are obliterated by the blood of Christ."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Even the righteousness of God through faith, or, ‘a righteousness, however (mediated), through faith’ (Meyer); the article being omitted, as in Romans 3:21, before ‘righteousness.’ There is a contrast implied between ‘the righteousness of God’ in general, and this specific form."
2. "In Jesus Christ. Lit., ‘of Jesus Christ,’ but as He is the object of faith, the proper English expression is ‘in.’ To explain the whole phrase of Christ’s faithfulness to us, or of faith produced by Him, is opposed by Paul’s usage."
3. "For there is no distinction. This assigns the reason for what precedes. There is no other way for any; all must believe, in order to obtain this righteousness. There may be other points of difference among men, but as respects this point, there is no ‘distinction’ made in God’s dealing with them."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Through faith in Jesus Christ... The objective nature of faith in Christ is shown... as well as here by the added words 'unto all them that believe' in Jesus, Paul means." 

2. "The Jew was first in privilege as in penalty, but justification or setting right with God is offered to both on the same terms." 

3. "The distinction is between Jew and Gentile, not between faith and works."

### John Gill:
1. "Here it is said to be 'by faith of Jesus Christ'; not by that faith which Christ himself had as man, but by that faith, of which he the author and object."
2. "Faith is a means of apprehending and receiving righteousness; it views the excellency of Christ's righteousness; it owns the sufficiency of it; the soul by it renounces its own righteousness, submits to Christ's, rejoices in it, and gives him the glory of it."
3. "Though this character does not design any cause or condition of justification, but is only descriptive of the persons, who are declaratively interested in a justifying righteousness."

### John Wesley:
1. "There is no difference" - This phrase emphasizes the equality of all believers, regardless of their ethnic or cultural background. It highlights the inclusive nature of salvation, available to both Jews and Gentiles alike.

2. "The need of justification" - This phrase points to the universal need for justification before God. It highlights the fact that all people, regardless of their religious or cultural background, require the saving grace of God.

3. "The manner of it" - This phrase suggests that the process of justification is the same for all believers. It emphasizes that the means by which one is justified before God is not dependent on external factors but rather on faith in Jesus Christ.
