## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "By faith in Jesus Christ, the Gospel is brought near to all people, and it becomes a reality for all who believe." 
2. "All believers, without distinction or exception, are granted this justification through faith in Christ Jesus." 
3. "There is no difference among believers when it comes to receiving this justification."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Faith of Jesus Christ." - This phrase is a common form for "faith in Christ," but there is a subtle difference. It is used only by Paul in this passage and in Romans 10:12 and 1 Corinthians 14:7. The translation "distinction" is more accurate than "difference" as it highlights the unique aspect of this phrase.

2. "Faith in Christ." - The phrase "faith of Jesus Christ" emphasizes the faithfulness and trustworthiness of Jesus. It highlights the fact that it is through Jesus' own faith that believers are able to have faith in him. This understanding deepens our understanding of the relationship between Jesus and his followers.

3. "Distinction." - The use of the word "distinction" instead of "difference" emphasizes that the faith of Jesus Christ is not just a mere variation of faith in Christ. It signifies a unique aspect of Jesus' faith that sets him apart and makes him the object of our faith. This distinction is important in understanding the depth and significance of our faith in Jesus.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Even the righteousness of God through faith, or, 'a righteousness, however (mediated), through faith' (Meyer); the article being omitted, as in Romans 3:21, before 'righteousness.' There is a contrast implied between 'the righteousness of God' in general, and this specific form."
2. "In Jesus Christ. Lit., 'of Jesus Christ,' but as He is the object of faith, the proper English expression is 'in.' To explain the whole phrase of Christ's faithfulness to us, or of faith produced by Him, is opposed by Paul's usage."
3. "For there is no distinction. This assigns the reason for what precedes. There is no other way for any; all must believe, in order to obtain this righteousness. There may be other points of difference among men, but as respects this point, there is no 'distinction' made in God's dealing with them."

### John Gill:
1. "The righteousness of God, which is by faith of Jesus Christ, is a means of apprehending and receiving righteousness; it views the excellency of Christ's righteousness; it owns the sufficiency of it; the soul by it renounces its own righteousness, submits to Christ's, rejoices in it, and gives him the glory of it."

2. "This character does not design any cause or condition of justification, but is only descriptive of the persons, who are declaratively interested in a justifying righteousness."

3. "The righteousness is equally applied to one as to another, and one is as much justified by it in the sight of God as another."

### John Wesley:
1. "There is no difference" - This phrase emphasizes the equality of all believers, regardless of their background or ethnicity. It highlights the inclusive nature of faith in Christ, where all are equally in need of justification and can receive it through belief.

2. "The Jews" - This reference to the Jewish people highlights the historical context of the verse and reminds readers that the message of salvation was first offered to them. It serves as a reminder that God's plan of redemption encompasses all people, including those who were initially chosen as His people.

3. "The gentiles that believe" - This phrase emphasizes the importance of faith in receiving justification. It underscores that both Jews and gentiles can be justified through their belief in Christ, highlighting the universal nature of salvation and the equal opportunity for all to receive it.
