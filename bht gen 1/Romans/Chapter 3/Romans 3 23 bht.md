# Romans 3:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, it is emphasized that every person, without exception, has fallen short and failed to measure up to the glory of God. All have sinned, both in inherited sin from Adam and through personal choices and actions. This universal need for redemption highlights that there is no distinction between individuals based on their own merits, as no one can achieve righteousness and justify themselves before God. The verse presents the reality of humanity's sinful nature, the loss of the glorious image of God, and the need for redemption through faith.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "ὑστεροῦνται should be rendered fall short, not, as E. V., 'come short,' since this latter may be taken for the past tense, after the auxiliary 'have.'" 
2. "Of the praise which comes from God, see reff. (so Grot., Thol., Reiche, Fritz., Meyer, Rückert, De Wette): not, 'of praise in God's sight' (Luther, Calv., Estius, Köllner): nor, 'of glory with God,' as ch. Romans 5:2 (Œc, Beza, al.), for the Apostle is not speaking here of future reward, but of present worthiness."
3. "nor, of the glorious image of God which we have lost through sin (Calov., al., Rückert, Olsh.), which is against both the usage of the word, and the context of the passage."

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "There is absolutely no difference between the best and the worst of men, in the fact that 'all have sinned'." 
2. "All have come short of the glory of God, meaning they have failed to earn His approbation." 
3. "The best interpreters agree that all have failed to earn God's praise."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "For all have sinned - This was the point which he had fully established in the discussion in these chapters."
2. "Have come short - Greek, 'Are deficient in regard to;' are lacking, etc. Here it means, that they had failed to obtain, or were destitute of."
3. "The glory of God - The praise or approbation of God. They had sought to be justified, or approved, by God; but all had failed."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "They sinned, and therefore they are lacking." 
2. "The glory of God is used of the aggregate of the divine attributes and coincides with His self-revelation."
3. "The point under discussion is the want of righteousness. Unbelievers, or mere legalists, do not approve themselves before God by the righteousness which is of the law."

### John Calvin:
1. "There is no other way of attaining righteousness; for some cannot be justified in this and others in that way; but all must alike be justified by faith, because all are sinners, and therefore have nothing for which they can glory before God."
2. "Since we are all sinners, Paul concludes, that we are deficient in, or destitute of, the praise due to righteousness. There is then, according to what he teaches, no righteousness but what is perfect and absolute."
3. "It is then certain, there is no righteousness where there is sin, until Christ removes the curse; and this very thing is what is said in Galatians 3:10, that all who are under the law are exposed to the curse, and that we are delivered from it through the kindness of Christ."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "For all sinned; this is the historical fact, they became sinners."
2. "'Have sinned,' is not altogether objectionable, since it implies a relation to what precedes."
3. "Glory of God. This is variously explained as, glory before God, glory like God, glory from God. The last is preferable; His approval is meant, since the next verse closely joins the thought of justification."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "This tense gathers up the whole race into one statement (a timeless aorist)." 
2. "Present middle indicative of υστερεω, to be υστερος (comparative) too late, continued action, still fall short."
3. "It is followed by the ablative case as here, the case of separation."

### John Gill:
1. "All have sinned in Adam, are guilty by his sin, polluted with it, and condemned for it."
2. "There is no difference in the state and condition of men by nature; nor is there any reason from and in themselves, why God saves one and not another."
3. "Sin has made him infamous, and is his shame; by it he has forfeited all external favours, and has nothing of his own to glory in."

### John Wesley:
1. "For all have sinned — In Adam, and in their own persons; by a sinful nature, sinful tempers, and sinful actions." 

2. "And are fallen short of the glory of God — The supreme end of man; short of his image on earth, and the enjoyment of him in heaven." 

3. "In Adam, humanity inherited a sinful nature, and through personal choices and actions, all have fallen short of the glory of God."
