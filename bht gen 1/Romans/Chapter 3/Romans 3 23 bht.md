# Romans 3:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
"All have sinned, failing to earn God's praise and approval, and are guilty, polluted, and condemned. There is no difference in the state of all men, regardless of their best or worst qualities. They have fallen short of the glory of God, lacking His image on earth and the ultimate enjoyment of Him in heaven. Man's own righteousness is insufficient, and he must rely on a better righteousness for salvation."
