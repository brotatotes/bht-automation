## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "justified freely—without anything done on our part to deserve."
2. "by his grace—His free love."
3. "though justification is quite gratuitous, it is not a mere fiat of the divine will, but based on a 'Redemption,' that is, 'the payment of a Ransom,' in Christ's death."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Because they are all in this condition (fallen short of the glory of God), if they are justified it is in this way, namely, freely; as a gift, not by their own merit."
2. "God's grace, i.e., His unmerited favor. His love to the sinner, is the efficient cause of justification."
3. "The word 'redemption,' meant first of all, release or deliverance of captives from a state of misery or danger by the payment of a ransom as an equivalent."

### John Gill:
1. "The moving cause of it is the free grace of God; for by 'the grace of God' here, is not meant the Gospel, or what some men call the terms of the Gospel, and the constitution of it; nor the grace of God infused into the heart; but the free love and favour of God, as it is in his heart; which is wonderfully displayed in the business of a sinner's justification before him."

2. "The meritorious cause of justification is the redemption that is in Jesus Christ: redemption supposes a former state of captivity to sin, Satan, and the law, in which God's elect were by nature, and is a deliverance from it; it is of a spiritual nature, chiefly respects the soul, and is plenteous, complete, and eternal."

3. "Nor is this any objection or contradiction to the free grace of God, in a sinner's justification; since it was grace in God to provide, send, and part with his Son as a Redeemer, and to work out righteousness; it was grace in Christ, to come and give himself a sacrifice, and obtain salvation and righteousness, not for angels, but for men, and for some of them, and not all; and whatever this righteousness, salvation, and redemption cost Christ, they are all free to men."

### John Wesley:
1. "And are justified - Pardoned and accepted."
2. "Freely - Without any merit of their own."
3. "It is not possible to find words that should more absolutely exclude all consideration of our own works and obedience, or more emphatically ascribe the whole of our justification to free, unmerited goodness."
