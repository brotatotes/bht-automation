# Romans 3:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This verse describes the incredible truth of justification by faith. It emphasizes the insufficiency of our own efforts to attain God's glory and highlights the free, undeserved nature of our salvation. Justification is a result of God's grace and is not based on our own merit or works. It is a powerful redemption through the death of Christ, a releasing from captivity to sin, and a deliverance granted through the payment of a ransom. This passage affirms that our righteousness and freedom from sin are solely a product of God's mercy and love.

3. "though justification is quite gratuitous, it is not a mere fiat of the divine will, but based on a 'Redemption,' that is, 'the payment of a Ransom,' in Christ's death."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Being justified - Being treated as if righteous; that is, being regarded and treated as if they had kept the Law."
2. "To them it is a mere undeserved gift, It does not mean that it has been obtained, however, without any price or merit from anyone, for the Lord Jesus has purchased it with his own blood."
3. "The word used here denotes that deliverance from sin, and from the evil consequences of sin, which has been effected by the offering of Jesus Christ as a propitiation."

1. "Being justified. The fact that they are justified in this extraordinary way shows that they must have sinned."
2. "Freely [δωρεαν]. Gratuitously."
3. "The distinction must be carefully maintained between this word and lutron ransom. The Vulgate, by translating both redemptio, confounds the work of Christ with its result."

### John Calvin:
1. "That since there remains nothing for men, as to themselves, but to perish, being smitten by the just judgment of God, they are to be justified freely through his mercy."
2. "There is, perhaps, no passage in the whole Scripture which illustrates in a more striking manner the efficacy of his righteousness."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Because they are all in this condition (fallen short of the glory of God), if they are justified it is in this way, namely, freely; as a gift, not by their own merit."

4. "Freedom from sin is the consequence of the ‘redemption’ here spoken of, but the ‘redemption’ itself is an essential part of the work of Christ."
5. "Every mode of conception, which refers redemption and the forgiveness of sins not to a real atonement through the death of Christ, but subjectively to the dying and reviving with Him guaranteed and produced by that death, is opposed to the New Testament, a mixing up of justification and sanctification."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Being justified... each being set right." 
2. "Freely... God's free gift." 
3. "Through the redemption... a releasing by ransom."

### John Gill:
1. "The moving cause of [justification] is the free grace of God; for by 'the grace of God' here, is not meant the Gospel, or what some men call the terms of the Gospel, and the constitution of it; nor the grace of God infused into the heart; but the free love and favour of God, as it is in his heart; which is wonderfully displayed in the business of a sinner's justification before him."
2. "The meritorious cause of justification is the redemption that is in Jesus Christ: redemption supposes a former state of captivity to sin, Satan, and the law, in which God's elect were by nature, and is a deliverance from it; it is of a spiritual nature, chiefly respects the soul, and is plenteous, complete, and eternal."
3. "Now, as all the blessings of grace come through redemption by Christ, so does this of justification, and after this manner; Christ, as a Redeemer, had the sins of his people laid on him, and they were bore by him, and took away; the sentence of the law's condemnation was executed on him, as standing in their legal place and stead; and satisfaction was made by him for all offences committed by them, which was necessary, that God might appear to be just, in justifying all them that believe."

### John Wesley:
1. "And are justified — Pardoned and accepted."
2. "By his grace — Not their own righteousness or works."
3. "It is not possible to find words that should more absolutely exclude all consideration of our own works and obedience, or more emphatically ascribe the whole of our justification to free, unmerited goodness."
