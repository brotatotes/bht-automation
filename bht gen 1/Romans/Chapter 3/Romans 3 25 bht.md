2. "the sins committed under the old economy, before Christ came to 'put away sin by the sacrifice of Himself.'" - This clarifies that the sins referred to as "past" are not the sins committed by believers before coming to Christ, but rather the sins committed before Christ's sacrifice.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "God has publicly exhibited Jesus Christ as a propitiatory sacrifice for the sins of people. This public exhibition was made by his being offered on the cross, in the face of angels and of people."

1. "Set forth [προεθετο]. Publicly, openly [προ]; correlated with to declare. He brought Him forth and put Him before the public. Bengel, 'placed before the eyes of all;' unlike the ark of the covenant which was veiled and approached only by the high - priest."
2. "Propitiation [ιλαστηριον]. This word is most important, since it is the key to the conception of Christ's atoning work. In the New Testament it occurs only here and Hebrews 9:5; and must be studied in connection with the following kindred words: iJlaskomai which occurs in the New Testament only Luke 18:13, God be merciful, and Hebrews 2:17, to make reconciliation."
3. "The true meaning of the offering of Christ concentrates, therefore, not upon divine justice, but upon human character; not upon the remission of penalty for a consideration, but upon the deliverance from penalty through moral transformation; not upon satisfying divine justice, but upon bringing estranged man into harmony with God."

### John Calvin:
1. "God, without having regard to Christ, is always angry with us, — and that we are reconciled to him when we are accepted through his righteousness."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The atoning death of Christ is the ground of the 'reconciliation'...since it satisfies the demands of Divine justice on the one hand, and on the other draws men to God."
2. "This setting forth of Christ as a propitiatory sacrifice took place in the shedding of His blood...the reality is the atoning death of Christ, which really removes the guilt of sin."
3. "God's judicial (or punitive) righteousness...the death of Christ shows how He hates sin, while He saves sinners."

### John Gill:
1. "Christ is the propitiation to God for sin; which must be understood of his making satisfaction to divine justice, for the sins of his people; these were imputed to him, and being found on him, the law and justice of God made demands on him for them; which he answered to satisfaction, by his obedience and sacrifice."
2. "Christ has not, by his sacrifice and death, procured the love and favour of God, but has removed the obstructions which lay in the way of love's appearing and breaking forth; there was, a law broken, and justice provoked, which were to be attended to, and Christ by his sacrifice has satisfied both; so that neither the wrath of God, nor any of the effects of it, can fall upon the persons Christ is the propitiation for, even according to justice itself; so that it is not love, but justice that is made propitious."
3. "The 'blood' of Christ is that, by which Christ is the propitiation; for without the shedding of that blood, there is no redemption, no peace, no reconciliation, or remission of sin; and 'faith' in his blood is the means by which persons become partakers of the benefits of his propitiation; such as peace, pardon, atonement, justification, and adoption."

And, if so, Christ died in vain." - This quote highlights the significance of Jesus' sacrifice as a propitiation, or an offering to satisfy God's justice. It challenges the notion that God was never offended, emphasizing the necessity of Christ's death.
