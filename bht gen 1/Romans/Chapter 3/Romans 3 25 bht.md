### Philip Schaff:

2. "The entire thought is purely expiatory; the figure is that of doing away guilt by blood; the reality is the atoning death of Christ, which really removes the guilt of sin."

### John Gill:
1. "Redemption by Christ is here further explained, by his being 'a propitiation': which word may design either Christ the propitiator, the author of peace and reconciliation; or the propitiatory sacrifice, by which he is so; and both in allusion to the mercy seat, which was a type of him as such."
2. "Christ is the propitiation to God for sin; which must be understood of his making satisfaction to divine justice, for the sins of his people; these were imputed to him, and being found on him, the law and justice of God made demands on him for them; which he answered to satisfaction, by his obedience and sacrifice."
3. "The 'blood' of Christ is that, by which Christ is the propitiation; for without the shedding of that blood, there is no redemption, no peace, no reconciliation, or remission of sin; and 'faith' in his blood is the means by which persons become partakers of the benefits of his propitiation; such as peace, pardon, atonement, justification, and adoption."
