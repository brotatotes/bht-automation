# Romans 3:26 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the righteousness of God is revealed through the exhibition of His justice and mercy. God demonstrates His integrity by justifying the guilty through faith in Jesus, as it is through Christ's blood that sinners find pardon and deliverance. This demonstration of righteousness in the Gospel plan of salvation showcases God's character as both just and justifier. Through the death of Christ, Divine justice is satisfied, sin is punished, and the sinner is saved, all while preserving the attribute of justice that God upholds.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The shewing forth that He was righteous throughout His dealings with the whole world, by means of setting forth an adequate and complete propitiation in the death of Christ, was towards, formed a subsidiary manifestation to, His great manifestation of His righteousness under the Gospel." 
2. "The whole present concern is with ἔνδειξις, the exhibition to men of the righteousness of God."
3. "In order that He may be (shewn to be) just and (yet, on the other side) justifying him who is of (the) faith in Jesus."

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Just in punishing," and "merciful in pardoning," men can understand; but "just in justifying the guilty," startles them.
2. The propitiation through faith in Christ's blood resolves the paradox and harmonizes the discordant elements.
3. It is on the atoning blood of Christ, as the one propitiatory sacrifice which God hath set forth to the eye of the guilty, that the faith of the convinced and trembling sinner fastens for deliverance from wrath.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The word 'just' here does not mean benevolent, or merciful, though it may sometimes have that meaning... But it refers to the fact that God had retained the integrity of his character as a moral governor; that he had shown a due regard to his Law, and to the penalty of the Law by his plan of salvation." 
2. "He has shown that if sinners do not avail themselves of the offer of pardon by Jesus Christ, they must experience in their own souls forever the pains which this substitute for sinners endured in behalf of people on the cross." 
3. "Even while pardoning, and treating the ill-deserving as if they were innocent, he can retain his pure and holy character... He shows no less regard to his law in pardoning than in punishing. This is the grand, glorious, special feature of the gospel plan of salvation."

### John Calvin:
1. "Nothing is more difficult than to persuade man that he ought to disclaim all things as his own, and to ascribe them all to God."
2. "The coming of Christ was the time of his good pleasure, and the day of salvation."
3. "The righteousness of God shines in us, whenever he justifies us by faith in Christ; for in vain were Christ given us for righteousness, unless there was the fruition of him by faith."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "By setting forth Christ, in His blood, as a propitiation, to be appropriated by faith, God not only demonstrated His judicial righteousness which had been obscured in past ages, but also and mainly, He accomplished this purpose and result, that His own character was displayed, as just and justifier, as righteous and accounting righteous him that hath faith in Christ." 

2. "God could not show Himself righteous in any simpler way than by making men righteous; the gospel paradox is that He is righteous and accounting righteous believing sinners." 

3. "In the death of Christ, God punished sin and saved the sinner; Divine justice was vindicated in the culminating act of redeeming love."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "This is the key phrase which establishes the connexion between the δικαιοσυνη θεου and the δικαιοσυνη εκ πιστεως" (Sanday and Headlam).
2. "Nowhere has Paul put the problem of God more acutely or profoundly."
3. "To pronounce the unrighteous righteous is unjust by itself (Romans 4:5)."

### John Gill:
1. "To declare, I say, at this time, his righteousness... under the Gospel dispensation; in which there was such a display of the grace, mercy, and goodness of God." 
2. "God is naturally and essentially just in himself; and he is evidentially so in all his works, particularly in redemption by Christ."
3. "God is the justifier of such in a declarative way, and God only, though not to the exclusion of the Son and Spirit."

### John Wesley:
1. "For a demonstration of his righteousness — Both of his justice and mercy."
2. "That he might be just — Showing his justice on his own Son. And yet the merciful justifier of every one that believeth in Jesus."
3. "The attribute of justice must be preserved inviolate; and inviolate it is preserved, if there was a real infliction of punishment on our Saviour."
