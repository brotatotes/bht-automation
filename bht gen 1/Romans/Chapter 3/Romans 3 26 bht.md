# Romans 3:26 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the Gospel dispensation, God declares His righteousness, showcasing both His justice and mercy. Through the propitiation of Christ's blood, God resolves the paradox, displaying His justice in punishing sin and His mercy in justifying the guilty. The death of Christ vindicates Divine justice and becomes the foundation on which the faith of trembling sinners rests for deliverance. God is revealed as the righteous and justifier, both appearing just and accounting righteous those who have faith in Christ.
