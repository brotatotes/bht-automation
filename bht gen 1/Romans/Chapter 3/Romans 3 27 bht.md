# Romans 3:27 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the contrast is made between the law of works and the law of faith. Boasting is completely excluded, as salvation is not achieved through personal achievements or merit. Faith, rather than works, is the condition for acceptance by God. This emphasizes the need for all individuals, regardless of their background, to come to God as guilty and helpless sinners, relying solely on His mercy and grace for salvation.

2. "By what law?—on what principle or scheme? of works? Nay; but by the law of faith." - This quote emphasizes that the law of faith is the guiding principle, rather than the law of works.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Since all have sinned, and since all have failed of being able to justify themselves by obeying the Law, and since all are alike dependent on the mere mercy of God in Christ, all ground of boasting is of course taken away."

### John Calvin:
1. "But he says that glorying is beyond all doubt excluded, for we cannot adduce anything of our own, which is worthy of being approved or commended by God."
2. "If the material of glorying be merit, whether you name that of congruity or of condignity, by which man would conciliate God, you see that both are here annihilated."
3. "This contrast between faith and works ought to be carefully noticed: works are here mentioned without any limitation, even works universally."

Note: The commentary is quite lengthy, so I have selected three quotes that capture the essence of the author's argument.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "In view of this manifestation of God’s righteousness apart from the law, the Jew cannot boast."
2. "By what kind of a law? This refers to the exclusion, which must have taken place according to some rule or principle revealed by God."
3. "A law of faith; i.e., a law that requires faith. 'The contrast is not here between the law and the gospel as two dispensations, but between the law of works and the law of faith.'"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "It is completely shut out." - The verse emphasizes that glorying is excluded and cannot be achieved by human effort alone. 

2. "By a law of faith." - The commentary highlights the concept of a "law of faith," which suggests that faith operates according to a principle that aligns with God's love and grace. 

3. "By the principle of faith in harmony with God's love and grace." - This quote further expands on the idea that faith operates in accordance with God's love and grace, emphasizing the importance of aligning one's faith with these principles.

### John Gill:
1. "There is no room nor reason for it, either in Jews or Gentiles."
2. "It is excluded; it is shut out of doors; the key is turned upon it; it is not allowed of; it is entirely exploded."
3. "By what law? of works? nay; for, that establishes boasting when men seek life, righteousness, and salvation by the works of it."

These quotes emphasize that boasting has no place in the lives of both Jews and Gentiles. It is completely excluded and rejected, as it goes against the law of faith. Seeking righteousness through works only leads to boasting, but through faith in Christ's righteousness, there is no room for boasting in the creature, only in Christ.

1. "By what law? of works? Nay - This would have left room for boasting." - The commentary highlights that the law of works, where one can boast about their own accomplishments, is excluded. This emphasizes that salvation is not based on human effort or achievements.

2. "The law of faith is that divine constitution which makes faith, not works, the condition of acceptance." - The commentary explains that the law of faith is the principle that faith, rather than works, is the requirement for acceptance by God. This emphasizes the importance of trusting in God's mercy and grace.

3. "Since this requires all, without distinction, to apply as guilty and helpless sinners, to the free mercy of God in Christ." - The commentary emphasizes that the law of faith applies to everyone, regardless of their background or status. It highlights the need for all individuals to recognize their own sinfulness and rely on God's mercy through Christ.
