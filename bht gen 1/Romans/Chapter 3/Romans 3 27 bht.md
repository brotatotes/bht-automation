# Romans 3:27 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, boasting and pride are clearly excluded from the equation. Salvation is not obtained through works or adherence to a set of rules, but rather by the law of faith. This law of faith is a divine constitution that requires all, without distinction, to come to God as guilty and helpless sinners, relying on His free mercy in Christ. In recognizing the exclusion of boasting, we grasp the importance of humility and the centrality of faith in the Christian faith.
