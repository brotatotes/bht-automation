# Romans 3:28 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse being described focuses on the concept of justification through faith. The commentators emphasize that relying on our own works for acceptance with God leads to boasting. Instead, faith receives a righteousness that makes the sinner just, a unique way of salvation applicable to all. Faith, as the alone instrument of justification, is accompanied by other saving graces and worketh by love. The verse asserts that a man is justified by faith, emphasizing that faith is not just another work, but the means by which one receives Christ and is justified, something different from all other human works.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "It is the unavoidable tendency of dependence upon our own works, less or more, for acceptance with God, to beget a spirit of 'boasting.'" 
2. "Our faith receives a righteousness that makes the sinner just." 
3. "This and no other way of salvation is adapted alike to Jew and Gentile."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "That a man is justified by faith - Is regarded and treated as righteous, by believing in the Lord Jesus Christ."
2. "No righteousness of their own will be the ground of their justification. They are sinners; and as such can have no claim to be treated as righteous."
3. "This is the grand uniqueness of the Christian religion. This was the special point in the reformation from popery. Luther often called this doctrine of justification by faith the article upon which the church stood or fell."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Glorying is excluded by the law of faith, for (we have already proved and hence) we reckon, etc."
2. "This principle has already been established (Romans 3:21-26); and is re-stated here to furnish a basis for the argument against the pride of the Jew."
3. "The emphasis rests on 'faith,' which 'is the alone instrument of justification; yet it is not alone in the person justified, but is ever accompanied with all other saving graces, and is no dead faith, but worketh by love.'"

### John Gill:
1. "The subject of justification is, 'man', to show that Christ's righteousness is unto all, and every man, that believes, be he who he will."
2. "The means is 'by faith', either organically, as it is a means of receiving Christ's righteousness; or objectively, as it denotes Christ the object of it."
3. "All this is done 'without works', not by a faith which is without works, but by faith without works joined to it, in the affair of justification."
