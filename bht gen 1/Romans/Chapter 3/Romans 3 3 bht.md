## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "And this advantage is not cancelled, nor the covenant annulled, by their disobedience."
2. "For what? The γάρ confirms the preceding, the τί indicates some difficulty, or anticipated objection to it."
3. "If we place an interrogation at γάρ, we must render this, suppose some were unfaithful; if only a comma, as in E. V., 'For what if…' The former seems preferable, as more according to usage."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "It is the unbelief of the great body of the nation which the apostle points at; but as it sufficed for his argument to put the supposition thus gently, he uses this word 'some' to soften prejudice." 
2. "Shall their unbelief make the faith of God—or, 'faithfulness of God'—nullify, invalidate it." 
3. "The unbelief of some does not diminish or undermine the faithfulness of God."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "What then? or what follows? if it be admitted that some of the nation did not believe, does it not follow that the faithfulness of God in his promises will fail?"
2. "Did not the fact that God chose them as his people, and entered into covenant with them, imply that the Jews should be kept from perdition?"

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The Rev. rendering is preferable, as bringing out the paronomasia between the Greek words: were without faith; their want of faith; the faithfulness of God."
2. "Faith of God. Better, as Rev., faithfulness; the good faith of God; His fidelity to His promises."
3. "The radical meaning is to make inert or idle. Dr. Morison acutely observes that it negatives the idea of agency or operation, rather than of result or effect. It is rather to make inefficient than to make without effect."

### John Calvin:
1. "Shall their unbelief, etc. Καταργεῖν is properly to render void and ineffectual; a meaning most suitable to this passage."
2. "The meaning then is, 'Since most of the Jews are covenant-breakers, is God’s covenant so abrogated by their perfidiousness that it brings forth no fruit among them?'"
3. "But this cannot be, except when the promise is received by faith; for it is in this way that a mutual covenant is on both sides confirmed."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Such objections would be addressed to the Apostle continually, as he labored, more or less assailed by Jewish opposition."
2. "We prefer (2), and find an objection growing out of the unbelief of the Jews at that time, which is more fully discussed in chaps. 9-11."

### Archibald T Robertson:

1. "Though the Jews enjoyed such a privilege, some of them did not believe; which is an aggravation of their sin, that they should have such means of light, knowledge, and faith, such clear and full evidences of things, and yet be incredulous."
