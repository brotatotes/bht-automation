3. "To understand τῆς πίστεως as referring to πίστεως just mentioned 'by the instrumentality of the identical faith which operates in the case of the circumcised,' is to contradict the fact: the faith was not, strictly speaking, identical in this sense, or the two cases never need have been distinguished."
