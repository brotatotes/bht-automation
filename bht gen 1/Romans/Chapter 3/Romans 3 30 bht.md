# Romans 3:30 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we see how God, who is one and unified, justifies both Jews and Gentiles alike. His mercy extends to all people, showing that His love is not limited by one's background or status. The act of mercy itself is emphasized, reminding us that it is not earned, but freely given by God. Furthermore, this mercy is consistent and accessible to all, demonstrated through a common means that is not dependent on human efforts or achievements.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "It is one God who shall justify - 'has unchangeably fixed that He shall justify.'" 
2. "The circumcision by - 'of' faith, and the uncircumcision through faith - probably this is but a varied statement of the same truth for greater emphasis." 
3. "The justification of the Jews, as the born heirs of the promise, may be here purposely said to be 'of faith,' while that of the Gentiles, previously 'strangers to the covenants of promise,' may be said to be 'through faith,' as thus admitted into a new family."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The unity of God implies that He is God, not merely of the Jews, but also of the Gentiles; for otherwise another special Deity must rule over the Gentiles, which would do away with monotheism." 
2. "The unity of God's being involves the uniformity of His method of justification. If God is one, there can be no contradictory revelations from God."
3. "Christianity, based equally with Judaism upon monotheism, cannot admit of being one among several religions equally true."

### John Gill:
1. "God is one in nature and essence, though there are three persons in the Godhead."
2. "God, as he is one in nature, so he is one in will, in his promises, and in the methods of his grace."
3. "The objects of justification are 'the circumcision', the circumcised Jews, and 'the uncircumcision', the uncircumcised Gentiles; the circumcision of the one does not forward, and the uncircumcision of the other does not hinder, nor neither of them effect the grace of justification."

### John Wesley:
1. "One God who shows mercy to both" - This quote highlights the unity of God's mercy towards all people, regardless of their differences or backgrounds. It emphasizes that God's love and compassion are not limited to a select few, but extend to all of humanity.

2. "Shows mercy to both" - This phrase emphasizes the act of mercy itself, reminding us that God's compassion is not based on merit or deservingness. It underscores the unconditional nature of God's love and the willingness to extend grace to all, regardless of their past actions or circumstances.

3. "By the very same means" - This statement suggests that God's mercy is not arbitrary or inconsistent, but is consistently demonstrated through a specific means. It implies that God's mercy is not dependent on human efforts or achievements, but is made available to all through a common channel, perhaps through the sacrifice of Jesus Christ.
