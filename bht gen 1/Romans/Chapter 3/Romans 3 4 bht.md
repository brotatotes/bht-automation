## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Let us believe all men on earth to have broken their word and truth, than God His. Whatever becomes of men and their truth, His truth must stand fast."
2. "The citation which follows goes to the depth of the matter. It is the penitent confession of a sinner, that he is sensible how entirely against God his sin has been, and how clearly his own unworthiness sets God’s judgment against sin vindicated before him."
3. "That thou mightest be justified (shewn to be just) in thy sayings (sentences, words of judgment), and mightest conquer when Thou art judged."

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "God forbid—literally, 'Let it not be,' that is, 'Away with such a thought'—a favorite expression of our apostle, when he would not only repudiate a supposed consequence of his doctrine, but express his abhorrence of it."
2. "The Scriptures do not authorize such a use of God's name as must have been common among the English translators of the Bible."
3. "Yea, let God be held true, and every man a liar—that is, even though it should follow from this that every man is a liar."
4. "When thou art judged—that we are to vindicate the righteousness of God, at whatever expense to ourselves."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Let not this be. The sense is, 'let not this by any means be supposed.' This is the answer of the apostle, showing that no such consequence followed from his doctrines; and that 'if' any such consequence should follow, the doctrine should be at once abandoned, and that every man, no matter who, should be rather esteemed false than God."
2. "Let God be esteemed true and faithful, whatever consequence may follow. This was a first principle, and should be now, that God should be believed to be a God of truth, whatever consequence it might involve."
3. "Though every man and every other opinion should be found to be false. Of course this included the apostle and his reasoning; and the expression is one of those which show his magnanimity and greatness of soul. It implies that every opinion which he and all others held; every doctrine which had been defended; should be at once abandoned, if it implied that God was false."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "God forbid" expresses a strong aversion, a rejection of a thought or inference drawn from Paul's arguments by an opponent.
2. "Let God be true" emphasizes the idea that God should be found true or proven to be true by His creatures.
3. "Be justified" refers to the forensic figure of God's justice being put on trial, where God is acknowledged as righteous.

### John Calvin:
1. "God is true, not only because he is prepared to stand faithfully to his promises, but because he also really fulfills whatever he declares; for he so speaks, that his command becomes a reality."
2. "So far is it that the truth of God is destroyed by our falsehood and unfaithfulness, that it thereby shines forth and appears more evident."
3. "Since all the sins of mortals must serve to illustrate the glory of the Lord, and since he is especially glorified by his truth, it follows, that even the falsehood of men serves to confirm rather than to subvert his truth."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "God forbid, or, 'let it never be' (far from it). The expression is used in animated discussions, fourteen times by Paul (ten times in this Epistle), and elsewhere in the New Testament (Luke 20:16). It is an indignant denial, including pious horror, and hence is equivalent to the English phrase 'God forbid.'" 

2. "Yea, let God be (lit., 'become') true. The only question here is whether Paul refers to what God is, or what He is proven to be. The latter seems to accord better with the word 'become,' and suits the context best. Hence we explain: be seen and acknowledged, even by His enemies, to be truthful."

3. "Every man who is unfaithful is a liar, but the reference is to the recognition of the fact. 'Rather let us believe all men on earth to have broken their word and troth, than God His. Whatever becomes of men and their truth His truth must stand fast.'"

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Let God continue to be true" - The imperative form of the verb emphasizes the ongoing nature of God's truthfulness.
2. "Though every man be found a liar" - The contrast highlights the fallibility of human beings in contrast to the unwavering truth of God.
3. "Used of God this verb here has to mean 'declared righteous,' not 'made righteous'" - The commentary clarifies the meaning of the verb "justified" in the context, emphasizing that it refers to being declared righteous by God rather than being made righteous.

Note: The commentary provided is quite brief, and there are not many substantial quotes to extract. However, these quotes capture the main points of the commentary.

### John Gill:
1. "Let no such thing ever enter into the minds of any, that the truth of God can be, or will be made of none effect by the want of faith in man; let it be always asserted and abode by; that God is true, faithful to his word, constant in his promises, and will always fulfil his purposes." 
2. "God made a promise to David, that of the fruit of his body he would set upon his throne; that the Messiah should spring from him; that he would of his seed raise up unto Israel a Saviour. Now David sinned greatly in the case of Bathsheba, but his sin did not make of no effect the truth and faithfulness of God."
3. "This now is brought as a full proof, and is a full proof of this truth, that God is always true to his word, though men fail in theirs, and fall into sin."

### John Wesley:
1. "The verse highlights the sovereignty and power of God, emphasizing that He sits enthroned in heaven and laughs at the futile attempts of rebellious humans to defy His authority."
2. "This verse reminds us that God's laughter is not one of amusement, but rather a response to the arrogance and foolishness of those who oppose Him."
3. "In the face of human rebellion, God's laughter serves as a reminder of His ultimate victory and the futility of any opposition to His divine plan."
