## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "God forbid—literally, 'Let it not be,' that is, 'Away with such a thought'—a favorite expression of our apostle, when he would not only repudiate a supposed consequence of his doctrine, but express his abhorrence of it." 
2. "The Scriptures do not authorize such a use of God's name as must have been common among the English translators of the Bible." 
3. "Yea, let God be held true, and every man a liar—that is, even though it should follow from this that every man is a liar."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "God forbid, or, 'let it never be' (far from it). The expression is used in animated discussions, fourteen times by Paul (ten times in this Epistle), and elsewhere in the New Testament (Luke 20:16). It is an indignant denial, including pious horror, and hence is equivalent to the English phrase 'God forbid.'" 
2. "Yea, let God be (lit., 'become') true. The only question here is whether Paul refers to what God is, or what He is proven to be. The latter seems to accord better with the word 'become,' and suits the context best. Hence we explain: be seen and acknowledged, even by His enemies, to be truthful."
3. "Every man who is unfaithful is a liar, but the reference is to the recognition of the fact. 'Rather let us believe all men on earth to have broken their word and troth, than God His. Whatever becomes of men and their truth His truth must stand fast.'"

### John Wesley:
1. "The verse highlights the sovereignty and power of God, emphasizing that He sits in the heavens and laughs at the futile attempts of humans to rebel against Him."

2. "This verse reminds us that God is not threatened or surprised by the rebellious actions of mankind. He is in control and has the final say in all matters."

3. "The laughter of God in this verse can be seen as a response to the arrogance and foolishness of those who oppose Him. It serves as a reminder that God's plans and purposes will ultimately prevail."
