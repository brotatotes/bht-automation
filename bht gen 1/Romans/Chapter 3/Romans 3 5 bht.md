# Romans 3:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this passage, there is a contemplation about the relationship between human unrighteousness and God's righteousness. The concept is raised that if our unrighteousness ultimately glorifies God, then it would be unjust of Him to punish us for it. This challenges our understanding of justice and prompts us to consider the complexity of God's ways. There is an acknowledgement of the limitations of human understanding and a call to approach theological questions with humility and reverence. It reminds us that our perspective is limited and that we should embrace a posture of submission to God's Word.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The penitent regarded his sin as having been the instrument of bringing out God’s justice into clearer light."
2. "It would almost seem as if God would be unjust in inflicting His wrath on men whose very impiety has been the means whereby His own righteousness has been shown forth and established."
3. "Said, as elsewhere by Paul, to excuse a supposition bearing with it an aspect of inconsistency or impiety."

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "The more faithless we are, so much the more illustrious will the fidelity of God appear." 

2. "For Him to take vengeance on us for our unfaithfulness would be unrighteousness in God." 

3. "God's faithfulness is not dependent on our faithfulness."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "But if our unrighteousness - If our sin. The particular sin which had been specified Romans 3:3 was 'unbelief.' But the apostle here gives the objection a general form."
2. "This is to be regarded as an objection which a Jew might make. The force of it is this: But God was true to his promises. Notwithstanding their sin, God’s character was the same."
3. "The righteousness of God - His just and holy character. This was the effect on David’s mind, that he saw more clearly the justice of God in his threatenings against sin, in consequence of his own transgression."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Commend is the prevailing sense in the New Testament, though in some instances the two ideas blend, as Romans 5:8; 2 Corinthians 7:11; Galatians 2:18." 
2. "Rev., much better, who visiteth with wrath. Lit., bringeth the anger to bear." 
3. "The phrase is thrown in apologetically, under a sense that the mode of speech is unworthy of the subject."

### John Calvin:
1. "Hence Paul could not have covertly passed it by; but that no one should think that he expressed the sentiments of his own mind, he premises that he assumes the person of the ungodly."
2. "And thus indeed it is, for all the mysteries of God are paradoxes to the flesh: and at the same time it possesses so much audacity, that it fears not to oppose them and insolently to assail what it cannot comprehend."
3. "We are hence reminded, that if we desire to become capable of understanding them, we must especially labor to become freed from our own reason, and to give up ourselves, and unreservedly submit to his word."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Our unrighteousness. The opposite of ‘righteousness;’ here used quite generally."
2. "The righteousness of God. Here His character or attribute."
3. "I speak after the manner of men. This parenthetical clause is a third protest against the wrong conclusion, which is directly denied in Romans 3:6."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "What shall we say?" - Rhetorical question, common with Paul as he surveys the argument.
2. "Commendeth" - This common verb συνιστημ, to send together, occurs in the N.T. in two senses, either to introduce, to commend or to prove, to establish. Either makes good sense here.
3. "Who visiteth the wrath" - "Who brings on the wrath," "the inflicter of the anger" (Vaughan).

### John Gill:
1. "Hence it appears, that the unrighteousness of men commends the righteousness, or faithfulness of God."
2. "This can only be understood of the manifestation and illustration of the righteousness of God by it; which is covered and commended, in punishing the unrighteousness of men; in setting forth Christ to be a propitiation for sin; and in fulfilling his promises, notwithstanding the failings of his people."
3. "Shall we allow the following question to be put? Is God unrighteous, who taketh vengeance? If the premises are true, this is a just consequence of them; whereas God does take vengeance on men for their unrighteousness, both here and hereafter, it must be a piece of unrighteousness in him so to do."

### John Wesley:
1. "If our unrighteousness be subservient to God's glory, is it not unjust in him to punish us for it?" - This quote raises the question of whether it is fair for God to punish us for our unrighteousness if it ultimately serves His glory. It challenges our understanding of justice and prompts us to consider the complexity of God's ways.

2. "I speak as a man - As human weakness would be apt to speak." - This quote acknowledges the limitations of human understanding and highlights the need for humility when grappling with theological questions. It reminds us that our perspective is limited and that we should approach these matters with a sense of reverence and humility.

3. "I speak as a man" - This short quote emphasizes the humility of the speaker, acknowledging that their understanding is limited and finite. It serves as a reminder that our human comprehension of God's ways is limited and that we should approach theological questions with humility and reverence.
