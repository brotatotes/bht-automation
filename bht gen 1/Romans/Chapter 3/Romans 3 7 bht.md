# Romans 3:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, we are reminded of the preciousness of the Scriptures. It is evident that the oracles of God hold great value, and they are a crucial aspect of the Church. Despite the complexities surrounding divine administration and the truths of the Bible, this passage provides us with steadfast principles that form the foundation of our faith. It addresses the tension between God's eternal purposes and human free agency, emphasizing the unchanging obligations of God's law. Additionally, it confronts the notion of justifying lies by suggesting that practicing contrary to truth ultimately hinders the glory of God.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Such reasoning amounts to this—which indeed we who preach salvation by free grace are slanderously accused of teaching—that the more evil we do, the more glory will redound to God a damnable principle."
2. "Mark the place here assigned to the Scriptures. In answer to the question, 'What advantage hath the Jew?' or, 'What profit is there of circumcision?' those holding Romish views would undoubtedly have laid the stress upon the priesthood, as the glory of the Jewish economy. But in the apostle's esteem, 'the oracles of God' were the jewel of the ancient Church."
3. "God's eternal purposes and man's free agency, as also the doctrine of salvation by grace and the unchanging obligations of God's law, have ever been subjected to the charge of inconsistency by those who will bow to no truth which their own reason cannot fathom. But amidst all the clouds and darkness which in this present state envelop the divine administration and many of the truths of the Bible, such broad and deep principles as are here laid down, and which shine in their own luster, will be found the sheet-anchor of our faith."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Lie [ψευσματι] . Only here in the New Testament."
2. "The expression carries us back to ver. 4, and is general for moral falsehood."
3. "Unfaithfulness to the claims of conscience and of God, especially with reference to the proffer of salvation through Christ."

### John Wesley:
1. "If my lie, that is, practice contrary to truth, conduces to the glory of God, by making his truth shine with superior advantage."
2. "Can this be said to be any sin at all? Ought I not to do what would otherwise be evil, that so much 'good may come?'"
3. "To this the apostle does not deign to give a direct answer, but cuts the objector short with a severe reproof."
