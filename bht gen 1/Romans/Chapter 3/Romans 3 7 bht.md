# Romans 3:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Bible verse in question addresses the consequences of a supposition that challenges God's judgment and advocates for doing evil for the sake of good. Commentators warn against such reasoning, as it undermines God's righteousness and moral truth, despite any potential overruling of sins for His glory. The objection is rebutted firmly, emphasizing the need to avoid unfaithfulness, falsehood, and the abandonment of truth. Ultimately, the verse urges believers to uphold the truth of God and to be cautious of any actions that may compromise His righteousness.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The supposition if carried out, would overthrow all God’s judgment, and the whole moral life of man."
2. "If the truth of God abounded by means of my falsehood, to His glory, why any longer am I also judged as a sinner?"
3. "Let us do evil that good may come?" whose condemnation is according to justice.

These quotes highlight the consequences of the supposition, the questioning of judgment, and the condemnation of those who advocate for doing evil for the sake of good.

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Such reasoning amounts to this—which indeed we who preach salvation by free grace are slanderously accused of teaching—that the more evil we do, the more glory will redound to God a damnable principle."
2. "Mark the place here assigned to the Scriptures. In answer to the question, 'What advantage hath the Jew?' or, 'What profit is there of circumcision?' those holding Romish views would undoubtedly have laid the stress upon the priesthood, as the glory of the Jewish economy. But in the apostle's esteem, 'the oracles of God' were the jewel of the ancient Church."
3. "God's eternal purposes and man's free agency, as also the doctrine of salvation by grace and the unchanging obligations of God's law, have ever been subjected to the charge of inconsistency by those who will bow to no truth which their own reason cannot fathom. But amidst all the clouds and darkness which in this present state envelop the divine administration and many of the truths of the Bible, such broad and deep principles as are here laid down, and which shine in their own luster, will be found the sheet-anchor of our faith."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "His 'truth' will be shown by the fulfillment of all his promises to his people, and of all his predictions."
2. "Every lost sinner will be, therefore, an eternal monument of the truth of God."
3. "The fault in the reasoning of the objector is this, that he takes for granted that the direct tendency of his conduct is to promote God’s glory, whereas it is just the reverse."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The expression carries us back to ver. 4, and is general for moral falsehood, unfaithfulness to the claims of conscience and of God." 
2. "Lie is a comprehensive term, embracing all forms of falsehood, whether in word or deed." 
3. "It signifies the abandonment of the truth, and the substitution of error, deception, or hypocrisy."

### John Calvin:
1. "If by our unfaithfulness the truth of God becomes more conspicuous, and in a manner confirmed, and hence more glory redounds to him, it is by no means just, that he, who serves to display God’s glory, should be punished as a sinner."
2. "The particle γὰρ here gives no reason, but is to be viewed as meaning then, or indeed, verily."
3. "The idea is substantially the same, which is designated by these respectively corresponding appellations. Fidelity, uprightness, integrity, are designated byπίστιν, δικαιοσύνην, and ἀλήθεια; while ἀλήθεια, and ἀπιστία ἀδικία, designate unfaithfulness, want of uprightness and false dealing."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "God must judge the world; but if, etc. 'The argument accordingly rests on the basis, that in the case put... the relation of God to the judgment of the world would yield two absurd consequences.'" 
2. "The truth of God... His moral truth, in this connection, almost equivalent to His righteousness."
3. "Why (if this is a sufficient justification, does He judge the world, and thus) am I also (I who thus glorify him) as a sinner still judged, i.e., at the day of judgment."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Paul 'uses the first person from motives of delicacy' in this supposable case for argument's sake." 

2. "So here he 'transfers by a fiction' to himself the objection." 

3. "Paul returns to the imaginary objection in verse Romans 3:5."

### John Gill:
1. "The 'truth of God' is the same with 'the righteousness of God', Romans 3:5, and means his faithfulness."
2. "The truth of God is commended, illustrated, and made to abound, when it is asserted, that he is true and faithful, and every man is a liar, fallacious, and deceitful."
3. "Though God may overrule, in a providential way, the sins of others for his glory, this is no excuse for their sins, nor will it be an exemption of them from punishment."

### John Wesley:
1. "If my lie, that is, practice contrary to truth, conduces to the glory of God, by making his truth shine with superior advantage."
2. "Can this be said to be any sin at all? Ought I not to do what would otherwise be evil, that so much 'good may come?'"
3. "To this the apostle does not deign to give a direct answer, but cuts the objector short with a severe reproof."
