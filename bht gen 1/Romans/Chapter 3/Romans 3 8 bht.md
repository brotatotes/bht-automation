## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Albert Barnes:
1. "If the glory of God is to be promoted by sin, and if a man is not therefore to be condemned, or held guilty for it; if this fact absolves man from crime, 'why not carry the doctrine out, and make it a principle of conduct, and do all the evil we can, in order to promote his glory.'" 
2. "The apostles taught that the sins of people were the occasion of promoting God’s glory in the plan of salvation. That 'where sin abounded, grace did much more abound.' That God, in the salvation of people, would be glorified just in proportion to the depth and pollution of the guilt which was forgiven."
3. "That is, since sin is to promote the glory of God, let us commit as much as possible. That God may take occasion by it to promote his glory."

These quotes highlight the objection and misrepresentation of the apostles' teachings, emphasizing the importance of not doing evil in order to achieve a perceived good.

### John Calvin:
1. "That evil cannot of itself produce anything but evil; and that God’s glory is through our sin illustrated, is not the work of man, but the work of God; who, as a wonderful worker, knows how to overcome our wickedness, and to convert it to another end, so as to turn it contrary to what we intend, to the promotion of his own glory."
2. "It is not then a new thing, that adversaries at this day load with so many false accusations, and render odious our doctrine, which we ourselves know to be the pure gospel of Christ, and all the angels, as well as the faithful, are our witnesses."
3. "Let us, at the same time, according to the Apostle’s example, oppose, as much as we can, all malicious subtilties, (technis — crafts, wiles,) that the base and the abandoned may not, without some check, speak evil of our Creator."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The second absurd consequence, as respects man, is the evil principle, so strongly condemned, as carrying its refutation with it."
2. "Slanderously reported; lit, ‘blasphemed.’ Such slander was in the last instance blasphemy, since thus God’s character was outraged."
