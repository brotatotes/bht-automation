## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Philip Schaff:
1. "The second absurd consequence, as respects man, is the evil principle, so strongly condemned, as carrying its refutation with it."
2. "The early Christians were charged with even asserting this false principle, which would have been worse than the previous charge."
3. "The absurdity of the principle, that the end justifies the means, is not proven; the Apostle makes short work of an objection which has this logical issue."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "And why should it not happen? The other way is to take μη with ποιησωμεν and make a long parenthesis of all in between."
2. "The parenthesis is necessary anyhow, for there are two lines of thought, one the excuse brought forward by the unbeliever, the other the accusation that Paul affirms that very excuse that we may do evil that good may come."
3. "It sounds almost uncanny to find this maxim of the Jesuits attributed to Paul in the first century by Jews. It was undoubtedly the accusation of Antinomianism because Paul preached justification by faith and not by works."
