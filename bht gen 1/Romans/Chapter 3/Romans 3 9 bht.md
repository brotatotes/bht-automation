## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The meaning of προέχομαι every where else is passive, ‘to be surpassed,’ and προέχω, act., is to surpass, or have the pre-eminence."
2. "The only way left seems...to take προεχόμεθα as middle, and understand it as προέχομεν Have we (Jews) the (any) preference?"
3. "No, by no means. This would more naturally be πάντως οὐ...The meaning ‘not in every way,’ ‘not altogether,’...will not apply, for it does not agree with what follows, where the Apostle proves absolute equality in respect of his argument."

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "No, in no wise—Better off the Jews certainly were, for having the oracles of God to teach them better."
2. "But as they were no better, that only aggravated their guilt."
3. "Having the knowledge of God's truth and His commandments, the Jews were held to a higher standard and therefore had a greater responsibility to live according to God's will."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Are we better than they? - Are we Jews better than the Gentiles? Or rather, have we any preference, or advantage as to character and prospects, over the Gentiles?"
2. "No, in no wise - Not at all. That is, the Jews have no preference or advantage over the Gentiles in regard to the subject of justification before God."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Are we in better case than they, i.e., have we any advantage?"
2. "Paul has been showing that the Old Testament privileges, though giving to the Jews a certain superiority to the Gentiles, did not give them any advantages in escaping the divine condemnation."
3. "The reference is not to logical proof, but to forensic accusation. The simple verb means to charge as being the cause of some evil: hence to accuse, impeach."

### John Calvin:
1. "Those privileges in which he allowed them to be eminent were separate from themselves, and dependent on God's goodness, and not on their own merit."
2. "He shows that they had nothing of their own."
3. "The holy contrivance (sanctum artificium) which he adopts; for when he ascribes pre-eminency to them, he speaks in the third person; but when he strips them of all things, he puts himself among them, that he might avoid giving offense."

### John Gill:
1. "Are we [Jews] better than they [Gentiles]? No, in no wise; upon no consideration whatever, neither as men, nor as Jews." 

2. "Both Jews and Gentiles are under sin; under the power and guilt of sin, and a sentence of condemnation for it; which is equally true of the Jews, who were no better than the Gentiles."

3. "God's elect in all nations, who are no better by nature, by birth, than others; as deserving of the wrath of God as the rest; no better in their tempers and dispositions, or in the endowments of their minds, or outward circumstances of life."

### John Wesley:
1. "Under sin — Under the guilt and power of it: the Jews, by transgressing the written law; the gentiles, by transgressing the law of nature."

2. "The Jews, as the chosen people of God, were entrusted with the written law, but they too were under the power of sin. This highlights the universal need for salvation."

3. "The gentiles, who did not have the written law, were also under sin. This shows that even without the specific commandments, they were still accountable for their actions."
