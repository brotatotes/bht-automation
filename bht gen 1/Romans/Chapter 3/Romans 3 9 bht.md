# Romans 3:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse in question reveals that having the oracles of God, the knowledge of God's truth, does not make one better or give any advantage in regard to justification before God. Both Jews and Gentiles are under the guilt and power of sin. The form of the verb used in the question has been debated, but it emphasizes the responsibility and accountability of both Jews and Gentiles for their transgressions. The argument is directed against the Jews, highlighting the reversal of the charge made against the Gentiles and the Jews.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "No, in no wiseâ€”Better off the Jews certainly were, for having the oracles of God to teach them better." 
2. "But as they were no better, that only aggravated their guilt." 
3. "Having the knowledge of God's truth and yet failing to live according to it increased their responsibility and accountability."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Are we better than they? - Are we Jews better than the Gentiles? Or rather, have we any preference, or advantage as to character and prospects, over the Gentiles?"
2. "No, in no wise - Not at all. That is, the Jews have no preference or advantage over the Gentiles in regard to the subject of justification before God."
3. "We have before proved ... - Romans 1:21-32; Romans 2:0. Under sin - Sinners. Under the power and dominion of sin."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The exact meaning of the verb used (the only Greek word occurring in the question) has been much discussed... The form here may be either middle or passive, but the former is uncommon in the New Testament."
2. "This is the correct sense of a phrase which stands literally, 'not altogether.' There is no contradiction between 'much every way' (Romans 3:2) and this denial. The former refers to historical and external advantages, the latter to the moral result."
3. "The charge had been made first against the Gentiles (chap. 1), then against the Jews (chap. 2), but the order is here reversed, since the argument is directed against the Jews."

### John Wesley:
1. "Under sin - Under the guilt and power of it."
