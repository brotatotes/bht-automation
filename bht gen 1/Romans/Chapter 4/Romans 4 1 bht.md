# Romans 4:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
According to the commentaries, this Bible verse discusses the justification of Abraham. It emphasizes that Abraham's righteousness was not achieved through his own efforts, obedience to the law, or works, but rather it was a gift from God received through faith. The verse challenges any notion of boasting before God and highlights the true method of justification through faith alone. It explores the agreement between the law and the gospel and addresses the concept of acceptance with God as opposed to reliance on natural descent or sinful human nature.
