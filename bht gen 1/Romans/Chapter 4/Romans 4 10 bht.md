## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The interval between the recognition of his faith (Gen 15:6) and his circumcision, was perhaps as much as twenty-five, certainly not less (Gen 17:25) than fourteen years." 

2. "Abraham's faith was recognized before he was circumcised, highlighting the importance of faith as the basis for righteousness." 

3. "The delay in Abraham's circumcision emphasizes that righteousness is not dependent on external rituals, but on a genuine faith in God."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "For if he was justified by faith after he was circumcised, the Jew might pretend that it was in virtue of his circumcision; that even his faith was acceptable, because he was circumcised."
2. "But if it was before he was circumcised, this plea could not be set up; and the argument of the apostle was confirmed by the case of Abraham, the great father and model of the Jewish people, that circumcision and the deeds of the Law did not conduce to justification."
3. "As Abraham was justified without those works, so might others be, and the pagan, therefore, might be admitted to similar privileges."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "How then was it reckoned? Not, what was the mode in which it was reckoned, but, 'how was he situated when this took place?' The rest of the verse makes this clear." 
2. "Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision. The 'reckoning' took place (Genesis 15:6) at least fourteen years before the circumcision of Abraham (Genesis 17:25); consequently the latter was the Divine ratification of grace already received, not the effective cause or condition of the bestowal of grace."

### John Gill:
1. "Was he justified, or his faith reckoned to him for righteousness, when he was a circumcised, or an uncircumcised person?"
2. "It must be 'fourteen' years, or thereabout, before his circumcision, that this declaration of his being a justified person was made."
3. "Hence it clearly appears that circumcision could not be the cause of his justification, since it followed it."

### John Wesley:
1. "Not in circumcision" - This phrase emphasizes that Abraham's justification before God was not based on his physical act of circumcision. It highlights the fact that his righteousness came from his faith in God, not from any external ritual or action.

2. "He was justified before Ishmael was born" - This statement reveals that Abraham's justification occurred long before the birth of Ishmael, emphasizing that it was not dependent on any specific lineage or offspring. It underscores the timeless and universal nature of God's justification of Abraham.

3. "He was not circumcised till Ishmael was thirteen years old" - This detail highlights the chronological sequence of events, indicating that circumcision was not a prerequisite for Abraham's justification. It demonstrates that God's acceptance of Abraham was not contingent upon his physical state but rather on his faith and obedience.
