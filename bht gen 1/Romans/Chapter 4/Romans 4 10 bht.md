# Romans 4:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, it is revealed that Abraham's faith and justification were not dependent on outward signs or rituals such as circumcision. His faith and righteousness were reckoned to him before his circumcision, emphasizing that they were not based on human effort or accomplishment. The period of waiting and uncertainty between his recognition of faith and his circumcision teaches us the importance of trusting in God's promises and understanding that His timing is perfect. Circumcision, therefore, was a confirmation and symbol of the faith Abraham already possessed, rather than the cause of his justification.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The interval between the recognition of his faith (Gen 15:6) and his circumcision, was perhaps as much as twenty-five, certainly not less (Gen 17:25) than fourteen years."

2. "The delay in circumcision highlights the fact that Abraham's faith was not dependent on outward signs or rituals, but on his trust in God's promises."

3. "Abraham's faith was not a one-time event, but a journey of growth and deepening trust in God's faithfulness."

4. "This period of waiting and uncertainty teaches us that God's timing is not always immediate, but He is faithful to fulfill His promises in His perfect timing."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "For if he was justified by faith after he was circumcised, the Jew might pretend that it was in virtue of his circumcision; that even his faith was acceptable, because he was circumcised."
2. "But if it was before he was circumcised, this plea could not be set up; and the argument of the apostle was confirmed by the case of Abraham, the great father and model of the Jewish people, that circumcision and the deeds of the Law did not conduce to justification."
3. "As Abraham was justified without those works, so might others be, and the pagan, therefore, might be admitted to similar privileges."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "How then was it reckoned? Not, what was the mode in which it was reckoned, but, ‘how was he situated when this took place?’" 
2. "The ‘reckoning’ took place at least fourteen years before the circumcision of Abraham; consequently the latter was the Divine ratification of grace already received, not the effective cause or condition of the bestowal of grace."
3. "The circumcision of Abraham was not the means by which he received God's grace, but rather a confirmation of the grace he had already received."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "A pertinent point that the average Jew had not noticed."
2. "To him being in a state of circumcision or in a state of uncircumcision?"
3. "The average Jew had not noticed."

### John Gill:
1. "Was he justified, or his faith reckoned to him for righteousness, when he was a circumcised, or an uncircumcised person?"
2. "It must be 'fourteen' years, or thereabout, before his circumcision, that this declaration of his being a justified person was made."
3. "Hence it clearly appears that circumcision could not be the cause of his justification, since it followed it."

### John Wesley:
1. "Not in circumcision" - The justification of Abraham did not come as a result of his circumcision. It was not a physical act that brought him into a right relationship with God. (Genesis 15:1-21)

2. "He was justified before Ishmael was born" - Abraham's justification occurred long before the birth of Ishmael, emphasizing that it was not based on any human effort or accomplishment. (Genesis 15:1-21)

3. "He was not circumcised till Ishmael was thirteen years old" - The act of circumcision came later in Abraham's life, as a sign of the covenant between him and God. It was not the cause of his justification, but rather a symbol of the faith he already had. (Genesis 17:25)
