# Romans 4:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This verse talks about a sign and seal, known as circumcision, which represents being in covenant with God. It signifies a Divine covenant or blessing, but it is not the actual source of confidence or grace. It is an outward assurance from God that one is accounted righteous based on faith, even before being circumcised. This verse highlights the belief that righteousness is not dependent on external signs like circumcision, but on faith in God.
