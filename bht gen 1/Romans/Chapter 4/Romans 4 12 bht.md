# Romans 4:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This passage discusses the significance of Abraham as the spiritual father of believers and the Jewish people. He is not only the father of all believers but also considered the father of the Jewish people. However, his fatherhood is not limited to those who are circumcised, but also extends to those who have faith like he did. This emphasizes that faith, rather than mere circumcision, is essential for being counted as his true descendants. It is through following in the footsteps of Abraham, imitating his example and having his faith, that one truly becomes his descendant.
