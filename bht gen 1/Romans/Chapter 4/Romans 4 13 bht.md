## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "For the promise, &c.—This is merely an enlargement of the foregoing reasoning, applying to the law what had just been said of circumcision."
2. "that he should be the heir of the world—or, that 'all the families of the earth should be blessed in him.'"
3. "was not to Abraham or to his seed through the law—in virtue of obedience to the law."
4. "but through the righteousness of faith—in virtue of his simple faith in the divine promises."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The Mosaic law was in no sense the ground or cause of the promise, for the law was not then in existence; and this fact is the ground of the position of Abraham as father of all believers, whether Gentiles or Jews."
2. "The promise is to both, as one. Here 'his seed' is not directly referred to Christ, as in Galatians 3:16, but to all believers, as the spiritual descendants of Abraham."
3. "The promise will be literally fulfilled when the kingdoms of the world are given to the people of the Most High, and Christ returns to rule."

"All Abraham's seed, all that believe in him with the faith of Abraham" - The promise of being heirs of the world is not limited to physical descendants of Abraham, but includes all who have faith in him.
