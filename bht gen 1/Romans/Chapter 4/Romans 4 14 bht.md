# Romans 4:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
If one's inheritance is based on perfect obedience to the law, as highlighted by John Wesley, then faith becomes empty and useless, as emphasized by Henry Alford and John Calvin. The promises of God would be made void and of no effect, according to Albert Barnes and John Wesley, as relying solely on the law undermines the role of faith in receiving blessings. This passage challenges the notion that salvation is earned through works, emphasizing the importance of faith in receiving the promises of God.
