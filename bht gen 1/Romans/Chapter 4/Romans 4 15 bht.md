# Romans 4:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse being described highlights the role of the law in revealing sin and bringing about God's wrath. Commentators explain that the law itself, without the grace of God, condemns and works wrath against those who break it. They emphasize that the existence of the law is what makes transgression possible, leading to a more pronounced form of sin and God's wrath. The law's purpose is to bring knowledge of sin and the need for a Savior, but without grace, it stirs up wrath and becomes an occasion for condemnation.
