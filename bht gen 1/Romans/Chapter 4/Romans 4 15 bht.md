# Romans 4:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The commentators analyze a Bible verse discussing how the law does not justify or bring peace to fallen humanity. Rather, it reveals transgression and produces condemnation and wrath. The law works wrath by stirring up God's judgment against disobedience. Without a known law or rule, there can be no responsibility for wrongdoing or transgression. The purpose of the law is to detect and expose sin, leading to apprehensions of God's wrath. Instead of bestowing blessings, the law becomes an occasion for wrath.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The purpose of the Apostle here is not to deny the existence of the law of God written in the heart before Moses, but to show that no promise of inheritance can be by the law, because the property of the law is, the more it is promulgated, to reveal transgression more, not to unfold grace." 
2. "Comparatively, there was no transgression before the law of Moses; and if we conceive a state in which the law whether written or unwritten should be altogether absent, there would be no transgression whatever." 
3. "This reasoning does not touch the doctrine of the original taint of our nature in Adam, only referring to the discrimination of acts, words, and thoughts by the conscience in the light of the law."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The law worketh wrath—has nothing to give to those who break is but condemnation and vengeance." 
2. "For where there is no law, there is no transgression—It is just the law that makes transgression, in the case of those who break it; nor can the one exist without the other." 
3. "The law reveals the standard of righteousness and exposes our inability to meet it, leading to condemnation and wrath."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "While man is fallen, and a sinner, its tendency, so far from justifying him, and producing peace, is just the reverse."
2. "The Law of God, demanding perfect purity, and denouncing every sin condemns the sinner, and consigns him to punishment."
3. "If no such rule is given and known, there can be no crime. Law expresses what may be done, and what may not be done."

These quotes highlight the commentary's emphasis on the law's inability to justify and bring peace to fallen humanity, its role in condemning sinners, and the concept that without a known rule of conduct, there can be no wrongdoing.

### John Calvin:
1. "For the law causeth wrath, etc. This is a confirmation of the last verse, derived from the contrary effect of the law; for as the law generates nothing but vengeance, it cannot bring grace."
2. "By wrath, understand God’s judgment, which meaning it has everywhere."
3. "The reasoning seems to be this, — 'The promise is by faith, and not by the law; for the law brings wrath or condemnation: but where there is no law, there is no transgression to occasion wrath.'"

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The law does, indeed, stir up the wrath of man against God, as is set forth in chap. Romans 7:5, etc., but the train of thought in that chapter is distinct from that found here." 
2. "Because the law brings about wrath, it cannot be the ground of promise (Romans 4:13)." 
3. "Where there is a law, there is transgression of it, thus producing a more pronounced form of sin, upon which God’s wrath is visited; thus the law ‘works wrath.’"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Worketh wrath (οργην κατεργαζετα). Because of disobedience to it." This quote highlights the idea that disobedience to the law leads to the manifestation of wrath or anger.
2. "Neither is there transgression (ουδε παραβασις)." This quote emphasizes that there is no responsibility for breaking a law that does not exist.
3. "There is no responsibility for the violation of a non-existent law." This quote further reinforces the concept that without a law, there can be no transgression or guilt.

### John Gill:
1. "The law is so far from justifying sinners, that it curses and condemns them."
2. "When the law comes into the heart and conscience of a sinner, it fills them with terrible apprehensions of the wrath of God."
3. "The law was added for the better discovery and detection of sin, which would not have been so manifest without it."

### John Wesley:
1. "The law... is so difficult, and we so weak and sinful, that... it only worketh wrath."
2. "Instead of bringing us a blessing, it becomes to us an occasion of wrath."
3. "Where there is no law in force, there can be no transgression of it."
