## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Abraham was the father of us all, though not physically, nor in actuality, seeing that we were not as yet, yet in the sight and estimation of God, in his relation with God, with whom no obstacles of nature or time have force."
2. "Who quickens the dead, a general description of God’s almighty creative power, applied particularly to the matter in hand - the deadness of generative physical power in Abraham himself, which was quickened by God."
3. "Who calleth (nameth, speaketh of) the things that are not, as being (as if they were). This He did in the present case with regard to the seed of Abraham, which did not as yet exist."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Thus Abraham, in the reckoning of Him whom he believed, is the father of us all, in order that all may be assured, that doing as he did, they shall be treated as he was."
2. "The nature and greatness of that faith of Abraham which we are to copy is here strikingly described."
3. "What he was required to believe being above nature, his faith had to fasten upon God's power to surmount physical incapacity, and call into being what did not then exist."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The argument of the apostle is founded in part on the fact that the past tense is used - I have made thee - and that God spoke of a thing as already done, which he had promised or purposed to do."
2. "The sense is, he had, in his mind or purpose, constituted him the father of many nations; and so certain was the fulfillment of the divine purposes, that he spoke of it as already accomplished."
3. "The giving of this promise, and its fulfillment, were such as strongly to remind us that God has power to give life to the dead."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Originally his name was Abram, exalted father; afterward Abraham, father of a multitude." 
2. "The verb shows that the paternity was the result of a special arrangement."
3. "The seed of Abraham 'which were at present in the category of things which were not, and the nations which should spring physically or spiritually from him, God spoke of as having an existence, which word Abraham believed."

### John Calvin:
1. "He had indeed to attain, in a wonderful way, the promise which he had heard from the Lord’s mouth, since there was then no token of it."
2. "He then who denies them to be capable of grace, does wrong to Abraham, whose faith was sustained by this thought, — that it matters not whether he was dead or not who is called by the Lord; to whom it is an easy thing, even by a word, to raise the dead through his own power."
3. "The character of the divine calling is, that they who are dead are raised by the Lord, that they who are nothing begin to be something through his power."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The promise was of a spiritual seed from many nations. The pertinence of the quotation thus becomes obvious."
2. "In the sight and estimation of God, in whose sight Abraham believed."
3. "The phrase suggests the numerous seed of Abraham, in regard to which God had decreed and spoken while they were nonexistent, except in His purpose."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "A father of many nations (πατερα πολλων εθνων). Quotation from Genesis 17:5. Only true in the sense of spiritual children as already explained, father of believers in God." 

2. "Before him whom he believed even God (κατεναντ ου επιστευσεν θεου). Incorporation of antecedent into the relative clause and attraction of the relative ω into ου. See Mark 11:2 for κατεναντ, 'right in front of.'"

3. "Calleth the things that are not as though they were (καλουντος τα μη οντα ως οντα). 'Summons the non-existing as existing.' Abraham's body was old and decrepit. God rejuvenated him and Sarah (Hebrews 11:19)."

### John Gill:
1. "Abraham was the father of them, before him whom he believed, [even] God; that is, he was so, either in the sight of God, who sees not as man sees; in his account, he was the father of many nations, long before he really in fact was."
2. "The object of his faith is described as he, who quickeneth the dead: meaning either the dead body of Abraham and Sarah's womb; or Isaac, who was given up for dead; or the Gentiles, who were dead in trespasses and sins; or rather the dead bodies of men at the last day, a work which none but the almighty God can effect."
3. "And who stands further described as he, who calleth those things which be not, as though they were; so he called Abraham the father of many nations, when he was not in fact, as if he really was; and the Gentiles his seed and offspring, before they were."

3. "A man can say to his servant actually existing, Do this; and he doeth it: but God saith to the light, while it does not exist, Go forth; and it goeth."
