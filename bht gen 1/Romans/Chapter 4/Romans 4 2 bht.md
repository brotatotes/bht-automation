3. "In his case, the righteousness itself was not yet manifested. He believed implicitly, taking the promise, with all it involved and implied, as true."

They emphasize that Abraham's righteousness was not earned through his works, but rather through his trust in God's promise.

1. "Even in their view, justification was a matter where God's verdict was concerned."
2. "If Abraham, as the Jews suppose, was justified by works, he has reason to glory toward God, but he has no ground of glorying toward God, for the Scripture says he was justified by faith."

### John Wesley:
1. "If Abraham had been justified by works, he would have had room to glory." This quote highlights the idea that if Abraham's righteousness came from his own actions, he would have had reason to boast and take credit for his salvation.
