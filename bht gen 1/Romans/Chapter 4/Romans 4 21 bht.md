## BHT:
Abraham's unwavering trust in God's ability to fulfill His promises, his complete confidence in God's word, and his full assurance of faith brought glory to God. Firm in his conviction, Abraham's faith was not shaken by difficulties, nor was it a mere intellectual assent. Abraham's confidence in God's power, his conviction that nothing is impossible for Him, is the essence of faith. His faith was not limited by time or obstacles, but rested upon the unchanging nature of God.
