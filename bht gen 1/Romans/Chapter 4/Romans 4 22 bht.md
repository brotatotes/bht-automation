# Romans 4:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Abraham's faith, not based on his own merit, but solely in his belief in God's promises, was counted as righteousness. His unwavering and implicit trust in God served as proof of his friendship with Him. This faith was not mere intellectual assent, but a deep reliance on God's power and faithfulness. The righteousness of faith is not limited to strong believers, but extends to all who have genuine faith, regardless of its degree.
