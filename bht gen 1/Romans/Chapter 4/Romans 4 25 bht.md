## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "His resurrection was the divine assurance that He had 'put away sin by the sacrifice of Himself,' and the crowning of His whole work, our justification is fitly connected with that glorious act."
2. "Faith and works, in the matter of justification, are opposite and irreconcilable, even as grace and debt."
3. "Nothing gives more glory to God than simple faith in His word, especially when all things seem to render the fulfillment of it hopeless."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "It is at the same time self-surrender (Galatians 2:20; Ephesians 5:2), since Christ was obedient to His Father." 
2. "Christ died to remove our guilt which already existed, but He rose again to accomplish our justification which could not otherwise take place."

### John Gill:
1. "Christ was delivered into the hands of men, and into the hands of justice, and unto death; and he was delivered by men, by Judas, to the chief priests, and by them to Pilate, and by Pilate to the Jews and Roman soldiers to be put to death." 

2. "He was delivered to death, not for any offences of his own, for he committed none; nor for the offences of angels, for these were not spared; nor for the offences of all men, since all will not be saved; but for the offences of all God's elect: he was delivered for these, as the causes of his death, and as the end for which he died; namely, to make reconciliation, atonement, and satisfaction for them."

3. "He died in the room and stead of his people, and by dying made satisfaction for their sins; he rose again as their head and representative, and was legally discharged, acquitted, and justified, and they in him."
