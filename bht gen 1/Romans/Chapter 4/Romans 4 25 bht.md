## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Our Lord was delivered up (to death) for or on account of our sins (i.e. because we had sinned): He was also raised up (from the dead) for or on account of our justification (i.e. not because we had been, but that we might be justified)." 
2. "The great complex event by which our justification (death unto sin and new birth unto righteousness) has been made possible, may be stated in one word as the GLORIFICATION of Christ."
3. "But he does not view them respectively as the causes, exclusively of one another, of forgiveness and justification: e.g. (1) ch. Romans 5:9, we are said to be justified by His blood, and 2Co 5:21 God made Him sin for us, that we might become the righteousness of God in Him: and (2) 1 Corinthians 15:17, if Christ is not raised, we are yet in our sins."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "As His resurrection was the divine assurance that He had 'put away sin by the sacrifice of Himself,' and the crowning of His whole work, our justification is fitly connected with that glorious act."
2. "Faith and works, in the matter of justification, are opposite and irreconcilable, even as grace and debt."
3. "Nothing gives more glory to God than simple faith in His word, especially when all things seem to render the fulfillment of it hopeless."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He was delivered up to death in order to make expiation for our sins."
2. "His resurrection was a proof that his work was accepted by the Father. Our justification, therefore, became sure."
3. "The fact that he was raised becomes the ground of hope that we shall be raised and accepted of God. There is no higher motive that can be presented to induce man to seek salvation than the fact that he may be raised up from death and the grave, and made immortal."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Raised again for our justification." - This quote highlights the significance of Christ's resurrection in the context of justification. It emphasizes that while the resurrection has immense significance in terms of renewing our moral nature and revealing God's righteousness, it is not the sole determining factor for our justification.

2. "It is only by the rising that His incarnate life and glory are fully discovered." - This quote emphasizes the role of Christ's resurrection in fully revealing His divine nature and glory. It suggests that through His resurrection, the true moral power of God's righteousness is declared in His person.

3. "The righteousness of God declared in His person in its true moral power." - This quote underscores the declaration of God's righteousness through Christ's person, particularly in terms of its true moral power. It suggests that Christ's resurrection plays a crucial role in manifesting and demonstrating the moral power of God's righteousness.

### John Calvin:
1. "By separating his death from his resurrection, he no doubt accommodates what he says to our ignorance; for it is also true that righteousness has been obtained for us by that obedience of Christ, which he exhibited in his death, as the Apostle himself teaches us in the following chapter."
2. "But as Christ, by rising from the dead, made known how much he had effected by his death, this distinction is calculated to teach us that our salvation was begun by the sacrifice, by which our sins were expiated, and was at length completed by his resurrection."
3. "He therefore still speaks of imputative justification; and this will be confirmed by what immediately follows in the next chapter."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Who was delivered up. ‘A standing designation for the divine surrender of Christ, surrender unto death... It is at the same time self-surrender, since Christ was obedient to His Father’ (Meyer)."
2. "For our trespasses... Christ died to remove our guilt which already existed, but He rose again to accomplish our justification which could not otherwise take place."
3. "Without the resurrection, Christ’s grave would be the grave of all our hopes... That great fact testified that God accepted the atoning sacrifice."

Note: The commentary is quite long, so I had to condense it into three quotes.

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "The first δια with παραπτωματα is probably retrospective, though it will make sense as prospective (to make atonement for our transgressions)." 
2. "The second δια is quite clearly prospective with a view to our justification." 
3. "Paul does not mean to separate the resurrection from the death of Christ in the work of atonement, but simply to show that the resurrection is at one with the death on the Cross in proof of Christ's claims."

### John Gill:
1. "Christ was delivered into the hands of men, and into the hands of justice, and unto death... he voluntarily laid down his life, and gave himself a ransom for his people." 
2. "He was delivered for the offences of all God's elect... to make reconciliation, atonement, and satisfaction for them." 
3. "He was raised again from the dead... not only that he might live an immortal and glorious life in our nature, but for 'our justification'."
