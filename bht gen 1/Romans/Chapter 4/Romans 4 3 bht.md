# Romans 4:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, it is evident that Abraham's faith played a significant role in his righteousness. We see that his faith was not in his own works, but in God and His promises, which included blessings for all nations through Christ. By believing and trusting in God's words, Abraham was accounted as righteous. Through faith, he was accepted by God, despite his own shortcomings, and his faith was credited to him as righteousness.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Romish expositors and Arminian Protestants make this to mean that God accepted Abraham's act of believing as a substitute for complete obedience. But this is at variance with the whole spirit and letter of the apostle's teaching."
2. "Throughout this whole argument, faith is set in direct opposition to works, in the matter of justification."
3. "The meaning plainly is that Abraham believed in the promises which embraced Christ, as we believe in Christ Himself and in both cases, faith is merely the instrument that puts us in possession of the blessing gratuitously bestowed."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The faith which Abraham exercised was, that his posterity should be like the stars of heaven in number. This promise was made to him when he had no child, and of course when he had no prospect of such a posterity."
2. "The reason why it was counted to him for righteousness was, that it was such a strong, direct, and unwavering act of confidence in the promise of God."
3. "In being justified by faith, it is meant, therefore, that we are treated as righteous; that we are forgiven; that we are admitted to the favor of God, and treated as his friends."

### Marvin Vincent:

3. "The phrases ejlogisqh eijv and ejl. wJv are thus shown to be substantially equivalent" - This statement suggests that the phrases "counted for righteousness" and "reckon unto" are essentially the same in meaning, further reinforcing the idea that the scripture passage is associated with righteousness.

### John Calvin:
1. "For if Abraham was justified, because he embraced, by faith, the bountiful mercy of God, it follows, that he had nothing to glory in; for he brought nothing of his own, except a confession of his misery, which is a solicitation for mercy."
2. "The righteousness of faith is rightly called imputative. For if there be any righteousness by the law or by works, it must be in men themselves; but by faith they derive from another what is wanting in themselves."
3. "Abraham then laid hold on the benignity of God offered to him in the promise, through which he understood that righteousness was communicated to him. It is necessary, in order to form an opinion of righteousness, to understand this relation between the promise and faith."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The New Testament citations all follow the LXX: And Abraham believed God, and it was reckoned unto him for righteousness." 
2. "The word we translate ‘reckon’ occurs eleven times in this chapter, and is represented in the E. V. by ‘count,’ ‘reckon,’ ‘impute;’ elsewhere in this Epistle by ‘account’ (so Galatians 3:6)."
3. "The idea of putting to one’s account is obvious; and the full expression is a technical one, the equivalent of God’s act of justification."

2. "The object of his faith and trust were not his riches, nor his righteousness, but Jehovah, the Son of God."
3. "It was counted to him for righteousness, the meaning of which is not, that Abraham imputed righteousness to God, or celebrated his righteousness and faithfulness, but that God reckoned him righteous, or imputed it to him for righteousness."

### John Wesley:
1. "Abraham believed God...through whom all nations should be blessed." 
2. "That promise of God concerning the numerousness of his seed...especially the promise concerning Christ."
3. "It was imputed to him for righteousness...God accepted him as if he had been altogether righteous."
