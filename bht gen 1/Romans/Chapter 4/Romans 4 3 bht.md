# Romans 4:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Abraham's faith in God's promise, specifically in the blessings brought about by Christ, was credited to him as righteousness. This act of justification through faith, rather than works, sets faith in direct opposition to obedience. The reckoning of righteousness to Abraham was not a mere substitution for complete obedience, but a recognition of his belief in the promises and his assurance of God's acceptance. This verse emphasizes the instrumental role of faith in receiving the blessings that God graciously bestows to believers.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Romish expositors and Arminian Protestants make this to mean that God accepted Abraham's act of believing as a substitute for complete obedience. But this is at variance with the whole spirit and letter of the apostle's teaching."
2. "Throughout this whole argument, faith is set in direct opposition to works, in the matter of justification."
3. "The meaning plainly is that Abraham believed in the promises which embraced Christ, as we believe in Christ Himself and in both cases, faith is merely the instrument that puts us in possession of the blessing gratuitously bestowed."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The New Testament citations all follow the LXX: And Abraham believed God, and it was reckoned unto him for righteousness." 
2. "The word we translate 'reckon' occurs eleven times in this chapter, and is represented in the E. V. by 'count,' 'reckon,' 'impute;' elsewhere in this Epistle by 'account' (so Galatians 3:6). The idea of putting to one's account is obvious; and the full expression is a technical one, the equivalent of God's act of justification."
3. "The following explanations attempt to avoid this sense: his faith was taken into account with a view to making him righteous; his faith being a new principle of obedience, was regarded as already a complete righteousness; he was justified on account of the merit of his faith, not through his faith. But all these are opposed to the proper sense of 'reckon' as well as to that of the entire phrase."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "It was reckoned unto him for righteousness." 
2. "First aorist passive indicative of λογιζομα, old and common verb to set down accounts (literally or metaphorically)." 
3. "His believing God."

### John Wesley:
1. "Abraham believed God — That promise of God concerning the numerousness of his seed, Genesis 15:5,7; but especially the promise concerning Christ, Genesis 12:3, through whom all nations should be blessed." 

2. "And it was imputed to him for righteousness — God accepted him as if he had been altogether righteous." 

3. "Genesis 15:6."
