This verse emphasizes that the reward we receive from God is not based on our own merit or deserving, but on His grace. It contrasts the concept of a worker earning wages according to debt with the freely bestowed reward of God. The passage highlights that salvation is not attained through our own works or righteousness, but through faith and the graciousness of God. It reminds us that our relationship with God is not based on a transactional system, but on His abundant love and mercy.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "His wages are not reckoned according to grace, but according to debt."
2. "The stress is on κατὰ χάριν, not on λογίζεται, which in this first member of the sentence, is used hardly in the strict sense, of imputing or reckoning, but of allotting or apportioning."
3. "And the sentence is a general one, not with any peculiar reference to Abraham, except that after κατὰ χάριν we may supply ὡς τῷ Ἀβραάμ, if we will; for this is evidently assumed."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The concept of grace is central to understanding this verse. The reward that comes from working as a servant is not based on grace, but rather on the merit of the work done. In contrast, the reward that comes from God is purely a matter of favor, given freely and undeservedly."
2. "This verse highlights the difference between human relationships and our relationship with God. In human relationships, rewards are often given as a matter of debt, where one person owes something to another. However, in our relationship with God, the reward is not based on any debt we can repay, but solely on His grace."
3. "The concept of grace challenges our human understanding of fairness and merit. We may feel that we deserve a reward for our work, but in God's economy, it is not about what we deserve, but about His abundant grace and love towards us."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "This passage is not to be understood as affirming that any actually have worked out their salvation by conformity to the Law so as to be saved by their own merits; but it expresses a general truth in regard to works."
2. "On that plan, if a man were justified by his works, it would be a matter due to him."
3. "The reward - The pay, or wages. The word is commonly applied to the pay of soldiers, day-laborers, etc."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Not grace but debt is the regulative standard according to which his compensation is awarded."
2. "The workman for hire represents the legal method of salvation; he who does not work for hire, the gospel method."
3. "Grace is out of the question when wages is in question."

### John Calvin:
1. "He would not, indeed, have the faithful to be idle; but he only forbids them to be mercenaries, so as to demand any thing from God, as though it were justly their due."
2. "God confers not righteousness on us because it is due, but bestows it as a gift."
3. "Faith is counted for righteousness, not that it procures any merit for us, but because it lays hold on the goodness of God: hence righteousness is not due to us, but freely bestowed."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "A workman whose business it is to labor for hire represents the legal method, the plan of making one’s own moral character and doings the basis of acceptance with God."
2. "Not reckoned; this takes up the verb from Romans 4:3, but without emphasizing it."
3. "Of grace, but of debt; not according to, as a matter of favor, but of debt."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "But as of debt": This phrase highlights the idea that the wages earned by the workman are not given as a favor or grace, but rather as a rightful payment for the work done. It emphasizes the concept of deserving and earning what is due.

2. "An illustration of the workman who gets his wages due him": This analogy helps us understand that just as a worker expects to receive his wages in full, without any favor or grace, so too are we to understand that our salvation is not based on grace alone, but on the righteousness and obedience of Christ.

3. "Not as of grace": This phrase reminds us that while grace is an essential aspect of our salvation, it is not the sole basis for it. Our salvation is also rooted in the concept of debt and deserving, as Christ's obedience and righteousness fulfill the requirements of the law on our behalf.

### John Gill:
1. "The regenerate man is disposed to work for God; the man that has the Spirit of God is capable of working; he that has the grace of Christ, and strength from him, can work well; he that believes in Christ, works in a right way; he that loves Christ, works freely, and from a right principle; and he that has Christ's glory in view, works to a right end."
2. "There is no reward due to the creature's work, though ever so perfect, arising front any desert or dignity in itself...admitting heaven itself to be the reward promised to the worker, in what manner must that be reckoned to him? not of grace: for grace and works can never agree together."
3. "Now this was not Abraham's case, which must have been, had he been justified by works; he had a reward reckoned to him, and accounted his, which was God himself, 'I am thy shield, and exceeding great reward', Genesis 15:1; which must be reckoned to him, not of debt, but of grace."

### John Wesley:
1. "All that the law requires, the reward is no favour, but an absolute debt."
2. "Abraham was the most illustrious pattern of piety among the Jewish patriarchs."
3. "If then neither of these was justified by his own obedience, if they both obtained acceptance with God, not as upright beings who might claim it, but as sinful creatures who must implore it, the consequence is glaring."
