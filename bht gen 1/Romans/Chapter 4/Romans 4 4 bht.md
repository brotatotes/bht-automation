# Romans 4:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Bible verse being described emphasizes the concept of earning and deserving. It highlights that the reward received is not freely given but is a result of the work done, not out of grace, but as a matter of right and debt. The verse reflects the idea that acceptance with God is not based on one's own moral character or works, but rather on grace. It brings forth the example of Abraham, who obtained acceptance not through his obedience or as an upright being who could claim it, but as a sinful creature who implored it.

2. "There is no reward due to the creature's work, though ever so perfect, arising front any desert or dignity in itself...admitting heaven itself to be the reward promised to the worker, in what manner must that be reckoned to him? Not of grace: for grace and works can never agree together."
3. "Now this was not Abraham's case, which must have been, had he been justified by works; he had a reward reckoned to him, and accounted his, which was God himself, 'I am thy shield, and exceeding great reward', Genesis 15:1; which must be reckoned to him, not of debt, but of grace."
