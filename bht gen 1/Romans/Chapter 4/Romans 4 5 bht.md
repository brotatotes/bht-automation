1. "To him that worketh not... but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly" - This quote highlights the contrast between relying on one's own works for acceptance with God and instead placing faith in God's mercy and justification of the ungodly.

2. "Casts himself upon the mercy of Him that justifieth those who deserve only condemnation" - This quote emphasizes the act of surrendering oneself to God's mercy and recognizing that justification comes from Him alone, even for those who are ungodly and deserving of condemnation.

3. "David sings of the same justification" - This quote suggests that the concept of justification by faith is not a new idea, but rather something that has been acknowledged and celebrated by individuals like David in the past.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "But to him that worketh not...who seeks to be justified in some other way." 
2. "That justifieth the ungodly...He does not justify them because he sees them to be, or regards them to be righteous; but knowing that they are in fact polluted."
3. "God judges things as they are; and sinners who are justified, he judges not as if they were pure, or as if they had a claim; but he regards them as united by faith to the Lord Jesus; and in this relation he judges that they should be treated as his friends."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Faith is not a substitute for righteousness, since righteousness is involved in faith."
2. "When a man is reckoned righteous through faith, it is not a legal fiction. He is not indeed a perfect man, but God does not reckon something which has no real existence."
3. "God accepts the germ, not in place of the fruit, but as containing the fruit."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "But to him that worketh not; to one who does not work for hire. The statement is general, including Abraham, but not specifically applied to him."
2. "Believeth on him. The idea of trustfully resting on is suggested by the original."
3. "The ungodly; the ungodly individual, the original is in the singular. The word is chosen to present a strong contrast of 'justifying,' one who is alienated from God is yet accounted righteous by God."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "That justifieth the ungodly" - The phrase highlights the radical nature of God's grace, as He declares righteous those who are inherently sinful and ungodly. 

2. "A forensic figure" - This term suggests that God's act of justification is a legal declaration, where He declares the guilty to be righteous based on the work of Christ.

### John Gill:
1. "Not that the believer does not work at all, but not from such principles, and with such views as the other; he does not work in order to obtain life and salvation; he does not seek for justification by his doings."
2. "Though he justifies the ungodly, he does not justify their ungodliness, but them from it; nor will he, nor does he leave them to live and die in it."
3. "His faith is counted for righteousness; not the act, but the object of it; which was Abraham's case, and therefore was not justified by works."

### John Wesley:
1. "Therefore God's affirming of Abraham, that faith was imputed to him for righteousness, plainly shows that he worked not; or, in other words, that he was not justified by works, but by faith only."
2. "For the sinner, being first convinced of his sin and danger by the Spirit of God, stands trembling before the awful tribunal of divine justice; and has nothing to plead, but his own guilt, and the merits of a Mediator."
3. "Thus God justifies the ungodly, and yet remains just, and true to all his attributes!"
