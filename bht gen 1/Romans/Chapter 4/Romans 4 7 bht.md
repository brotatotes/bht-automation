# Romans 4:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the psalmist joyfully sings of the forgiveness and covering of transgressions, sins, and iniquities. The commentators emphasize that this forgiveness is not a distant hope but a present reality, a tangible experience. The sins are not only forgiven but also hidden by God Himself, encompassed by the veil of divine mercy. It is the ultimate happiness, a blessed state, where one can endure afflictions with cheerfulness and face death with comfort, knowing that their sins are forgiven and covered by God's grace.
