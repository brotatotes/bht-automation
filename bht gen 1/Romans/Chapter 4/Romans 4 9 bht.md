### Henry Alford:
1. "The form of the question, with ἢ καί, presupposes an affirmative answer to the latter clause."
2. "The stress is on τῷ Ἀβραάμ, not on ἡ πίστις: for we say that TO ABRAHAM faith was reckoned for righteousness."

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Say not, All this is spoken of the circumcised, and is therefore no evidence of God's general way of justifying men." 
2. "Abraham's justification took place long before he was circumcised, and so could have no dependence upon that rite."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Having shown that Abraham was justified by faith in accordance with the doctrine which he was defending, the only remaining inquiry was whether it was after he was circumcised or before."

### John Calvin:
1. "We must ever bear in mind, that circumcision is here mentioned as the initial work, so to speak, of the righteousness of the law: for the Jews gloried not in it as the symbol of God’s favor, but as a meritorious observance of the law."
2. "We now see that the dispute is not about one rite, but that under one thing is included every work of the law; that is, every work to which reward can be due."
