# Romans 5:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As believers, we are urged to embrace the peace that comes from being justified by faith in Jesus Christ. Our peace with God is not based on our efforts, but on the objective reality of God's reconciliation to us. This peace is a change in God's relation to us and produces a change in our own minds. It is a declaration of the results that come from being justified by faith. Being justified by faith, we have peace and enjoy the fruits of peace, hope, love, and power over sin.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Being then justified by faith, let us have peace with God." - This verse is a hortatory statement, urging believers to embrace the peace that comes from being justified by faith in Jesus Christ.

2. "Having (been allowed to believe in and enjoy) peace with God, depends on, not our reconciliation to Him, not anything subjective in ourselves, but the objective fact of His reconciliation to us." - Our peace with God is not based on our efforts or actions, but on the objective reality of God's reconciliation to us through Jesus Christ.

3. "The whole passage is declaratory of the consequences flowing from justification by faith, and does not exhort, but assert." - The passage is not a call to action, but a declaration of the results that come from being justified by faith in Christ. It is a statement of truth rather than a command.

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Let us have peace" a reading, however, which most reject, because they think it unnatural to exhort men to have what it belongs to God to give.
2. If it be the privilege of the justified to "have peace with God," why might not the apostle begin his enumeration of the fruits of justification by calling on believers to "realize" this peace as belonged to them, or cherish the joyful consciousness of it as their own?
3. This "peace" is first a change in God's relation to us; and next, as the consequence of this, a change on our part towards Him.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Being justified by faith...we have peace." 
2. "True religion is often represented as peace with God."
3. "The effect of this plan, when the sinner embraces it, is to produce peace in his own mind."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "No exegete has been able satisfactorily to account for this imperative suddenly occurring in the midst of a didactic development."
2. "Some explain as a concessive subjunctive, we may have; but the use of this in independent sentences is doubtful."
3. "Others give the deliberative sense, shall we have; but this occurs only in doubtful questions, as Romans 6:1."

### John Calvin:
1. "When any one strives to seek tranquillity of conscience by works, he labors for it in vain; for either his heart is asleep through his disregard or forgetfulness of God’s judgment, or else it is full of trembling and dread, until it reposes on Christ, who is alone our peace."
2. "Peace with God is opposed to the dead security of the flesh, and for this reason, — because the first thing is, that every one should become awakened as to the account he must render of his life; and no one can stand boldly before God, but he who relies on a gratuitous reconciliation."
3. "This is the strongest of proofs, that our opponents do nothing but prate to no purpose, when they ascribe righteousness to works; for this conclusion of Paul is derived from this fact, — that miserable souls always tremble, except they repose on the grace of Christ."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The single act of justification is indicated in the original. The sense 'make righteous,' is altogether inappropriate here, destroying the whole force of the Apostle’s inference."
2. "The hindrance to peace has been removed by the death of Christ; God’s wrath against our sin is removed. Peace that does not rest upon this great fact is a dream and a delusion."
3. "This personal Lord has made peace, satisfied justice, removed the curse, made it possible for a holy God to be righteous in accounting righteous those, who by nature and character, are sinners."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Being therefore justified by faith...this is done by faith." 
2. "Let us have peace with God...Let us enjoy peace with God or Let us retain peace with God."
3. "The preceding justification 'made peace with God'."

### John Gill:
1. "Not that faith is at the first of our justification; for that is a sentence which passed in the mind of God from all eternity, and which passed on Christ, and on all the elect considered in him, when he rose from the dead."
2. "We are not justified by faith, either as God's work in us, for, as such, it is a part of sanctification; nor as our work or act, as exercised by us, for then we should be justified by works, by something of our own, and have whereof to glory."
3. "The apostle having set the doctrine of justification in a clear light, and fully proved that it is not by the works of men, but by the righteousness of God; and having mentioned the several causes of it, proceeds to consider its effects, among which, peace with God stands in the first place."

### John Wesley:
1. "Being justified by faith — This is the sum of the preceding chapters."
2. "We have peace with God — Being enemies to God no longer, Romans 5:10; neither fearing his wrath, Romans 5:9."
3. "We have peace, hope, love, and power over sin, the sum of the fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth chapters."
