# Romans 5:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Bible verse being described speaks of the profound concept of peace with God through justification by faith. Commentators emphasize that this peace is not attained through works, but by relying on the grace and reconciliation brought by Jesus Christ. They affirm that this peace is not a mere feeling, but a real change in our relationship with God, removing His wrath and allowing us to confidently stand before Him. This verse is seen as the foundation for various other blessings, such as hope, love, and victory over sin.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Let us have peace" - a reading that most reject, but it is worth considering if believers can "realize" and cherish the peace with God that comes from justification.
2. This peace is a change in God's relation to us and a change on our part towards Him. God has reconciled us to Himself through Jesus Christ, and we are reconciled to God.
3. The propitiation is the meeting-place where the controversy between God and us ends in an honorable and eternal peace.

### John Calvin:
1. "When any one strives to seek tranquillity of conscience by works, he labors for it in vain; for either his heart is asleep through his disregard or forgetfulness of God’s judgment, or else it is full of trembling and dread, until it reposes on Christ, who is alone our peace."
2. "Peace with God is opposed to the dead security of the flesh, and for this reason, — because the first thing is, that every one should become awakened as to the account he must render of his life; and no one can stand boldly before God, but he who relies on a gratuitous reconciliation."
3. "This is the strongest of proofs, that our opponents do nothing but prate to no purpose, when they ascribe righteousness to works; for this conclusion of Paul is derived from this fact, — that miserable souls always tremble, except they repose on the grace of Christ."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The single act of justification is indicated in the original. The sense 'make righteous,' is altogether inappropriate here, destroying the whole force of the Apostle's inference."
2. "The hindrance to peace has been removed by the death of Christ; God's wrath against our sin is removed. Peace that does not rest upon this great fact is a dream and a delusion."
3. "This personal Lord has made peace, satisfied justice, removed the curse, made it possible for a holy God to be righteous in accounting righteous those, who by nature and character, are sinners."

### John Gill:
1. "Not that faith is at the first of our justification; for that is a sentence which passed in the mind of God from all eternity, and which passed on Christ, and on all the elect considered in him, when he rose from the dead."
2. "We are not justified by faith, either as God's work in us, for, as such, it is a part of sanctification; nor as our work or act, as exercised by us, for then we should be justified by works, by something of our own, and have whereof to glory."
3. "The apostle having set the doctrine of justification in a clear light, and fully proved that it is not by the works of men, but by the righteousness of God; and having mentioned the several causes of it, proceeds to consider its effects, among which, peace with God stands in the first place."

### John Wesley:
1. "Being justified by faith - This is the sum of the preceding chapters."
2. "We have peace with God - Being enemies to God no longer, Romans 5:10; neither fearing his wrath, Romans 5:9."
3. "We have peace, hope, love, and power over sin, the sum of the fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth chapters."
