Furthermore, the ongoing work of Christ's life, intercession, and sovereignty is emphasized, assuring believers that they are saved, sanctified, and glorified through His continued action.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "For if, being enemies, we were reconciled to God by means of the death of His Son..." - This highlights the transformative power of Christ's death in reconciling humanity with God.

2. "Much more, having been reconciled, we shall be saved by means of His Life." - This emphasizes the ongoing salvation and life that believers receive through their connection with Christ.

3. "Both the objective reception into God's favor by the death of Christ, and the subjective appropriation, by faith, of that reception, are included." - This underscores the dual nature of reconciliation, involving both God's action and the believer's response of faith.

(Note: The commentary is quite lengthy, so I have selected three quotes that capture the essence of the author's thoughts on the verse.)

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "If that part of the Saviour's work which cost Him His blood, and which had to be wrought for persons incapable of the least sympathy either with His love or His labors in their behalf—even our 'justification,' our 'reconciliation'—is already completed; how much more will He do all that remains to be done, since He has it to do, not by death agonies any more, but in untroubled 'life,' and no longer for enemies, but for friends—from whom, at every stage of it, He receives the grateful response of redeemed and adoring souls?"

2. "To be 'saved from wrath through Him,' denotes here the whole work of Christ towards believers, from the moment of justification, when the wrath of God is turned away from them, till the Judge on the great white throne shall discharge that wrath upon them that 'obey not the Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ'; and that work may all be summed up in 'keeping them from falling, and presenting them faultless before the presence of His glory with exceeding joy' (Judges 1:24): thus are they 'saved from wrath through Him.'"

3. "He has it to do, not by death agonies any more, but in untroubled 'life,' and no longer for enemies, but for friends—from whom, at every stage of it, He receives the grateful response of redeemed and adoring souls?"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The work was undertaken while we were enemies. From being enemies we were changed to friends by that work. Thus, it was commenced by God; its foundation was laid while we were still hostile to it; it evinced, therefore, a determined purpose on the part of God to perform it; and he has thus given a pledge that it shall be perfected." 
2. "We are brought to an agreement; to a state of friendship and union. We became his friends, laid aside our opposition, and embraced him as our friend and portion. To effect this is the great design of the plan of salvation." 
3. "If in this state, when humble, despised, dying, dead, he had power to accomplish so great a work as to reconcile us to God, how much more may we expect that he will be able to keep us now that he is a living, exalted, and triumphant Redeemer."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The term represents the mutual estrangement and opposition which must accompany sin on man's part, and which requires reconciliation."
2. "In the Christian sense, the change in the relation of God and man effected through Christ."
3. "A corresponding movement on man's part toward God; yielding to the appeal of Christ's self-sacrificing love, laying aside his enmity, renouncing his sin, and turning to God in faith and obedience."

### John Calvin:
1. "We were enemies, he says, when Christ interposed for the purpose of propitiating the Father: through this reconciliation we are now friends; since this was effected by his death; much more influential and efficacious will be his life."
2. "By saying that we were reconciled to God by the death of Christ, he means, that it was the sacrifice of expiation, by which God was pacified towards the world."
3. "We do not know the gratuitous mercy of God otherwise than as it appears from this — that he spared not his only-begotten Son; for he loved us at a time when there was discord between him and us."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The Scriptures say that God has wrath against sinners (which really means that they are ‘enemies’ in the sense we advocate), they do not assert that He has the revengeful, passionate feelings which naturally belong to human enmity."
2. "Thus God’s wrath was removed, His justice satisfied, and, in consequence, men are reunited to Him as a loving and reconciled Father."
3. "The living Christ cannot leave without final success what His death effected. This, however, is accomplished not merely through His intercession, but also through His whole working in His kingly office for believers up to the completion of His work and kingdom."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "We were reconciled to God... God has attended to that himself." 
2. "We become reconciled to God by means of the death of God's Son." 
3. "Much more... we shall be saved 'by his life'... for he does live, 'ever living to intercede for them'."

### John Gill:
1. "Reconciliation implies a former state of friendship, a breach of that friendship, and a making of it up again; which no ways contradicts the everlasting and unchangeable love of God to his people."
2. "This expresses the wonderful love of God, since this reconciliation arises purely from himself; the scheme of it is of his own contriving; he, whose justice was affronted, and whose law was broken, took the first step towards it, and conducted the whole affair."
3. "In consequence of this, another reconciliation of them is made by the Spirit of God in regenerations, of which notice is taken in this passage: much more being reconciled: to God, as a sovereign God, in his decrees, in his providences, and in the method of salvation by his Son."

### John Wesley:
1. "As sure as" - The word "if" in this verse signifies a certainty, emphasizing the assurance of salvation.
2. "Sanctified and glorified" - The phrase "we shalt be saved" implies not only being saved from sin but also being transformed and glorified in the presence of God.
3. "Through his life" - This highlights the ongoing intercession of Jesus, who is alive and actively interceding for believers, ensuring their salvation.
