# Romans 5:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse under consideration speaks of an incredible transformation, as described by different commentators. The completion of the Savior's work in justifying and reconciling us, at great cost, is already assured. His ongoing work in our lives, not through death but in a life of love, is for friends rather than enemies. This work of salvation encompasses being saved from wrath through Christ, who reconciles us to God and grants us eternal life through His death and resurrection.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "If that part of the Saviour's work which cost Him His blood, and which had to be wrought for persons incapable of the least sympathy either with His love or His labors in their behalf—even our 'justification,' our 'reconciliation'—is already completed; how much more will He do all that remains to be done."
2. "He has it to do, not by death agonies any more, but in untroubled 'life,' and no longer for enemies, but for friends—from whom, at every stage of it, He receives the grateful response of redeemed and adoring souls?"
3. "To be 'saved from wrath through Him,' denotes here the whole work of Christ towards believers, from the moment of justification, when the wrath of God is turned away from them, till the Judge on the great white throne shall discharge that wrath upon them that 'obey not the Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ'."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The Scriptures say that God has wrath against sinners (which really means that they are 'enemies' in the sense we advocate), they do not assert that He has the revengeful, passionate feelings which naturally belong to human enmity."
2. "Thus God's wrath was removed, His justice satisfied, and, in consequence, men are reunited to Him as a loving and reconciled Father."
3. "The living Christ cannot leave without final success what His death effected. This, however, is accomplished not merely through His intercession, but also through His whole working in His kingly office for believers up to the completion of His work and kingdom."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "We were reconciled to God... God has attended to that himself." 
2. "We become reconciled to God by means of the death of God's Son." 
3. "Much more... we shall be saved 'by his life'."

### John Gill:
1. "Reconciliation implies a former state of friendship, a breach of that friendship, and a making of it up again; which no ways contradicts the everlasting and unchangeable love of God to his people."
2. "This expresses the wonderful love of God, since this reconciliation arises purely from himself; the scheme of it is of his own contriving; he, whose justice was affronted, and whose law was broken, took the first step towards it, and conducted the whole affair."
3. "In consequence of this, another reconciliation of them is made by the Spirit of God in regenerations, of which notice is taken in this passage: much more being reconciled: to God, as a sovereign God, in his decrees, in his providences, and in the method of salvation by his Son."

### John Wesley:
1. "If" in this verse signifies a certainty, emphasizing the assurance of salvation.
2. The phrase "we shalt be saved" refers to the process of sanctification and glorification.
3. Jesus, who is alive and intercedes for us, is the source of our salvation.
