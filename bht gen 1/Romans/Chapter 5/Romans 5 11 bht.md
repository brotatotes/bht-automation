### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Our first feeling towards God, after we have found peace with Him, is that of clinging gratitude for so costly a salvation; but no sooner have we learned to cry, Abba, Father, under the sweet sense of reconciliation, than 'gloriation' in Him takes the place of dread of Him, and now He appears to us 'altogether lovely!'" 

2. "How gloriously does the Gospel evince its divine origin by basing all acceptable obedience on 'peace with God,' laying the foundations of this peace in a righteous 'justification' of the sinner 'through our Lord Jesus Christ,' and making this the entrance to a permanent standing in the divine favor, and a triumphant expectation of future glory!" 

3. "Gratitude to God for redeeming love, if it could exist without delight in God Himself, would be a selfish and worthless feeling; but when the one rises into the other—the transporting sense of eternal 'reconciliation' passing into 'gloriation in God' Himself—then the lower is sanctified and sustained by the higher, and each feeling is perfective of the other."
