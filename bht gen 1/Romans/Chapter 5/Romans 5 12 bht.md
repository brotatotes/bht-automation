# Romans 5:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, we see the contrast between the introduction of sin and death into the world through Adam, and the redemption and justification found in Christ. Sin, both original and actual, entered the world through Adam's fall, resulting in death extending to all humanity. The effects of Adam's sin are transmitted to his descendants, affecting every individual with a sinful nature. However, in Christ, we find the solution to the calamity caused by Adam, as through Him, we receive redemption and the opportunity for righteousness and justification before God.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Consequently (the method of God’s procedure in introducing life by righteousness resembled the introduction of death by sin: ‘it was’) like as by one man sin entered into the world, and by means of sin death extended to all men."
2. "Death extended to all men, as a consequence of the fact, that, posito, that, = because, all have sinned."
3. "Sin, as above remarked, is here, throughout, both original and actual: in the seed, as planted in the nature by the sin of our forefather: and in the fruit, as developed by each conscious responsible individual in his own practice."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Things being so; referring back to the whole preceding argument."
2. "Death reaches every individual of the human family, as the penalty due to himself."
3. "Instead of this, we have a digression, extending to five verses, to illustrate the important statement."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "As [ωσπερ] begins the first member of a comparison."
2. "Entered into. As a principle till then external to the world."
3. "Passed upon [διηλθεν εφ] . Lit., came throughout upon."

### John Calvin:
1. "For since Christ came to redeem us from the calamity into which Adam had fallen, and had precipitated all his posterity with him, we cannot see with so much clearness what we have in Christ, as by having what we have lost in Adam set before us." 
2. "Paul distinctly affirms, that sin extends to all who suffer its punishment: and this he afterwards more fully declares, when subsequently he assigns a reason why all the posterity of Adam are subject to the dominion of death; and it is even this — because we have all, he says, sinned."
3. "Frivolous then was the gloss, by which formerly the Pelagians endeavored to elude the words of Paul, and held, that sin descended by imitation from Adam to the whole human race; for Christ would in this case become only the exemplar and not the cause of righteousness."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The comparison between Adam and Christ is the only apt one, and there is no reference to Satan, because the Apostle is concerned with the effect, not the mode, of the fall." 
2. "The presence of the definite article in the Greek, and the course of thought sustain the view that ‘sin’ is here regarded as a power or principle, personified as a fearful tyrant, who has acquired universal dominion over the human race."
3. "The entrance of death into the world of humanity was through sin, death as a power in the world resulted from the entrance of sin as a power; the two are uniformly connected in the Bible."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "For this reason." - This phrase refers to the argument made in verses Romans 5:1-11, highlighting the justification and exultant joy in Christ due to reconciliation and future salvation through his death and life.

2. "The effects of Adam's sin are transmitted to his descendants." - Paul emphasizes that the consequences of Adam's sin are passed down to all humanity, though he does not specify the mechanism of transmission, whether through natural or federal headship.

3. "Sin entered into the world." - Sin is personified as entering the world from outside humanity. Paul does not delve into the origin of evil beyond this point, contrasting with those who deny the existence of sin or view it as merely an animal inheritance.

4. "Death passed unto all men." - Paul distinguishes between physical death in Genesis and the concept of eternal death. The idea of eternal death is always present alongside physical death in Paul's understanding.

5. "For that all sinned." - This phrase expresses the constative aorist indicative of αμαρτανω, summarizing the history of the race's sin. The transmission from Adam to all humanity becomes a reality in individual experience.

### John Gill:
1. "The saints have not only an expiation of sin by the blood of Christ, but a perfect righteousness, by which they are justified in the sight of God."
2. "Sin entered into the world through Adam, not by imitation, but by imputation."
3. "Death and suffering did not exist until after Adam sinned. Hence before Adam sinned, no animal died and it would be impossible for any fossils to form."

### John Wesley:
1. "Sin entered into the world - Actual sin, and its consequence, a sinful nature."
2. "By sin - Therefore it could not enter before sin."
3. "All sinned - In Adam. These words assign the reason why death came upon all men; infants themselves not excepted, in that all sinned."
