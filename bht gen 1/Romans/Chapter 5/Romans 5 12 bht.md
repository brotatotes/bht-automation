# Romans 5:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Referring back to the preceding arguments, sin entered the world through Adam, resulting in the universal presence of death as a penalty for every individual in the human family. The comparison between Adam and Christ is the only suitable one, and the Apostle is more concerned with the effect of the fall rather than the mode. Sin, personified as a fearful tyrant, has attained dominion over humanity, leading to the entrance of death into the world. Wesley's explanation emphasizes that death came upon all men, including infants, as a result of sinning in Adam.
