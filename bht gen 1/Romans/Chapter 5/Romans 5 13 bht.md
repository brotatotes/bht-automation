# Romans 5:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Before the giving of the Mosaic law, sin already existed in the world. Sin is not solely a result of the law, but a deeper issue within humanity. God recognized and treated humanity as sinners even before the law was given. The law plays a crucial role in revealing and making sin known, as sin cannot be accounted for or attributed to someone if there is no law that defines it. The corruption of human nature and the committing of various sins were evident even before the law was established.

### John Calvin:
