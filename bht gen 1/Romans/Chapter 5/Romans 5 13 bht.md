# Romans 5:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Before the law was given, sin already existed in the world, indicating that sin is not a result of the law, but a preexisting reality. Sin is only reckoned and punished in the presence of a law to reveal its presence. The universal nature of sin is evident in the fact that all had sinned and experienced death, even before the law was established.
