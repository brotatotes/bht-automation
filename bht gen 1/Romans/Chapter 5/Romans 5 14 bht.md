# Romans 5:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
From various commentators, we learn that the verse being described speaks of the universal reign of death and its connection to sin. It emphasizes that death reigned over all, from Adam to Moses, and even those who had not transgressed in the same manner as Adam were still under its dominion. It is noted that the sin of Adam brought about severe consequences for humanity, resulting in death extending to infants and the innocent. However, in contrast to the consequences of Adam's sin, there is hope found in Christ's righteous work, which brings about life.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The universality of death is a proof that all sinned, for death is the consequence of sin."
2. "The aim is to prove that the seed of sin planted in the race by the one man Adam has sprung up and borne fruit in all, so as to bring them under death."
3. "As by Adam's transgression, of which we are by descent inheritors, we have become sinners, and have thus incurred death."

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "The meaning then must be, that 'death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over those that had not, like Adam, transgressed against a positive commandment, threatening death to the disobedient.'"
2. "In this case, the particle 'even,' instead of specifying one particular class of those who lived 'from Adam to Moses,' merely explains what it was that made the case of those who died from Adam to Moses worthy of special notice—namely, that 'though unlike Adam and all since Moses, those who lived between the two had no positive threatening of death for transgression, nevertheless, death reigned even over them.'"
3. "The point of analogy intended here is plainly the public character which both sustained, neither of the two being regarded in the divine procedure towards men as mere individual men, but both alike as representative men."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Death reigned - People died; they were under the dominion of death in its various melancholy influences."
2. "The point or emphasis of the remark here is, that it reigned over those that had sinned under a different economy from that of Adam. This was what rendered it so remarkable; and which showed that the withering curse of sin had been felt in all dispensations, and in all times."
3. "The expression 'he who was to come' is often used to denote the Messiah. As applied to him, it means that there was in some respects a similarity between the results of the conduct of Adam and the effects of the work of Christ."

### John Calvin:
1. "Hence they sinned not after the similitude of Adam’s transgression; for they had not, like him, the will of God made known to them by a certain oracle: for the Lord had forbidden Adam to touch the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil; but to them he had given no command besides the testimony of conscience."
2. "The Apostle then intended to imply, that it did not happen through the difference between Adam and his posterity that they were exempt from condemnation. Infants are at the same time included in their number."
3. "But in saying that Adam bore a resemblance to Christ, there is nothing incongruous; for some likeness often appears in things wholly contrary. As then we are all lost through Adam’s sin, so we are restored through Christ’s righteousness: hence he calls Adam not inaptly the type of Christ."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The consequence of sin (‘death through sin,’ Romans 5:12) was universal, even before the law: from Adam until Moses."
2. "Death, which here includes more than physical death, as the penalty of sin, lorded it over even such as did not sin, etc., i.e., were not guilty of a definite transgression."
3. "The Apostle’s argument is that death came upon these as a consequence of the sin of Adam, and thus he proves that ‘death came through unto all men, because all sinned’ in that transgression."

2. "Sin and death followed all from Adam on till Moses, showing clearly that the sin of Adam brought terrible consequences upon the race."
3. "Death has come upon infants and idiots also as a result of sin, but one understands Paul to mean that they are not held responsible by the law of conscience."

### John Gill:
1. "Death is represented as a king, as sin and Satan sometimes are; and indeed, death reigns by sin, and Satan both by sin and death; their empires rise, stand, and fall together."
2. "The subjects of his [death's] government were not only adult persons, who had been guilty of many actual transgressions, but he reigned even over them that had not sinned after the similitude of Adam's transgression."
3. "The true reason of their [infants'] dying is here suggested by the apostle; which is the transgression of Adam: who is the figure of him that was to come."

### John Wesley:
1. "Death reigned — And how vast is his kingdom! Scarce can we find any king who has as many subjects, as are the kings whom he hath conquered."
2. "Even over them that had not sinned after the likeness of Adam's transgression — Even over infants who had never sinned, as Adam did, in their own persons; and over others who had not, like him, sinned against an express law."
3. "As by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; so by one man righteousness entered into the world, and life by righteousness."
