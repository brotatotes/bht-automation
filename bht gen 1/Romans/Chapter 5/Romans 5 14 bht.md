# Romans 5:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
From the commentators' insights, we can gather that this Bible verse addresses the universal consequence of sin, death. It is noted that death reigned from the time of Adam until Moses, even over those who did not sin in the same way as Adam or against a specific command. The verse highlights the reach of death's dominion, extending even to infants who had not sinned personally. However, it reminds us that just as sin entered the world through one man, righteousness too entered through another, offering the hope of life.
