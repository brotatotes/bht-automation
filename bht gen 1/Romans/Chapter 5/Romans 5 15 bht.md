# Romans 5:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we are presented with a comparison between the consequences of Adam's fall and the redemptive work of Jesus Christ. Commentators highlight both the contrast and resemblance between the two events. The grace of God, through Jesus Christ, is described as a much more abundant and profound gift bestowed on undeserving individuals. The effects of Christ's sacrifice far surpass the effects of Adam's transgression, bringing greater benefits and righteousness to all who believe. Through this comparison, we gain an understanding of the certainty and magnitude of God's redemptive plan.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "For if by the transgression of the one (man) the many (have) died, much more did the grace of God, and the gift abound in (by means of) the grace of the one man Jesus Christ towards the many." 
2. "Here, the question is of abounding, a matter of degree, there, of reigning, a matter of fact."
3. "So that I think the quantitative sense the better, and join πολλῷ μᾶλλον with ἐπερίσσευσεν, in the sense of much more abundant (rich in diffusion) was the gift, &c."
4. "The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ (His self-offering love, see 2Co 8:9) is the medium by which the free gift is imparted to men."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The two cases present points of contrast as well as resemblance."
2. "By 'the free gift' is meant... the glorious gift of justifying righteousness."
3. "And the 'much more,' of the one case than the other, does not mean that we get much more of good by Christ than of evil by Adam... but that we have much more reason to expect... that the many should be benefited by the merit of one, than that they should suffer for the sin of one."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The favor, benefit, or good bestowed gratuitously on us. It refers to the favors bestowed in the gospel by Christ. These are free, that is, without merit on our part, and bestowed on the undeserving."
2. "The apostle does not labor to prove that this is so. This is not the point of his argument, He assumes that as what was seen and known everywhere. His main point is to show that greater benefits have resulted from the work of the Messiah than evils from the fall of Adam."
3. "The intervention of the plan of atonement by the Messiah, prevented the immediate execution of the penalty of the Law, and produced all the benefits to all the race, resulting from the sparing mercy of God. In this respect it was co-extensive with the fall."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The character of God is such, from a Christian point of view, that the comparison gives a much more certain basis for belief, in what is gained through the second Adam, than in the certainties of sin and death through the first Adam."
2. "As the fall of Adam caused vast evil, the work of the far greater Christ shall much more cause great results of good."
3. "The argument seems to turn rather on the question of certainty."

Note: The commentary is discussing the comparison between Adam and Christ, emphasizing the certainty and magnitude of the good brought by Christ compared to the evil caused by Adam.

### John Calvin:
1. "Though he mentions oftentimes a difference, yet there are none of these repetitions in which there is not a want of a corresponding clause, or in which there is not at least an ellipsis."
2. "But as they cannot be disproved, who wish to take the passage without this inference, I am willing that they should choose either of these views; though what next follows cannot be deemed an inference, yet it is of the same meaning."
3. "Grace is properly set in opposition to offense; the gift which proceeds from grace, to death. Hence grace means the free goodness of God or gratuitous love, of which he has given us a proof in Christ, that he might relieve our misery."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The word here used refers to an act of sin, and is almost the same as ‘transgression’ (Romans 5:14), and ‘disobedience’ (Romans 5:19). Perhaps this suggests, more than the other terms, the idea of weakness, hence ‘fall’ expresses one phase of the meaning."
2. "Four different words are used in this passage to express the same thought of free grace, and it is difficult to distinguish them in English."
3. "Not simply that the gift was more abundant, but with much more certainty is it to be expected from God, or has God proved, that grace abounds."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "The gift surpasses the sin."
2. "As a God of love, he delights much more in showing mercy and pardon than in giving just punishment."
3. "It is not necessary to Paul's argument to make 'the many' in each case correspond, one relates to Adam, the other to Christ."

### John Gill:
1. "By 'the offence', or 'fall', as the word signifies, is meant the first sin of Adam; by which he offended God, and fell from that estate in which he was created, and all his posterity with him."
2. "Both are sole authors of what they convey to their respective offspring, Adam of sin, Christ of righteousness."
3. "The righteousness of Christ, in which the grace of God is so illustrious, is much more effectual to the giving of life to all his seed and offspring."

### John Wesley:
1. "The fall and the free gift differ, 1. In amplitude." 
2. "He from whom sin came, and He from whom the free gift came, termed also 'the gift of righteousness,' differ in power." 
3. "The offence and the free gift are compared, with regard to their effect, Romans 5:18, and with regard to their cause, Romans 5:19."
