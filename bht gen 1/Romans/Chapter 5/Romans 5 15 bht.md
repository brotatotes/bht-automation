## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "The two cases present points of contrast as well as resemblance."
2. "By 'the free gift' is meant the glorious gift of justifying righteousness."
3. "And the 'much more,' of the one case than the other, does not mean that we get much more of good by Christ than of evil by Adam, but that we have much more reason to expect... that the many should be benefited by the merit of one, than that they should suffer for the sin of one."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The character of God is such, from a Christian point of view, that the comparison gives a much more certain basis for belief, in what is gained through the second Adam, than in the certainties of sin and death through the first Adam."
2. "The fall of Adam caused vast evil, the work of the far greater Christ shall much more cause great results of good."
3. "The argument seems to turn rather on the question of certainty."

Note: The commentary provides additional insight into the comparison between Adam and Christ, emphasizing the certainty and magnitude of the good brought by Christ compared to the evil caused by Adam.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The word here used refers to an act of sin, and is almost the same as 'transgression' and 'disobedience'. Perhaps this suggests, more than the other terms, the idea of weakness, hence 'fall' expresses one phase of the meaning."
2. "Four different words are used in this passage to express the same thought of free grace, and it is difficult to distinguish them in English."
3. "Not simply that the gift was more abundant, but with much more certainty is it to be expected from God, or has God proved, that grace abounds."

### John Gill:
1. "By 'the offence', or 'fall', as the word signifies, is meant the first sin of Adam; by which he offended God, and fell from that estate in which he was created, and all his posterity with him."
2. "Both convey single things, Adam only one sin, not more... Christ conveys his righteousness, or obedience to the law, without any additional works of righteousness of ours to complete it."
3. "The righteousness of Christ, in which the grace of God is so illustrious, is much more effectual to the giving of life to all his seed and offspring; not barely such a life as Adam had in innocence, and which he lost by the offence, but a spiritual and an eternal one."

### John Wesley:
1. "The fall and the free gift differ, 1. In amplitude" - This quote highlights that there is a significant difference between the fall of Adam and the free gift of righteousness through Christ. The magnitude or extent of these two events is not the same.

2. "He from whom sin came, and He from whom the free gift came, termed also 'the gift of righteousness,' differ in power" - This quote emphasizes that the power or source of sin and the gift of righteousness are distinct. Sin came from Adam, while the free gift of righteousness came from Christ.

3. "The offence and the free gift are compared, with regard to their effect" - This quote suggests that the commentary discusses the comparison between the effect of the offense (Adam's fall) and the effect of the free gift (righteousness through Christ). The consequences or outcomes of these two events are being examined.
