## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "The condemnation by Adam was for one sin; but the justification by Christ is an absolution not only from the guilt of that first offense, mysteriously attaching to every individual of the race, but from the countless offenses it, to which, as a germ lodged in the bosom of every child of Adam, it unfolds itself in his life."
2. "This is the meaning of 'grace abounding towards us in the abundance of the gift of righteousness.' It is a grace not only rich in its character, but rich in detail."
3. "It is a 'righteousness' not only rich in a complete justification of the guilty, condemned sinner; but rich in the amplitude of the ground which it covers, leaving no one sin of any of the justified uncancelled, but making him, though loaded with the guilt of myriads of offenses, 'the righteousness of God in Christ.'"

### John Calvin:
1. "By one offense guilt issued in the condemnation of us all, but that grace, or rather the gratuitous gift, is efficacious to our justification from many offenses."
2. "It is indeed an expansion of what the last verse contains; for he had not hitherto expressed, how or in what respect Christ excelled Adam."
3. "Observe also, that these many offenses, from which he affirms we are freed through Christ, are not to be understood only of those which every one must have committed before baptism, but also of those by which the saints contract daily new guilt."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "A single act of sin is referred to in either case."
2. "The judicial sentence of God... may refer to a favorable or unfavorable sentence."
3. "The many sins of men could be pardoned only by a 'free gift.' In this sense they were the origin or occasion of the free gift."

### John Gill:
1. "The apostle goes on with the dissimilitude between the effects of Adam's sin, and Christ's righteousness."
2. "The righteousness of Christ, which stands opposed to the guilt of Adam's sin, being imputed to all his offspring, is to the justification of them."
3. "Another instance of the exuberance, or abounding of the grace of God, in the righteousness of Christ, not only over the sin of the one man, but also over the sins of many, even all the elect of God."
