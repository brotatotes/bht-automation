# Romans 5:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Through Adam's one offense, he faced condemnation and received the sentence of death. However, the free gift of justification, available to all despite the multitude of offenses committed, stands in stark contrast. This gift demonstrates God's grace and mercy, purchasing it for all individuals, regardless of their past transgressions. It highlights the inclusive nature of God's love, extending His offer of salvation to anyone who seeks it.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "And not as (that which took place) by one that sinned, so is the gift." 
2. "For the judgment (pronounced by God upon Adam) came of (was by occasion of) one (man having sinned) unto condemnation, but the gift of grace was by occasion of many transgressions unto justification." 
3. "The only difficulty here is the sense of δικαίωμα. The ordinary meaning of the word is 'the amendment of an evil deed,' but this, which Aristotle insists on as the proper, but not perhaps usual sense of the word, is not to be pressed in the N. T., and does not, though upheld by Calv., Calov., Wolf, and Röthe, suit the context as contrasted with κατάκριμα."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The condemnation by Adam was for one sin; but the justification by Christ is an absolution not only from the guilt of that first offense, mysteriously attaching to every individual of the race, but from the countless offenses it, to which, as a germ lodged in the bosom of every child of Adam, it unfolds itself in his life."
2. "This is the meaning of 'grace abounding towards us in the abundance of the gift of righteousness.' It is a grace not only rich in its character, but rich in detail."
3. "It is a 'righteousness' not only rich in a complete justification of the guilty, condemned sinner; but rich in the amplitude of the ground which it covers, leaving no one sin of any of the justified uncancelled, but making him, though loaded with the guilt of myriads of offenses, 'the righteousness of God in Christ'."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The effects of Adam’s sin, whatever they were, pertained to the one sin; the effects of the work of Christ, to many sins."
2. "The work of Christ is designed to have reference to many offences, so as to produce pardon or justification in regard to them all."
3. "However this may be, it is certain that the apostle has in neither case here explained the mode in which it is done. He has simply stated the fact, a fact which he did not seem to consider himself called on to explain."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The judgment [κριμα] . Judicial sentence."
2. "Condemnation [κατακριμα] . A condemnatory sentence."
3. "Justification [δικαιωμα] . Not the subjective state of justification, but a righteous act or deed."

### John Calvin:
1. "By one offense guilt issued in the condemnation of us all, but that grace, or rather the gratuitous gift, is efficacious to our justification from many offenses."
2. "It is indeed an expansion of what the last verse contains; for he had not hitherto expressed, how or in what respect Christ excelled Adam."
3. "Observe also, that these many offenses, from which he affirms we are freed through Christ, are not to be understood only of those which every one must have committed before baptism, but also of those by which the saints contract daily new guilt; and on account of which they would be justly exposed to condemnation, were they not continually relieved by this grace."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "A single act of sin is referred to in either case."
2. "The judicial sentence of God. The word itself may refer to a favorable or unfavorable sentence."
3. "The many sins of men could be pardoned only by a 'free gift.' In this sense they were the origin or occasion of the free gift."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Through one having sinned." - This highlights the role of Adam as the source of sin and sets up a contrast between him and Christ.
2. "The gift by Christ grew out of manifold sins by Adam's progeny." - This emphasizes the connection between the sins of Adam's descendants and the gift of justification through Christ.
3. "Justification...verdict as here (acquittal)." - This clarifies that justification is not just an act of righteousness, but also a verdict of acquittal for those who believe in Christ.

### John Gill:
1. "The apostle goes on with the dissimilitude between the effects of Adam's sin, and Christ's righteousness."
2. "The righteousness of Christ, which stands opposed to the guilt of Adam's sin, being imputed to all his offspring, is to the justification of them."
3. "Another instance of the exuberance, or abounding of the grace of God, in the righteousness of Christ, not only over the sin of the one man, but also over the sins of many, even all the elect of God."

### John Wesley:
1. "By one offence to Adam's condemnation" - This highlights how Adam's sin led to his condemnation and the passing of the sentence of death upon him. It emphasizes the consequences of his actions and the impact it had on all of humanity.

2. "The free gift is of many offences unto justification" - This phrase emphasizes the contrast between Adam's one offense and the free gift of justification. It highlights that despite the multitude of offenses committed by humanity, the free gift of justification is available to all, demonstrating God's grace and mercy.

3. "Unto the purchasing it for all men, notwithstanding many offences" - This quote emphasizes that the free gift of justification is available to all individuals, regardless of the many offenses they may have committed. It highlights the inclusive nature of God's gift and His willingness to extend His grace to all who seek it.
