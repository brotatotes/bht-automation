# Romans 5:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we see a contrast between the consequences of Adam's sin and the abundant grace and gift of righteousness found in Jesus Christ. Death reigned as a consequence of Adam's sin, but through Christ, a reign of life is established. The reception of this grace and gift is not a one-time event, but a continuous process by which the abundance of God's grace is imparted. It is through this grace and gift that believers receive the right to live a righteous and eternal life, reigning with Christ in the glorious territory of life.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "That which came in by the one sinner, was the reign of DEATH: that which shall come in by the One, Jesus Christ, will be a reigning in LIFE." 
2. "If by the transgression of the one, death reigned by means of the one, much more shall they who receive the abundance of the grace and of the gift of righteousness reign in life by means of the one Jesus Christ."
3. "The present λαμβάνοντες, instead of λαβόντες, is not merely used in a substantive sense, receptores, but signifies that the reception is not one act merely, but a continued process by which the περισσεία is imparted."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Here, for the first time in this section, he speaks of that LIFE which springs out of justification, in contrast with the death which springs from sin and follows condemnation."
2. "The proper idea of it therefore is, 'Right to live'—'Righteous life'—life possessed and enjoyed with the good will, and in conformity with the eternal law, of 'Him that sitteth on the Throne'; life therefore in its widest sense—life in the whole man and throughout the whole duration of human existence, the life of blissful and loving relationship to God in soul and body, for ever and ever."
3. "While freedom and might are implied in the figure of 'reigning,' 'life' is represented as the glorious territory or atmosphere of that reign."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "If, under the administration of a just and merciful Being, it has occurred, that by the offence of one, death hath exerted so wide a dominion; we have reason much more to expect under that administration, that they who are brought under his plan of saving mercy shall be brought under a dispensation of life."
2. "The evils which they suffer in consequence of the sin of Adam bear no comparison with the mercies of eternal life that shall flow to them from the work of the Saviour."
3. "If by one man’s sin, death reigned over those who were under condemnation in consequence of it, we have much more reason to suppose that they who are delivered from sin by the death of Christ, and accepted of God, shall reign with him in life."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The effect of the second Adam cannot fall behind that of the first."
2. "If death reigned, there must be a reign of life."
3. "They which receive, not believingly accept, but simply the recipients."

### John Calvin:
1. "The sum of the whole is this — that Christ surpasses Adam; the sin of one is overcome by the righteousness of the other; the curse of one is effaced by the grace of the other; from one, death has proceeded, which is absorbed by the life which the other bestows."
2. "The first is, that by Adam’s sin we are not condemned through imputation alone, as though we were punished only for the sin of another; but we suffer his punishment, because we also ourselves are guilty; for as our nature is vitiated in him, it is regarded by God as having committed sin."
3. "The other difference is, that the benefit of Christ does not come to all men, while Adam has involved his whole race in condemnation; and the reason of this is indeed evident; for as the curse we derive from Adam is conveyed to us by nature, it is no wonder that it includes the whole mass; but that we may come to a participation of the grace of Christ, we must be ingrafted in him by faith."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The repetition is probably to prepare for the triumphant close of the verse, contrasting the two persons."
2. "If this was God’s way of justice, with much more certainty will His way of grace be, as is now described."
3. "The whole clause has a triumphant tone, pointing from present grace to future glory, all mediated through the one, Jesus Christ."

### John Gill:
1. "It was the single sin of Adam, the first sin that was committed by him, which gave death its reigning power over the sons of men."
2. "Death is represented as a mighty monarch, a powerful king; and designs not only corporeal death, but also a moral or spiritual death, which has seized on all mankind."
3. "By abundance of grace is designed, either something distinct from the justifying righteousness of Christ, or rather the same with 'the gift of righteousness', because of the large display of the grace of God in it."

### John Wesley:
1. "Grace is opposed to the offence."
2. "The gift, [is] being the gift of life."
3. "Grace is the unmerited favor of God, while the gift is the result of that favor, which is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord."
