# Romans 5:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, Paul resumes the parallel between Adam and Christ, highlighting the contrast between the condemnation brought upon all by Adam's offense and the justification of life brought upon all through Christ's righteousness. The concept of imputed guilt and divine condemnation to eternal death is contrasted with the imputation of Christ's righteousness, which freely justifies believers and entitles them to eternal life. This justification, conceived in the mind of God from eternity, is a powerful act of redemption that reconciles believers with God, granting them forgiveness and a new life in Christ.
