## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "By the 'obedience' of Christ here is plainly not meant more than what divines call His active obedience, as distinguished from His sufferings and death it is the entire work of Christ in its obediential character."
2. "The significant word twice rendered made, does not signify to work a change upon a person or thing, but to constitute or ordain, as will be seen from all the places where it is used."
3. "The change of tense from the past to the future—'as through Adam we were made sinners, so through Christ we shall be made righteous'—delightfully expresses the enduring character of the act, and of the economy to which such acts belong, in contrast with the forever-past ruin of believers in Adam."

### John Calvin:
1. "He shows that we are guilty through the offense of one man, in such a manner as not to be ourselves innocent."
2. "Christ, in satisfying the Father, has provided a righteousness for us."
3. "We may also hence learn, how false are the schemes which they take to pacify God, who of themselves devise what they obtrude on him."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "As a consequence of the disobedience of the one man (Adam) the many (including all his posterity) were constituted sinners (put in the category of sinners, subject to condemnation), so also in consequence of the obedience of the one (Christ) shall the many (as many as believe in Him, Romans 5:17) be constituted righteous (be placed in that category)."
2. "The main point open to discussion, is respecting the exact sense of the word 'constituted' or 'made.' Three views: (1) set down, placed, as such, in a declarative sense; (2.) placed in the category, because of a vital connection; (3) becoming so ethically, not declaratively. The last seems contrary to the whole course of thought."
3. "The emphasis in this verse and throughout is placed by Paul upon the positive and gracious side of the parallel: righteousness and life to the many through the One Jesus Christ, while interpreters too often dwell well-nigh exclusively upon the other side."

### John Wesley:
1. "By the disobedience of one man many (that is, all men) were constituted sinners." - This highlights the concept of original sin, explaining how all humanity inherited a sinful nature from Adam, our common ancestor.
2. "By the obedience of one... by his dying for us." - This emphasizes the redemptive work of Jesus Christ, who through his obedience and sacrificial death, offers salvation to all who believe in him.
3. "Shall be constituted righteous - Justified, pardoned." - This reveals the outcome of faith in Christ, that believers are not only forgiven but also declared righteous before God, through the imputation of Christ's righteousness.
