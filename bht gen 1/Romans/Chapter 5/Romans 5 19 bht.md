# Romans 5:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Through the disobedience of Adam, all of humanity became sinners, inheriting a nature inclined towards sin. As descendants of Adam, we were spiritually present in him, sharing in the guilt and consequences of his transgression. But through the obedience of Jesus Christ, a new possibility arises. Through his perfect obedience and sacrifice, he offers righteousness and justification to all who believe in him, countering the effects of Adam's disobedience. It is through Christ's obedience that many are made righteous, experiencing a transformation from sinners to the righteous children of God.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The disobedience of Adam having been the inlet to all this: compare ἐφʼ ᾡ πάντες ἥμαρτον Rom 5:12 and the notes, on the kind of sin spoken of in this whole passage, as being both original and actual."
2. "Justification, as regards the many, is not yet completed."
3. "In Christ and united to Him, he is made righteous, not by a fiction, or imputation only of Christ’s righteousness, but by a real and living spiritual union with a righteous Head as a righteous member."

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "By the 'obedience' of Christ here is plainly not meant more than what divines call His active obedience, as distinguished from His sufferings and death it is the entire work of Christ in its obediential character."
2. "The significant word twice rendered made, does not signify to work a change upon a person or thing, but to constitute or ordain, as will be seen from all the places where it is used."
3. "The change of tense from the past to the future—'as through Adam we were made sinners, so through Christ we shall be made righteous'—delightfully expresses the enduring character of the act, and of the economy to which such acts belong, in contrast with the forever-past ruin of believers in Adam."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The apostle in this verse guards against this, and affirms that they are in fact sinners. He affirms that those who are sinners are condemned, and that the sufferings brought in on account of the sin of Adam, are introduced because many were made sinners." 

2. "The whole scope of the argument is, moreover, against this; for the object of the apostle is not to show that they were charged with the sin of another, but that they were in fact sinners themselves." 

3. "The facts here stated accord with all the analogy in the moral government of God. The drunkard secures as a result commonly, that his family will be reduced to beggary, want, and woe. A pirate, or a traitor, will overwhelm not himself only, but his family in ruin. Such is the great law or constitution on which society is now organized; and we are not to be surprised that the same principle occurred in the primary organization of human affairs."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Parakoh is therefore, primarily, a failing to hear or hearing amiss."
2. "The disobedience of Adam is thus declared to have been the occasion of the death of all, because it is the occasion of their sin."
3. "Note the play on the words, parakoe, hypokoe, disobedience, obedience."

### John Calvin:
1. "He shows that we are guilty through the offense of one man, in such a manner as not to be ourselves innocent."
2. "Christ, in satisfying the Father, has provided a righteousness for us."
3. "We truly worship him when we follow what he has commanded us, and render obedience to his word."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "As a consequence of the disobedience of the one man (Adam) the many (including all his posterity) were constituted sinners, so also in consequence of the obedience of the one (Christ) shall the many be constituted righteous." 
2. "The contrasts are exact, except that 'the many' comes in as a middle term of quantity, that 'man' is omitted in the second clause, where moreover the future is substituted for the past, showing that the actual efficacy of the gospel is here spoken of, and not the objective sufficiency."
3. "The emphasis in this verse and throughout is placed by Paul upon the positive and gracious side of the parallel: righteousness and life to the many through the One Jesus Christ, while interpreters too often dwell well-nigh exclusively upon the other side."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Here again we have 'the one' with both Adam and Christ."
2. "Disobedience contrasted with obedience."
3. "The many in both cases (but with different meaning as with 'all men' above)."

### John Gill:
1. "By the obedience of Christ, all his seed are made righteous, and come under a sentence of justification of life."
2. "The persons made sinners are said to be 'many', in opposition to the 'one man', by whose disobedience they became so."
3. "Adam's posterity are made sinners through his disobedience, in the same way as Christ's seed are made righteous by his obedience, which is by the imputation of it to them."

### John Wesley:
1. "By the disobedience of one man many were constituted sinners" - This highlights the concept of original sin, where Adam's disobedience affected all of humanity, making them sinners by nature.

2. "Being then in the loins of their first parent" - This phrase emphasizes the idea that all humans were spiritually present in Adam, and therefore share in the consequences of his actions.

3. "By the obedience of one...many shall be constituted righteous" - This points to the redemptive work of Jesus, who through his obedience and sacrifice, offers justification and righteousness to all who believe in him.
