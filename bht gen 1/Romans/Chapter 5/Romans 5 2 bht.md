# Romans 5:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, we are reminded of the profound impact of faith and grace in our lives. Through faith, we are introduced into a permanent standing in favor of God, rejoicing not simply in our present state of grace, but also in the hope of sharing in God's glory. Our access to God and acceptance in His presence is solely through Christ, creating a close and intimate relationship with Him. Through grace, we experience God's love, forgiveness, and blessings, knowing that it is not earned, but freely given.
