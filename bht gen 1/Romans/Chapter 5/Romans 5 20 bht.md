# Romans 5:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The law of Moses entered as an additional measure that revealed the extent of sin and the need for a deliverer. It did not diminish sin, but rather exposed it and multiplied transgressions. However, where sin abounded, the grace of God overflowed even more. This grace triumphed over sin, offering not only forgiveness but also the abundance of holiness and eternal life through Jesus Christ. The law's purpose was fulfilled as it paved the way for the revelation of God's abounding grace.

By 'the law' is meant, not the law of nature, much less the law of sin; rather the ceremonial law, which came in over and above the moral law; it entered but for a time; by which sin abounded, and appeared very sinful; and through it the grace of God much more abounded, in the sacrifice of Christ prefigured by it."

2. "the moral law, as it came by Moses, is here intended; which entered with great pomp and solemnity on Mount Sinai; and intervened, or came between Adam's sin and Christ's sacrifice; and also came in besides, or over and above the promise of life by Christ; and may moreover be said to enter into the conscience of a sinner, with the power and energy of the Spirit of God."

3. "but where sin abounded, grace did much more abound: sin has abounded in human nature, in all the individuals of it; and grace has superabounded in the same nature, being assumed by the Son of God, and united to him, who has appeared in it 'full of grace and truth', John 1:14."
