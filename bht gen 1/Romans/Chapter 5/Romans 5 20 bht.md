# Romans 5:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, commentators highlight the impact of the law and grace in revealing the sinful nature of humanity and the abundance of God's mercy. The law at Sinai was added to reveal the need for the remedy of Christ, and while it exposed the multitude of transgressions, it did not provide justification. However, through the overflowing abundance of grace, sin is not only forgiven but also transformed into holiness, leading to eternal life. The law magnifies sin, but grace reigns through righteousness, bringing about the glory and goodness of God.

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "The promulgation of the law at Sinai was no primary or essential feature of the divine plan, but it was 'added' for a subordinate purpose - the more fully to reveal the evil occasioned by Adam, and the need and glory of the remedy by Christ."
2. "All our multitudinous breaches of the law are nothing but that one first offense, lodged mysteriously in the bosom of every child of Adam as an offending principal, and multiplying itself into myriads of particular offenses in the life of each."
3. "The comparison here is between the multiplication of one offense into countless transgressions, and such an overflow of grace as more than meets that appalling case."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The design of the law was not to multiply sin as such, but to make it appear, to reveal it to the conscience, as a transgression of the law of God." 
2. "The ultimate purpose of the exceeding abounding of grace is to bring good out of evil; to make it the occasion of the most wonderful display of his glory and grace."
3. "Grace reigns through righteousness, eternal life as the result."


### John Gill:
1. "By prohibiting them, whereby the corrupt nature of man becomes more eager after them; and by accusing, threatening, terrifying, and condemning, on account of them." 
2. "One view of the apostle in this, doubtless, is to show, that there can be no justification by the law." 
3. "Sin has abounded in human nature, in all the individuals of it; and grace has superabounded in the same nature, being assumed by the Son of God, and united to him."

### John Wesley:
1. "The consequence (not the design) of the law's coming in was, not the taking away of sin, but the increase of it."
2. "Yet where sin abounded, grace did much more abound."
3. "Not only in the remission of that sin which Adam brought on us, but of all our own; not only in remission of sins, but infusion of holiness; not only in deliverance from death, but admission to everlasting life."
