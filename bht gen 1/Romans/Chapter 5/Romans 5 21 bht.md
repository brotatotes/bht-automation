# Romans 5:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, there is a clear contrast between sin and grace. Sin previously ruled over humanity, but now grace reigns, bringing salvation. Our access to eternal life is not through our own righteousness, but through the righteousness of Jesus Christ. It is important to recognize that all our blessings, including forgiveness and eternal life, stem from the abundant and undeserved grace of God.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "The grace which originated the scheme of salvation, the grace which 'sent the Son to be the Saviour of the world,' the grace which 'made Him to be sin for us who knew no sin,' the grace which 'makes us to be the righteousness of God in Him,' so that 'we who receive the abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness do reign in life by One, Jesus Christ!'"
2. "The apostle, after saying that Adam's sin introduced death into the world, does not say 'and so death passed upon all men for that Adam 'sinned,' but 'for that all sinned.' Thus, according to the teaching of the apostle, 'the death of all is for the sin of all'; and as this cannot mean the personal sins of each individual, but some sin of which unconscious infants are guilty equally with adults, it can mean nothing but the one 'first transgression' of their common head, regarded as the sin of each of his race, and punished, as such, with death."
3. "By 'death' then, in this section, we understand the sinner's destruction, in the only sense in which he is capable of it. Even temporal death is called 'destruction' (Deuteronomy 7:23; 1 Samuel 5:11, c.), as extinguishing all that men regard as life. But a destruction extending to the soul as well as the body, and into the future world, is clearly expressed in Matthew 7:13; 2 Thessalonians 1:9; 2 Peter 3:16, c. This is the penal 'death' of our section, and in this view of it we retain its proper sense."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "How much is lost by the inaccurate rendering of the prepositions."
2. "Ellicott remarks that there are few points more characteristic of the apostle's style than his varied but accurate use of prepositions."
3. "And now - so this last word seems to say - Adam has passed away; Christ alone remains."

### John Gill:
1. "Sin has such a power over man in a state of nature, as amounts to a dominion; it has not only an enticing, ensnaring power, to draw into a compliance with it, and an obstructive power to hinder that which is good, and an operative one of that which is evil, and a captivating, enslaving one to the same; but it has a kingly, governing, and commanding power." 

2. "Grace reigns or bears sway in man's salvation in all the parts of it, 'through righteousness'; consistent with the justice of God, in a way in which that is glorified, through the redemption of Christ."

3. "Grace as it is in the hearts of converted persons, is meant where it reigns, has the dominion, is the governing principle, and that in a way of righteousness and true holiness; and will reign until it is perfected in glory, or is crowned with eternal life."

### John Wesley:
1. "That as sin had reigned-so grace also might reign" - This highlights the contrast between sin and grace, showing that just as sin had dominion over humanity, grace now has the power to rule and bring salvation.
2. "Through righteousness to eternal life by Jesus Christ our Lord" - This emphasizes that our access to eternal life is not based on our own righteousness or works, but solely through the righteousness of Jesus Christ.
3. "Here is pointed out the source of all our blessings, the rich and free grace of God" - This reminds us that all the blessings we receive, including forgiveness and eternal life, come from the abundant and undeserved grace of God.
