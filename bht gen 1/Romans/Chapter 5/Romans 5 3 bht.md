# Romans 5:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, believers are called to patiently endure, and even find reasons to rejoice and glory in their tribulations. These trials are seen as divinely appointed and serve as a means of sanctification, promoting patience, experience, and hope. The verse presents a paradoxical view of the Christian faith, where believers consider suffering an honor and a token of God's fatherly love. Through enduring tribulations, believers are refined and prepared for a greater and more glorious future, finding blessings in the midst of their trials.

Because suffering is made the means of their own sanctification and preparation for usefulness here, and for heaven hereafter."
