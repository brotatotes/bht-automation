## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Christ when we were yet weak (‘powerless for good;’ or even stronger than that: there seems in this verse to be a tacit reference to Ezekiel 16:0."
2. "Christ died for (‘on behalf of,’ see reff.) ungodly men."
3. "The Apostle wishes to bring out fully by this strong antithesis, which he enlarges on in the next verses, the greatness of the divine Love to man."

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Christ died for the ungodly" - This quote highlights the remarkable nature of God's love, as Christ willingly sacrificed Himself for those who were undeserving and morally repulsive in the eyes of God.

2. "He did this 'when they were without strength'" - This quote emphasizes the helplessness of humanity, unable to save themselves from perdition. It underscores the divine compassion that bridged the gap between humanity and salvation.

3. "He did this 'at the due time'" - This quote signifies the perfect timing of Christ's sacrifice, demonstrating the wisdom and appropriateness of God's plan. It suggests that the appointed season was the most fitting moment for redemption to occur.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "God had given the most ample proof that he would save us by giving his Son when we were sinners; and he who had done so much for us when we were enemies, would not now fail us when we are his friends."
2. "While all hope of man’s being saved by any plan of his own was thus taken away; while he was thus lying exposed to divine justice, and dependent on the mere mercy of God; God provided a plan which met the case, and secured his salvation."
3. "It was a fit or proper time. All experiments had failed to save people. For four thousand years the trial had been made under the Law among the Jews: and by the aid of the most enlightened reason in Greece and Rome; and still it was in vain. No scheme had been devised to meet the maladies of the world, and to save people from death."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The classical writers furnish instances where the meanings seem to be interchanged."
2. "The most that can be said is that uJper borders on the meaning of ajnti."
3. "The true explanation seems to be that, in the passages principally in question, those, namely, relating to Christ's death, as here, Galatians 3:13; Romans 14:15; 1 Peter 3:18, uJper characterizes the more indefinite and general proposition - Christ died on behalf of - leaving the peculiar sense of in behalf of undetermined, and to be settled by other passages."

### John Calvin:
1. "If Christ had mercy on the ungodly, if he reconciled enemies to his Father, if he has done this by the virtue of his death, much more easily will he save them when justified, and keep those restored to favor in the possession of it, especially when the influence of his life is added to the virtue of his death."
2. "For as we are all born the children of wrath, so we are kept under that curse until we become partakers of Christ."
3. "When, therefore, we were weak, that is, when we were in no way worthy or fit that God should look on us, at this very time Christ died for the ungodly: for the beginning of religion is faith, from which they were all alienated, for whom Christ died."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The internal experience would be a delusion, were it not based on this historical fact, in which God’s love was specially displayed."
2. "The sinfulness is purposely described as weakness (need of help), in order to characterize it as the motive for the love of God interfering to save."
3. "The death of Christ was the central point of all human history."
4. "The term ‘ungodly’ is chosen rather than ‘us,’ which would have been otherwise correct, to bring out more forcibly the strength of God’s love."
5. "The doctrine of the substitutionary death of Christ (His vicarious atonement) rests... on the whole sweep of Biblical thought."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Christ came into the world at the proper time, the fulness of the time."
2. "In behalf, instead of."
3. "See about υπερ on Galatians 3:13 and also verse Romans 5:7 here."

### John Gill:
1. "That Christ died is certain; the death of Christ was foretold in prophecy, typified by the sacrifices of slain beasts, was spoken of by himself, both before and since his death; his enemies have never denied it; and this was the sum of the ministry of the apostles, and is the great article of faith."
2. "The death of Christ is a singular instance of the love of God, is evident by considering the person that died, the Son of God in human nature, his own, his only begotten Son, his beloved Son; the concern which God had in it, by willing, ordering, and appointing it, awaking the sword of justice against him, not sparing him, but delivering him up for us all."
3. "Christ died for the ungodly; not for himself, he had no sins of his own to die for, nor did he want any happiness to procure; nor for angels, but for men; and these not holy, just, and good men, but ungodly; and not as a mere martyr, or only by way of example to them, and so for their good; but as the Syriac version reads it, 'in the room', or 'stead of the ungodly', as their surety to make satisfaction for their sins."

### John Wesley:
1. "How can we now doubt of God's love?"
2. "In due time — Neither too soon nor too late; but in that very point of time which the wisdom of God knew to be more proper than any other."
3. "Christ died for the ungodly — Not only to set them a pattern, or to procure them power to follow it."
