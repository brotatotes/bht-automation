# Romans 5:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In a remarkable act of love, Christ sacrificed himself for the ungodly, those morally repulsive and undeserving of God's favor. This act of redemption, done at the perfect time, highlights the divine rescue of humanity from their powerlessness. Through Christ's death, God's love is unfathomable and doubts about it are extinguished. It is not merely a pattern to follow or a means to gain power, but a selfless act of laying down one's own life to save another.
