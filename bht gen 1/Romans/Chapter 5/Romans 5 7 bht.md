# Romans 5:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This Bible verse highlights the extraordinary love and sacrifice of Christ for humanity. It reveals the rarity of someone dying for a righteous or just individual, let alone an ungodly person. While self-sacrifice for someone upright is uncommon, it might be conceivable for a noble, benevolent individual. Christ's death for the impious showcases unparalleled kindness, surpassing any human example. The distinction between a just man and a good man lies in the latter's benevolence and affectionate nature, evoking love and even inspiring someone to risk their life.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The greatness of this Love, of Christ's death on behalf of the impious, is brought out by showing that there is none such among men."
2. "Such a self-sacrifice, not unexampled where a good man, one loving his fellow-men and loved by them, is to be rescued, is hardly found to occur on behalf of the pious and just."
3. "For hardly will anyone die on behalf of a just man, for justice's sake, but I do not press this without exception, on behalf of the good man, perhaps one doth even dare to die."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Scarcely for a righteous man—a man of simply unexceptionable character—will one die."
2. "Yet peradventure for a good man—a man who, besides being unexceptionable, is distinguished for goodness, a benefactor to society—some would even dare to die."
3. "Scarce an instance occurs of self-sacrifice for one merely upright; though for one who makes himself a blessing to society there may be found an example of such noble surrender of life."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Christ was willing to die for bitter foes."
2. "A righteous man - A just man; a man distinguished simply for integrity of conduct; one who has no remarkable claims for amiableness of character, for benevolence, or for personal friendship."
3. "For a good man - That is, not merely a man who is coldly just; but a man whose characteristic is that of kindness, amiableness, tenderness."

### Marvin Vincent:

### John Calvin:

2. "Thus it is an illustration, derived from a comparison; for such an example of kindness, as Christ has exhibited towards us, does not exist among men."
3. "The just, δίκαιος, is the opposite of the 'ungodly,' ἀσέβης; who, by not worshipping and honoring God, is guilty of injustice of the highest kind, and in this sense of being unjust it is found in Romans 4:5, where God is said to 'justify the ungodly,' that is, him who is unjust by withholding from God the homage which rightly belongs to him."

### Archibald T. Robertson:

"As between δικαιος, righteous, and αγαθος, good, Lightfoot notes 'all the difference in the world' which he shows by quotations from Plato and Christian writers, a difference of sympathy mainly, the δικαιος man being 'absolutely without sympathy' while the αγαθος man 'is beneficent and kind.'" 

2. "In the case of the kindly sympathetic man courage is called for to make the supreme sacrifice."
