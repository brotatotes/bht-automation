# Romans 5:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, the commentators bring out the distinction between a righteous man and a good man. They explain that while it is unlikely for someone to die for a merely upright or strictly just person, it is possible for someone to make the ultimate sacrifice for a noble, beneficent individual who embodies love, compassion, and kindness. The commentators emphasize the greatness and rarity of such an act, highlighting the enormity of God's love and the extraordinary nature of self-sacrifice for the good of others.

3. "Scarce an instance occurs of self-sacrifice for one merely upright; though for one who makes himself a blessing to society there may be found an example of such noble surrender of life."

1. "As between Î´Î¹ÎºÎ±Î¹Î¿Ï‚, righteous, and Î±Î³Î±Î¸Î¿Ï‚, good, Lightfoot notes 'all the difference in the world' which he shows by quotations from Plato and Christian writers, a difference of sympathy mainly, the Î´Î¹ÎºÎ±Î¹Î¿Ï‚ man being 'absolutely without sympathy' while the Î±Î³Î±Î¸Î¿Ï‚ man 'is beneficent and kind.'"
