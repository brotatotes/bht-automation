# Romans 6:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, the apostle Paul raises the objection of whether we should continue in sin so that God's grace may multiply. Various commentators highlight this objection as a challenge to the idea that sin can lead to an abundance of grace. They emphasize the importance of understanding that salvation is not based on our own efforts or good works, but solely on God's grace. The apostle refutes this objection and demonstrates that the righteousness of God is not only consistent with his truth and faithfulness, but is a glorious display thereof.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Must we think that we may persist in sin, that God's grace may be multiplied?" (ch. Romans 5:20)

2. "The question raised here is whether we should continue in our natural state of sin in order for God's grace to be multiplied." (ch. Romans 5:20)

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Shall we continue in sin, that grace may abound?" - This objection to the apostle's doctrine of salvation through grace alone has been raised throughout history. It is a plausible objection, but the apostle will demonstrate that it is a total perversion of the true doctrine of grace. 

2. "Had the apostle's doctrine been that salvation depends on our good works, no such objection could have been made." - If salvation were based on our own efforts and good works, then the objection of continuing in sin to increase grace would not have been applicable. 

3. "Against the doctrine of a purely gratuitous justification, the objection is plausible." - The objection of continuing in sin to increase grace is plausible because it challenges the concept of being justified solely by grace, without any merit of our own. However, the apostle will refute this objection and clarify the true nature of grace.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "What shall we say to such a sentiment as that where sin abounded grace did much more abound?" - This quote highlights the objection raised by the apostle, questioning whether we should continue in sin if grace abounds. 

2. "If sin has been the occasion of grace and favor, ought we not to continue in it, and commit as much as possible, in order that grace might abound?" - This quote captures the essence of the objection, emphasizing the idea of intentionally sinning to increase the abundance of grace. 

3. "He shows that the consequence does not follow; and proves that the doctrine of justification does not lead to it." - This quote summarizes the apostle's response, indicating that the objection's conclusion is incorrect and that the doctrine of justification does not encourage continued sinning.

### John Calvin:
1. "They who imagine that gratuitous righteousness is given us by him, apart from newness of life, shamefully rend Christ asunder."
2. "Let us, however, go on in our course; nor let Christ be suppressed, because he is to many a stone of offense, and a rock of stumbling; for as he is for ruin to the ungodly, so he is to the godly for a resurrection."
3. "The most common objection against the preaching of divine grace is that if it be true, the more completely we are overwhelmed with the mass of sin, then nothing is better for us than to be sunk into the depth of sin, and often to provoke God’s wrath with new offenses; for then at length we shall find more abounding grace."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "‘Then,’ in view of chap. Romans 5:20-21." 
2. "The form of the question in the original indicates that this is the statement of a point to be discussed, or rather of a wrong inference that might be drawn from the abounding of grace." 
3. "This wrong inference is a standing objection to the gospel, urged by those who have not felt its power."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "A debater's phrase" (Morison).
2. "But Paul sees the possible perversion of this glorious grace."
3. "Horrible thought (μη γενοιτο) and yet Paul faced it."

### John Gill:
1. "Sin is not 'per se', the cause of the glorifying God's grace, but 'per accidens': sin of itself is the cause of wrath, and not of grace."
2. "It is not by the commission of sin, but by the pardon of it, that the grace of God is glorified, or made to abound."
3. "Grace in conversion is glorified by putting a stop to the reign of sin, and not by increasing its power, which would be done by continuing in it."

### John Wesley:
1. "The apostle here sets himself more fully to vindicate his doctrine from the consequence above suggested."
2. "He had then only in strong terms denied and renounced it: here he removes the very foundation thereof."
3. "He removes the very foundation of the objection by showing that the righteousness of God is not only consistent with his truth and faithfulness, but is a glorious display thereof."
