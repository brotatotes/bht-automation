# Romans 6:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this passage, the author addresses an objection to the doctrine of grace. The objection suggests that one could continue in sin to increase the abundance of grace. The author debunks this objection, showing that sin is not the cause of God's grace and that grace is not magnified by the commission of sin. The author emphasizes that grace is glorified by the pardon of sin and the transformation it brings, putting a stop to the reign of sin rather than increasing its power.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Shall we (or, as the true reading is, 'May we,' 'Are we to') continue in sin, that grace may abound?" - This opening question highlights the objection that arises against the doctrine of a purely gratuitous justification. It shows that if salvation depended on good works, such objection would not exist. The objection has been raised throughout history and even against the apostles themselves, but the apostle here aims to demonstrate that it is a total perversion of the doctrine of Grace.

2. "Against the doctrine of a purely gratuitous justification, the objection is plausible." - This statement emphasizes that the objection raised against the doctrine of a purely gratuitous justification is reasonable and understandable. It acknowledges that the objection has some validity, but the apostle will go on to refute it and demonstrate the true nature of Grace.

3. "That it was brought against the apostles, we know from Romans 3:8; Galatians 5:13; 1 Peter 2:16; Judges 1:4." - This quote points out that the objection of continuing in sin to abound in grace was not only raised against the apostle Paul but also against other apostles. It provides references to other biblical passages that confirm the existence of this objection and the need to address it.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "What shall we say to such a sentiment as that where sin abounded grace did much more abound?" - This quote highlights the objection raised by the apostle in response to the idea that grace abounds where sin increases. It sets the stage for further discussion on whether one should continue in sin.

2. "Shall we continue in sin?" - This question captures the essence of the objection, questioning whether it is acceptable to persist in sin if it leads to an increase in grace. It serves as a starting point for the apostle's response.

3. "He shows that the consequence does not follow; and proves that the doctrine of justification does not lead to it." - This quote summarizes the apostle's argument against the objection, emphasizing that the logic of continuing in sin to increase grace does not hold. It highlights the importance of understanding the doctrine of justification and its implications.

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "What shall we say then?" - A transition - expression and a debater's phrase. The use of this phrase points to Paul's training in the Rabbinical schools, where questions were propounded and the students encouraged to debate, objections being suddenly interposed and answered.

2. "Shall we continue [επιμενωμεν]." - The verb means primarily to remain or abide at or with, as 1 Corinthians 16:8; Philippians 1:24; and secondarily, to persevere, as Romans 11:23; Colossians 1:23. So better here, persist.

3. "The verb means primarily to remain or abide at or with, as 1 Corinthians 16:8; Philippians 1:24; and secondarily, to persevere, as Romans 11:23; Colossians 1:23." - This explanation provides a deeper understanding of the verb used in the verse, shedding light on the possible nuances and implications of its meaning.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "What shall we say then? 'Then,' in view of chap. Romans 5:20-21. Comp. the similar phrase in chap. Romans 4:1."
2. "Shall we continue in sin? The form of the question in the original indicates that this is the statement of a point to be discussed, or rather of a wrong inference that might be drawn from the abounding of grace."
3. "This wrong inference is a standing objection to the gospel, urged by those who have not felt its power."

### John Gill:
1. "Sin is not 'per se', the cause of the glorifying God's grace, but 'per accidens': sin of itself is the cause of wrath, and not of grace."
2. "It is not by the commission of sin, but by the pardon of it, that the grace of God is glorified, or made to abound."
3. "Grace in conversion is glorified by putting a stop to the reign of sin, and not by increasing its power, which would be done by continuing in it."

### John Wesley:
1. "The apostle here sets himself more fully to vindicate his doctrine from the consequence above suggested."
2. "He had then only in strong terms denied and renounced it: here he removes the very foundation thereof."
3. "He removes the very foundation of the consequence by showing that the charge is unjust and the objection unreasonable."
