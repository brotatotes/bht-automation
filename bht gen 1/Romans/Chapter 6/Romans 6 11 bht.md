1. "Antinomianism is not only an error; it is a falsehood and a slander."
2. "As the death of Christ is not only the expiation of guilt, but the death of sin itself in all who are vitally united to Him; so the resurrection of Christ is the resurrection of believers, not only to acceptance with God, but to newness of life."
3. "In the light of these two truths, let all who name the name of Christ 'examine themselves whether they be in the faith.'"

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Only in fellowship with Christ Jesus can we reckon ourselves dead unto sin and alive unto God."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Reckon ye also yourselves" - Paul's imperative here emphasizes the personal responsibility of each individual to actively consider and evaluate their own lives in light of their baptism.

2. "Men in a state of nature, or of 'Pharisaism', think themselves alive, when they are not; but when they come under a work of the Spirit of God, they see themselves otherwise, and are convinced both of the exceeding sinfulness of sin, and the insufficiency of their own righteousness to justify from it."
3. "Their life of faith on the righteousness of Christ, is unto the glory of God, and will be followed with an eternal life with God, to which the justifying righteousness of Christ gives them a title."
