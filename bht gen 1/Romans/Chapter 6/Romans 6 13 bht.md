1. "Nor render. ‘Nor’ = ‘and especially not.’ ‘Render’ (in chap. Romans 12:1, ‘present’) is preferable to ‘yield,’ since the latter conveys the idea of previous resistance; the thought is of placing at the disposal of another; probably the figure of military service is suggested."
2. "Your members, the various parts of the body which can be used in the service of sin. If ‘mortal body’ (Romans 6:12) is taken figuratively, then ‘members’ must be taken accordingly."
