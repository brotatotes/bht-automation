# Romans 6:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse from the Bible, we are urged to surrender ourselves to God, offering our bodies and actions for His service rather than allowing sin to control us. We are encouraged to resist the temptation to engage in unrighteousness, acknowledging that sin seeks to corrupt and control our lives. Instead, we are to recognize God as our rightful King and willingly submit to His authority, living in obedience to His will. This verse reminds us of the power of our choices and the importance of aligning ourselves with God's purposes.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Neither yield ye your members instruments of unrighteousness unto Sin, but yield yourselves unto God as those that are alive from the dead." - This quote emphasizes the importance of surrendering to God and choosing righteousness over sin.

2. "Your members - till now prostituted to sin." - This quote highlights the previous state of being controlled by sin and the need to redirect one's actions towards righteousness.

3. "But what if indwelling sin should prove too strong for us? The reply is: But it will not." - This quote reassures that with God's help, sin will not have power over us and we can overcome its influence.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Nor render. 'Nor' = 'and especially not.' 'Render' (in chap. Romans 12:1, 'present') is preferable to 'yield,' since the latter conveys the idea of previous resistance; the thought is of placing at the disposal of another; probably the figure of military service is suggested."

2. "Your members, the various parts of the body which can be used in the service of sin. If 'mortal body' (Romans 6:12) is taken figuratively, then 'members' must be taken accordingly."

3. "But render yourselves to God; the new and true Ruler. The command is to present themselves entirely, once for all (the tense in the original is not the same as in the previous clause)."

These quotes provide insights into the meaning of the verse, emphasizing the idea of surrendering oneself to God and the importance of presenting all parts of one's body to Him.

### John Gill:
1. "By their 'members' he means the several powers and faculties of the soul... or the several parts of the body, or both."
2. "Yielding, or presenting of them, is designed the employment of them in the service of sin, as instruments of unrighteousness unto sin."
3. "Yield yourselves unto God, as those that are alive from the dead... and yield a cheerful obedience to him; considering themselves as under great obligation so to do."

Note: The commentary is quite lengthy, so I had to condense it significantly to fit within the word limit.
