2. "For ye are not under that law which is the strength of sin, but under that grace in which is no condemnation."
3. "The assertion being merely that of the general matter of fact, about which there can be no question, that we (Christians) are not under the law, placed in a covenant of legal obedience, but under grace, placed in a covenant of justification by faith and under the promise of the indwelling Spirit subjects of a higher law even the law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "To be 'under the law' is, first, to be under its claim to entire obedience; and so, next under its curse for the breach of these."

2. "This is a noble argument why saints should use their members as weapons of righteousness for God and against sin; since they are sure of being conquerors, and are secure from the tyrannical government of sin over them."
