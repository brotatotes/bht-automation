# Romans 6:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Being under grace means being freed from the dominion of sin. This is in contrast to being under the law, which only reveals sin without providing the power to conquer it. Grace has the power to sanctify and bring victory over sin, enabling believers to live in righteousness. Sin has no rightful authority or power over those who are under grace, as grace brings complete liberation from its rule.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "For Sin shall not have dominion over you—as the slaves of a tyrant lord." 
2. "To be 'under the law' is, first, to be under its claim to entire obedience; and so, next under its curse for the breach of these."
3. "To be 'under grace,' is to be under the glorious canopy and saving effects of that 'grace which reigns through righteousness unto eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord'."

These quotes highlight the contrast between being under the law and being under grace. They explain that being under the law means being under its claim to obedience and its curse for disobedience, while being under grace means being under the saving effects of God's grace through Jesus Christ. They emphasize that being under grace frees believers from the dominion of sin and enables them to live in righteousness.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Shall not have dominion - Shall not reign... This implies that sin ought not to have this dominion; and it also expresses the conviction of the apostle that it would not have this rule over Christians."
2. "We who are Christians are not subject to that law where sin is excited, and where it rages unsubdued... Christians are not under the law as legalists, or as attempting to be justified by it."
3. "It is implied here that the effect of an attempt to be justified by the Law was not to subdue sins, but to excite them and to lead to indulgence in them... Justification by works would destroy no sin, would check no evil propensity, but would leave a man to all the ravages and riotings of unsubdued passion."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The future tense is that of confident assertion, and hence of consolation."
2. "Freedom from the law gives you so little freedom to sin, that it is only by the exercise of grace upon you that your freedom from sin has begun."
3. "If the reason sin will not lord it over us, is that we are not under the law, but under grace, then grace sanctifies us, not the law."

### John Wesley:
1. "Sin shall not have dominion over you — It has neither right nor power."
2. "For ye are not under the law — A dispensation of terror and bondage, which only shows sin, without enabling you to conquer it."
3. "But under grace — Under the merciful dispensation of the gospel, which brings complete victory over it to every one who is under the powerful influences of the Spirit of Christ."
