# Romans 6:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the commentators make it clear that everyone must make a choice between serving either God or sin, as there is no middle ground. They explain that obedience reveals our true master, and that serving sin leads to death and the consequences of sinful actions. Alternatively, serving God leads to righteousness and a transformed character. The commentators stress the impossibility of serving both God and sin simultaneously, and emphasize the importance of unwavering loyalty to Christ.

### John Calvin:
1. "Between the yoke of Christ and that of sin there is so much contrariety, that no one can bear them both; if we sin, we give ourselves up to the service of sin; but the faithful, on the contrary have been redeemed from the tyranny of sin, that they may serve Christ: it is therefore impossible for them to remain bound to sin."
2. "If they obey, he concludes that they are servants, for obedience proves that he, who thus brings one into subjection to himself, has the power of commanding."
3. "Obedience then, though the name of God is suppressed, is yet to be referred to him, for it cannot be a divided obedience."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "To present yourselves as servants to any one implies service to that one: in this matter the masters are opposed, hence either,.... or, there is no third." 
2. "Both terms are used in the usual wide sense: ‘sin’ is personified as the master, the result of the service is ‘death,’ including all the consequences of sin." 
3. "Here ‘righteousness’ refers not to justification but to inwrought righteousness, not excluding the final verdict at the judgment."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "His servants ye are whom ye obey." - This quote emphasizes that our actions and choices reveal who we truly serve and obey. It highlights the concept of being slaves to our desires and urges, and the need to align ourselves with Christ instead of succumbing to sin.

2. "Bondservants, slaves of the one whom ye obey." - This quote highlights the imagery of being slaves to our master, whether it be sin or Christ. It reminds us that we willingly submit ourselves to the authority and influence of our chosen master, and that our obedience reflects our allegiance.

3. "Loyalty to Christ will not permit occasional crossing over to the other side to Satan's line." - This quote emphasizes the importance of remaining steadfast and loyal to Christ, without giving in to the temptations and enticements of sin. It underscores the need for unwavering commitment to Christ and the rejection of any compromise with evil.

### John Gill:
1. "Such who obey sin, are the servants of sin; they are at the beck and command of sin; they give up themselves to the service of it with delight and diligence, and are perfect drudges to it." 
2. "Their service is very unreasonable; and they are rendered incapable of serving God, for no man can serve two masters." 
3. "On the other hand, such as obey the Lord, are the servants 'of obedience unto righteousness': but why is not this obedience, which is the obedience of faith to the Gospel, of Christ, and of the new man to God or Christ, said to be 'unto life', as the antithesis seems to require? because though death is the fruit of sin, yet life is not the fruit of obedience, but the fruit of obedience is righteousness."
