### Henry Alford:
1. "Ye obeyed from the heart" - This highlights the sincere and genuine nature of their obedience to the teaching, emphasizing that it was not merely outward compliance but a true transformation of the heart.

2. "That form of teaching" - The term "form" suggests that the teaching had a specific shape or structure, indicating that it provided a clear and defined framework for their beliefs and actions.

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "But God be thanked, that ye were the servants of Sin—that is, that this is a state of things now past and gone." 
2. "but ye have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered you—rather, 'whereunto ye were delivered' (Margin), or cast, as in a mould." 
3. "The idea is, that the teaching to which they had heartily yielded themselves had stamped its own impress upon them."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The ground Of the thanksgiving was not that they had been the slaves of sin; but it is, that notwithstanding this, or although they had been thus, yet that they were now obedient."
2. "To give thanks to God that people were sinners, would contradict the whole spirit of this argument, and of the Bible. But to give thanks that although people had been sinners, yet that now they had become obedient; that is, that great sinners had become converted, is in entire accordance with the spirit of the Bible, and with propriety."
3. "From the heart - Not in external form only; but as a cordial, sincere, and entire service. No other obedience is genuine."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Ye were the servants of sin, but are so no more."
2. "The Pauline type of teaching as contrasted with the Judaistic forms of Christianity."
3. "They had been handed over to the educative power of this form of teaching."

### John Calvin:
1. "We may hence learn, that we are not freed from the bondage of the law that we may sin; for the law does not lose its dominion, until the grace of God restores us to him, in order to renew us in righteousness."
2. "He does not indeed allow his people unbridled freedom, that they might frisk about without any restraint, like horses let loose in the fields; but he brings them to a regular course of life."
3. "Paul compares here the hidden power of the Spirit with the external letter of the law, as though he had said, 'Christ inwardly forms our souls in a better way, than when the law constrains them by threatening and terrifying us.'"

### Philip Schaff:
1. "That ye were the servants of sin. ‘Were’ is emphatic; this state is past, and for this the Apostle is thankful, although this negative side of salvation cannot be separated from the positive."
2. "But ye obeyed from the heart. The moral change at conversion made their true, internal attitude that of obedience."
3. "That form of teaching whereunto ye were delivered. This rendering is greatly to be preferred to that of the E. V. The change to the passive suggests the Divine agency in delivering them to this ‘form of teaching.’ This phrase, literally, ‘type of teaching,’ is interpreted: (1) of Christian doctrine in general; which is objectionable, because in that case ‘type’ would be unmeaning; (2) of the Pauline teaching, over against the Judaistic forms of Christianity; (3) of the ideal, or, ‘pattern,’ presented by the gospel, the ethical rule of life it gives. The second interpretation is the best."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Paul is not grateful that they were once slaves of sin, but only that, though they once were, they turned from that state."
2. "To that form of doctrine whereunto ye were delivered."
3. "It is hardly proper to take 'form' here to refer to Paul's gospel, possibly an allusion to the symbolism of baptism which was the outward sign of the separation."

### John Gill:
1. "Not that the apostle must be thought to give thanks to God for that these persons had been the servants of sin, than which nothing is more disagreeable to God, or caused more shame to themselves; but that inasmuch as they had been in the drudgery and service of sin, they were now freed from it."

2. "By 'the form of doctrine', is meant the Gospel, which is the 'doctrine' of the Scriptures, of Christ and his apostles, and is sound and according to godliness; and is a 'form', or contains a summary and compendium of truths, and is a pattern or exemplar, according to which ministers are to preach, and people to hear and receive."

3. "This form of doctrine was 'obeyed' by them; by which is meant, not a mere obedience to the ordinances of the Gospel; nor a bare hearing of the doctrines of it, and giving an assent unto them; but an embracing of them by faith for themselves, so as to lay hold on Christ in them, submit to his righteousness therein revealed, and be willing to be saved by him, and him alone, in his own way; and this is the obedience of faith."

### John Wesley:
1. "The form of doctrine into which ye have been delivered" - This phrase suggests that believers should allow their minds to be shaped and molded by the teachings of the gospel, just as liquid metal takes the form of a mold.
