### Philip Schaff:
1. "That ye were the servants of sin. ‘Were’ is emphatic; this state is past, and for this the Apostle is thankful, although this negative side of salvation cannot be separated from the positive."
2. "But ye obeyed from the heart. The moral change at conversion made their true, internal attitude that of obedience."
3. "That form of teaching whereunto ye were delivered. This rendering is greatly to be preferred to that of the E. V. The change to the passive suggests the Divine agency in delivering them to this ‘form of teaching.’"

### John Gill:
1. "Not that the apostle must be thought to give thanks to God for that these persons had been the servants of sin, than which nothing is more disagreeable to God, or caused more shame to themselves; but that inasmuch as they had been in the drudgery and service of sin, they were now freed from it."
2. "By 'the form of doctrine', is meant the Gospel, which is the 'doctrine' of the Scriptures, of Christ and his apostles, and is sound and according to godliness; and is a 'form', or contains a summary and compendium of truths, and is a pattern or exemplar, according to which ministers are to preach, and people to hear and receive."
3. "This form of doctrine is 'a Cabala', but not like that of the Jews' oral law, or form of traditions, handed down, as they say, from one man, and set of men, to another; but this is delivered from the Father to Christ, from Christ to his apostles, and by them to the saints; and 'into which they were delivered', as it may be rendered, as into a mould; and so received the impression of it, and were evangelized by it."

### John Wesley:
1. "The form of doctrine into which ye have been delivered" - This phrase suggests that our minds should be pliant and ductile, conforming to the gospel precepts like liquid metal taking the shape of a mould. 

2. "Conveys a very instructive admonition" - The commentary highlights that this allusion serves as a valuable lesson, reminding us of the importance of aligning our thoughts and actions with the teachings of the gospel.
