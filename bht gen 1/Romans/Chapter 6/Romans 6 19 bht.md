# Romans 6:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The scripture, in speaking about the transformation from a life of sin to a life of righteousness, uses the concept of servitude, acknowledging our human understanding of servitude and our weakness as human beings. Formerly, we served sin with all our faculties, but now we are called to serve righteousness. This change requires us to offer ourselves wholeheartedly, using the same members that were once dedicated to sin, to now be dedicated to the service of God and His will, as a way of expressing our gratitude, humility, and obedience.
