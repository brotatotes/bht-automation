# Romans 6:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse being described speaks to the radical transformation that occurs in the life of a believer. By being "dead to sin," the new creature within us revolts at the thought of continuing to live in sin. This transformation means we are completely liberated from the guilt and power of sin, allowing us to live a new life, free from the control of our sinful desires. Through Christ's death and resurrection, we are given the power to resist sin and walk in righteousness.
