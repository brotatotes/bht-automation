# Romans 6:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, commentators emphasize the transformative power of dying to sin through surrendering to Christ. They highlight the personal nature of this transformation, emphasizing that it is an individual decision made by believers. The commentators express strong disapproval of the idea of continuing in sin, asserting that dying to sin means being completely separated from its influence. This freedom from sin, which is signified and sealed by baptism, enables believers to live a new life, liberated from the control of sinful desires.
