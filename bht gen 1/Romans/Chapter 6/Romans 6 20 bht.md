## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "For when ye were servants of sin, ye were free in relation to righteousness." - This quote highlights the irony in the use of the word "free" to describe the state of being a servant of sin. It suggests that although they may have felt free, they were actually disconnected from righteousness.

2. "There is doubtless a latent irony in the use of ἐλεύθεροι here." - This quote acknowledges the presence of irony in the verse, emphasizing that the freedom mentioned is not genuine freedom but rather a deceptive illusion.

3. "It does not appear, till the end of that freedom is declared." - This quote suggests that the true nature of this freedom is only revealed later in the passage, indicating that there is more to be understood about the concept of freedom in relation to sin and righteousness.

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Since no servant can serve two masters, much less where their interests come into deadly collision, and each demands the whole man, so, while ye were in the service of Sin ye were in no proper sense the servants of Righteousness, and never did it one act of real service."
2. "Whatever might be your conviction of the claims of Righteousness, your real services were all and always given to Sin."
3. "Thus had ye full proof of the nature and advantages of Sin's service."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Ye were free from righteousness - That is, in your former state, you were not at all under the influence of righteousness." This quote highlights the contrast between the believers' past state of being completely devoted to sin and their present state of being released from that bondage.

2. "It settles the question; and proves that they had no native goodness." This quote emphasizes the commentator's belief that the believers had no inherent goodness in them, reinforcing the idea of total depravity.

3. "The argument which is implied here rather than expressed is, that now they ought to be equally free from sin, since they had become released from their former bondage, and had become the servants of another master." This quote suggests that the commentator sees the believers' release from sin as a call to live a life free from sin, now that they are under the influence of righteousness.

1. "He still repeats the difference, which he had before mentioned, between the yoke of righteousness and that of sin; for these two things, sin and righteousness, are so contrary, that he who devotes himself to the one, necessarily departs from the other."
2. "Let us then remember that the Apostle still reasons on the principle of contraries, and in this manner, 'While ye were the servants of sin, ye were freed from righteousness; but now a change having taken place, it behoves you to serve righteousness; for you have been liberated from the yoke of sin.'"
3. "Wretched then and accursed is this liberty, which with unbridled or rather mad frenzy, leads us exultingly to our destruction."

### Philip Schaff:
