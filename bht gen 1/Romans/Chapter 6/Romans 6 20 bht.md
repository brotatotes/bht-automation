In this verse, commentators highlight the contrast between serving sin and pursuing righteousness.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Since no servant can serve two masters, much less where their interests come into deadly collision, and each demands the whole man, so, while ye were in the service of Sin ye were in no proper sense the servants of Righteousness, and never did it one act of real service: whatever might be your conviction of the claims of Righteousness, your real services were all and always given to Sin: Thus had ye full proof of the nature and advantages of Sin's service."

2. "The import of it seems clearly to be this:—'Since no servant can serve two masters, much less where their interests come into deadly collision, and each demands the whole man, so, while ye were in the service of Sin ye were in no proper sense the servants of Righteousness, and never did it one act of real service: whatever might be your conviction of the claims of Righteousness, your real services were all and always given to Sin: Thus had ye full proof of the nature and advantages of Sin's service.'"

3. "The searching question with which this is followed up, shows that this is the meaning."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Ye were free from righteousness - That is, in your former state, you were not at all under the influence of righteousness."

### John Calvin:
1. "He still repeats the difference, which he had before mentioned, between the yoke of righteousness and that of sin; for these two things, sin and righteousness, are so contrary, that he who devotes himself to the one, necessarily departs from the other."
2. "Let us then remember that the Apostle still reasons on the principle of contraries, and in this manner, 'While ye were the servants of sin, ye were freed from righteousness; but now a change having taken place, it behoves you to serve righteousness; for you have been liberated from the yoke of sin.'"
3. "He calls those free from righteousness who are held by no bridle to obey righteousness. This is the liberty of the flesh, which so frees us from obedience to God, that it makes us slaves to the devil."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The only freedom they had was this sad freedom as respects the right service; the deepest slavery in fact, just as to be servants of righteousness is the truest freedom."
