## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "What fruit then had ye at that time? (Things, deeds) of which ye are now ashamed."
2. "The reason of their present shame. For the end of those things is death."
3. "Death in the widest sense, physical, which has been the end of sin, in which we are all involved, and spiritual and eternal, which will be the end of actual sin if followed out."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "What permanent advantage, and what abiding satisfaction, have those things yielded? The apostle answers his own question:—'Abiding satisfaction, did I ask? They have left only a sense of shame.'"
2. "By saying they were 'now ashamed,' he makes it plain that he is not referring to that disgust at themselves, and remorse of conscience by which those who are the most helplessly 'sold under sin' are often stung to the quick; but that ingenuous feeling of self-reproach, which pierces and weighs down the children of God."
3. "They think of the dishonor which their past life did to His name, the ingratitude it displayed, the violence it did to their own conscience, its deadening and degrading effects, and the death—the second death—to which it was dragging them down, when mere Grace arrested them."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The question discussed throughout this chapter is, whether the gospel plan of justification by faith leads to indulgence in sin?"
2. "They have tried it; they know its effects; they have tasted its bitterness; they have reaped its fruits."
3. "Having seen their nature and tendency, you are now ashamed of them."

Note: The commentary provided is quite short, so I have included all the relevant quotes.

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "What fruit were ye having during your service of sin?" - This quote highlights the question of the kind of fruit that was produced during the period of sinful behavior, emphasizing the negative consequences of those actions.

2. "What fruit had ye at that time? Things whereof ye are now ashamed." - This quote suggests that the believers had no fruitful outcome during their sinful past and now feel ashamed of their previous actions.

3. "The question is of having fruit, not of the quality of the fruit." - This quote clarifies that the focus is on the presence or absence of fruit rather than the specific quality of the fruit, emphasizing the importance of producing positive outcomes in one's life.

### John Calvin:
1. "The godly, as soon as they begin to be illuminated by the Spirit of Christ and the preaching of the gospel, do freely acknowledge their past life, which they have lived without Christ, to have been worthy of condemnation; and so far are they from endeavouring to excuse it, that, on the contrary, they feel ashamed of themselves."
2. "Yea, further, they call to mind the remembrance of their own disgrace, that being thus ashamed, they may more truly and more readily be humbled before God."
3. "He only then is imbued with the principles of Christian philosophy, who has well learnt to be really displeased with himself, and to be confounded with shame for his own wretchedness."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "‘Then’ refers to their condition before conversion (Romans 6:20)."
2. "The question in antithesis to Romans 6:21 is the having of fruit, not its quality."
3. "Against the view presented in the E. V., Alford urges that it is 'inconsistent with the New Testament meaning of fruit, which is 'actions,' the fruit of the man considered as the tree, not 'wages,' or 'reward,' the fruit of his actions.'"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "What fruit then had ye at that time?" - This question prompts reflection on the past and challenges the reader to consider the consequences of their actions.
2. "Ashes in their hands now." - This vivid imagery conveys the emptiness and worthlessness of their previous pursuits and highlights the contrast between their former state and their current shame.
3. "The end of them is death." - This statement emphasizes the destructive nature of their previous choices and serves as a warning about the consequences of living without true spiritual fruit.

### John Gill:
1. "Sin yields no real profit to the servants of it."
2. "Nor is there any true pleasure in sin; persons may imagine within themselves they enjoy a real pleasure whilst they are serving divers lusts; but this is but imaginary, it is not real; and this imaginary pleasure is but for a season; it issues in bitterness and death."
3. "When persons are wrought upon by the Spirit of God, they are ashamed of sin; which might be exemplified in the case of Adam and Eve, of Ephraim, of the prodigal son, and of the poor publican; the reason is, because light is struck into their hearts; and this makes manifest the odious and detestable nature of sin; sin is hereby seen in its own proper colours, as exceeding sinful, loathsome, and abominable."

### John Wesley:
1. "The phrase 'those things' refers to the promises of God, the blessings and rewards that are yet to come. It reminds us that these things are not immediate, but rather distant and future. This encourages us to have patience and endurance as we wait for God's promises to be fulfilled."

2. "By describing 'those things' as afar off, the author emphasizes the need for faith and trust in God's timing. It reminds us that God's plans are not bound by our limited understanding of time, and that we must be willing to wait and persevere in our faith, knowing that His promises will come to pass."

3. "The phrase 'those things' also serves as a reminder that our focus should not be solely on earthly matters, but on the eternal promises of God. It encourages us to set our minds on heavenly things and to prioritize our relationship with God above all else, knowing that the fulfillment of His promises far surpasses any temporary satisfaction or worldly gain."
