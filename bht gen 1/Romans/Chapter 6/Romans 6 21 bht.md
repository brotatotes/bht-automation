# Romans 6:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse being described is about the dissatisfaction and shame that come from pursuing worldly desires. Commentators emphasize the temporary and illusory nature of these pursuits, highlighting the need for true repentance and turning towards God. They also point out the importance of acknowledging our past sins and feeling genuine remorse, as this leads to a humble and contrite heart before God. Ultimately, the verse underscores the transformation that occurs when the Spirit of God convicts us of our sin and enables us to see its true ugliness.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "What permanent advantage, and what abiding satisfaction, have those things yielded? The apostle answers his own question: 'Abiding satisfaction, did I ask? They have left only a sense of shame.'"
2. "By saying they were 'now ashamed,' he makes it plain that he is not referring to that disgust at themselves, and remorse of conscience by which those who are the most helplessly 'sold under sin' are often stung to the quick; but that ingenuous feeling of self-reproach, which pierces and weighs down the children of God."
3. "The dishonor which their past life did to His name, the ingratitude it displayed, the violence it did to their own conscience, its deadening and degrading effects, and the death—the 'second death'—to which it was dragging them down, when mere Grace arrested them."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "What fruit were ye having during your service of sin?"
2. "The question is of having fruit, not of the quality of the fruit."
3. "Some change the punctuation, and read 'What fruit had ye at that time? Things whereof ye are now ashamed.'"

### John Calvin:
1. "The godly, as soon as they begin to be illuminated by the Spirit of Christ and the preaching of the gospel, do freely acknowledge their past life, which they have lived without Christ, to have been worthy of condemnation."
2. "Yea, further, they call to mind the remembrance of their own disgrace, that being thus ashamed, they may more truly and more readily be humbled before God."
3. "He only then is imbued with the principles of Christian philosophy, who has well learnt to be really displeased with himself, and to be confounded with shame for his own wretchedness."

### John Gill:
1. "Sin yields no real profit to the servants of it."
2. "Nor is there any true pleasure in sin; persons may imagine within themselves they enjoy a real pleasure whilst they are serving divers lusts; but this is but imaginary, it is not real; and this imaginary pleasure is but for a season; it issues in bitterness and death."
3. "When persons are wrought upon by the Spirit of God, they are ashamed of sin; which might be exemplified in the case of Adam and Eve, of Ephraim, of the prodigal son, and of the poor publican; the reason is, because light is struck into their hearts; and this makes manifest the odious and detestable nature of sin; sin is hereby seen in its own proper colours, as exceeding sinful, loathsome, and abominable."

### John Wesley:
1. "The phrase 'those things' refers to the promises of God, which are described as being 'afar off.' This suggests that the fulfillment of these promises may not be immediate or easily visible to us in our present circumstances."

2. "By describing the promises as 'afar off,' the author highlights the need for faith and patience. We are called to trust in God's timing and to persevere in our belief, even when we cannot see the fulfillment of His promises in our lives."

3. "The phrase 'afar off' also reminds us that God's perspective is different from ours. While we may be focused on the present moment, God sees the bigger picture and works according to His perfect plan. We can take comfort in knowing that His promises will come to pass, even if they seem distant to us now."
