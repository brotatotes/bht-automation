# Romans 6:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This verse speaks about the freedom from sin and becoming servants to God. It emphasizes the concept of holiness, which is an ongoing process of sanctification and the development of a righteous character. The end goal is everlasting life, a state of complete acceptance and fellowship with God. Holiness is both a fruit of freedom and a result of the work of the Spirit within us. It is not only beneficial for ourselves but also brings glory to God and promotes the well-being of others.

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Being made free from Sin, and become servants to God—in the absolute sense intended throughout all this passage."
2. "Your fruit unto holiness—'sanctification,' as in :-; meaning that permanently holy state and character which is built up out of the whole 'fruits of righteousness,' which believers successively bring forth."
3. "And the end everlasting life—as the final state of the justified believer; the beatific experience not only of complete exemption from the fall with all its effects, but of the perfect life of acceptance with God, and conformity to His likeness, of unveiled access to Him, and ineffable fellowship with Him through all duration."

### John Gill:
1. "Holiness is a fruit of freedom from the bondage of sin, and of serving God."
2. "Holiness begun in regeneration, calling, and conversion, is a fruit of the Spirit."
3. "Holiness, as it denotes an external course of life, is useful and profitable on many accounts; hereby God is glorified, the doctrine of Christ is adorned, religion is honoured and recommended, our own credit, reputation, and peace, are preserved, and our neighbour's good promoted."
