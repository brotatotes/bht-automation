# Romans 6:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Sin, portrayed as a powerful ruler, pays its subjects their justly deserved wages of death - a consequence that extends beyond physical demise. In stark contrast, eternal life is not earned or merited, but rather a gift freely given by God. This gift of God's grace, be it the gift of righteousness or the grace of regeneration and sanctification, results in eternal life. It is notable that evil works deserve the consequences they bring, while good works do not merit salvation, highlighting the stark contrast between sin's wages and God's gift.
