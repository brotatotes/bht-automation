# Romans 6:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Eternal life, the gift of God, is not something we can earn or become entitled to through our own righteousness, as Jamieson Fausset Brown explains. It is a fundamental principle of Gospel obedience that sets us free from the law in order to keep it, as well as brings us under servitude to the law to be truly free. Death, in all its forms, is the due wages of sin, while eternal life stands out as the remarkable gift of God, in contrast to the rewards that evil works demand and good works do not merit, according to John Wesley.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "But 'eternal life' is in no sense or degree the wages of our righteousness; we do nothing whatever to earn or become entitled to it, and never can: it is therefore, in the most absolute sense, 'THE GIFT OF GOD.'" 
2. "The fundamental principle of Gospel obedience is as original as it is divinely rational; that 'we are set free from the law in order to keep it, and are brought graciously under servitude to the law in order to be free.'" 
3. "Death and life are before all men who hear the Gospel: the one, the natural issue and proper reward of sin; the other, the absolutely free 'GIFT OF GOD' to sinners, 'in Jesus Christ our Lord.'"

### John Wesley:
1. "Death — Temporal, spiritual, and eternal." 
2. "Is the due wages of sin; but eternal life is the gift of God — The difference is remarkable." 
3. "Evil works merit the reward they receive: good works do not. The former demand wages: the latter accept a free gift."
