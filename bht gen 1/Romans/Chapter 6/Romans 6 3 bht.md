# Romans 6:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Through baptism, we experience a profound transformation as we are united with Jesus Christ, symbolizing our death to sin and old way of life. Baptism signifies our connection and participation in Him, not as a means of salvation, but as a declaration of our faith and commitment to Him. It is a powerful act that allows us to share in Christ's death and resurrection, receiving new life and experiencing the work of the Holy Spirit within us.

### John Gill:

2. "There is a difference between being baptized in water in the name of Christ, and being baptized into Christ, which believers in their baptism are; by which is meant, not a being brought by it into union with Christ, which is either secretly from eternity, or openly at conversion, and both before the baptism of true believers; nor a being brought by it into the mystical body of Christ the church, for this also is before it; but rather it designs a being baptized, or a being brought by baptism into more communion with Christ, into a participation of his grace and benefits."
3. "The true meaning of the phrase 'baptized into Christ', I take to be, is to be baptized purely for the sake of Christ, in imitation of him, who has set us an example, and because baptism is an ordinance of his; it is to submit to it with a view to his glory, to testify our affection for him, and subjection to him, without laying any stress or dependence on it for salvation."

### John Wesley:
1. "In baptism we, through faith, are ingrafted into Christ."
2. "We draw new spiritual life from this new root, through his Spirit."
3. "His Spirit fashions us like unto him, particularly with regard to his death and resurrection."
