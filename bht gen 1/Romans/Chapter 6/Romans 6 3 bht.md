# Romans 6:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Through baptism, believers are united with Christ and partake in his death. This union with Christ signifies a complete surrender to a life free from sin. Baptism is not just a symbolic act, but a public proclamation of one's inward spiritual relationship with Christ. It represents a dedication to living in accordance with Christ's example, drawing new spiritual life from him and being transformed by his Spirit. In this way, believers are immersed in the likeness of Christ's death and resurrection, experiencing the power of his grace in their lives.
