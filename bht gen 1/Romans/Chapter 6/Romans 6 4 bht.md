# Romans 6:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, there is a powerful symbolism in baptism. Through baptism, we are not only publicly entering into the death and burial of Christ but also severing our connection with our old sinful life. As believers, we share in Christ's death and resurrection, experiencing a death to sin and a new life in righteousness. Baptism serves as a picture of these spiritual realities, reminding us of our identification with Christ's burial and our commitment to live in newness of life.
