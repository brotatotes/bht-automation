# Romans 6:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse being described focuses on the concept of union with Christ in His death and resurrection. The commentators emphasize that this union is not just a theological concept, but a transformative reality that impacts our lives in the present and guarantees our future resurrection. They stress the vital connection and intimate union we have with Christ, which involves dying to sin and experiencing the power of His resurrection. This transformative union is characterized by being united with Christ, growing together, and walking in newness of life.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Since Christ's death and resurrection are inseparable in their efficacy, union with Him in the one carries with it participation in the other, for privilege and for duty alike."
2. "The future tense is used of participation in His resurrection, because this is but partially realized in the present state."
3. "Union with Christ in His death and resurrection is not just a theological concept, but a transformative reality that impacts our lives in the present and guarantees our future resurrection."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Sumfutoi is not planted, which would be formed from futeuw to plant, while this word is compounded with sun together, and fuw to grow." 
2. "Gegonaman is have become, denoting process, instead of the simple einai to be. Hence Rev., have become united, have grown together; an intimate and progressive union; coalescence."
3. "Morison paraphrases : 'If we were united with Him in the likeness of His death (that will not be the full extent of the union), but we shall be also united,' etc."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The figure is that of vital connection; 'with Him' is implied in the original." 
2. "Our vital union with Him involves death to sin." 
3. "The whole points to the certainty of the other result of vital union with Christ; newness of life as truly as death to sin."

### John Gill:
1. "This is not to be understood of an implantation of Jews and Gentiles together in One body; nor of an implantation of believers together in a church state; but of an implantation of Christ and his people together."
2. "Now as these persons, by virtue of their secret union with Christ from eternity, as their head and representative, with whom they were crucified, in whom they died representatively, share in his death, enjoy the benefits of it, and feel its efficacy, and through it become dead to the law, sin, and the world, which is meant by the likeness of his death."
3. "They shall share in the benefits, and feel and enjoy the effects of it; not only their bodies will be raised at the last day, as their souls are now regenerated by virtue of it, and in resemblance to it; but they are, and shall be so influenced by his Spirit and grace, which has raised them from death to life, that they shall walk in newness of life."

### John Wesley:
1. "Surely these two must go together"
2. "If we are indeed made conformable to his death"
3. "We shall also know the power of his resurrection"
