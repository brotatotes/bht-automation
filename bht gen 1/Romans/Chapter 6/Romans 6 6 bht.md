3. "The body of sin refers to the body that serves sin, in which sin rules or is manifested. It is not the seat or source of sin, but rather the instrument through which sin operates. The goal is to no longer be in bondage to sin, to no longer be slaves to its dominion."

2. "This is so crucified by the death, and at the cross of Christ, as that it cannot exert its damning power over believers; and is so crucified by the Spirit and grace of Christ in them, as that it cannot reign over them, or exercise its domineering power over them."
3. "That henceforth we should not serve sin; not that it should not be in us, for as yet, neither by virtue of the sacrifice of Christ, nor by the power of his grace, is sin as to its being removed from the people of God: but that we should not serve it, make provision for it, indulge it and obey it, in the lusts thereof."
