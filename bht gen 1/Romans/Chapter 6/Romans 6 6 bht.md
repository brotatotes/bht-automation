# Romans 6:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, the commentators describe the concept of the "old man," referring to our previous unregenerate selves. They explain that our old selves, representative of our sinful nature, were crucified with Christ. The commentators also emphasize that the "body of sin" represents the existence of sin within us in our present state, and that it encompasses all evil thoughts, words, and actions. Through our union with Christ, our old selves are gradually killed, leading to the destruction of our sinful inclinations.
