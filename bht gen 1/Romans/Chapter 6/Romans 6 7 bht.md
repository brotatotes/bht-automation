# Romans 6:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the believer's death with Christ is depicted as a complete liberation from the chains of sin. They are acquitted and freed from the guilt and penalty of sin, both in a legal and spiritual sense. This death not only removes their obligation to live according to the flesh, but it also breaks the power of sin over their lives. It signifies a profound transformation, where believers are released from the dominion of sin and set free to live in accordance with the Spirit.

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Justified" (δεδικαιωτα) signifies being set free from the guilt and penalty of sin, as well as being declared righteous before God. It is a powerful word that encapsulates the transformative work of God in the life of a believer. 

2. This word emphasizes that through Christ, we are not only forgiven but also made righteous. It is a reminder that our standing before God is not based on our own efforts or merit, but on the finished work of Jesus on the cross.

2. "Here it is to be understood of a spiritual or mystical death, and of persons who are dead to the law, by the body of Christ; dead to sin by the sacrifice and grace of Christ."
3. "Such are 'freed from sin'; not from the being of it; nor from the burden of it; nor from a continual war with it; but they are freed from the dominion of it, from servitude to it, and also from the guilt of it, and from obligation to punishment on account of it."
