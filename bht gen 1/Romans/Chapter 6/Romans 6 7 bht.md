# Romans 6:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Through union with Christ in death, believers experience freedom from the guilt and power of sin. This transformative power breaks the bonds of sin, releasing believers from its control. Like dead men who are no longer under the authority of their former masters, believers are no longer under the dominion of sin. In this death with Christ, the guilt of past sins is erased, allowing believers to fully embrace the forgiveness and grace offered by God.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "For, as a man that is dead is acquitted and released from guilt and bondage (among men: no reference to God’s judgment of him): so a man that has died to sin is acquitted from the guilt of sin and released from its bondage."
2. "I express δεδικ . by this periphrasis in both cases, because I believe that all this is implied in it: ‘is acquitted,’ ‘has his quittance,’ from sin, so that Sin (personified) has no more claims on him, either as a creditor or as a master: cannot detain him for debt, nor sue him for service."
3. "A larger reference is thus given to δεδικ . than the purposes of the present argument, which is treating of the power, not the guilt of sin, required: but that it is so, lies in the nature of ἁμαρτία, the service of which is guilt, and the deliverance from whose service necessarily brings with it acquittal."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "As death dissolves all claims, so the whole claim of sin, not only to 'reign unto death,' but to keep its victims in sinful bondage, has been discharged once for all."
2. "The believer's penal death in the death of Christ...has set them free from sin."
3. "The believer is no longer a 'debtor to the flesh to live after the flesh'."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The Christian had been subject to sin before his conversion. But he has now become dead to it."
2. "The Christian being now dead to sin, on the same principle, is released from the control of his former master, sin."
3. "The design of the apostle is not to say that the Christian is perfect, but that sin has ceased to have dominion over him, as a master ceases to have power over a slave when he is dead."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The dead person sins no more, being released from sin as from a legal claim."
2. "A man that has died to sin is acquitted from the guilt of sin and released from its bondage."
3. "As a man that is dead is acquitted and released from bondage among men."

### John Calvin:
1. "If thou art a Christian, there must appear in thee an evidence of a fellowship as to the death of Christ; the fruit of which is, that thy flesh is crucified together with all its lusts."
2. "This work of God is not completed in the day in which it is begun in us; but it gradually goes on, and by daily advances is brought by degrees to its end."
3. "It is indeed well with us, if our flesh is continually mortified; nor is it a small attainment, when the reigning power, being taken away from it, is wielded by the Holy Spirit."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "He that hath died" is more literal, but "hath died" better expresses the relation to what follows.
2. The word "justified" is to be taken here in its strictly legal sense, absolved, acquitted, freed.
3. "As natural death cuts off all communication with life, so must sanctification in the soul cut off all communication with sin."

### Archibald T Robertson:

### John Gill:
1. "This is not to be understood of a natural or a corporeal death; for this is the effect of sin, and is inflicted by way of punishment for it, on Christless persons."
2. "Here it is to be understood of a spiritual or mystical death, and of persons who are dead to the law, by the body of Christ; dead to sin by the sacrifice and grace of Christ."
3. "Such are 'freed from sin'; not from the being of it; nor from the burden of it; nor from a continual war with it; but they are freed from the dominion of it, from servitude to it, and also from the guilt of it, and from obligation to punishment on account of it."

### John Wesley:
1. "He that is dead...is freed from the guilt of past, and from the power of present, sin." This quote highlights the transformative power of being united with Christ in death. It emphasizes that through this union, believers are released from the guilt and control of sin in their lives.

2. "As dead men from the commands of their former masters." This quote draws a parallel between the freedom of those who have died and the freedom of believers in Christ. Just as dead men are no longer under the authority of their former masters, believers are no longer under the dominion of sin.

3. "Is freed from the guilt of past." This quote underscores the significance of being dead with Christ. It emphasizes that through this death, believers are set free from the guilt and condemnation of their past sins, allowing them to experience the fullness of God's forgiveness and grace.
