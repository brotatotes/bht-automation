# Romans 6:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Christ's victory over death is evident as we see the dominion of death no longer having power over Him. Through His sacrificial death and triumphant resurrection, Christ has broken the chains of death and secured eternal life for all believers. His enduring life after the resurrection is a sure and certain fact, providing hope and assurance for those who trust in Him. This verse testifies to the profound transformation brought about by Christ, as He conquered the power of death and offers redemption and eternal life to all who believe in Him.
