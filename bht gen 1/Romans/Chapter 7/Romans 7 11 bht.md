# Romans 7:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse being described speaks about the deceptive nature of sin and its disastrous consequences. Sin, like a thief, leads one astray from the right path and ultimately results in death. The law, though not the cause, reveals the extent to which we deviate from what is right. In this universal experience, the law exposes our sinfulness, extinguishing any hope of life that we may have had.

### John Calvin:
1. "It is indeed true, that while the will of God is hid from us, and no truth shines on us, the life of men goes wholly astray and is full of errors; nay, we do nothing but wander from the right course, until the law shows to us the way of living rightly."
2. "Hence the verb, ἐξαπατᾷν, must be understood, not of the thing itself, but of our knowledge; that is, that it is made manifest by the law how much we have departed from the right course."
