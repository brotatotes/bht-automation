# Romans 7:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Bible verse portrays the dynamic relationship between sin and the law. Commentators emphasize that the law, while good, has the ability to reveal the true nature of sin and highlight its excessive and sinful character. The law serves as a mirror for humanity, exposing their depravity and showing that sin goes beyond mere transgressions. By causing death and condemnation, the law exposes the depth of sin and leaves no doubt about its egregiousness. This verse also highlights that sin operates in opposition to the commandments, bringing death through its perversion of what is good.
