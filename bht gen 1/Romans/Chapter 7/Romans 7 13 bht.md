# Romans 7:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Bible verse portrays the law as good, but not responsible for sin or death. It reveals sin's true nature by using what is good to bring about death. The law doesn't provide salvation or sanctification, as it cannot make us holy. Sin is emphasized as being fiercely rebellious, becoming even more sinful when confronted with the commandment. Its wickedness is magnified when it counteracts the holy and just nature of God's law.
