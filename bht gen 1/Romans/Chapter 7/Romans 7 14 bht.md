# Romans 7:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This passage from the Bible describes the spiritual nature of the law and the struggle between the carnal and spiritual aspects of human nature. Commentators emphasize that the law, in its essence, requires not only external obedience but also a genuine fear of God and a transformed heart. The law is described as spiritual because it is given by the Holy Spirit and demands spiritual obedience. However, the human tendency towards sin is also highlighted, as the speaker acknowledges being carnal and sold under sin, emphasizing the need for deliverance and the transformative power of Christ.
