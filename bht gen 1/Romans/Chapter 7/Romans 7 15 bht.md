# Romans 7:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this powerful Bible verse, the Apostle vividly captures the inner conflict between our sinful nature and our longing to do what is right. As one commentator puts it, we find ourselves in a state of slavery, where our actions are often driven by the desires of our carnal nature, going against our better but helpless desires to do what is good. This struggle is characterized by a paradoxical situation where the hatred of evil often outweighs the desire for good.
