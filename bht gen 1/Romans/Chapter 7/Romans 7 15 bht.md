### Albert Barnes:
1. "The prevailing propensity; the habitual fixed inclination of the mind of the Christian, is to do right. The evil course is hated, the right course is loved. This is the characteristic of a pious mind. It distinguishes a holy man from a sinner."

2. "The evil which is done is disapproved; is a source of grief; and the habitual desire of the mind is to avoid it, and be pure. This also distinguishes the Christian from the sinner."

3. "All are conscious of doing that, under the excitement of passion and prejudice, which their conscience and better judgment disapprove. A conflict thus exists, which is attended with as much metaphysical difficulty as the struggle in the Christian’s mind referred to here."

### Marvin Vincent:

1. "The great discord there is between the Law of God and the natural man."
2. "The law, as it produces only death in a man wholly carnal, is in him more easily impeached, for it is doubtful whence the evil proceeds."
3. "The godly, in whom the regeneration of God is begun, are so divided, that with the chief desire of the heart they aspire to God, seek celestial righteousness, hate sin, and yet they are drawn down to the earth by the relics of their flesh."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Like a slave he performs ignorantly the will of his master."
2. "He acts in gloomy self-distraction, and in contradiction of a better but helpless desire and repugnance."
3. "The desire for good is less strong than the hatred of evil."

3. "It is the unregenerate man's experience, surviving at least in memory into regenerate days, and read with regenerate eyes."

### John Gill:
1. "That which he did was evil, since he allowed not of it; but this is to be understood not of any notorious crime committed by him, and repeated again and again; nor of a sinful course of life, for before his conversion he was not a profane man, but externally moral."
2. "When that apostle says that what he did, 'I know not': his meaning is, not that he was utterly ignorant of them, of their nature and operations; that he was insensible of their motions, and unconcerned about them; but either that the efforts and effects of sin in him were so sudden, and at an unawares, that he was sometimes overtaken and held captive, before he knew well where he was, or what he was doing."
3. "He adds, but what I hate, that do I; sin was what he hated; it being contrary to the pure and holy nature of God, to the good and righteous law of God, and was in itself, to his view, exceeding sinful."
