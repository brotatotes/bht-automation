### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "To explain this and the following statements, as many do (even BENGEL and THOLUCK), of the sins of unrenewed men against their better convictions, is to do painful violence to the apostle's language, and to affirm of the unregenerate what is untrue."
2. "That coexistence and mutual hostility of 'flesh' and 'spirit' in the same renewed man, which is so clearly taught in Romans 8:4, c., and in Romans 8:4- :, &c., is the true and only key to the language of this and the following verses."
3. "His sole object in thus expressing himself was to bring more vividly before his readers the conflict of two opposite principles, and how entirely, as a new man—honoring from his inmost soul the law of God—he condemned and renounced his corrupt nature, with its affections and lusts, its stirrings and its outgoings, root and branch."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He means to say that he does not approve or love it in his present state, but that it is the result of his native propensities and passions."
2. "Thus, every Christian can say that he does not choose to do evil, but would wish to be perfect; that he hates sin, and yet that his corrupt passions lead him astray."
3. "This expression stands in contrast with another that occurs, where it is said that 'the Spirit of God dwells' in the Christian, Romans 8:9; 1 Corinthians 3:16."

### Marvin Vincent:

1. "It is no longer I that perform it, i.e., 'what I wish not.' I am a slave under sin, what 'I perform, I know not' (Romans 7:16)."

3. "The desire is powerless; the 'I' is enslaved."
4. "Whether the experience be that of a regenerate or unregenerate man, the moral responsibility rests on him in whom sin dwells; the description is intended to prove the powerlessness of man under the law, not to define his responsibility."
