# Romans 7:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the speaker grapples with the conflicting forces of their spiritual self and the power of sin dwelling within them. The internal struggle is described as sin taking up residence, transforming the individual's character, and exerting a tyrannical influence. It portrays the battle for control as an intense conflict where the speaker's new nature condemns and renounces their corrupt nature, yet they find themselves bound by the power of sin that dwells within.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "To explain this and the following statements, as many do (even BENGEL and THOLUCK), of the sins of unrenewed men against their better convictions, is to do painful violence to the apostle's language, and to affirm of the unregenerate what is untrue."
2. "That coexistence and mutual hostility of 'flesh' and 'spirit' in the same renewed man, which is so clearly taught in Romans 8:4, c., and in Romans 8:4- :, &c., is the true and only key to the language of this and the following verses."
3. "His sole object in thus expressing himself was to bring more vividly before his readers the conflict of two opposite principles, and how entirely, as a new man—honoring from his inmost soul the law of God—he condemned and renounced his corrupt nature, with its affections and lusts, its stirrings and its outgoings, root and branch."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "No more" - This phrase is not referring to a past time, but rather to a logical inference. It signifies that after this statement, it is no longer possible to maintain a certain belief or perspective.
2. "My personality proper" - This phrase describes the moral self-consciousness of the speaker, which has already approved the law and has a longing for something better.
3. "Developed vague desires for something better" - The speaker's moral self-consciousness has evolved to have indistinct longings for a higher standard or a more fulfilling existence.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "It is no longer I that perform it, i.e., 'what I wish not.' I am a slave under sin, what 'I perform, I know not'." 
2. "Both 'now' and 'no longer' are logical, not temporal; they point to an inference, not necessarily to a transition from a former condition into a state of grace." 
3. "The desire is powerless; the 'I' is enslaved."

### John Gill:
1. "since he did not approve, but hated what he did, and willed the contrary, it was not he as spiritual, as born again, as a new man, a new creature, that did it"
2. "the old man, the carnal I, the evil present with him, the law in his members"
3. "which not only existed in him, and wrought in him, and that at times very strongly, but dwelt in him, had its abode in him, as it has in all regenerate persons"

### John Wesley:
1. "Sin that dwelleth in me" - This phrase highlights the internal struggle between the self and sin. It suggests that sin has taken up residence within the individual, creating a constant battle for control.

2. "Makes, as it were, another person" - This statement emphasizes the power of sin to transform a person's character and behavior. It suggests that sin can exert such influence that it almost creates a separate identity within the individual.

3. "Tyrannizes over me" - This phrase conveys the oppressive nature of sin. It implies that sin exercises control and domination over the individual, subjecting them to its will and desires.
