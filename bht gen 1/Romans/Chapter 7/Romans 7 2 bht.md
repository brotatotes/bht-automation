## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "The phrase 'if her husband be dead' is a reference to the death of the old self, the old sinful nature that is crucified with Christ. It speaks to the believer's identification with Christ in His death and resurrection, and the freedom from the power of sin that comes through union with Him."
2. "Romans 7:3 further emphasizes the believer's release from the law and the bondage of sin. It highlights the new covenant relationship with Christ, where the believer is no longer bound to the old ways of the flesh but is now united with Christ and empowered to live a life of righteousness."
3. "This verse reminds us that our old self, with its sinful desires and tendencies, has been put to death through Christ's sacrifice. It calls us to live in the reality of our new identity in Christ, where we are no longer slaves to sin but are free to live in obedience to God's will."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The Mosaic law made no provision for her releasing herself from the marriage tie, though the husband might put away his wife."
2. "Death is common to both parties; when the husband dies, the wife dies so far as that legal relation is concerned."
3. "As the woman is not dead, but is killed in respect to her marriage relation, or is situated as dead, by the natural death of her husband, so believers have not died a natural death, but are made dead to the law, since they are crucified to the law with Christ."

### John Gill:
1. "A woman that is married to a man is bound by the law to her husband; to live with him, in subjection and obedience to him, so long as he liveth." 

2. "The bond of marriage is loosed, and for which a divorce or separation may be made, which are equal to death."
