# Romans 7:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we see a vivid portrayal of the internal struggle that believers face. Despite the transformed self, characterized by a desire to do what is right, there is an ongoing conflict between the old sinful nature and the new self. This battle is not an excuse for sin, but rather an acknowledgment of the deep-rooted corruption of human nature which is the ultimate source of all transgressions. It reminds us that our struggle against sin is not in vain, for through God's grace, we can find the strength and forgiveness needed to overcome.

2. "No longer do I do it" - This statement emphasizes the ongoing struggle against sin, even though the true self, the "Εγο," desires to do what is right. It acknowledges the tension between the desire to live according to God's will and the reality of human weakness and temptation.

### John Gill:
1. "The same conclusion is formed here, as in Romans 7:17, not with any view to excuse himself from blame in sinning, but to trace the lusts of his heart, and the sins of his life, to the source and fountain of them, the corruption of his nature."
2. "To ascribe them to the proper cause of them, which was not the law of God, nor the new man, but sin that dwelt in him."
3. "The corruption of nature is the cause of all actual transgressions, and is the spring and source of them."
