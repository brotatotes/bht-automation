# Romans 7:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, Paul describes a powerful struggle within oneself. The law, which is both an external moral guide and an internal constraining power, reveals the conflict between the desire to do good and the presence of evil stemming from corrupted human nature. This tension manifests as an ongoing battle between two wills: one inclined towards righteousness and another influenced by sinful desires. The purpose of this struggle is to bring awareness of our need for Christ's redemption and to guide us towards Him as the ultimate source of grace and salvation.
