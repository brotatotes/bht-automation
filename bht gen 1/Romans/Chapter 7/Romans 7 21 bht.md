# Romans 7:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, there is a depiction of an internal struggle between the desire to do good and the presence of evil. The corrupted nature within individuals is described as a "law," forcefully demanding compliance with its sinful desires. This inner conflict is like a constant battle, a force within us that compels us to go against God's will. However, it is through the grace of Jesus Christ that we can overcome this power of sin and live a life that is pleasing to God.
