### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "For I delight in the law of God after the inward man" - This verse expresses a deep and genuine joy in God's law, coming from the very core of one's being. It goes beyond mere consent or agreement, showing a state of mind and heart that is foreign to the unregenerate person.

2. "The word here rendered 'delight' is indeed stronger than 'consent' in Romans 7:16" - The use of the word "delight" emphasizes the intensity of the joy experienced in embracing God's law. It conveys a sense of pleasure, satisfaction, and fulfillment that goes beyond mere agreement or compliance.

3. "Both express a state of mind and heart to which the unregenerate man is a stranger" - This commentary highlights the stark contrast between the regenerate and unregenerate person. The unregenerate individual is unable to experience the deep delight and joy in God's law that is characteristic of the inwardly transformed believer.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Delight in' is stronger than 'agree with' (Romans 7:16), but must not be pressed too far, since Romans 7:21, of which this is an explanation, is a summing up of the experience in Romans 7:14-20."
2. "The inward man, despite all its agreement with the law, even when in aroused feeling it might be said to delight in the law of God, is in a helpless condition, all the more miserable, because of its approval of the law."
3. "When the Christian is 'under the law,' his delight may be more pronounced, but so long as he seeks sanctification through the law, he is quite as helpless."

### John Gill:
1. "Only a regenerate man delights in the law of God; which he does, as it is fulfilled by Christ, who has answered all the demands of it."
2. "He serves it with his mind, of a ready mind freely, and without any constraint but that of love."
3. "The renewed man, the new man, or new nature, formed in his soul... is an internal principle, oil in the vessel of the heart, a seed under ground, the kingdom within us, the hidden man of the heart, which is not obvious to everyone's view."

### John Wesley:
1. "For I delight in the law of God" - This shows that the writer's relationship with God's law goes beyond mere compliance; it is a source of joy and satisfaction.
