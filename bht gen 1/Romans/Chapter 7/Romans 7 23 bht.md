# Romans 7:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, a commentator describes the internal struggle within a person, their own battle against sin and the captivity they experience. Another commentator highlights the contrast between the sinful nature and the renewed mind that desires to follow God's law. We see the wrestling of a regenerate individual, deeply aware of the evil inclinations and bodily appetites that go against the inner desires for righteousness, despite all their resistance.

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The word 'law' means an inward principle of action, good or evil, operating with the fixedness and regularity of a law."
2. "The apostle found two such laws within him; the one 'the law of sin in his members,' called 'the flesh which lusteth against the spirit,' 'the flesh with the affections and lusts,' that is, the sinful principle in the regenerate; the other, 'the law of the mind,' or the holy principle of the renewed nature."
3. "When the apostle describes himself as 'brought into captivity' by the triumph of the sinful principle of his nature, he clearly speaks in the person of a renewed man."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The body is composed of many members; and as the flesh is regarded as the source of sin, the law of sin is said to be in the members, that is, in the body itself." 

2. "The law of my mind stands opposed to the prevailing inclinations of a corrupt nature. It denotes the desires and purposes of a renewed heart."

3. "The apostle represents himself as engaged in a warfare; and as being overcome, and made an unwilling captive to the evil inclinations of the heart. The expression is strong; and denotes strong corrupt propensities."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Paul is a spectator of his own personality."
2. "The key to its Pauline usage is furnished by the contrast in 1 Corinthians 14:14-19, between speaking with a tongue and with the understanding [τω νοι], and between the spirit and the understanding (ver. 14)."
3. "It stands related to pneuma spirit, as the faculty to the efficient power."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Paul represents himself as witnessing the conflict within his own person."
2. "The conflict is against the law of God, not as such, but as having the locality of its operation in the 'mind.'"
3. "The law in the members is the warrior that takes the captive, the law of sin is the victor under whom the captive is held; the two laws are practically identical."

1. "The law of my mind... the inward man" - Paul refers to the reflective intelligence within him, the higher self that recognizes the goodness of God's law.
2. "Warring against... carry on a campaign against" - Paul vividly describes the intense struggle and conflict he experiences in his battle against sin.
