# Romans 7:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the commentators describe a profound struggle within oneself. The law mentioned is an internal principle of action, a conflict between good and evil, sin and holiness. This conflict takes place within the mind and members, as the sinful nature triumphs over the renewed nature. Despite resistance, the captive finds themselves held under the stronghold of sin. It is a battle against evil inclinations and bodily appetites, as the mind delights in the law of God.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "The word 'law' means an inward principle of action, good or evil, operating with the fixedness and regularity of a law."
2. "The apostle found two such laws within him; the one 'the law of sin in his members,' called 'the flesh which lusteth against the spirit,' 'the flesh with the affections and lusts,' that is, the sinful principle in the regenerate; the other, 'the law of the mind,' or the holy principle of the renewed nature."
3. "When the apostle describes himself as 'brought into captivity' by the triumph of the sinful principle of his nature, he clearly speaks in the person of a renewed man."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Paul represents himself as witnessing the conflict within his own person."
2. "The conflict is against the law of God, not as such, but as having the locality of its operation in the 'mind.'"
3. "The law in the members is the warrior that takes the captive, the law of sin is the victor under whom the captive is held; the two laws are practically identical."

### John Wesley:
1. "Another inward constraining power of evil inclinations and bodily appetites."
2. "The dictate of my mind, which delights in the law of God."
3. "In spite of all my resistance."
