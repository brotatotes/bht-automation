# Romans 7:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, a believer cries out in anguish and desperation, recognizing their helplessness and wretchedness. They seek deliverance from the burden of sin that weighs them down, longing for God to answer their plea for help. The phrase "the body of this death" refers to the overwhelming presence of sin, which clings to them like a constant companion. The struggle intensifies, leading the believer to seek deliverance until God answers their cry for liberation.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "The apostle speaks of the 'body' here with reference to 'the law of sin' which he had said was 'in his members,' but merely as the instrument by which the sin of the heart finds vent in action, and as itself the seat of the lower appetites."
2. "He calls it 'the body of this death,' as feeling, at the moment when he wrote, the horrors of that death into which it dragged him down."
3. "The language is not that of a sinner newly awakened to the sight of his lost state; it is the cry of a living but agonized believer, weighed down under a burden which is not himself, but which he longs to shake off from his renewed self."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The prominent ideas are of helplessness and wretchedness; the cry for deliverance follows."
2. "A believer may thus speak, doubtless often does; but this condition is precisely that from which we are delivered."
3. "There is, however, no reference to physical death, but to the whole condition of helplessness, guilt, and misery just described, which is, in effect, spiritual death."

### John Wesley:
1. "Wretched man that I am" - The struggle is now come to the height; and the man, finding there is no help in himself, begins almost unawares to pray, Who shall deliver me?
2. "He then seeks and looks for deliverance, till God in Christ appears to answer his question." - The man actively seeks deliverance, longing for God to answer his plea for help.
3. "The body of this death" - This body of death; this mass of sin, leading to death eternal, and cleaving as close to me as my body to my soul. The deliverance is not yet achieved.
