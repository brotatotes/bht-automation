### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The apostle speaks of the 'body' here with reference to 'the law of sin' which he had said was 'in his members,' but merely as the instrument by which the sin of the heart finds vent in action, and as itself the seat of the lower appetites."

3. "But the language is not that of a sinner newly awakened to the sight of his lost state; it is the cry of a living but agonized believer, weighed down under a burden which is not himself, but which he longs to shake off from his renewed self."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The effect of this conflict is, (1) To produce pain and distress. It is often an agonizing struggle between good and evil; a struggle which annoys the peace, and renders life wretched."
2. "It tends to produce humility. It is humbling to man to be thus under the influence of evil passions. It is degrading to his nature; a stain on his glory; and it tends to bring him into the dust, that he is under the control of such propensities, and so often gives indulgence to them."
3. "The expression 'body of this death' is a Hebraism, denoting a body deadly in its tendency; and the whole expression may mean the corrupt principles of man; the carnal, evil affections that lead to death or to condemnation."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The prominent ideas are of helplessness and wretchedness; the cry for deliverance follows."
