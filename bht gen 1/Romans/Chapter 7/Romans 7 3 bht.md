## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Marriage is a sacred union where two individuals become one, not just legally but also spiritually and emotionally. It is a joining of two souls, a bond that is meant to be cherished and nurtured."
2. "In the context of Romans 7:4, being 'married' refers to the believer's union with Christ. Just as a wife is bound to her husband, we are bound to Christ in a covenant relationship. This speaks of the intimate connection we have with Him, and the commitment we have to live in accordance with His will."
3. "The word 'married' in Romans 7:4 signifies a deep level of commitment and devotion. It implies a complete surrender of oneself to the other person. In our relationship with Christ, we are called to fully surrender our lives to Him, allowing Him to be the center of our existence and guiding our every step."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Shall be called an adulteress. This is the formal sentence, with a definite penalty stoning."
2. "Free from that law; lit., 'the law,' in so far as it binds her to the husband, the binding effect of the law as respects the marriage relation."
3. "So that she is not an adulteress. This clause may express either the result ('so that') or the purpose, 'in order that.' The latter is perhaps grammatically more exact; the purpose of this freedom was to prevent the woman from being an adulteress in case of a second marriage."

### John Gill:
