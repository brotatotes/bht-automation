# Romans 7:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, believers are described as being united with Christ in his death and resurrection. They are freed from the law and are now married to Christ, bringing forth the fruits of good works for the glory of God. The death of Christ serves as the grounds for their justification and their fellowship in His death. This union with Christ in His death means that believers are now dead to the law, and the law no longer has power over them.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "The apostle here departs from his usual word 'died,' using the more expressive phrase 'were slain,' to make it clear that he meant their being 'crucified with Christ'."

2. "It was essential to his argument that we, not the law, should be the dying party, since it is we that are 'crucified with Christ,' and not the law."

3. "Believers are here viewed as having a double life—the old sin-condemned life, which they lay down with Christ, and the new life of acceptance and holiness to which they rise with their Surety and Head."

These quotes highlight the concept of believers being united with Christ in his death and resurrection, emphasizing the freedom from the law and the new life of holiness that comes through this union.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The expression is chosen, not merely because Christ's death was a violent one, but also because it describes the death of Christians to the law as a death incurred by virtue of the administration of the law." 
2. "This refers to the death of Christ, either as the ground of justification, or as involving our fellowship in His death. The latter is preferable; it implies the former, and suits the tenor of the whole passage." 
3. "The purpose of the death to the law was union to Christ; the figure of a marriage is still present, and quite appropriate."

### John Gill:
1. "Believers being dead to the law, and the law dead to them, they are loosed from it, and may be, and are lawfully married to Christ, that they may bring forth the genuine fruits of good works, not in order to obtain righteousness and life by them, but for the honour and glory of God."
2. "The saints and children of God are become dead to the law, and that to them... they can have no more power over them than a law can have over dead persons."
3. "The reason why the law is become so to them, and they to that, is, that ye should be married to another; or 'that ye should be to another', or 'be another's'; that is, that ye should appear to be so in a just and legal way."

### John Wesley:
1. "Thus ye also â€” Are now as free from the Mosaic law as an husband is, when his wife is dead." 
2. "By the body of Christ â€” Offered up; that is, by the merits of his death, that law expiring with him." 
3. "That law expiring with him."
