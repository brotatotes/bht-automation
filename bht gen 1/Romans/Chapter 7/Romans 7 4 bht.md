# Romans 7:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this passage, commentators explain the profound implications of being "slain to the law by means of the Body of Christ." They emphasize the transformative power of Christ's sacrifice, freeing believers from the bondage of the law and connecting them to the resurrected Christ. Through this connection, believers are released from the old way of life and united to Christ, entering into a new life of acceptance and holiness. This new union with Christ brings forth fruit that honors and glorifies God, as believers are now dead to the law and alive to righteousness.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "you also were slain to the law by means of the Body of Christ, that you should become attached to another, to Him who was raised from the dead" - This highlights the transformative power of Christ's sacrifice, freeing believers from the bondage of the law and connecting them to the resurrected Christ.

2. "that we should bring forth fruit to the honor of God" - This emphasizes the purpose of believers' new life in Christ, to bear fruit that brings glory to God.

3. "Not merely final, as Thol., Meyer, De W., &c. Not merely ecbatic, as Fritzsche" - This shows that there are different interpretations of the intended meaning of the passage, highlighting the complexity of understanding biblical texts.

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The apostle here departs from his usual word 'died,' using the more expressive phrase 'were slain,' to make it clear that he meant their being 'crucified with Christ'." 

2. "It was essential to his argument that we, not the law, should be the dying party, since it is we that are 'crucified with Christ,' and not the law." 

3. "Believers are here viewed as having a double life—the old sin-condemned life, which they lay down with Christ, and the new life of acceptance and holiness to which they rise with their Surety and Head."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The meaning is, as death dissolves the connection between a wife and her husband, and of course the obligation of the law resulting from that connection, so the death of the Christian to the Law dissolves that connection, so far as the scope of the argument here is concerned, and prepares the way for another union, a union with Christ, from which a new and more efficient obligation results."

2. "The connection between us and the Law is dissolved, so far as the scope of the apostle’s argument is concerned. He does not say that we are dead to it, or released from it as a rule of duty, or as a matter of obligation to obey it; for there neither is, nor can be, any such release, but we are dead to it as a way of justification and sanctification."

3. "Thus released, we are at liberty to be united to the law of him who has thus bought us with his blood."

4. "As the woman that is freed from the law of her husband by his death, when married again comes under the authority of another, so we who are made free from the Law and its curse by the death of Christ, are brought under the new law of fidelity and obedience to him with whom we are thus united."

5. "That we should bring forth fruit unto God - That we should live a holy life. This is the point and scope of all this illustration. The new connection is such as will make us holy."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Who was raised. An important addition, because it refers to the newness of life which issues from the rising with Christ."
2. "The real point of analogy is the termination of relations to the old state."
3. "The flesh is not necessarily sinful in itself; but as it has existed from the time of the introduction of sin through Adam, it is recognized by Paul as tainted with sin."

### John Calvin:
1. "Christ, by the glorious victory of the cross, first triumphed over sin; and that he might do this, it was necessary that the handwriting, by which we were held bound, should be cancelled."
2. "But the Apostle goes farther, and says, that the bond of the law was destroyed; not that we may live according to our own will, but that we may be now bound to another husband, that is, from the law to Christ."
3. "He at the same time softens the asperity of the expression, by saying that Christ, in order to join us to his own body, made us free from the yoke of the law."
4. "He ever annexes the final cause, lest any should indulge the liberty of their flesh and their own lusts, under the pretense that Christ has delivered them from the bondage of the law; for he has offered us, together with himself, as a sacrifice to the Father, and he regenerates us for this end — that by newness of life we may bring forth fruit unto God."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The expression is chosen, not merely because Christ’s death was a violent one, but also because it describes the death of Christians to the law as a death incurred by virtue of the administration of the law."
2. "This refers to the death of Christ, either (1) as the ground of justification, or (2) as involving our fellowship in His death. The latter 'is preferable; it implies the former, and suits the tenor of the whole passage."
3. "The purpose of the death to the law was union to Christ; the figure of a marriage is still present, and quite appropriate. 'The exalted Christ is the husband of His Church that has become independent of the law by dying with Him.'"

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Paul refuses to say that [the law is dead]. He changes the structure and makes them dead to the law as the husband."
2. "The relation of marriage is killed 'through the body of Christ' as the 'propitiation' for us."
3. "The saints as wedded to Christ as their Husband occurs in 1 Corinthians 6:13; Galatians 4:26."

### John Gill:
1. "Believers being dead to the law, and the law dead to them, which is all one, they are loosed from it, and may be, and are lawfully married to Christ, that they may bring forth the genuine fruits of good works, not in order to obtain righteousness and life by them, but for the honour and glory of God."
2. "The saints and children of God are become dead to the law, and that to them... they can have no more power over them than a law can have over dead persons, or a dead abrogated law can have over living ones."
3. "The reason why the law is become so to them, and they to that, is, that ye should be married to another; or 'that ye should be to another', or 'be another's'; that is, that ye should appear to be so in a just and legal way; for they were another's, they were Christ's before by the Father's gift, and were secretly married to him in the everlasting covenant."

### John Wesley:
1. "Are now as free from the Mosaic law as an husband is, when his wife is dead."
2. "By the body of Christ — Offered up; that is, by the merits of his death."
3. "That law expiring with him."
