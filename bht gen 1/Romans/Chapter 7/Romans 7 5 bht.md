# Romans 7:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the commentators shed light on the idea of being "in the flesh." They describe it as a state of natural depravity, opposing a spiritual state. It refers to our unregenerate condition before believing in Christ. The passions and stirrings of sin, which were intensified by the law's prohibition, led to sinful actions through the members of our body. This verse highlights the impact of our sinful nature and the role of the law in exacerbating our sins.
