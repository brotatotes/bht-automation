Believers are delivered from the old covenant of the law, enabling them to live in a new way, free from its grip.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "But now have we been delivered from the law, having died (to that) wherein we were held." 
2. "So that we serve in the newness of the Spirit and not in the oldness of the letter." 
3. "The law being only a collection of precepts and prohibitions, but the Gospel a service of freedom, ruled by the Spirit, whose presence is liberty."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "we are delivered from the law—The word is the same which, in James 1:15- : and elsewhere, is rendered 'destroyed,' and is but another way of saying (as in Romans 7:4) that 'we were slain to the law by the body of Christ'; language which, though harsh to the ear, is designed and fitted to impress upon the reader the violence of that death of the Cross, by which, as by a deadly wrench, we are 'delivered from the law.'" 

2. "that being dead wherein we were held—It is now universally agreed that the true reading here is, 'being dead to that wherein we were held.' The received reading has no authority whatever, and is inconsistent with the strain of the argument; for the death spoken of, as we have seen, is not the law's, but ours, through union with the crucified Saviour."

3. "serve in newness of spirit—'in the newness of the spirit.' and not in the oldness of the letter—not in our old way of literal, mechanical obedience to the divine law, as a set of external rules of conduct, and without any reference to the state of our hearts; but in that new way of spiritual obedience which, through union to the risen Saviour, we have learned to render."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The way in which this is accomplished, the apostle illustrates more at length in Romans 8:0 with which this verse is properly connected."
2. "Delivered from it as a means of justification, as a source of sanctification, as a bondage to which we were subjected, and which tended to produce pain and death."
3. "The worship required under the gospel is uniformly described as that of the spirit and the heart, rather than that of form and ceremony."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "We are delivered [κατηργηθημεν]. Rev., have been discharged, as the woman, ver. 2." 
2. "We were held. Lit., held down." 
3. "See on ch. Romans 1:18."

### John Calvin:
1. "If the restraint of the law availed so little to bridle the flesh, that it became rather the exciter of sin; then, that we may cease from sin, we must necessarily be freed from the law."
2. "We are then freed from the law, when God emancipates us from its rigid exactions and curse, and endues us with his Spirit, through whom we walk in his ways."
3. "He sets the spirit in opposition to the letter; for before our will is formed according to the will of God by the Holy Spirit, we have in the law nothing but the outward letter, which indeed bridles our external actions, but does not in the least restrain the fury of our lusts."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "We died so far as the law is concerned, hence the marriage tie is dissolved."
2. "The sphere of the Christian service of God is a new one, of which the Holy Spirit is the ruling element or force."
3. "The new service is the only true service; under the law such a service was not possible."

1. "Now the saints deliverance from the law through the abrogation of it, that losing its former life, vigour, power, and dominion, is not that they may live a loose licentious life and conversation, but that they should serve the Lord their God without slavish fear, and with a godly one, acceptably, in righteousness and holiness, all the days of their lives."
2. "The manner in which this service is to be, and is performed, is, in newness of Spirit; under the influences of the Spirit of God, the author of renovation, of the new creature, or new man created in us, in righteousness and true holiness."
3. "A believer without the law, being delivered from it, that being dead to him, and he to that, lives a better life and conversation under the influence of the Spirit of God, than one that is under the law, and the works of it, destitute of the grace of God."

### John Wesley:
