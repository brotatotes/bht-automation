# Romans 7:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
We have been delivered from the law, set free from its curse and condemnation, through the violent death of Christ on the Cross. Our old self, held captive by the law, has died, enabling us to serve God in a new, spiritual manner. This newness of spirit allows us to serve God with righteousness and true holiness, contrasting with our previous mechanical obedience to the law. In this freedom, we are not bound by legalistic rules, but instead serve the Lord with a heartfelt devotion and acceptance.
