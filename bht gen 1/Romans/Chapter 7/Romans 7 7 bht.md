# Romans 7:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Bible verse being described is a reflection on the purpose and impact of the law. The commentators emphasize that the law is not to be blamed for sin, but rather exposes the sinful nature and desires within humanity. They highlight that the law reveals the strength and virulence of our sinful propensity and is necessary to make us aware of coveting and evil desires. The verse also distinguishes that the law is not sinful itself, but rather opposes sin. It is through the law that we come to understand the sinful nature in us.
