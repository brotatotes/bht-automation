## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Is the law sin? not 'the cause of sin,' which in one sense the Apostle would not have denied, but sin, abstract for concrete, sinful." 
2. "I was living in a state of ignorance of sin, were it not ... This construction comprehends in it οὐκ ἂν ἔγνων as a consequence, and is therefore often said to be put for it; but it has its propriety, as here, where a historical state is being described, and the unconditional indicative is more appropriate." 
3. "The law here is in the full sense of the Mosaic law as regarded himself, not excluding the wider sense on which I have insisted in the former part of the Epistle when applied to others."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Is the law sin? God forbid! Far from us be such a thought." 
2. "It was by means of the law that I came to know what a virulence and strength of sinful propensity I had within me."
3. "The apostle saw in it the prohibition not only of desire after certain things there specified, but of 'desire after everything divinely forbidden'; in other words, all 'lusting' or 'irregular desire.'"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The objection which is here urged is one that would very naturally rise, and which we may suppose would be urged with no slight indignation."
2. "The apostle replies with great wisdom, by showing that the evil was not in the Law, but in man; that though these effects often followed, yet that the Law itself was good and pure."
3. "The apostle in these verses refers, doubtless, to the state of his mind before he found that peace which the gospel furnishes by the pardon of sins."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "I did not know." - The commentary explains that the phrase "I did not know" refers to Paul himself, emphasizing his personal experience. This quote highlights the introspective nature of the verse.

2. "He speaks in the first person, declaring concerning himself what is meant to apply to every man placed under the Mosaic law." - The commentary suggests that Paul's words have a broader application beyond his own experience, encompassing all individuals under the Mosaic law. This quote emphasizes the universal aspect of the verse.

### John Calvin:

### John Gill:
1. "To this it is replied by way of detestation and abhorrence, God forbid! a way of speaking often made use of by the apostle, when any dreadful consequence was drawn from, or any shocking objection was made to his doctrine, and which was so monstrous as scarcely to deserve any other manner of refutation." 

2. "The apostle exemplifies this in his own case, and says, nay, I had not known sin, but by the law; which he says not in the person of another, there is no room nor reason for such a fancy; but in his own person, and of himself: not of himself at that present time, as is evident from his way of speaking; nor of himself in his childhood, before he came to years of discretion to discern between good and evil; but as, and when he was a grown person, and whilst a Pharisee, Philippians 3:5; he did not know sin during his being in that state till the law came, and entered into his conscience, and then, and by it, he knew sin." 

3. "By 'lust' is meant the inward motions of sin in the heart, any and every desire of the mind after it not only studied and concerted schemes, how to bring about and compass an evil action; but every loose vagrant thought of sin, and inclination to it; yea, every imagination of the thought of the heart, before the imagination is well formed into a thought; and not only a dallying with sin in the mind, dwelling upon it with pleasure in thought, but even such sudden motions and starts of the mind to sin, to which we give no assent; such as are involuntary, yea, contrary to the will, being 'the evil [we] would not', Romans 7:19, and are displeasing and hateful to us; these are meant by lust, and which by the law of God are known to be sinful, and only by that."

### John Wesley:
1. "This is a kind of a digression, to the beginning of the next chapter, wherein the apostle, in order to show in the most lively manner the weakness and inefficacy of the law, changes the person and speaks as of himself, concerning the misery of one under the law."
2. "The character here assumed is that of a man, first ignorant of the law, then under it and sincerely, but ineffectually, striving to serve God."
3. "To have spoken this of himself, or any true believer, would have been foreign to the whole scope of his discourse; nay, utterly contrary thereto, as well as to what is expressly asserted, Romans 8:2."
