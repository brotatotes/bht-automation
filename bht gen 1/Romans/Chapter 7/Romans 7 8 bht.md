# Romans 7:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse being described explores the relationship between sin and the law. It reveals that sin, when given an opportunity, uses the law as a starting point to attack. These prohibitions intensify desire, making forbidden things more alluring. The law's opposition to wicked desires only serves to inflame them further. The verse highlights the impact of the law on our corrupt nature, as it brings sin to light and amplifies its presence. However, it is important to note that the law itself is not sinful, but sin takes advantage of its existence.
