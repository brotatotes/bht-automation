# Romans 7:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Before the law, sin lies dormant and seemingly non-existent, as our sinful nature is inactive and lacks power. Without the knowledge of the law, we may not even realize the depth of our inbred corruption, unaware of the danger and the raging desires within us. The law serves as both a commandment to restrain sin and a trigger that provokes and intensifies our evil desires. It is through the revelation of the law that sin is no longer dead but activated and opposed, leading us to a greater awareness of our own sinful nature.

### Philip Schaff:
