# Romans 7:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Before the law came into effect, there was a period when sin seemed dormant and guilt was not apparent. During this time, there was a sense of righteousness and security, as if one had a life of their own. However, when the commandment was revealed, sin regained its power and the individual experienced a spiritual death, realizing their true sinful nature and the consequences they deserved. The law served as a wakeup call, exposing the realization of the need for redemption and the struggle between sin and righteousness.
