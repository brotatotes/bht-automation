# Romans 7:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the days of my ignorance, when I deemed myself a righteous man, I thought I was healthy and alive. But when the law came to me with its commandments and prohibitions, sin revealed itself in all its ugliness and strength. It lifted up its monstrous head and I saw myself full of wounds and sores, dead in sin and under the sentence of death. Before truly understanding the extent of the Divine law, sin had less power over me. But with the knowledge of sin, I died within myself, realizing my need for redemption.
