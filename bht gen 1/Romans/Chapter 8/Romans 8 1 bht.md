## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:

2. "The body remains dead, under the power of death physical (and eternal?), because of sin which it stands in, and serves."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The scope of [Romans 8:1] is to show how 'the law of sin and death' is deprived of its power to bring believers again into bondage, and how the holy law of God receives in them the homage of a living obedience."
2. "As Christ, who 'knew no sin,' was, to all legal effects, 'made sin for us,' so are we, who believe in Him, to all legal effects, 'made the righteousness of God in Him' and thus, one with Him in the divine reckoning. There is to such 'NO CONDEMNATION.'"
3. "But this is no mere legal arrangement: it is a union in life; believers, through the indwelling of Christ's Spirit in them, having one life with Him, as truly as the head and the members of the same body have one life."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The function of the law is to condemn. The one never affords deliverance, but always condemns; the object of the other is to free from condemnation, and to set the soul at liberty."
2. "The design of Paul is not so much to assert the different functions of the Law and the gospel, as simply to state the fact in regard to the condition of a certain class, namely, those who are in Christ. To them there is no condemnation whatever; not only no final condemnation, but no condemnation now, from the moment of their union to Christ, and deliverance from the curse of the Law."
3. "Who conduct, or live. Note, Romans 4:12. Not after the flesh. Who do not live to gratify the corrupt desires and passions of the flesh...

2. "The trembling consciences of the godly have an invincible fortress, for they know that while they abide in Christ they are beyond every danger of condemnation." 
3. "Those who walk after the Spirit are not such as have wholly put off all the emotions of the flesh, but they are those who sedulously labor to subdue and mortify the flesh, so that the love of true religion seems to reign in them."
