# Romans 8:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we are reminded of the powerful presence of the Spirit of Christ within us, described as the Spirit that raised Jesus from the dead. This indwelling Spirit guarantees that not only will our spirits experience eternal life, but also that our bodies, despite their mortality, will ultimately share in redemption and be resurrected. It assures us that the victory over sin and death will be complete, as the triumph of grace extends to every aspect of our being.
