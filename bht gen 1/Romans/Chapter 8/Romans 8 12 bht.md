# Romans 8:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As believers, we are no longer bound to the desires and temptations of our sinful nature. We have the power and responsibility to resist the pull of the flesh, and instead, live in obedience to God's commands. Our allegiance is now to the Spirit, who empowers us to live a life pleasing to God and walk in righteousness. Through the indwelling of the Spirit, we are set free from the bondage of sin and have a new identity in Christ.
