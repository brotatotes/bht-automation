# Romans 8:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Bible verse being described speaks of the spirit received, which is not a spirit of bondage, as it was in the Old Testament. Rather, it refers to the condition before belief, living in legal bondage and constant fear of unpardoned sin. The cry mentioned signifies the joint cry of both Jewish and Gentile believers, expressing the spontaneous, strong, and exuberant emotions that arise from the operations of the Holy Spirit, leading the soul from bondage to sin, the world, and Satan to freedom in Christ.
