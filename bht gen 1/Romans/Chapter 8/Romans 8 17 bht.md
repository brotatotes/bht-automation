# Romans 8:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, we are reminded of our status as heirs of God's kingdom, a remarkable inheritance that awaits us. Just as Jesus is the firstborn among many brethren and the heir of all things, we too are joint-heirs with Christ. It is important to understand that our participation in His glory requires conformity to Christ in suffering. The sufferings we endure are not in vain, but rather serve to prepare us for the glory that is to come.
