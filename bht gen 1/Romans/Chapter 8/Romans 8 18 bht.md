# Romans 8:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the sufferings that we experience in the present time are portrayed as insignificant compared to the glory that will be revealed in the future. These sufferings, though they may seem great, cannot be compared to the future happiness and radiance that await us. The sufferings of our present life are outweighed by the promise of incomparable glory which will be revealed in us.
