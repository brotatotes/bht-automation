# Romans 8:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
No matter the sufferings we face in the present time, they cannot compare to the glorious future that awaits us in Christ. Our temporary suffering is insignificant when compared to the eternal glory that will be revealed in us. Embracing suffering is a necessary part of our journey, as it is through suffering that we can partake in Christ's glory. The present sufferings we endure will be eclipsed by the radiance of the future glory that awaits us.
