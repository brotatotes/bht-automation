### John Gill:
1. "The creature" in this verse refers to the Gentile world, specifically the nations of the world in distinction to the Jews. This understanding is supported by references in Jewish writings where "the creatures" are used to refer to the Gentiles, distinguishing them from the Israelites.

2. The manifestation of the sons of God is made first at their conversion, where they are adopted into God's family. This manifestation is in some measure made known to themselves and others. This can be particularly applied to the Gentiles, who were not previously recognized as the children of God by the Jews, but were manifested as such through the power of the Gospel.

3. The full manifestation of the sons of God will occur at Christ's second coming, where they will be openly acknowledged as God's children before angels and men. They will receive their inheritance and have the honor and dignity of their character actually conferred upon them. This ultimate glory is eagerly awaited by the Gentiles and all the sons of God.
