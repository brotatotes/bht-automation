# Romans 8:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this profound and illuminating passage, the apostle passionately describes the future glory of the saints and the longing of the entire creation for its revelation. This expectation is not one of anxiety, but rather a persistent and lively hope, a vehement longing for redemption. The concept of creation here encompassing both rational and irrational beings highlights the universal need for redemption, to which even upright heathens are not excluded. The glorious manifestation of the saints' glory brings refreshment and a lasting transformation to all who have suffered through sin.
