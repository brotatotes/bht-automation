# Romans 8:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The law of the Spirit of life, also known as the gospel, has freed believers from the law of sin and death associated with the Mosaic dispensation. This liberation is accomplished through the Holy Spirit's power and efficacy, received from Christ as the head and mediator, allowing individuals to live a new life in Christ. The law of the Spirit, which grants life and works life in believers, replaces the old principle of sin that held humanity captive and led to spiritual and eternal death.

2. "The law of sin and death may intend the law of Moses, called 'the law of sin'; not as if it was sinful, or commanded or encouraged sin, for it severely prohibits it; but because by it, through the corruption of man's nature, sin is irritated, and made to abound; it is the strength of sin, and by it is the knowledge of it."
3. "The life which the Spirit is the author and giver of, is in Christ as the head of his people, the proper repository of all grace, and the fountain of life; the Spirit himself is in him, both as God and as man, and as Mediator, hence the saints receive him and his gifts and graces from him; and the law of the Spirit, or his power and efficacy in working, is 'in' or 'by' Christ, through his sufferings and death, and in consequence of his mediation."
