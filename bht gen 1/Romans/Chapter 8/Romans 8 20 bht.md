# Romans 8:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Bible verse being described is about the creation being subjected to vanity. It highlights the current state of the creation, which is characterized by decay, emptiness, and a departure from its original design. This state was not willingly chosen, but rather imposed due to the effects of sin and the divine order. However, despite this subjection, there is a sense of hope and anticipation, as the creation holds onto the promise of being delivered from corruption and restored to its intended glory.

2. "But on account of him, etc. He sets before us an example of obedience in all created things, and adds, that it springs from hope; for hence comes the alacrity of the sun and moon, and of all the stars in their constant courses, hence is the sedulity of the earth’s obedience in bringing forth fruits, hence is the unwearied motion of the air, hence is the prompt tendency to flow in water." 
3. "How much soever then created things do naturally incline another way; yet as it has pleased God to bring them under vanity, they obey his order; and as he has given them a hope of a better condition, with this they sustain themselves, deferring their desire, until the incorruption promised to them shall be revealed."
