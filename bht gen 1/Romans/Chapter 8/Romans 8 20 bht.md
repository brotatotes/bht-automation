# Romans 8:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
From the quotes by various commentators, we gather a deeper understanding of the unspoken Bible verse. It speaks of how creation, including the minds of the Gentiles, fell away from its original design and became subject to vanity, emptiness, and corruption. This was not a voluntary submission, but rather it resulted from man's sin and God's just decree. Despite this subjection, there remains a glimmer of hope, as God, who subjected creation to this state, holds the promise of restoration and renewal.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "The creature—'the creation.' was made subject to vanity, not willingly—that is, through no natural principle of decay."
2. "The apostle, personifying creation, represents it as only submitting to the vanity with which it was smitten, on man's account, in obedience to that superior power which had mysteriously linked its destinies with man's."
3. "But by reason of him who hath subjected the same —'who subjected it.' in hope—or 'in hope that.'"

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Vain is also used to render kenov (1 Corinthians 14:14, 1 Corinthians 14:58; Ephesians 5:6; James 2:20). Kenov signifies empty; mataiov idle, resultless."
2. "Kenov, used of persons, implies not merely the absence of good, but the presence of evil."
3. "All which has not God for the true end of its being is mataiov."

Note: The commentary provides a deeper understanding of the term "vain" in the Bible, explaining its usage and implications. It also highlights the significance of having God as the true purpose in life.

### John Calvin:
1. "He shows the object of expectation from what is of an opposite character; for as creatures, being now subject to corruption, cannot be restored until the sons of God shall be wholly restore; hence they, longing for their renewal, look forward to the manifestation of the celestial kingdom."
2. "He introduces all parts of the world, by a sort of personification, as being endued with reason; and he does this in order to shame our stupidity, when the uncertain fluctuation of this world, which we see, does not raise our minds to higher things."
3. "God has given to everything its charge; and he has not only by a distinct order commanded what he would to be done, but also implanted inwardly the hope of renovation."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The creation fell away from its original design; it is probable that thus its development was checked, and it became a prey to corruption."
2. "The subjection to vanity was...by reason of him who subjected it. The reference is to God, not to Adam."
3. "Resting on hope. This is to be joined with 'was made subject,' rather than with 'subjected it.'"

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "It was due to the effect of man's sin." 
2. "Because of God." 
3. "Hοτ can be causal 'because' instead of declarative 'that'."

### John Gill:
1. "This designs the vanity and emptiness of the minds of the Gentiles, who were without God and Christ, and the Holy Spirit, without the law and Gospel, and grace of God."
2. "They willingly went into idolatrous and other evil practices, but the devil made them subject, or slaves unto them."
3. "He led them captive at his will, and powerfully worked in them, by divine permission, so that they became vassals to him, and to their lusts."

### John Wesley:
1. "The creation was made subject to vanity — Abuse, misery, and corruption." 
2. "By him who subjected it — Namely, God, Genesis 3:17; 5:29." 
3. "Adam only made it liable to the sentence which God pronounced; yet not without hope."
