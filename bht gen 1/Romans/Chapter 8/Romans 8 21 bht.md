# Romans 8:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Bible verse describes the hopeful anticipation of creation to be delivered from its present state of decay and corruption. The suffering and longing of nature are not in vain, but serve a purpose in the plan of redemption. This future deliverance will bring about a glorious freedom, not only for humanity but also for the creation itself. The connection between mankind's fall and the bondage experienced by the created world is evident, yet there is a sense of hope that one day the entire creation will experience the glorious liberty it was meant to enjoy in its original state.
