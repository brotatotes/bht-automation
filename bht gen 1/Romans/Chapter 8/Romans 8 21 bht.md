# Romans 8:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Bible verse depicts a future deliverance that the creation eagerly awaits. Despite the suffering and corruption it currently endures, there is a hope for liberation into a glorious liberty. The creation senses the unmerited suffering it undergoes and possesses a presentiment of its future deliverance. This hope lies in the anticipation of being set free from its suffering and being transferred into a better condition. This deliverance, though not shared exactly in the same glory as the sons of God, promises a freedom from the prison of the flesh and a full experience of God's presence.
