### Albert Barnes:
1. "The whole creation is in just this condition; and we are not to be surprised, therefore, if it is the condition of the believer. It is a part of the universal system of things; it accords with everything we see; and we are not to be surprised that the church exists on the same principle of administration; in a state of bondage, imperfection, sorrow, and sighing for deliverance."

2. "All is united in a condition of sorrow. The expression denotes mutual and universal grief. It is one wide and loud lamentation, in which a dying world unites; and in which it has united 'until now.'"

3. "It has been the characteristic of every age. It is remarkable that the apostle does not here say of 'the whole creation,' that it had any hope of deliverance; an additional consideration that shows that the interpretation above suggested is correct."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The simple verb wjdinw to travail, occurs Galatians 4:19, Galatians 4:27; Revelation 12:2; and the kindred noun wjdin birth - pang, in Matthew and Mark, Acts, and 1 Thessalonians 5:3."

### John Calvin:
1. "He repeats the same sentiment, that he might pass over to us, though what is now said has the effect and the form of a conclusion; for as creatures are subject to corruption, not through their natural desire, but through the appointment of God, and then, as they have a hope of being hereafter freed from corruption, it hence follows, that they groan like a woman in travail until they shall be delivered."

2. "The meaning is, that creatures are not content in their present state, and yet that they are not so distressed that they pine away without a prospect of a remedy, but that they are as it were in travail; for a restoration to a better state awaits them."

3. "By saying that they groan together, he does not mean that they are united together by mutual anxiety, but he joins them as companions to us. The particle hitherto, or, to this day, serves to alleviate the weariness of daily languor; for if creatures have continued for so many ages in their groaning, how inexcusable will our softness or sloth be if we faint during the short course of a shadowy life."
