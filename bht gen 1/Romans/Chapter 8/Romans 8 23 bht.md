# Romans 8:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, commentators describe the profound impact of the Spirit on believers, as they become partakers of heavenly blessings and eagerly await the complete fulfillment of their salvation. Christians, although already experiencing the indwelling of the Spirit, still long for full adoption into God's family, groaning under the burden of sin and the transient nature of worldly pursuits. This groaning, fueled by their desire for personal growth and the conversion of others, reflects the tension between their present reality and the future redemption of their bodies in resurrection or in the spiritual body of the church.

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "the Spirit as the first-fruits" of our full redemption, molding the heart to a heavenly frame and attempering it to its future element.
2. "even we ourselves" - though we have so much of heaven already within us.
3. "groan within ourselves" - under this "body of sin and death," and under the manifold "vanity and vexation of spirit" that are written upon every object and every pursuit and every enjoyment under the sun.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Even Christians who are highly privileged unite with creation in its groaning."
2. "Though we have the first-fruits of the Spirit, our salvation is incomplete; the groaning is internal and intense."
3. "The redemption is not complete until the body is redeemed: then we shall have the full blessing of adoption."

### John Gill:
1. "The grace of God communicated to them in conversion, which they received as the firstfruits, with respect to an after increase; or in regard to glory, like the firstfruits, grace is of the same kind with glory, and is a pledge and earnest of it."
2. "Their groans were inward from their hearts, not hypocritical or were among themselves, common to them all; and that not merely on their own account, but also for the conversion of the Gentiles, for which they incessantly laboured, and prayed night and day."
3. "By 'the redemption of our body' is not meant the redemption of God's elect, body and soul, by the blood and death of Christ, which was already finished; but it designs either the redemption of the natural body, by the resurrection from the dead; or else the redemption of the mystical body the church, of which the Gentiles make a considerable part."

### John Wesley:
1. "The Spirit, who is the first-fruits of our inheritance."
2. "The sons of God shall be publicly owned by him in the great assembly of men and angels."
