# Romans 8:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This verse speaks about the indwelling and influence of the Holy Spirit as a guarantee of our complete possession by Him, being the firstfruit of our redemption. It highlights the yearning for deliverance and the groaning within ourselves due to the present struggles, while patiently waiting for our ultimate transformation. Our longing for the redemption of both soul and body is fueled by our understanding of the grace as a pledge of future glory, as well as our desire to be publicly acknowledged by God in His glorious assembly.

For the price of our redemption was in such a way paid by Christ, that death should notwithstanding hold us tied by its chains, yea, that we should carry it within us; it hence follows, that the sacrifice of the death of Christ would be in vain and fruitless, except its fruit appeared in our heavenly renovation."

3. "By 'the redemption of our body' is not meant the redemption of God's elect, body and soul, by the blood and death of Christ, which was already finished; but it designs either the redemption of the natural body, by the resurrection from the dead, or the redemption of the mystical body the church."
