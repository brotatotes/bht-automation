# Romans 8:26 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Holy Spirit, like a compassionate helper, joins us in our weaknesses and offers intercession. We are prone to limited understanding, feeble desires, and weak prayers. However, the Spirit transcends these limitations, groaning and interceding on our behalf, aligning our hearts and prayers with the perfect will of God. His presence strengthens us and bridges the gap between our human frailty and divine communion.
