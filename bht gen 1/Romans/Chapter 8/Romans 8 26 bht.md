# Romans 8:26 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Holy Spirit comes alongside believers, providing help and support in their weaknesses and limitations. Our understanding, desires, and prayers are all weak, but the Spirit intercedes for us, forming groanings and intercessions that go beyond what we can express ourselves. The Spirit works within us, aiding our infirmities and strengthening our spiritual journey.
