## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The assurance which we have that God the Heart-Searcher interprets the inarticulate sighings of the Spirit in us, is, not strictly speaking, His Omniscience, but the fact that the very Spirit who thus pleads, does it κατὰ θεόν, in pursuance of the divine purposes and in conformity with God’s good pleasure."
2. "All these pleadings of the Spirit are heard and answered, even when inarticulately uttered."
3. "We may extend the same comforting assurance to the imperfect and mistaken verbal utterances of our prayers, which are not themselves answered to our hurt, but the answer is given to the voice of the Spirit which speaks through them, which we would express, but cannot."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "He that searcheth the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the Spirit, because he—the Spirit maketh intercession for the saints according to the will of God." 
2. "It cannot but swell the heart of every intelligent Christian to think that if external nature has been mysteriously affected for evil by the fall of man, it only awaits his completed recovery, at the resurrection, to experience a corresponding emancipation from its blighted condition into undecaying life and unfading beauty." 
3. "If when 'my Beloved stands behind our wall, looking forth at the windows, showing Himself through the lattice'—that thin veil which parts the seen from the unseen—if He is even thus to me 'Fairer than the children of men,' what shall He be when He stands confessed before my undazzled vision, the Only-begotten of the Father in my own nature, and I shall be like Him, for I shall see Him as He is?"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "To search the heart is one of his attributes which cannot be communicated to a creature." 
2. "He does not need that those deep emotions should be expressed in words; he sees the anxious feelings of the soul, and is ready to aid and to bless."
3. "That man is most safe who yields himself most entirely to the influence of the Holy Spirit."

### John Calvin:
1. "This is a remarkable reason for strengthening our confidence, that we are heard by God when we pray through his Spirit, for he thoroughly knows our desires, even as the thoughts of his own Spirit."
2. "God regards not these emotions of the Spirit as new and strange, or that he rejects them as unreasonable, but that he allows them, and at the same time kindly accepts them, as allowed and approved by him."
3. "The reason also is immediately added, because he thus conforms us to his own will. It hence follows, that in vain can never be what is agreeable to his will, by which all things are ruled."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Though the groanings are unutterable, God understands their meaning."
2. "The mind of the Spirit... may be but partially recognized by us in our weakness."
3. "What we cannot utter, because we do not know what to pray for as we ought, what the indwelling Spirit in its pleadings cannot articulately utter through us, is known to God, because in accordance with His will."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "The Holy Spirit is the 'other Paraclete' who pleads God's cause with us as Christ is our Paraclete with the Father."
2. "The Holy Spirit interprets our prayers to God and 'makes intercession for us in accord with God's will.'"
3. "According to the will of God."

### John Gill:
1. "This is peculiar to God, and a 'periphrasis' of him; angels, neither good nor bad, can search into the hearts of men; one man cannot know the heart of another, nor any man fully know his own; this is the prerogative of God." 
2. "The searcher of hearts knows this, not barely by his omniscience, but he regards it, approves of it, attends, and gives an answer to it; which is no small encouragement to pray, though it be but with sighs and groans unutterable; since the omniscient God understands, and respects such kind of prayer." 
3. "Since it is the Holy Spirit that makes intercession, and the persons are holy for whom he makes it, and this is made for holy things, and all according to the will of God, which the Spirit of God must fully know, saints may be confident of the prevalence and success of such intercession."

### John Wesley:
1. "He who searcheth the hearts...knoweth" - The commentary highlights that God, who searches the hearts, has a deep understanding that surpasses human comprehension. This emphasizes the divine knowledge and insight that God possesses.

2. "What is the mind of the Spirit, for he maketh intercession for the saints" - The commentary points out that the Holy Spirit intercedes on behalf of believers, advocating for them and aligning their prayers with God's will. This highlights the role of the Spirit in guiding and supporting believers in their relationship with God.

3. "According to God...acceptable to him" - The commentary emphasizes the importance of aligning our prayers and desires with God's will. It reminds us that our prayers should be in accordance with God's purposes and pleasing to Him, rather than driven by our own selfish desires. This highlights the need for humility and surrender in our prayers.
