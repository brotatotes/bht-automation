# Romans 8:27 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse speaks of the profound understanding of God, who searches our hearts and knows the intentions of the Spirit as it intercedes for us. When we are unable to articulate our prayers, He comprehends the unspoken groanings of our souls. It is a reminder that our prayers are not in vain, for the Spirit aligns our hearts with God's will and pleads on our behalf.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "He that searcheth the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the Spirit, because he—the Spirit maketh intercession for the saints according to the will of God." 
2. "It cannot but swell the heart of every intelligent Christian to think that if external nature has been mysteriously affected for evil by the fall of man, it only awaits his completed recovery, at the resurrection, to experience a corresponding emancipation from its blighted condition into undecaying life and unfading beauty." 
3. "If when 'my Beloved stands behind our wall, looking forth at the windows, showing Himself through the lattice' (Romans 8:18- :) —that thin veil which parts the seen from the unseen—if He is even thus to me 'Fairer than the children of men,' what shall He be when He stands confessed before my undazzled vision, the Only-begotten of the Father in my own nature, and I shall be like Him, for I shall see Him as He is?"

### John Calvin:
1. "This is a remarkable reason for strengthening our confidence, that we are heard by God when we pray through his Spirit, for he thoroughly knows our desires, even as the thoughts of his own Spirit."
2. "God regards not these emotions of the Spirit as new and strange, or that he rejects them as unreasonable, but that he allows them, and at the same time kindly accepts them, as allowed and approved by him."
3. "The reason also is immediately added, because he thus conforms us to his own will. It hence follows, that in vain can never be what is agreeable to his will, by which all things are ruled."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Though the groanings are unutterable, God understands their meaning."
2. "The mind of the Spirit...may be but partially recognized by us in our weakness."
3. "What we cannot utter, because we do not know what to pray for as we ought, what the indwelling Spirit in its pleadings cannot articulately utter through us, is known to God, because in accordance with His will."

### John Wesley:
1. "He who searcheth the hearts... knoweth... what is the mind of the Spirit." 
2. "The Spirit dwells and intercedes... making intercession for the saints." 
3. "According to God... according to his will, as is worthy of God and acceptable to him."
