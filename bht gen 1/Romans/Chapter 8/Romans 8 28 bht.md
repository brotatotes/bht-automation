# Romans 8:28 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we are reminded that all things, whether favorable or difficult, in life are interwoven by God to ultimately bring about good, specifically for those who have been called according to His purpose. Our limited knowledge may prevent us from always knowing what to pray for, but we can take comfort in the understanding that God orchestrates all circumstances, allowing them to work harmoniously for our spiritual and eternal welfare. It is through His gracious design that He works to save a broken world through the sacrifice of His Son.

1. "We know that to them that love God all things work together for good [even] to them who are called according to His (eternal) purpose." 
2. "This working of all things for good is done quite naturally to 'them that love God,' because such souls, persuaded that He who gave His own Son for them cannot but mean them well in all His procedure, learn thus to take in good part whatever He sends them, however trying to flesh and blood."
3. "And knowing that it is in pursuance of an eternal 'purpose' of love that they have been 'called into the fellowship of His Son Jesus Christ,' they naturally say within themselves, 'It cannot be that He should suffer that purpose to be thwarted by anything really adverse to us, or that He should not make all things, dark as well as light, crooked as well as straight, to co-operate to the furtherance and final completion of His high design.'"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "All things - All our afflictions and trials; all the persecutions and calamities to which we are exposed. Though they are numerous and long-continued yet they are among the means that are appointed for our welfare."
2. "They take off our affections from this world; they teach us the truth about our frail, transitory, and lying condition; they lead us to look to God for support, and to heaven for a final home; and they produce a subdued spirit, a humble temper, a patient, tender, and kind disposition."
3. "The Christian is made a better man by receiving afflictions as they should be received, and by desiring that they should accomplish the purpose for which they are sent; the sinner is made more hardened by resisting them, and refusing to submit to their obvious intention and design."

2. "Spiritual good lies in a lively exercise of grace and a conformity of the soul to God; and is what the men of the world least regard, and the saints most; and sometimes afflictions issue in this sort of good."
3. "All evils or afflictions, spiritual and temporal, work together for good; all spiritual ones, such as the temptations of Satan, which are made useful for humiliation, for the trial of grace, to show us our weakness, our need of Christ, and to conform us to him, and also to excite to prayer and watchfulness; the hidings of God's face, which make his presence the more prized when enjoyed, and the more desirable."

### John Wesley:
1. "And we know — This in general; though we do not always know particularly what to pray for."
