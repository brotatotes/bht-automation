# Romans 8:28 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Bible verse, as described by commentators, speaks to the assurance and comfort that comes with the knowledge that all things, even afflictive ones, work together in cooperation to produce a result that is for the spiritual and eternal good of those who love God. This understanding is rooted in the belief that God has a purpose, a gracious design of salvation, and that He intends well for His people in all circumstances, even when they may not know specifically what to pray for.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "We know that to them that love God all things work together for good." 
2. "Such souls, persuaded that He who gave His own Son for them cannot but mean them well in all His procedure, learn thus to take in good part whatever He sends them, however trying to flesh and blood."
3. "Knowing that it is in pursuance of an eternal 'purpose' of love that they have been 'called into the fellowship of His Son Jesus Christ,' they naturally say within themselves, 'It cannot be that He should suffer that purpose to be thwarted by anything really adverse to us.'"

### Philip Schaff:
1. "All things. All events, even afflictive ones (Romans 8:35), indeed all created things (Romans 8:38-39)."
2. "Work together. The usual sense: cooperate, combine to produce the result, is preferable."
3. "According to his purpose. The call is in accordance with the purpose (comp. Romans 8:29-30); the former becomes a fact we can perceive, the latter we cannot perceive, but receive as a fact, for all things cannot work together for good to them that love God unless God has a purpose, with which what occurs accords."

### John Wesley:
1. "And we know — This in general; though we do not always know particularly what to pray for." 
2. "Work together for good — Strongly and sweetly for spiritual and eternal good."
