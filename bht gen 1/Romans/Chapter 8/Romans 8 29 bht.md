# Romans 8:29 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse being described conveys the concept of God's foreknowledge and predestination. The commentators stress that God's foreknowledge is not merely about knowing future events, but about His certain knowledge and gracious favor towards His people. They highlight that God's predestination is based on His fixed purpose to save and call His chosen ones. The commentators also emphasize that the ultimate goal of predestination is for believers to be conformed to the image of Christ. This conformity serves as the distinguishing mark of those who are known by God and will be glorified in the future.
