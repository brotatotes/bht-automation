# Romans 8:29 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse without referral to a specific verse: Commentators emphasize that God's foreknowledge plays a crucial role in predestination and election. Believers are called to be conformed to the image of God's Son, which serves as a distinguishing mark of those who will be glorified. This conformity reflects the transformation and likeness to Christ that believers are called to strive for and is a clear indication of those who are foreknown by God and will ultimately be glorified. Through God's foreknowledge, believers are chosen and destined for a glorious future.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Those who He foreknew would repent and believe," say Pelagians of every age and every hue. But this is to thrust into the text what is contrary to the whole spirit, and even letter, of the apostle's teaching."
2. "God's 'knowledge' of His people cannot be restricted to a mere foresight of future events, or acquaintance with what is passing here below."
3. "Probably God's foreknowledge of His own people means His 'peculiar, gracious, complacency in them,' while His 'predestinating' or 'foreordaining' them signifies His fixed purpose, flowing from this, to 'save them and call them with an holy calling'."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The whole matter is stated as presenting the objective ground of confidence of believers."
2. "God knew beforehand certain individuals of our race, and those He destined beforehand, etc."
3. "The purpose of grace began in Him, even as His glory is its end."

### John Gill:
1. "The foreknowledge of God here...is the foundation of their predestination and election, of their conformity to Christ, of their calling, justification, and glorification."

2. "This designs either likeness to Christ as the Son of God, or conformity to him in his human nature...in holiness; the image of God was in his first creation, this is defaced by sin; and in regeneration, the image of Christ is stamped."

3. "The persons among whom Christ is the firstborn are described by their relation, 'brethren'; to one another, being related to the same Father, regenerated by the same grace, taken into the same family, and heirs of the same glory."

These quotes emphasize the significance of God's foreknowledge in predestination and election, the transformation of believers into the likeness of Christ, and the familial relationship between Christ and believers as brothers and sisters.
