# Romans 8:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse being described is a powerful declaration about the inability of the law to free humanity from sin and the remarkable work that God accomplished through sending His own Son. The law, though holy in itself, lacked the power to secure righteousness and conquer our sinful nature. In contrast, God condemned sin through the incarnation of His Son in human flesh, and through His death and resurrection, sin itself was brought to condemnation. This sending of the Son unveiled the reality of His true human nature and marked the beginning of deliverance from sin for believers.
