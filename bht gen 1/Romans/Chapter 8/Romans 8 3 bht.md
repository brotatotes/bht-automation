# Romans 8:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The commentators highlight the limitations of the law in overcoming sin. They emphasize that the law, while unable to secure its own fulfillment, was powerless to conquer our sinful nature. To accomplish what the law couldn't, God sent His Son, taking on the likeness of our sinful flesh to condemn and destroy the sin that resides within us. Through His sacrifice and resurrection, believers are set free from the power of sin and given the opportunity for complete deliverance.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "The law could irritate our sinful nature into more virulent action, but it could not secure its own fulfillment."
2. "God took the method of sending His own Son for attaining the fulfillment of the law."
3. "He was made in the reality of our flesh, but only in the likeness of its sinful condition. He took our nature as it is in us, compassed with infirmities, with nothing to distinguish Him as man from sinful men, save that He was without sin."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "For what the law could not do; lit, 'the impossible (thing) of the law.' The Mosaic law is certainly meant. What was impossible for the law to do, God did, i.e., condemned sin, etc."
2. "God sending his own Son. It was by sending Him, that He accomplished what was impossible for the law. 'His own Son,' preexisting before He was sent, and that too as Son, in a specific sense."
3. "Condemned sin in the flesh. This was what the law could not do. 'Sin' has the article in the original, pointing to the 'sin' on account of which the Law of God was sent into the world. 'In the flesh' is to be joined with 'condemned,' referring to the human nature which Christ has in common with us."

### John Wesley:
1. "The law of Moses was unable to conquer our evil nature, as it was weak through the flesh. God had to send his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh to condemn and destroy the sin that was in our flesh." 

2. "By sending his Son in the likeness of our sinful flesh, God gave the sentence that sin should be destroyed and believers should be wholly delivered from it." 

3. "The law, with its limitations, could not accomplish what God's Son accomplished. Through his death and resurrection, believers are set free from the power of sin and given the opportunity for complete deliverance."
