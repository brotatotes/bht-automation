# Romans 8:30 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This Bible verse describes the remarkable process of salvation and the unbreakable chain of divine grace that leads to eternal glory. From predestination to glorification, each step is securely intertwined through the work of God's grace. The call, effectually and savingly, sets in motion God's purpose, leading to justification and ultimately to the future fulfillment of glorification. This process is already viewed as complete, highlighting the certainty and necessity of the believers' already accomplished salvation. It is a journey of faith, encompassing forgiveness, acceptance, and an earnest taste of the eternal glory yet to come.

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "In 'predestinating us to be conformed to the image of His Son' in final glory, He settled all the successive steps of it."
2. "The word 'called'... always means 'internally, effectually, savingly called.' It denotes the first great step in personal salvation and answers to 'conversion.'"
3. "And all this is viewed as past; because, starting from the past decree of 'predestination to be conformed to the image of God's Son' of which the other steps are but the successive unfoldings—all is beheld as one entire, eternally completed salvation."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The call is effectual, is inseparably linked with predestination and justification in the unfolding of God's gracious purpose."
2. "Only those who believe are justified, but as throughout the subjective side is not presented."
3. "Moreover, the past tense is chosen to present the matter as necessary and certain, so much so that it can be spoken of as already accomplished."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Called, justified, glorified - these three verbs summarize the entire process of salvation." 
2. "The use of aorist indicatives emphasizes the decisive and completed nature of each step in God's plan of redemption." 
3. "While glorification is described as already accomplished, it is important to note that it is still a future event in its fullest sense."

### John Gill:
1. "This predestination is of particular persons, who, in consequence of it, are called, justified, and glorified; it is the effect of divine grace, and entirely owing to it; it is the source of all the other blessings of grace, and is therefore placed at the head of them, and secures them all." 

2. "Their call is of grace, by special grace, to peculiar blessings of grace, and to a kingdom and glory; and this their calling is secured by predestination, and connected with glorification." 

3. "But eternal glory is here meant, which is what the apostle had been speaking of in the context; is what the elect are predestinated and called unto; and which their justification gives them a right and title to; and will consist in a likeness to Christ, in communion with him, in an everlasting vision of him, and in a freedom from all that is evil, and in an enjoyment of all that is good."

### John Wesley:
1. "He also justified - Forgave and accepted."
2. "He does not deny that a believer may fall away and be cut off between his special calling and his glorification."
3. "Indeed grace, as it is glory begun, is both an earnest and a foretaste of eternal glory."
