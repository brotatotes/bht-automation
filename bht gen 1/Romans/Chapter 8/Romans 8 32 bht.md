## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "His own Son, the only one of God's sons who is One with Him in nature and essence, begotten of Him before all worlds."
2. "Delivered Him up on behalf of us all, so that every one of us believers, even the most afflicted, has an equal part in Him."
3. "How shall He not also with Him give freely to us all things, all that we need or hope for; or even more largely, all created things for ours, to subserve our good, and work together for us."

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "In 'not sparing His own Son, but delivering Him up,' or surrendering Him, God exercised, in His Paternal character, a mysterious act of Self-sacrifice, which, though involving none of the pain and none of the loss which are inseparable from the very idea of self-sacrifice on our part, was not less real, but, on the contrary, as far transcended any such acts of ours as His nature is above the creature's."
2. "Understand Christ's Sonship thus, and the language of Scripture regarding it is intelligible and harmonious; but take it to be an artificial relationship, ascribed to Him in virtue either of His miraculous birth, or His resurrection from the dead, or the grandeur of His works, or all of these together—and the passages which speak of it neither explain of themselves nor harmonize with each other."
3. "How can we conceive that He should not [freely give us all things]? All other gifts being not only immeasurably less than this Gift of gifts, but virtually included in it."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "His own Son - Who thus gave the highest proof of love that a father could give, and the highest demonstration of his willingness to do good to those for whom he gave him."
2. "For them he endured as severe pangs, and expressed as much love, as for the rich and the great that shall be redeemed."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Spared [ÎµÏ†ÎµÎ¹ÏƒÎ±Ï„Î¿] . Mostly in Paul. Elsewhere only Acts 20:29; 2 Peter 2:4, 2 Peter 2:5. Compare Genesis 22:16, which Paul may have had in mind."
