# Romans 8:32 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the commentator highlights the incredible love and sacrifice of God in not sparing His own Son. The verse assures believers that if God did not hold back the most precious gift, He will surely provide everything else needed. Through delivering His Son, believers are freed from any accusation or condemnation, and every gift that follows, including justification, is freely given as well.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "His own Son, the only one of God’s sons who is One with Him in nature and essence, begotten of Him before all worlds."
2. "Delivered Him up on behalf of us all, so that every one of us believers, even the most afflicted, has an equal part in Him."
3. "How can it be that He will not also give freely to us all things, all that we need or hope for; or even more largely, all created things for ours, to subserve our good, and work together for us."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "In 'not sparing His own Son, but delivering Him up,' or surrendering Him, God exercised, in His Paternal character, a mysterious act of Self-sacrifice, which, though involving none of the pain and none of the loss which are inseparable from the very idea of self-sacrifice on our part, was not less real, but, on the contrary, as far transcended any such acts of ours as His nature is above the creature's."
2. "Understand Christ's Sonship thus, and the language of Scripture regarding it is intelligible and harmonious; but take it to be an artificial relationship, ascribed to Him in virtue either of His miraculous birth, or His resurrection from the dead, or the grandeur of His works, or all of these together—and the passages which speak of it neither explain of themselves nor harmonize with each other."
3. "How can we conceive that He should not [freely give us all things]? All other gifts being not only immeasurably less than this Gift of gifts, but virtually included in it."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "His own Son - Who thus gave the highest proof of love that a father could give, and the highest demonstration of his willingness to do good to those for whom he gave him."
2. "For us all - For all Christians. The connection requires that this expression should be understood here with this limitation."
3. "How shall he not - His giving his Son is a proof that he will give to us all things that we need. The argument is from the greater to the less."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Spared [εφεισατο]. Mostly in Paul. Elsewhere only Acts 20:29; 2 Peter 2:4, 2 Peter 2:5."
2. "His own [ιδιου]. See on Acts 1:7; 2 Peter 1:3, 2 Peter 1:20."
3. "Freely give. In contrast with spared."

### John Calvin:
1. "It greatly concerns us to be so thoroughly persuaded of the paternal love of God, as to be able to retain our rejoicing on its account."
2. "This passage ought to remind us of what Christ brings to us, and to awaken us to contemplate his riches; for as he is a pledge of God’s infinite love towards us, so he has not been sent to us void of blessings or empty, but filled with all celestial treasures."
3. "Christ himself, and everything that comes with or through him, is a favor freely bestowed, and not what we merit. This shuts out everything as meritorious on the part of man. All is grace."
