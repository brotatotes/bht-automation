# Romans 8:33 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we are reminded of the assurance and security that believers have in God's love. The term "the elect" is used to emphasize that believers are chosen by God for a special purpose. No accusation or charge brought against them can stand because it is God who justifies them. Satan may be the Accuser, but the Judge is God, who dismisses all charges. This assurance is not limited to a specific group but extends to all who have been chosen by God, both Jews and gentile Christians alike.
