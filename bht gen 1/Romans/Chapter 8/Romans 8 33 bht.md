# Romans 8:33 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the commentators emphasize the assurance and security of believers in God's election. The elect are a chosen group, dear to God, and justified by Him. No one can successfully bring a charge against them, as God is the one who justifies. The term "lay anything to the charge" refers to bringing forth accusations resulting in condemnation. Believers can take comfort in the fact that God, the righteous judge, pronounces them exempt from guilt. This verse encourages believers to trust in God's election and to find solace in the knowledge that they are chosen by Him.

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Who shall lay - to the charge. Only here by Paul. Frequent in Acts. See Rom 19:38, 40; Rom 23:28, 29; Rom 26:2, 7. Lit., 'to call something in one.' Hence call to account; bring a charge against."

### John Calvin:
1. "The first and the chief consolation of the godly in adversities, is to be fully persuaded of the paternal kindness of God; for hence arises the certainty of their salvation, and that calm quietness of the soul through which it comes that adversities are sweetened, or at least the bitterness of sorrow mitigated."
2. "Hardly then a more suitable encouragement to patience could be adduced than this, a conviction that God is propitious to us; and hence Paul makes this confidence the main ground of that consolation, by which it behoves the faithful to be strengthened against all evils."
3. "He then more emphatically concludes, that the children of God are not subject to an accusation, because God justifies, than if he had said that Christ is our advocate; for he more fully expresses that the way to a trial is more completely closed up when the judge himself pronounces him wholly exempt from guilt, whom the accuser would bring in as deserving of punishment."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The term used is a legal one, and suggests an accusation resulting in condemnation."

3. "But all these charges avail nothing, since none of the divine persons, Father, Son, and Spirit, lay anything against them: not God the Father, for it is God that justifieth; he against whom sin is committed, who is the lawgiver, and the righteous judge, justifies them from every charge."
