# Romans 8:34 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When contemplating the verse, we are reminded of the incomparable delight that Christ was again alive, ensuring the efficacy of His death on our behalf. Sitting at the right hand of God signifies the glory and power in His participation in governing the world. Christ's resurrection, ascension, and intercession serve as a greater security from condemnation, offering salvation, righteousness, and eternal love to God's elect. Our faith should extend beyond his death, embracing his resurrection, kingdom, and second coming, as he continually intercedes for us.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "not meaning that the resurrection of Christ was of more saving value than His death, but that having 'put away sin by the sacrifice of Himself'—which though precious to us was to Him of unmingled bitterness—it was incomparably more delightful to think that He was again alive, and living to see to the efficacy of His death in our behalf."
2. "Christ's sitting at the right hand of God...signifies the glory of the exalted Son of man, and the power in the government of the world in which He participates."
3. "His Session at God's right hand denotes His power to save us; His Intercession, His will to do it."
