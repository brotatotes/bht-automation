### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers." - This quote highlights the all-encompassing nature of the Apostle Paul's conviction, affirming that nothing, whether it be life or death, heavenly beings or earthly authorities, can separate believers from the love of God.

2. "The bad are not called 'angels,' or 'principalities,' or 'powers,' save with some addition to show that such are meant." - This quote clarifies that while the terms "angels," "principalities," and "powers" are typically associated with good beings, there may be some additional context or modification to indicate that the reference is to evil entities.

3. "No condition of the present life and none of the unknown possibilities of the life to come." - This quote emphasizes that the love of God is not limited by any circumstance or future event, whether it be the challenges and trials of the present life or the uncertainties of what lies ahead.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "In thus expressing his own triumphant conviction, the Apostle not only sums up what precedes, but goes further."
2. "Dying or living, we are the objects of this love."
3. "To refer the one term to the former, and the other to the latter, is both abrupt and arbitrary; to leave the evil spirits unnoticed in such a catalogue would seem strange- Hence, we may refer both terms to both classes, in the wide hypothesis the Apostle here conceives."

### John Gill:
1. "This persuasion not only regards himself, but others; and is not conjectural, but certain; and which did not arise from any special and extraordinary revelation, but is founded upon the nature of the love of God itself, the security of it in Christ, and of the persons of God's elect in him."
2. "The things enumerated, which are not able to separate from the love of God, are as follow: death; nor life; nor angels; nor principalities; nor powers; nor things present; nor things to come."
3. "God will never leave, nor forsake his people, or cause his loving kindness to depart from them, in whatsoever state or condition they may come into."

### John Wesley:
1. "Neither death - Terrible as it is to natural men; a violent death in particular." 
2. "Nor life - With all the affliction and distress it can bring, or a long, easy life; or all living men."
3. "Nor height, nor depth - The former sentence respected the differences of times; this, the differences of places."

These quotes highlight the commentary's emphasis on the all-encompassing nature of God's love and protection. It acknowledges the various challenges and threats that can come our way, but affirms that nothing can separate us from the love of God in Christ.
