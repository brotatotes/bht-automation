# Romans 8:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Those who are driven by their sinful desires solely focus on satisfying their own selfish desires, judging them to be good and setting their affections on them. However, those who are led by the Spirit prioritize heavenly things, relishing and loving what is invisible and eternal. Through mighty grace, these individuals are renewed in the spirit of their minds, guided by the revealed truths and promises of the Spirit.

"It is entirely owing to mighty grace, that any mind the things of the Spirit: but they that are after the Spirit; not such who follow the dictates of their own spirits; or are outwardly reformed; nor all that have spiritual gifts; or profess themselves to have the grace and Spirit of God; but such who are born again, are renewed in the spirit of their minds, in whom grace is the governing principle."
