# Romans 8:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Bible verse being described in these commentaries addresses the concept of enmity against God. It speaks of a state of hostility and opposition towards God, stemming from the fallen nature of humanity. This enmity is not a passive indifference but an active rejection of God's authority and truth. It leads to spiritual emptiness and separation from God. However, through the redemptive work of Jesus Christ, this enmity can be overcome, and reconciliation with God is made possible. This transformation requires humility, surrender, and a reliance on the power of the Holy Spirit.

### Philip Schaff:

2. "Enmity against God. This is equivalent to death."
3. "Paul declares that the cause of non-submission to the law of God, which is a proof of enmity to God, is the fact that the mind of the flesh has no ability to produce this submission, being essentially antagonism to God."

### John Wesley:
1. "Enmity against God" refers to a deep-seated hostility towards God and everything related to Him. It encompasses a denial of His existence, a rejection of His power, and a resistance to His providence. This enmity is rooted in the fallen nature of humanity and is manifested in various ways, such as atheism, idolatry, and rebellion against His moral laws.

2. This enmity is not merely a passive indifference towards God but an active opposition to His authority and sovereignty. It is a deliberate choice to distance oneself from God and to live in rebellion against His will. It is a rejection of the truth and a preference for darkness over light.

3. The enmity against God is ultimately self-destructive, as it separates us from the source of life and love. It leads to spiritual emptiness, moral decay, and eternal separation from God. However, through the redemptive work of Jesus Christ, this enmity can be overcome, and reconciliation with God is made possible.

4. Overcoming enmity against God requires a humble recognition of our own sinfulness and a willingness to submit to His authority. It involves a surrender of our own desires and a wholehearted acceptance of His truth and grace. Through the power of the Holy Spirit, we can be transformed from enemies of God into beloved children, experiencing the fullness of His love and purpose in our lives.
