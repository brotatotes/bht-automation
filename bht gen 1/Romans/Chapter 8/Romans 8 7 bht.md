# Romans 8:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The enmity against God refers to the deep-seated hostility and opposition that humans have towards Him. Rooted in the fallen nature of humanity, it is a rebellion against His authority and sovereignty driven by pride and self-centeredness. This enmity is not passive indifference, but an active defiance and deliberate choice to reject God. Overcoming it requires a transformation of the heart through the work of the Holy Spirit and a personal relationship with Jesus Christ, who offers forgiveness and reconciliation with God. In Christ, true peace and harmony can be found.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The mind of the flesh is enmity against God." This highlights the inherent opposition between the mindset driven by worldly desires and the will of God. 

2. "For it does not submit itself to the law of God." This emphasizes the rebellious nature of the fleshly mind, which refuses to align with God's commands and principles. 

3. "Neither can it." This phrase underscores the inability of the fleshly mind to conform to God's law, as demonstrated in the previous chapter.

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "The desire and pursuit of carnal ends is a state of enmity to God, wholly incompatible with true life and peace in the soul."
2. "In such a state of mind there neither is nor can be the least subjection to the law of God."
3. "Many things may be done which the law requires, but nothing either is or can be done because God's law requires it, or purely to please God."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The carnal mind...means that the minding of the things of the flesh, giving to them supreme attention, is hostility against God; and involves the sinner in a controversy with him, and hence, leads to death and woe."
2. "The minding of the things of the flesh also leads to the hatred of God himself, because he is opposed to it, and has expressed his abhorrence of it."
3. "The supreme regard to the flesh, the minding of that, is utterly irreconcilable with the Law of God. They are different things, and can never be made to harmonize; just as adultery cannot be chastity; falsehood cannot be truth; dishonesty cannot be honesty; hatred cannot be love."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Spirit is found contrasted with letter, Romans 2:29; Romans 7:6; 2 Corinthians 3:6."
2. "It is the common possession of the Church and its members; not an occasional gift, but an essential element and mark of the christian life."
3. "It leads believers: they serve in newness of the Spirit (Romans 7:6) They walk after the Spirit (Romans 8:4, Romans 8:5; Galatians 5:16-25)."

### John Calvin:
1. "Nothing proceeds from the efforts of our flesh but death, because it contends as an enemy against the will of God."
2. "The will of man is in all things opposed to the divine will; for, as much as what is crooked differs from what is straight, so much must be the difference between us and God."
3. "Let every one acknowledge himself to be the servant of sin, as he is in reality, that he may be made free, being set at liberty by the grace of Christ: to glory in any other liberty is the highest folly."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Proof that the mind of the flesh is death (Romans 8:6); in Romans 8:10-11, it is proved that the mind of the spirit is life and peace, though that is implied here."
2. "Enmity against God. This is equivalent to death."
3. "Paul declares that the cause of non-submission to the law of God, which is a proof of enmity to God, is the fact that the mind of the flesh has no ability to produce this submission, being essentially antagonism to God."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Present tense here means continued insubordination."
2. "This helpless state of the unregenerate man Paul has shown above apart from Christ."
3. "Hope lies in Christ and the Spirit of life."

### John Gill:
1. "The carnal mind, the wisdom of the flesh, is not only an enemy, but enmity itself against God: against his being; it reasons against it; it wishes he was not; it forms unworthy notions of him; thinks him such an one as itself; and endeavours to bury him in forgetfulness, and erase out of its mind all memorials of him."
2. "This enmity is universal, it is in all men in unregeneracy, either direct or indirect, hidden or more open; it is undeserved; it is natural and deeply rooted in the mind, and irreconcilable without the power and grace of God."
3. "The carnal mind is so far from an obedient subjection to the law, that it is far off from the law, and the law from that; it hates and despises it, thwarts and contradicts it in every instance, and, as much as in it lies, makes it void; which fully proves the enmity of the carnal mind against God."

### John Wesley:
1. "Enmity against God" refers to the deep-seated hostility and opposition that humans have towards God. It encompasses the denial of His existence, the rejection of His power, and the resistance to His providential care.

2. This enmity is rooted in the fallen nature of humanity, which rebels against the authority and sovereignty of God. It is a manifestation of our sinful inclinations and desires that seek to assert our own autonomy and control.

3. The enmity against God is not merely a passive indifference or ignorance, but an active rebellion and defiance. It is a deliberate choice to reject God and His truth, often driven by pride, self-centeredness, and a desire to pursue our own selfish desires.

4. Overcoming this enmity requires a transformation of the heart and mind through the work of the Holy Spirit. It involves a surrendering of our will to God, a recognition of our need for His grace and forgiveness, and a submission to His authority and lordship.

5. Ultimately, the enmity against God can only be fully overcome through a personal relationship with Jesus Christ. He is the bridge that reconciles us to God, offering forgiveness for our sins and restoring us to a right relationship with Him. In Christ, we can experience true peace, love, and harmony with God.
