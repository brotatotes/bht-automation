# Romans 8:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse being described emphasizes the importance of being under the government of the Holy Spirit. It highlights that those who do not have the Spirit of Christ dwelling and governing within them do not belong to Christ and are not in a state of salvation. Self-examination is encouraged as evidence of having the Spirit, which enables believers to live in alignment with God's will.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "To be 'in the spirit' means here to be under the dominion of our own renewed mind because the indwelling of God's Spirit is given as the evidence that we are 'in the spirit'." 
2. "It is as 'the Spirit of Christ' that the Holy Ghost takes possession of believers, introducing into them all the gracious, dove-like disposition which dwelt in Him." 
3. "Even though intellectually convinced of the truth of Christianity, and in a general sense influenced by its spirit, if any man's heart be void, not of such dispositions, but of the blessed Author of them, 'the Spirit of Christ,' he is none of his."

### John Calvin:
1. "By explaining what the Spirit of God works in the elect, and what fruit he brings forth, he encourages them to strive after newness of life."
2. "The surest mark by which the children of God are distinguished from the children of the world, when by the Spirit of God they are renewed unto purity and holiness."
3. "The reign of the Spirit is the abolition of the flesh. Those in whom the Spirit reigns not, belong not to Christ; then they are not Christians who serve the flesh."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "This conditional form is 'an indirect incitement to self-examination' (Meyer), and does not imply special doubt."
2. "The Spirit of God dwell in you...here as the indwelling power which enables them to live in this element."
3. "It means the Holy Spirit which belongs to, or proceeds from, Christ...those who have not this Spirit are 'none of Christ's.'"

These quotes highlight the importance of self-examination, the role of the Holy Spirit in enabling believers to live in God's element, and the significance of having the Spirit of Christ as evidence of belonging to Christ.

### John Wesley:
1. "In the Spirit — Under his government."
2. "If any man have not the Spirit of Christ — Dwelling and governing in him."
3. "He is none of his — He is not a member of Christ; not a Christian; not in a state of salvation."
