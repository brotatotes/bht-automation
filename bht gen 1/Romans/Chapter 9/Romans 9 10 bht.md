# Romans 9:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In exploring the concept of divine election, the commentator highlights the case of Rebecca and her two sons. Despite being twins and having the same parents, God made a distinction and chose one over the other. This selection was not based on their actions or merits, but rather on God's sovereign choice. The example of Jacob and Esau serves as a powerful illustration that God's blessing is not indiscriminately given to all descendants of Abraham and that it is solely a result of God's calling, not human works.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "But there could be no such reason in the case of Rebecca, Isaac's only wife for the choice of her son Jacob was the choice of one of two sons by the same mother and of the younger in preference to the elder, and before either of them was born, and consequently before either had done good or evil to be a ground of preference."
2. "And all to show that the sole ground of distinction lay in the unconditional choice of God."
3. "Not of works, but of Him that calleth."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The principle of making a distinction among the natural descendants of Abraham is settled by the promise."
2. "The selection was made not according to any natural principles, but according to God's good pleasure."
3. "The distinction was made before Jacob and Esau were born, proving that it was not based on their works."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Not only have we an example of the election of a son of Abraham by one woman, and a rejection of his son by another, but also of the election and rejection of the children of the same woman." 

2. "Though of one father, a different destiny was divinely appointed for each of the twins." 

3. "Hence only the divine disposal constitutes the true and valid succession, and not the bodily descent."

### John Calvin:
1. "The difference as to the possession of the promise may not only be seen in the children of Abraham, but that there is a much more evident example in Jacob and Esau: for in the former instance some might allege that their condition was unequal, the one being the son of an handmaid; but these were of the same mother, and were even twins: yet one was rejected, and the other was chosen by the Lord."
2. "It is hence clear, that the fulfilment of the promise does not take place in all the children of the flesh indiscriminately."
3. "And not only so, but Rebecca also received a message, when she conceived by the first, (i.e., son or seed,) even our father Isaac."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "These words introduce a second proof from history, namely, the case of Rebecca and her two sons, one of whom was chosen." 
2. "This case is not strictly of the same kind as that of Sarah, but furnishes a stronger proof." 
3. "The children were twins, having the same father and mother, and yet of such a different destiny."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Having conceived of one" - This phrase suggests that the woman had a marital relationship with only one husband, emphasizing the idea of faithfulness and commitment in marriage.
2. "Having a marriage bed from one" - This idiom highlights the unity and exclusivity of the marital relationship, emphasizing the importance of monogamy in the context of conception and childbirth.
3. "One father and twins" - This phrase underscores the miraculous nature of the conception, as twins are typically conceived by two different fathers. It highlights the extraordinary nature of God's intervention in the process of childbirth.

### John Gill:
1. "This instance of Ishmael and Isaac...proving that Abraham's natural seed, the children of the flesh, are not all children, the children of God."
2. "The apostle was aware, that the Jews would be ready to say, that the instance of Ishmael and Isaac was not a pertinent one...he proceeds to mention the case of Jacob and Esau."
3. "A difference was made between these two by God himself, and which was notified by him to the mother of them, before either were born."
