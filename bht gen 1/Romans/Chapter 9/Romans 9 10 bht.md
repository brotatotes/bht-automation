# Romans 9:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, a commentator explains that the choice made by God between the twin brothers Jacob and Esau was based on divine election, not on their own works or merits. The commentator emphasizes that this choice was made by God before they were even born, highlighting the sovereignty of God in determining who receives His blessings. It is through these examples, like the selection of Isaac over Ishmael and Jacob over Esau, that we see that God's blessings are not automatically given to all descendants of Abraham, but rather are based on His divine choice.

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "But there could be no such reason in the case of Rebecca, Isaac's only wife for the choice of her son Jacob was the choice of one of two sons by the same mother and of the younger in preference to the elder, and before either of them was born, and consequently before either had done good or evil to be a ground of preference."
2. "And all to show that the sole ground of distinction lay in the unconditional choice of God."
3. "Not of works, but of Him that calleth."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The principle of making a distinction among the natural descendants of Abraham is settled by the promise."
2. "The selection of Jacob over Esau was not according to any natural principles, but according to God's good pleasure."
3. "The distinction between Jacob and Esau was made before they were born, proving it was not based on their works."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Not only have we an example of the election of a son of Abraham by one woman, and a rejection of his son by another, but also of the election and rejection of the children of the same woman." 
2. "Though of one father, a different destiny was divinely appointed for each of the twins."
3. "Hence only the divine disposal constitutes the true and valid succession, and not the bodily descent."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "These words introduce a second proof from history, namely, the case of Rebecca and her two sons, one of whom was chosen." 
2. "But Rebecca also... furnishes a stronger proof." 
3. "Here the children were twins, having the same father and mother, and yet of such a different destiny."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "Having conceived of one" - This phrase suggests that the woman in question became pregnant with a child. It emphasizes the act of conception and the beginning of new life.

2. "Metonymy with cause for the effect" - This comment highlights the use of metonymy, where the word "bed" is used to represent the concept of marriage. It implies that the marriage bed is the cause or source of the effect, which is the conception of a child.

3. "One father and twins" - This statement indicates that despite the use of the term "one" in reference to the father, the result is the birth of twins. It emphasizes the miraculous nature of the situation, as twins typically have two different fathers.

### John Gill:
1. "This instance of Ishmael and Isaac... proving that Abraham's natural seed, the children of the flesh, are not all children, the children of God." 
2. "The apostle was aware, that the Jews would be ready to say, that the instance of Ishmael and Isaac was not a pertinent one... he proceeds to mention the case of Jacob and Esau, which was not liable to any such exception." 
3. "A difference was made between these two by God himself, and which was notified by him to the mother of them, before either were born."

### John Wesley:
1. "And that God's blessing does not belong to all the descendants of Abraham, appears not only by this instance, but by that of Esau and Jacob, who was chosen to inherit the blessing, before either of them had done good or evil."

2. "The apostle mentions this to show, that neither were their ancestors accepted through any merit of their own."

3. "Not of works â€” Not for any preceding merit in him he chose."
