# Romans 9:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Bible verse in question reveals a divine purpose that is founded in the plan of God, preceding any actions or character formation. This purpose involves God's choice or election, which is unchangeable and not based on works or merit, but solely on His goodness and mercy. The passage underscores God's sovereignty in making distinctions and predestining individuals to salvation or eternal condemnation, emphasizing the personal nature of predestination rather than a collective determination. This divine purpose and election highlight the freedom and liberty of God's choice, attesting to His unfathomable wisdom and power.
