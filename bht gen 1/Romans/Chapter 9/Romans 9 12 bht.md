# Romans 9:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, commentators emphasize that God's choice and favor are evident even from before birth. They discuss how the statement that the elder shall serve the younger can be understood both in a temporal sense, as seen in the history of the Edomites and Israelites, and in a spiritual sense, as referring to Esau's exclusion from God's blessings. The significance of this verse is further highlighted by the reference to Genesis 25:23 and the use of Old Testament passages to support Paul's teaching. Overall, the verse demonstrates God's sovereignty in choosing and calling individuals for His purposes.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### John Calvin:
1. "See how the Lord makes a difference between the sons of Isaac, while they were as yet in their mother's womb; for this was the heavenly answer, by which it appeared that God designed to show to the younger peculiar favor, which he denied to the elder."
2. "Though this indeed had reference to the right of primogeniture, yet in this, as the symbol of something greater, was manifested the will of God."
3. "There was then something greater than the primogeniture promised in the answer given by the Lord."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The elder shall serve the younger; lit., 'the greater shall serve the less.' As spoken to Rebecca, this language referred not only to the twin children, but to the nations springing from them respectively." 

2. "Hence it seems best to accept here both the national and personal reference. The former is required by the citation from Malachi (see Romans 9:13), but the latter is necessary to give point to the argument of the Apostle."

3. "Eternal results in the case of these persons are not involved in the original prophecy; and doubtless theocratic privileges and promises are more prominently in the mind of the Apostle in both these historical cases."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "But of him that calleth" - This phrase emphasizes that it is God who initiates the calling, highlighting His sovereignty and authority in the process of salvation.

### John Gill:
1. "Esau shall be a servant to Jacob; which is to be understood, not of temporal servitude; for in this sense he never was a servant to him... the completion of it, in this sense, is not very evident in their offspring."
2. "It is certain, there was a long train of dukes and kings in Esau's family, before there was any king in Israel; the posterity of Esau were in lordly grandeur and splendour, when the children of Israel were grievously oppressed with hard bondage in Egypt."
3. "This servitude therefore is to be understood in a spiritual sense, of Esau's exclusion from the favour of God, and blessings of grace, signified by his being rejected from inheriting the blessing, which was given to Jacob."

### John Wesley:
1. "The elder - Esau. Shall serve the younger - Not in person, for he never did; but in his posterity." 
2. "Accordingly the Edomites were often brought into subjection by the Israelites."
