1. "Representing their respective nations, as often in the Old Testament."

3. "No idea of malice is implied of course."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The word 'hated' seems harsh, and hence some explain it as 'love less,' making the whole passage to mean, 'I preferred Jacob to Esau.' But, despite such instances as Luke 14:24, compared with Matthew 10:37, this explanation is not allowable." 

2. "The historical dealings of God with Esau (and with Edom also), indicate, not less love, but the deprivation or absence of love, to say the least."

3. "While human goodness is the effect of Divine love and grace, on the contrary, human wickedness is the cause of Divine hatred and abhorrence; and on that account alone can it be the object of the punitive wrath, and condemnatory decree of God."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "It is possible that the word μισεω did not always carry the full force of what we mean by 'hate'." 
2. "So also in Luke 14:26 about 'hating' (μισεω) one's father and mother if coming between one and Christ."

### John Gill:
1. "These words are explanative of the former; they are of like import, and the one interpret the other; and show, that the former are to be understood in a spiritual, and not in a temporal sense, and of the persons, and not the posterity of Jacob and Esau."

2. "Everlasting and unchangeable love is the true cause and spring of the choice of particular persons to eternal salvation."
