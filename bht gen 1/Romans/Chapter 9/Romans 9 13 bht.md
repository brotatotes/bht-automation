# Romans 9:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this passage, commentators reflect on a verse which speaks of God's love for Jacob and God's comparative hatred towards Esau. The term "hated" is seen as not implying active malice, but rather the withholding of blessings and privileges from Esau's descendants. The preference for Jacob is understood to be based on God's sovereign choice and not on any merit of Jacob's own. While the language may sound harsh, it is interpreted as conveying a spiritual rather than a literal or eternal meaning.

2. "This does not mean any positive hatred; but that he had preferred Jacob, and had withheld from Esau those privileges and blessings which he had conferred on the posterity of Jacob."
3. "It was common among the Hebrews to use the terms 'love' and 'hatred' in this comparative sense, where the former implied strong positive attachment, and the latter, not positive hatred, but merely a less love, or the withholding of the expressions of affection."

2. "Jacob obtained this favor through the kindness of God, and not through his own merit."
3. "The Lord, reproaching the Jews for their ingratitude, mentions his former kindness to them... 'Was not Esau the brother of Jacob?' as though he said, 'What privilege had he, that I should prefer him to his brother? None whatever... I yet chose the one, and rejected the other; and I was thus led by my mercy alone, and by no worthiness as to works.'"

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The word 'hated' seems harsh... The historical dealings of God with Esau (and with Edom also), indicate, not less love, but the deprivation or absence of love, to say the least." 

2. "God loves the good... and He elects them not on account of their faith and their holiness, but to faith and holiness."

### John Gill:
1. "These words are explanative of the former; they are of like import, and the one interpret the other; and show, that the former are to be understood in a spiritual, and not in a temporal sense, and of the persons, and not the posterity of Jacob and Esau."

2. "Everlasting and unchangeable love is the true cause and spring of the choice of particular persons to eternal salvation."

3. "Hatred is the cause of rejection, by which is meant not positive hatred, which can only have for its object sin and sinners, or persons so considered; but negative hatred, which is God's will, not to give eternal life to some persons; and shows itself by a neglect of them, taking no notice of them, passing them by, when he chose others."

### John Wesley:
1. "I have loved Jacob — With a peculiar love; that is, the Israelites, the posterity of Jacob."
2. "And I have, comparatively, hated Esau - That is, the Edomites, the posterity of Esau."
3. "This does not relate to the person of Jacob or Esau, nor does it relate to the eternal state either of them or their posterity."
