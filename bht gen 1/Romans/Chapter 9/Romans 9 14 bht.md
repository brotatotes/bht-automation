### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

This emphasizes the divine prerogative and the absence of human control in salvation.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "What conclusion shall we draw from these acknowledged facts, and from these positive declarations of Scripture." 
2. "Does God do injustice or wrong? This charge has often been brought against the doctrine here advanced. But this charge the apostle strongly repels."
3. "He meets it by further showing that it is the doctrine explicitly taught in the Old Testament Romans 9:15, Romans 9:17, and that it is founded on the principles of equity, and on just views of the sovereignty of God."

### John Calvin:
1. "The predestination of God is indeed in reality a labyrinth, from which the mind of man can by no means extricate itself."
2. "Let this then be our sacred rule, to seek to know nothing concerning it, except what Scripture teaches us: when the Lord closes his holy mouth, let us also stop the way, that we may not go farther."
3. "Paul indeed had no wish to go out of his way to find out things by which he might confound his readers; but he took up as it were from what was common the wicked suggestion, which immediately enters the minds of many, when they hear that God determines respecting every individual according to his own will."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The blessings they receive of Him are not their right, but of His mercy, as the words of God Himself in the Old Testament plainly show."
2. "The underlying principle, already assumed in this Epistle, is that God’s will is the absolute and eternal norm of righteousness, and all that He does is necessarily right."

1. "Paul goes right to the heart of the problem."
2. "Beside God there can be no injustice to Esau or to anyone because of election."

### John Gill:
1. "God is not unrighteous in his nature; nor in any of his ways and works; nor in this, in choosing some and rejecting others."
2. "To choose some and not others is no act of injustice; for injustice is a violation of justice, which has no place in this affair."
3. "Every prince may choose his own ministers and favourites... and yet men are not willing to allow the Most High that liberty, which every man daily takes, and may lawfully make use of."

These quotes highlight the righteousness of God in His choices and refute the objection of unrighteousness. They emphasize that God's election and rejection are acts of grace and mercy, not injustice. The analogy of a prince choosing his own council and company further supports the idea that God has the freedom to choose without being unjust.

### John Wesley:
1. "Is there injustice with God — Is it unjust in God to give Jacob the blessing rather than Esau? or to accept believers, and them only. God forbid — In no wise. This is well consistent with justice; for he has a right to fix the terms on which he will show mercy..."
2. "I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy — According to the terms I myself have fixed."
3. "And I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion — Namely, on those only who submit to my terms, who accept of it in the way that I have appointed."
