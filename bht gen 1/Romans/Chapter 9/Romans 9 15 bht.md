# Romans 9:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Bible verse being described speaks about God's sovereign choice and mercy. Commentators highlight that God's selection is not based on merit or worthiness, but on His nature and grace. God actively seeks out those in need of His mercy and shows compassion because of His love. Although we may not fully understand His ways, His decisions are rooted in love, and His mercy challenges our understanding of justice. It reminds us of our own sinfulness and the need to extend mercy to others.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "There can be no unrighteousness in God's choosing whom He will, for to Moses He expressly claims the right to do so."
2. "Yet it is worthy of notice that this is expressed in the positive rather than the negative form: not, 'I will have mercy on none but whom I will'; but, 'I will have mercy on whomsoever I will.'"
3. "God's mercy and compassion are not limited by human standards or expectations, but are freely given to those whom He chooses."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "In condescending to grant this request, the Lord would have him understand that nothing in him, notwithstanding all he had hitherto been able to do for the service of God, would merit such a favor." 
2. "If God accorded it to him, it was not because it was Moses who besought Him, or had any right to it; it was pure grace on His part." 
3. "The present tense is used in this and the corresponding clause, referring to the settled disposition of mercy and compassion."

### John Gill:
1. "The apostle goes on to answer to the above objections, by producing some testimonies out of the writings of Moses, in favour of both branches of predestination."
2. "This is produced, in favour of special, particular, and personal election, and to clear it from any charge of unrighteousness."
3. "God wills nothing in time, but what he willed before time; that this grace and mercy are shown only to some persons, and that the only reason of this is his sovereign will and pleasure, and not the works and merits of men."

### John Wesley:
1. "God's sovereignty is not arbitrary or capricious, but rather rooted in his character of love and mercy. He chooses to show mercy and compassion to whom he wills, not based on any merit or worthiness on their part, but simply because it is his nature to do so."

2. "God's mercy is not a passive attribute, but an active and intentional choice. He actively seeks out those who are in need of his mercy and extends it to them. He is not a distant and detached deity, but a loving and compassionate Father who desires to bless his children."

3. "The fact that God chooses to show mercy to some does not mean that he is unjust or unfair. Rather, it highlights the depth of his grace and the richness of his love. It is a reminder that salvation is not earned or deserved, but freely given by a God who delights in showing mercy."

4. "God's mercy is not limited by human understanding or expectations. He is not bound by our definitions of fairness or justice. His ways are higher than our ways, and his thoughts are higher than our thoughts. We may not always understand why he chooses to show mercy to some and not to others, but we can trust that his decisions are always rooted in love and wisdom."

5. "The mercy of God is not something to be taken for granted or presumed upon. It is a precious gift that should humble us and lead us to repentance. We should never forget the depth of our own sinfulness and the magnitude of God's grace in extending his mercy to us. It is a reminder of our constant need for his forgiveness and a call to extend that same mercy to others."
