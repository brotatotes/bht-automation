2. "The metaphor from the foot-race is a favorite one with Paul." - This comment reveals that Paul frequently uses the metaphor of a race to illustrate spiritual concepts. It suggests that Paul often draws parallels between the discipline and perseverance required in a race and the Christian journey.

3. "God is laid under no obligation by a human will or a human work." - This statement reminds us that God's mercy and grace are not dependent on anything we can do. It emphasizes that our salvation is solely a result of God's love and mercy, not our own efforts or merits.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "It is in parts of Scripture like this that we must be especially careful not to fall short of what is written - not to allow of any compromise of the plain and awful words of God's Spirit, for the sake of a caution which He Himself does not teach us." (Alford)

2. "The participation in any and all of the effects of God's mercy and compassion does not depend on human will, nor on human effort, but on the will of God, who thus spoke to Moses." 

3. "The reference of 'him that willeth' to Abraham's wish respecting Ishmael, and of 'him that runneth' to Esau's running home from hunting, is worth mentioning as a specimen of farfetched interpretation."

### John Gill:
1. "Election, which is what he is discoursing of, is 'not of him that willeth', nor of him that runneth: that is, is not owing to the will or works of men, to the desires, inclinations, and affections of their minds, or to the actions of their lives; these are not the motives, conditions, or causes of this act." 

2. "He is at full liberty, notwithstanding whatever they will or do, to give his grace and mercy, when, where, and to whom he pleases; and therefore to give it to some, and deny it to others, can never be accounted an act of injustice, since he is not bound to give it to any." 

3. "The true sense is, that as election, which is the leading step to salvation, is not owing at all to the will of men, but to the good pleasure and will of God; and not at all to the works of men, that being done before them, and they being the fruits and effects of that, but to the free love, grace, and good will of God."
