# Romans 9:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we see a reflection on the account of Pharaoh and the plagues he experienced. The commentators emphasize that God did not create Pharaoh as a wicked ruler, but rather allowed him to continue in his wickedness to display His divine justice. The verse is seen as applicable to all individuals, as it underscores the importance of accepting God's blessings on His terms. Furthermore, it highlights God's power and sovereignty over creation and pagan gods, as evidenced through the supernatural events during the Exodus.
