## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The Scripture saith to Pharaoh, 'For this very purpose did I raise thee up, that I may show in thee my power, and that my Name may be proclaimed in all the earth.'" - This verse highlights the purpose behind God's actions, using Pharaoh as an example to display His power and make His name known throughout the earth.

2. "The meaning 'incolumem prœstitit,' given in the Lexicons, seems to be grounded on the following of the LXX in this passage, who apparently understood it of Pharaoh being kept safe through the plagues." - This comment explains the alternative interpretation of Pharaoh being kept safe through the plagues, which some interpreters use to avoid the strong assertion that Pharaoh was raised up as an example of God's dealing with impenitent sinners.

3. "The word chosen by the Apostle, ἐξεγείρω, in its transitive sense, is often used by the LXX for 'to rouse into action.' So that the meaning (3) given above for the Heb. verb 'prodire fecit, excitavit,' was evidently that intended by ἐξήγειρα." - This comment explains the usage of the Greek word ἐξεγείρω and how it aligns with the Hebrew verb meaning "to rouse into action," emphasizing that Pharaoh was called into action in his office to serve as an example.
