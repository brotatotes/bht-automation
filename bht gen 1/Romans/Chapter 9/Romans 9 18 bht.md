# Romans 9:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, we see the intricate relationship between God's mercy and hardening. It emphasizes God's sovereignty over human destinies and the freedom of His will. God has the authority to show mercy on those who believe, but He also leaves others to the hardness of their hearts, allowing them to experience the consequences of their own sinful choices. The external influences and societal pressures also contribute to this hardening. God's mercy is extended to those who believe, but He also works in the lives of those who don't believe, allowing them to face the consequences of their actions.
