# Romans 9:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, commentators highlight objections to God's sovereignty and the responsibility of individuals. One commentator emphasizes that the objection applies universally, questioning God's right to choose. Another commentator focuses on the objection to God's decision-making in salvation. The ungodly argue against God's anger, seeing His actions as punishment for His own creation. Ultimately, the objections are met with the acknowledgment of God's power and the inability to resist His will.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The objection is a general one, applying to all mankind, and likely to arise in the mind of any reader."
2. "The answer to the objector’s question does not lie in these verses, but in the following."
3. "The Apostle in asking this question rather aims at striking dumb the objector by a statement of God’s undoubted right, against which it does not become us men to murmur."

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "This objection shows quite as conclusively as the former the real nature of the doctrine objected to—that it is Election and Non-election to eternal salvation prior to any difference of personal character; this is the only doctrine that could suggest the objection here stated, and to this doctrine the objection is plausible."
2. "What now is the apostle's answer? It is twofold. First: 'It is irreverence and presumption in the creature to arraign the Creator.'"
3. "If God chooses and rejects, pardons and punishes, whom He pleases, why are those blamed who, if rejected by Him, cannot help sinning and perishing?"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "If the position which he had been endeavoring to establish were true; if God had a purpose in all his dealings with people; if all the revolutions among people happened according to his decree, so that he was not disappointed, or his plan frustrated; and if his own glory was secured in all this, why could he blame people?"
2. "These objections are met by the apostle in the following argument."
3. "God had accomplished his purposes 'in spite of' their opposition."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "A man may resist God's will, but cannot maintain his resistance."
2. "The idea is the result rather than the process of resistance."
3. "Who can resist him?"

### John Calvin:
1. "Here indeed the flesh especially storms, that is, when it hears that they who perish have been destined by the will of God to destruction."
2. "They are indeed constrained to yield; but they storm, because they cannot resist; and ascribing dominion to him, they in a manner charge him with tyranny."
3. "Thus then speak the ungodly in this passage, — 'What cause has he to be angry with us? Since he has formed us such as we are, since he leads us at his will where he pleases, what else does he in destroying us but punish his own work in us?'"

### Philip Schaff:
1. "For it will arise, wherever there is any such notion of God, however derived, as admits the possibility of His being the author of evil in man, or what amounts to the same thing, denies His righteousness." 
2. "The difficulty is an ontological one: Given an infinite free will, how can there be other free wills."
3. "The question implies the helplessness of the objector, and acknowledges the Almightiness of God, but at the expense of His rectitude, since it virtually makes Him responsible for men's sins."

1. "Paul's imaginary objector picks up the admission that God hardened Pharaoh's heart."
2. "'Still' (ετ) argues for a change of condition since that is true."
3. "Many have attempted to resist God's will (βουλημα, deliberate purpose, in N.T. only here and Acts 27:43; 1 Peter 4:3)."

### John Gill:
1. "It is with a witness a stretching out of the hand against God, and strengthening a man's self against the Almighty."
2. "This is downright cruelty and tyranny."
3. "The fault then can never lie in them who are hardened, and who act as such, but in God; and therefore it must be unreasonable in him to be angry with, blame, accuse, and condemn persons for being and doing that, which he himself wills them to be and do."

### John Wesley:
1. "The particle still is strongly expressive of the objector's sour, morose murmuring."
2. "The word his likewise expresses his surliness and aversion to God, whom he does not even deign to name."
3. "For who hath resisted his will."
