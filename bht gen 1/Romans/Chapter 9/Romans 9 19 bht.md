## BHT:

### John Gill:
1. "The objector does not think fit to name the name of 'God', or 'the Lord', but calls him 'he'; and a considerable emphasis lies upon the word 'yet': what as if he should say, is he not content with the injustice he has already exercised, in passing by some, when he chose others; in leaving them to themselves, and hardening their hearts against him, and to go on in their own ways, which must unavoidably end in destruction; but after all this, is angry with them, finds fault with them, blames, accuses, and condemns them, for that which they cannot help; nay, for that which he himself wills? this is downright cruelty and tyranny."
2. "The objector seems to have a particular regard to the case of Pharaoh, the apostle had instanced in, when after God had declared that he had raised him up for this very purpose, to make known his power, and show forth his glory in all the world, still finds fault with him and says, 'as yet exaltest thou thyself against my people, that thou wilt not let them go?' Exodus 9:17; and yet he himself had hardened his heart, and continued to harden his heart, that he might not let them go as yet; and when he had let them go, hardened his heart again to pursue after them, when he drowned him and his host in the Red sea; all which in this objection, is represented as unparalleled cruelty and unmercifulness."
3. "This is said in support of the former, and means not God's will of command, which is always resisted more or less, by wicked men and devils; but his will of purpose, his counsels and decrees, which stand firm and sure, and can never be resisted, so as to be frustrated and made void. This the objector takes up, and improves against God; that since he hardens whom he will, and there is no resisting his will, the fault then can never lie in them who are hardened, and who act as such, but in God; and therefore it must be unreasonable in him to be angry with, blame, accuse, and condemn persons for being and doing that, which he himself wills them to be and do."

### John Wesley:
1. "The particle still is strongly expressive of the objector's sour, morose murmuring."
2. "The word his likewise expresses his surliness and aversion to God, whom he does not even deign to name."
3. "The objector's questioning of God's fault-finding and resistance to His will reveals a deep sense of bitterness and rebellion."
