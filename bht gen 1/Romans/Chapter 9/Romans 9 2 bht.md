# Romans 9:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This verse speaks of a deep sorrow and grief that the writer carries in his heart, caused by the unbelief and rejection of his fellow countrymen. This heaviness is described as a consuming pain, relentlessly weighing upon his spirit. The writer's grief is not a fleeting emotion, but a continuous agony that accompanies him. Despite this sorrow, it is clear that the writer's concern is not born out of personal animosity, but rather a sincere desire for the salvation and spiritual well-being of those who have rejected the truth.
