## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Nay but, O man, who art thou that repliest against God?" - This quote reminds us of our limited understanding and the audacity of questioning God's intentions and actions. It humbles us and reminds us of our place in relation to the Almighty.

2. "Shall the thing formed say to him that formed it, Why hast thou made me thus?" - This quote emphasizes the absurdity of a created being questioning its Creator. It highlights the sovereignty and wisdom of God in His creation, reminding us that we are not in a position to challenge His divine plan.

3. "Why hast thou made me thus?" - This quote captures the essence of human nature, the tendency to question and seek answers for our circumstances. It reflects the innate desire to understand the purpose behind our existence and challenges us to trust in God's sovereignty, even when we don't have all the answers.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Paul here strongly reproves the impiety and wickedness of arraigning God."
2. "What qualifications has a creature of a day, a being just in the infancy of his existence; of so limited faculties; so perverse, blinded, and interested as man, to sit in judgment on the doings of the Infinite Mind?"
3. "No where is there to be found a more cutting or humbling reply to the pride of man than this."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Man as man, not Jew."
2. "Jesus answered the thought in the minds of the lawyers and Pharisees by asking, 'Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?'"
3. "The word signifies to reply to an answer which God had already given, and implies, as Godet observes, the spirit of contention."

### John Calvin:
1. "Who art thou who enterest into a dispute with God?" - This quote emphasizes the futility of humans contending with God and highlights the incomprehensible nature of God's will.
2. "He reminds man of what is especially meet for him to remember, that is, of his own condition; as though he had said, — 'Since thou art man, thou ownest thyself to be dust and ashes; why then doest thou contend with the Lord about that which thou art not able to understand?'" - This quote underscores the humility and reverence that humans should have when approaching the mysteries of God's will.
3. "Paul only meant to allude to the words of the Prophet, in order that the similitude might have more weight." - This quote explains the use of the simile from Isaiah, highlighting the significance of the comparison between humans and clay in understanding our position in relation to God.

### Philip Schaff:

2. "How great art thou?"
3. "The folly, rather than the error of the objector, is thus rebuked."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "O man, but surely thou who art thou?" - Unusual and emphatic order of the words, prolepsis of συ (thou) before τις (who) and μεν ουν γε (triple particle, μεν, indeed, ουν, therefore, γε, at least) at the beginning of clause as in Romans 10:18; Philippians 3:8 contrary to ancient idiom, but so in papyri.

2. "That repliest" - Present middle articular participle of double compound verb ανταποκρινομα, to answer to one's face (αντι-) late and vivid combination, also in Luke 14:6, nowhere else in N.T., but in LXX.

3. "The thing formed" - Old word (Plato, Aristophanes) from πλασσω, to mould, as with clay or wax, from which the aorist active participle used here (τω πλασαντ) comes. Paul quotes these words from Isaiah 29:16 verbatim. It is a familiar idea in the Old Testament, the absolute power of God as Creator like the potter's use of clay (Isaiah 44:8; Isaiah 45:8-10; Jeremiah 18:6).

### John Gill:
1. "Nay, but O man, who art thou that repliest against God?" - The apostle reminds us that we are mere creatures and not the Creator, and therefore we have no right to question or challenge God's ways. We are fallen, sinful, and ignorant, and it is audacious for us to open our mouths against Him.

2. "To litigate a point with God, to dispute a matter with Him, is the highest instance of arrogance and impudence." - It is foolish and arrogant for us to argue or contend with God. We cannot answer Him or challenge His wisdom, for He is wise in heart and mighty in strength.

3. "Shall the thing formed, say unto him that formed it, why hast thou made me thus?" - Just as it would be absurd for a piece of clay to question its fashioner or for a child to question its parents, it is unreasonable for us to question God about our circumstances and the way He has made us. We must humbly submit to His sovereign will.

### John Wesley:
1. "Nay, but who art thou, O man — Little, impotent, ignorant man." - This quote highlights the humility and insignificance of human beings in comparison to God. It reminds us that we should not question or challenge God's ways, but instead trust in His wisdom and sovereignty.

2. "That repliest against God — That accusest God of injustice, for himself fixing the terms on which he will show mercy?" - This quote emphasizes the futility of questioning God's fairness or accusing Him of injustice. It reminds us that God has the right to establish the conditions for His mercy and salvation, and it is not our place to question His decisions.

3. "Shall the thing formed say to him that formed it, Why hast thou made me thus - Why hast thou made me capable of honour and immortality, only by believing?" - This quote highlights the concept of God as the Creator and human beings as His creations. It reminds us that we should not question why God has made us in a certain way or why He has established faith as the means to receive honor and immortality.
