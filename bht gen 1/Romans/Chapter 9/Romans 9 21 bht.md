# Romans 9:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, God's sovereignty and authority over his creation are compared to a potter's control over clay. He has the power to appoint some vessels for honor and others for dishonor. God's ways of dispensing blessings and favor are beyond our comprehension, guided solely by his perfect wisdom. His will, which is infinitely wise and good, serves as the ultimate measure of judgment. Through this verse, we are reminded of the limitless power and divine wisdom of our Creator.
