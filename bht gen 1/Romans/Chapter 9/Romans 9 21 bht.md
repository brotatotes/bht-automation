### Albert Barnes:
1. "God might bestow his favors as he pleased, and mould them as the potter did the clay. He would do no injury to those who were left, and 'who had no claim to his mercy,' if he bestowed favors on others, any more than the potter would do injustice to one part of the mass, if he put it to an ignoble use, and moulded another part into a vessel of honor."
2. "God does no injustice to a man if he leaves him to take his own course to ruin, and makes another, equally undeserving, the recipient of his mercy."

2. "God, as sovereign Lord and Proprietor of all, dispenses his gifts or favours to his creatures with perfect wisdom, but by no rules or methods of proceeding that we are acquainted with."
3. "Therefore, though 'He hath mercy on whom he willeth, and whom he willeth he hardeneth,' that is, suffers to be hardened in consequence of their obstinate wickedness; yet his is not the will of an arbitrary, capricious, or tyrannical being."
