# Romans 9:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, God is portrayed as willing to display his righteous wrath and endure with great patience those who are deserving of punishment. There are difficulties in comprehending such statements, but they cannot be dismissed as numerous other passages convey the same message. God endures with long-suffering even in the necessary punishment of the wicked. The phrase "fitted for destruction" suggests everlasting destruction, while the contrasted word "glory" highlights the ultimate fate of the vessels of mercy. This verse also emphasizes God's response to sin and rejection of his mercy, similar to how he dealt with Pharaoh.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "What if God, willing to show his wrath...endured with much long-suffering the vessels of wrath." 
2. "It is well remarked by STUART that the 'difficulties which such statements involve are not to be got rid of by softening the language of one text, while so many others meet us which are of the same tenor.'"
3. "Even in the necessary punishment of the wicked...God 'endures with much long-suffering' those objects of His righteous displeasure."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "But what will be said, if, as is the case, God, etc. 'But' thus introduces an additional thought, which forms the main answer to the objection."
2. "His power. This peculiar expression, meaning 'what is possible to him,' suits the view we take of 'willing.'"
3. "The endurance was really 'with much long-suffering.'"
4. "Fitted for destruction; everlasting destruction is meant, as the contrasted word (‘glory;’ Romans 9:23) plainly shows."
5. "Probably the mediate agency of God is not to be excluded, but the obvious differences between the two phrases (‘fitted for destruction’ and ‘which He before prepared for glory, see below) point unmistakably to such a difference as should guard the passage against fatalistic interpretations."

### John Wesley:
1. "To show his wrath - Which necessarily presupposes sin." 
2. "Yet endured - As he did Pharaoh." 
3. "The vessels of wrath - Those who had moved his wrath by still rejecting his mercy."
