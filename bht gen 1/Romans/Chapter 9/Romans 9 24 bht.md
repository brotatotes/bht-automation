# Romans 9:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This verse emphasizes that God's calling is not limited to a specific group but extends to both Jews and Gentiles. The mention of a "remnant" implies that while Israel's rejection was partial, God's promise to Abraham was still fulfilled through the inclusion of the Gentiles. The calling is not based on one's heritage, but rather on God's grace and election, which is known through the effect of being called. This calling is a powerful and irresistible grace that reaches the heart, demonstrating God's inclusive and purposeful plan.
