1. "If God formerly purposed to recall to himself a people whom he had rejected; if he bestowed favors on his own people after they had forfeited his favor, and ceased to be entitled to the name of 'his people:' then the same thing was not to be regarded as absurd if he dealt in a similar manner with the Gentiles."
