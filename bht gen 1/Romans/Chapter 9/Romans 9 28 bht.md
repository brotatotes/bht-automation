# Romans 9:28 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, God's word is being executed swiftly and decisively, bringing His plans and purposes to a complete and perfect conclusion. With His sovereignty and control, He intervenes and cuts short the course of events, demonstrating His power. His judgment, characterized by rigorous justice, will result in widespread destruction, with only a small remnant being spared. The urgency for repentance is emphasized, as the magnitude of God's judgment leaves little room for escape.

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "For he will finish the work, and cut it short in righteousness." 
2. "The sense given to these words by the apostle may seem to differ from that intended by the prophet. But the sameness of sentiment in both places will at once appear."
3. "The 'short reckoning' seems to mean the speedy completing of His word, both in cutting off the one portion and saving the other."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The Lord will execute His word upon the earth, finishing and cutting it short."
2. "Work does not mean work, but word, utterance, doctrine; not decree, which logov never means, though the idea may underlie it."
3. "Finish - cut short. The preposition sun together signifies summarily; bringing to an end at the same time."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The longer reading may be translated thus: 'For he (i.e., the Lord) is finishing and cutting short his word in righteousness, because a short (lit, cut-short) word will the Lord execute upon the earth.'"
2. "The LXX., especially as here applied by the Apostle, has preserved most fully the thought of the original prophecy, in fact conveying it to the mind of a reader familiar with Greek more clearly than could have been done by a literal rendering of the Hebrew."
3. "'Finishing and cutting short' then refer to the rapid accomplishment of the word uttered by the Lord. This applies, as we think, to both the threatening and the promise, and that too, whichever reading be accepted."
