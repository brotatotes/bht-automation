# Romans 9:29 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This verse, as explained by commentators, speaks to the importance of God's preservation of a faithful remnant. The title "The Lord of Sabaoth" signifies His role as the leader of hosts, emphasizing His power and authority. The chosen people, represented as a seed, play a crucial role in the Christian Church's growth and survival. Without this precious seed, they would have fallen into moral decline and faced just punishment, resembling the doomed cities of Sodom and Gomorrah. The verse also highlights the prophetic nature of Isaiah's words and their fulfillment in history.
