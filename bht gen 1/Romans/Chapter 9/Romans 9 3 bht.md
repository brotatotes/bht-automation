## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The sense of the imperf. in such expressions is the proper and strict one...the act is unfinished, an obstacle intervening."
2. "Attempts have been made to explain away the meaning here...but excommunication included cursing and delivering over to Satan."
3. "The wish is evidently not to be pressed as entailing on the Apostle the charge of inconsistency in loving his nation more than his Saviour."

### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "In proportion as he felt himself severed from his nation, he seems to have realized all the more vividly their natural relationship."
2. "To explain away the wish here expressed, as too strong for any Christian to utter or conceive, some have rendered the opening words, 'I did wish,' referring it to his former unenlightened state; a sense of the words too tame to be endured."
3. "But our version gives the true import of the original; and if it be understood as the language rather of 'strong and indistinct emotions than of definite ideas,' expressing passionately how he felt his whole being swallowed up in the salvation of his people, the difficulty will vanish."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The proper grammatical construction of the word used here is not I did wish, but I could desire ἠυχόμην ēuchomēn, implying that he was willing now to endure it; that his present love for them was so strong, that he would, if practicable, save them from the threatened ruin and apostasy."

2. "The word rendered 'accursed' (anathema) properly means, (1) Anything that was set up, or 'set apart,' or consecrated to the gods in the temples, as spoils of war, images, statues, etc. This is its Classical Greek meaning. It has a similar meaning among the Hebrews, It denoted what was set apart or consecrated to the service of God, as sacrifices or offerings of any kind."

3. "And as whatever is devoted to destruction may be said to be subject to a curse, or to be accursed, the word comes to have this signification; 1 Kings 20:42; Isaiah 34:5. But in none of these cases does it denote eternal death. The idea, therefore, in these places is simply, 'I could be willing to be destroyed, or devoted, to death, for the sake of my countrymen.'"

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The imperfect here has a tentative force, implying the wish begun, but stopped at the outset by some antecedent consideration which renders it impossible, so that, practically, it was not entertained at all."
2. "Paul would wish to save his countrymen, even at such sacrifice, if it were morally possible."
3. "Accursed from Christ. Set apart to destruction and so separated from Christ. An expression of deep devotion."

### John Calvin:
1. "He could not have expressed a greater ardour of love than by what he testifies here; for that is surely perfect love which refuses not to die for the salvation of a friend."
2. "It is no objection that he knew that his salvation was based on the election of God, which could by no means fail; for as those ardent feelings hurry us on impetuously, so they see and regard nothing but the object in view."
3. "For though it is better that one member should perish than the whole body; it was yet for this reason that Paul had such a high regard for the Jews, because he viewed them as bearing the character, and, as they commonly say, the quality of an elect people."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The Apostle, however, is not using a hyperbole, nor is his language a senseless straining of the idea of self-denial. The objective impossibility did not destroy or diminish the subjective intensity of Paul’s feeling, which thus seeks expression."
2. "It is the expression of an affectionate and self-denying heart, willing to surrender all things even, if it might be so, eternal glory itself if thereby he could obtain for his beloved people those blessings of the gospel which he now enjoyed, but from which they were excluded."
3. "My kinsmen according to the flesh. Notice the tender way in which the Apostle characterizes the Jews. But the phrase suggests as its antithesis ‘brethren in the Lord.’ Paul’s patriotism grew out of the human consanguinity, but as the following description shows, has its deepest ground in the gracious gifts and religious privileges hitherto possessed by his countrymen."

### Archibald T Robertson:
1. "I could wish (ηυχομην). Idiomatic imperfect, 'I was on the point of wishing.' We can see that ευχομα (I do wish) would be wrong to say."
2. "Αν ηυχομην would mean that he does not wish (conclusion of second class condition). Αν ηυχομην would be conclusion of fourth class condition and too remote. He is shut up to the imperfect indicative (Robertson, Grammar, p. 886)."
3. "According to the flesh (κατα σαρκα). As distinguished from Paul's Christian brethren."

### John Gill:
1. "He saw that these branches, the people of the Jews, were going to be cut off, and no longer to be of the church of God; and such was his affection to them, that he could have wished rather to be cut off himself, that they might be spared; and this was an instance of great love to them, since, next to Christ, the church and the ordinances of it were exceeding dear unto, and highly valued by the apostle."

2. "I could wish that my dear Lord and Master, as if he should say, would appoint and order me to die, might this nation of mine but escape that ruin and destruction I see is coming upon them, as a nation and a church; I could be content to die the most accursed death, and be treated in the most ignominious manner, might they but be saved."

3. "For a man to die for his country, that a whole nation perish not, was agreeably to the sentiments both of Jews and Gentiles, and was the highest instance of love among men; 'greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends'."

### John Wesley:
1. "Human words cannot fully describe the motions of souls that are full of God."
2. "I could wish to suffer in their stead; yea, to be an anathema from Christ in their place."
3. "Certainly he did not then consider himself at all, but only others and the glory of God."
