# Romans 9:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the writer expresses a deep longing and self-sacrificial love for their people, even to the point of being severed from their own nation. They passionately wish for the salvation and blessings of the gospel to be extended to their beloved people, willing to surrender even eternal glory for their sake. This intense feeling is beyond human description, as it stems from a heart full of love and a desire to see others experience the grace and mercy of God. Their focus is solely on others and the glory of God, considering themselves of little importance.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "In proportion as he felt himself severed from his nation, he seems to have realized all the more vividly their natural relationship."
2. "To explain away the wish here expressed, as too strong for any Christian to utter or conceive, some have rendered the opening words, 'I did wish,' referring it to his former unenlightened state; a sense of the words too tame to be endured."
3. "But our version gives the true import of the original; and if it be understood as the language rather of 'strong and indistinct emotions than of definite ideas,' expressing passionately how he felt his whole being swallowed up in the salvation of his people, the difficulty will vanish."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "I could wish that I myself were devoted to destruction from Christ for the sake of my brethren." 
2. "The objective impossibility did not destroy or diminish the subjective intensity of Paul's feeling, which thus seeks expression."
3. "It is the expression of an affectionate and self-denying heart, willing to surrender all things even, if it might be so, eternal glory itself if thereby he could obtain for his beloved people those blessings of the gospel which he now enjoyed, but from which they were excluded."

### John Wesley:
1. "I could wish â€” Human words cannot fully describe the motions of souls that are full of God."
2. "As if he had said, I could wish to suffer in their stead; yea, to be an anathema from Christ in their place."
3. "Certainly he did not then consider himself at all, but only others and the glory of God."
