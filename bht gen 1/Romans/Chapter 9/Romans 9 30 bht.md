# Romans 9:30 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verses in question highlight the unexpected outcome for both the Gentiles and the Israelites. The Gentiles, who did not actively seek righteousness, have surprisingly achieved it through faith. On the other hand, the Israelites, who pursued righteousness through the law, have ultimately failed to attain it. This contrast underscores how righteousness is not solely based on human efforts or merit but is ultimately obtained through faith in God's grace.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The result is this—very different from what one would have expected."
2. "The Gentiles, which followed not after righteousness, have attained to righteousness, even the righteousness of faith."
3. "The Gentiles, who while strangers to Christ were quite indifferent about acceptance with God, having embraced the Gospel as soon as it was preached to them, experienced the blessedness of a justified state."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "To what results have we come by the passages adduced from the Old Testament? This question is asked preparatory to his summing up the argument; and he had so stated the argument that the conclusion which he was about to draw was inevitable."
2. "The Gentiles... had actually embraced the righteousness of faith... multitudes of pagans had embraced the Christian religion."
3. "The Gentiles, which sought not justification, have obtained justification... it is implied that the gospel did not have the special obstacle to contend with among the Gentiles that it had among the Jews... people were more easily brought 'to see' that they were sinners, and to feel their need of a Saviour."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The meaning is substantially the same, only the imagery in the two words differs; the former being that of laying hold of a prize, and the latter of arriving at a goal."
2. "The latter is appropriate to following after, and is carried out in stumbling."
3. "Attained righteousness, that is not that arising from these works, but from faith."

### John Calvin:
1. "The corruption and wickedness of the ungodly afford a reason and an occasion for the judgments of God."
2. "The righteousness which the Gentiles attained was by faith; and that it hence depends on the Lord’s mercy, and not on man’s own worthiness."
3. "He deigned to embrace them when unworthy of his favor...it was based on a gratuitous reconciliation."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "What shall we say then? Precisely as in Romans 9:14, where, however, it introduces an objection. But when followed by an assertion, it further unfolds an argument from what precedes."
2. "While this word does not mean 'justification,' we need not give it here a purely ethical sense. For some of the Gentiles had a high ethical ideal which they pursued. But they did not follow this ethical aim with the thought of attaining a verdict of righteousness before God."
3. "The peculiar form of the original suggests that this is the true righteousness."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Attained (κατελαβεν). Second aorist active indicative of καταλαμβανω, old verb, to grasp, to seize, to overtake (carrying out the figure in διωκω (to pursue). It was a curious paradox."
2. "Which is of faith (την εκ πιστεως). As Paul has repeatedly shown, the only way to get the God-kind of righteousness."

### John Gill:
1. "To God's calling of a large number of the Gentiles, and only a very few of the Jews, according to his eternal purposes and decrees; what can be objected to it? is he chargeable with any unrighteousness? must it not be referred to his sovereign will and pleasure?"
2. "They did not pursue and improve the light of nature, about God and things of a moral kind, as they might have done; but held the light and truth they had in unrighteousness, and indeed were filled with nothing else: and yet these persons have attained to righteousness, even the righteousness which is of faith."
3. "These Gentiles being called by grace, 'attained', 'comprehended', or 'apprehended' this righteousness; not by the light of nature, which makes no discovery, nor gives the least hint of it; but by the light of faith they apprehended it, as revealed in the Gospel."

### John Wesley:
1. "The gentiles, who followed not after righteousness... have attained to righteousness." 
2. "Even the righteousness which is by faith." 
3. "Israel, although following after the law of righteousness... have not attained to the law of righteousness."
