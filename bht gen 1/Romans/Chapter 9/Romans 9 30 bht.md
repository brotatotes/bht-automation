# Romans 9:30 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The passage describes the unexpected outcome where the Gentiles, who were indifferent about acceptance with God, embraced the Gospel and experienced the blessedness of a justified state. Their righteousness is not based on their own worthiness or works, but on faith and the Lord's mercy. It is a righteousness attained by grasping and pursuing, revealed in the Gospel. In contrast, Israel, in their pursuit of the law, did not attain the righteousness found in faith.

### John Gill:
1. "To God's calling of a large number of the Gentiles, and only a very few of the Jews, according to his eternal purposes and decrees; what can be objected to it? is he chargeable with any unrighteousness?" 
2. "They did not pursue and improve the light of nature, about God and things of a moral kind, as they might have done; but held the light and truth they had in unrighteousness, and indeed were filled with nothing else: and yet these persons have attained to righteousness, even the righteousness which is of faith." 
3. "These Gentiles being called by grace, 'attained', 'comprehended', or 'apprehended' this righteousness; not by the light of nature, which makes no discovery, nor gives the least hint of it; but by the light of faith they apprehended it, as revealed in the Gospel."

### John Wesley:
1. "The gentiles, who followed not after righteousness... Have attained to righteousness."
