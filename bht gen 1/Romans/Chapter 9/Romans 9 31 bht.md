# Romans 9:31 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Israel, in their zealous pursuit of righteousness through the law, fell short of attaining it. Despite their sincere efforts, they missed the mark by not truly understanding the true nature and purpose of the law. They strived vigorously, aiming to reach the righteousness within the law, but they lacked the inward character and grasp of its mission. If only they had started their endeavor from a place of faith, they would have realized their pursuit fulfilled in Christianity.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Israel, which followed after the law of righteousness, hath not attained unto the law of righteousness." 
2. "The word 'law' is used here, we think, in the same sense as in Romans 7:23, to denote 'a principle of action.'"
3. "Israel, though sincerely and steadily aiming at acceptance with God, nevertheless missed it."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Israel pursued this law in order that justification might ensue, but without any true sense of its contents, or real apprehension of its mission."
2. "They did not even arrive at the real inward character of that law, which they pursued as affording righteousness."
3. "Had they started from faith in their striving, they would have obtained in Christianity the realization of their endeavor."

### John Gill:
1. "The Israelites, the far greater part of the Jews, who were not called by the grace of God, were all very zealous of the law, called 'the law of righteousness'; because the matter of it was righteous, it was so in its own nature."
2. "They very violently and eagerly pursued after it, they tugged and toiled, and laboured with all their might, as persons in running a race, to get up to the law, and the righteousness of it."
3. "Some of them fancied they had, supposing an external conformity to it, to be all that it insisted upon; not knowing the spirituality of it, that it required truth and holiness in the inward parts."
