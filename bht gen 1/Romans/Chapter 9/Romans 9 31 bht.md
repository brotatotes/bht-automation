# Romans 9:31 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse being described highlights the failures of Israel in obtaining righteousness through their pursuit of the law. Despite their sincere efforts, they stumbled and fell short of attaining true justification. Israel misunderstood the true nature and purpose of the law, relying on their own imperfect obedience rather than trusting in the mercy of God. The contrast is made between their external conformity to the law and the inward righteousness it truly demanded.
