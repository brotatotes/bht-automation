# Romans 9:32 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Some sought righteousness through their works, stumbling over Christ as the stone of stumbling. They failed to seek it through faith, relying on the law instead. Justification is unattainable by works alone, but can only be found through faith. The stumbling block for those who do not seek salvation is their rejection of Christ crucified. The verse explores the consequences of seeking righteousness in the wrong places and failing to embrace the truth of salvation through faith in Christ.
