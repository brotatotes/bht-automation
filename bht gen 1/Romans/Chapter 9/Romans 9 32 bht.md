# Romans 9:32 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This verse describes how the people did not seek righteousness by faith, but rather through their own works; they stumbled over the stumbling stone, which is Christ. They attempted to attain salvation by relying on their own righteousness and not on the mercy of God obtained through faith. The obstacle to their righteousness was Christ Himself, whom they had longed for but ultimately rejected.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "They sought it not by faith, but as it were—rather simply, 'as' by the works of the law—as if it were thus attainable, which justification is not: Since, therefore, it is attainable only by faith, they missed it." 
2. "They stumbled at that stumbling-stone—better, 'against the stone of stumbling,' meaning Christ."
3. "But in this they only did."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "They depended on their own righteousness, and not on the mercy of God to be obtained by faith."
2. "The sacrifices had reference to a future state of things, and were doubtless so understood."
3. "That obstacle which prevented their attaining the righteousness of faith; and which was the occasion of their fall, rejection, and ruin."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "They stumbled. 'In their foolish course Israel thought they were advancing on a clear path, and lo! all at once there was found in this way an obstacle upon which they were broken; and this obstacle was the very Messiah whom they had so long invoked in all their prayers' (Godet)."

2. "Not by faith. They sought it not. Israel's failure to obtain righteousness was not due to a lack of faith. Rather, they stumbled because they did not actively seek after it."

3. "The obstacle was the very Messiah. The stumbling block for Israel was Jesus Christ himself, the very one they had been praying for and longing for. Their rejection of him was a tragic irony."

### John Calvin:
1. "They are deservedly rejected, who attempt to attain salvation by trusting in their own works; for they, as far as they can, abolish faith, without which no salvation can be expected."
2. "Faith and the merits of works are contrasted, as things altogether contrary to each other... it is necessary that we should wholly renounce [trust in works] in order that we may depend on God’s goodness alone."
3. "Christ has been given to us for righteousness, whosoever obtrudes on God the righteousness of works, attempts to rob him of his own office... they do in their furious madness carry on war with God himself."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "We must supply the omitted verb εδιωξα (pursued) from verse Romans 9:31. That explains the rest."
2. "They stumbled at the stone of stumbling (προσεκοψαν τω λιθω του προσκομματος). The quotation is from Isaiah 8:14."
3. "The Jews found Christ a σκανδαλον (1 Corinthians 1:23)."

### John Gill:
1. "They sought for it in the law, and the works of it, where it is never to be found by a sinful creature, and not in Christ, in whom only are righteousness and strength."
2. "They sought it as if they expected their justification before God was to be by works of righteousness done by them; or as if it was partly by their own works, and partly by the goodness of God, accepting of them for a justifying righteousness."
3. "They stumbled at that stumbling stone; meaning the word of the Gospel, at which Peter says they stumbled, and particularly the doctrine of justification by the righteousness of Christ."

### John Wesley:
1. "There is nothing like this to be met with but agreeable to his argument the apostle gives us this good reason for it, Because they sought it not by faith - Whereby alone it could be attained."
2. "But as it were — In effect, if not professsedly, by works."
3. "For they stumbled at that stumblingstone — Christ crucified."
