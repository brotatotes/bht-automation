# Romans 9:33 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, a stone is laid in Zion, which is Jesus Christ, the cornerstone upon which the church is built. This stone becomes a stumbling block and rock of offense to those who do not believe. It is foretold by the prophet that many will stumble because of their unbelief. However, for those who believe in Christ, they will not be put to shame, finding their sure foundation and salvation in Him.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The ‘stone of stumbling and rock of offence,’ mentioned Isaiah 8:14, is substituted for the ‘corner-stone elect, precious,’ of ch. Isaiah 28:16."
2. "Isa 8:14 was evidently interpreted by the Jews themselves of the Messiah: for Simeon, Luke 2:34, when speaking of the child Jesus as the Messiah, expressly adduces the prophecy as about to be fulfilled."
3. "What was there then to prevent the Apostle from giving to this Stone, plainly foretold as to be laid in Zion, that designation which prophecy also justifies, and which bears immediately on the matter here in hand?"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "To speak and act 'in Christ,' with a conscience not only illuminated, but under the present operation of the Holy Ghost, is not peculiar to the supernaturally inspired, but is the privilege, and ought to be the aim, of every believer." 
2. "Grace does not destroy, but only intensify and elevate, the feelings of nature; and Christians should study to show this."
3. "Yet the most sacred external distinctions and privileges will avail nothing to salvation without the heart's submission to the righteousness of God."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He is called rock of stumbling, not because it was the design of sending him that people should fall, but because such would be the result." 
2. "It is not on human merits, but by the righteousness of the Saviour, that the church is to be reared." 
3. "The man who believes shall not be agitated, or thrown into commotion, by fear of want or success: shall not be disappointed in his hopes; and, of course, he shall never be ashamed that he became a Christian."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Offense [σκανδαλου]. See on Matthew 5:29; Matthew 16:9 Matthew 16:3."
2. "Shall not be ashamed [ου καταισχυνθησεται]. The Hebrew in Isaiah 28:16 is, shall not make haste, or flee hastily."
3. "The quotation combines Isaiah 8:4 and Isaiah 28:16."

### John Calvin:
1. "Because Christ is called the stone of stumbling, there is no reason that we should dread him, or entertain fear instead of confidence; for he is appointed for ruin to the unbelieving, but for life and resurrection to the godly."
2. "By putting shall not be ashamed instead of shall not hasten or fall, he has followed the Greek Translator. It is indeed certain that the Lord in that passage intended to strengthen the hope of His people: and when the Lord bids us to entertain good hope, it hence follows that we cannot be ashamed."
3. "The citation in this verse is made in a remarkable manner. The first part, 'Behold I lay in Zion,' is taken from Isaiah 28:16; what follows, 'a stone of stumbling and rock of offense,' is taken from Isaiah 8:14; and then the last words, 'and whosoever believes in him shall not be ashamed,' are given from the preceding passage in Isaiah 28:16."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Stone of stumbling, etc. In Isaiah 8:14, God Himself is represented as being ‘for a stone of stumbling and for a rock of offence’ to His enemies."
2. "This combination is both justifiable and natural. In both cases the supreme revelation of Jehovah in the Messiah is referred to; in one passage as a sanctuary for His people, but for a stone of stumbling, etc., to His enemies; in the other as a corner-stone laid in Zion, for a secure foundation."
3. "Shall not be put to shame. The Hebrew is: ‘shall not make haste,’ or, ‘flee hastily,’ with a primary reference to escaping from danger, but the LXX., from which Paul varies very slightly, gives the meaning with substantial correctness."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Paul repeats the phrase just used in the whole quotation from Isaiah 8:14 with the same idea in 'a rock of offence' (πετραν σκανδαλου, 'a rock of snare,' a rock which the Jews made a cause of stumbling)."
2. "The rest of the verse is quoted from Isaiah 28:16."
3. "Either Peter had read Romans or both Paul and Peter had a copy of Christian Testimonia like Cyprian's later."

### John Gill:
1. "The stone" said to be laid in Zion, is by the "Chaldee paraphrast" interpreted of a "king"; by R. David Kimchi, of King Hezekiah, and by Jarchi of the King Messiah; and is truly applied by the apostle to Jesus Christ.
2. The place where he is laid is Zion, meaning either literally Judea or Jerusalem, where the Messiah was to appear, whither he came, and from whence his Gospel went forth; or mystically the church, where he is laid as the foundation of it, and of the salvation of all the members thereof.
3. Whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed; that is, who believes in Christ unto righteousness, who builds his faith, and hope of eternal salvation on him, the foundation God has laid in Zion, and at which the unbelieving Jews stumbled and fell; he shall neither be ashamed here nor hereafter.

### John Wesley:
1. "I exhibit in my church, what, though it is in truth the only sure foundation of happiness, yet will be in fact a stumblingstone and rock of offence." 

2. "An occasion of ruin to many, through their obstinate unbelief." 

3. "Foretold by their own prophet."
