## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "To speak and act 'in Christ,' with a conscience not only illuminated, but under the present operation of the Holy Ghost, is not peculiar to the supernaturally inspired, but is the privilege, and ought to be the aim, of every believer." (Romans 9:1)
2. "Grace does not destroy, but only intensify and elevate, the feelings of nature; and Christians should study to show this." (Romans 9:2; Romans 9:3)
3. "To belong to the visible Church of God, and enjoy its high and holy distinctions, is of the sovereign mercy of God, and should be regarded with devout thankfulness." (Romans 9:4; Romans 9:5)

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Offense [σκανδαλου]. See on Matthew 5:29; Matthew 16:9 Matthew 16:3." This quote refers to the Greek word for "offense" and directs readers to other verses in Matthew for further understanding.

2. "Shall not be ashamed [ου καταισχυνθησεται]." This quote highlights the Greek phrase used in the verse and suggests a connection to the Hebrew phrase in Isaiah 28:16, which adds depth to the meaning of not being ashamed.

3. "The quotation combines Isaiah 8:4 and Isaiah 28:16." This quote points out the combination of two Old Testament verses, Isaiah 8:4 and Isaiah 28:16, in the commentary, indicating a deeper layer of interpretation for the verse being discussed.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Stone of stumbling, etc. In Isaiah 8:14, God Himself is represented as being ‘for a stone of stumbling and for a rock of offence’ to His enemies."
2. "This combination is both justifiable and natural. In both cases the supreme revelation of Jehovah in the Messiah is referred to; in one passage as a sanctuary for His people, but for a stone of stumbling, etc., to His enemies; in the other as a corner-stone laid in Zion, for a secure foundation."
3. "Shall not be put to shame. The Hebrew is: ‘shall not make haste,’ or, ‘flee hastily,’ with a primary reference to escaping from danger, but the LXX., from which Paul varies very slightly, gives the meaning with substantial correctness."

### John Gill:
1. "The stone" said to be laid in Zion, is by the "Chaldee paraphrast" interpreted of a "king"; by R. David Kimchi, of King Hezekiah, and by Jarchi of the King Messiah; and is truly applied by the apostle to Jesus Christ.
2. The place where he is laid is Zion, meaning either literally Judea or Jerusalem, where the Messiah was to appear, whither he came, and from whence his Gospel went forth; or mystically the church, where he is laid as the foundation of it, and of the salvation of all the members thereof.
3. Whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed; that is, who believes in Christ unto righteousness, who builds his faith, and hope of eternal salvation on him, the foundation God has laid in Zion, and at which the unbelieving Jews stumbled and fell; he shall neither be ashamed here nor hereafter.

### John Wesley:
1. "Foretold by their own prophet." - This quote highlights the prophetic nature of the verse, emphasizing that the events described were foretold by the prophets of old. It suggests that the fulfillment of these prophecies is a testament to the divine nature of the scripture.

2. "I exhibit in my church... an occasion of ruin to many." - This quote suggests that the church, which represents the body of believers, serves as a platform for the manifestation of God's truth. However, it also acknowledges that this truth can be a stumbling block for those who stubbornly refuse to believe, leading to their downfall.

3. "The only sure foundation of happiness." - This quote emphasizes the significance of the truth presented in the verse as the sole foundation for true happiness. It implies that those who embrace and believe in this truth will find lasting joy and fulfillment in their lives.
