## BHT:
In this verse, the commentators explore the unique relationship between God and the people of Israel.

The commentators also emphasize the significance of the covenant and its promises, which were specific to the Israelites and revealed to them through various renewals. Additionally, the commentators mention the visible presence of God with the Israelites in the form of the Shekinah and discuss the distinction of Israel as the people of God and God as their Father.
