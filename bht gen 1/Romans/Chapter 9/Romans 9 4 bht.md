# Romans 9:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse being described talks about the privileges and glories of the Israelites, their adoption into the family of God, and the divine presence that rested over them. The commentators emphasize that the Israelites were chosen by God and had a special relationship with Him, symbolized by the Shekinah glory. The verse also mentions the giving of the law and the covenant God made with them, which preceded the law. Despite their privileges, the commentators caution that these benefits carry no worth without Christ. The Israelites' rejection of Christ is seen as an enigma in light of their remarkable heritage.
