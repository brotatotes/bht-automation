# Romans 9:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse in question deals with the fulfillment of God's promise to Israel. The commentators emphasize that the promise has not failed, despite the unbelief and rejection of some within the nation. They highlight that being physically descended from Israel does not automatically make one a part of the true Israel. Instead, membership in the true Israel is based on faith and acceptance of the Gospel. The verse addresses God's original purpose, as stated in the Scriptures, to include and save those who believe. It is a reminder that God's promises remain steadfast, even in the face of human unbelief.
