# Romans 9:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, the commentators emphasize that not all who are physically descended from Israel are part of God's chosen people. They discuss the enduring nature of God's promises in the face of unbelief and the distinction between physical lineage and true membership in Israel. The verse also addresses the rejected Gospel by the Jews, attributing it to the promise being applicable only to the true Israelites. Ultimately, the commentators assert that God accepts believers as the children of the promise, while unbelievers are rejected.
