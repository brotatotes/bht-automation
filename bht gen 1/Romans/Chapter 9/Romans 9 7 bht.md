# Romans 9:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Bible verse being described emphasizes that being a true child of Abraham does not solely depend on physical lineage, but on a deeper spiritual connection. Commentators highlight that the promise of being called Abraham's seed was fulfilled through Isaac, not Ishmael, emphasizing the concept of selection and divine election. The verse challenges the assumption that all descendants of Abraham automatically inherit the promise, highlighting the significance of being chosen by God as true inheritors of the covenant.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Not in the line of mere fleshly descent from Abraham does the election run; else Ishmael, Hagar's child, and even Keturah's children, would be included, which they were not."
2. "The true election are such of Abraham's seed as God unconditionally chooses, as exemplified in that promise."
3. "In Isaac shall thy seed be called."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Are they all children - Adopted into the true family of God."
2. "But in Isaac - This was the promise; Genesis 21:12."
3. "Shall thy seed ... - Thy true people. This implied a selection, or choice; and therefore the doctrine of election was illustrated in the very commencement of the history of the nation."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The general principle asserted is that the true sonship of Abraham does not rest on bodily descent."
2. "In the person of Isaac, the descendant of Abraham will be represented and recognized."
3. "The promise was made after Isaac was born."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The seed of Abraham. A well-known phrase, here meaning, as the context shows, 'the physical posterity of Abraham'; in Galatians 3:29, the phrase is used of his true spiritual descendants."
2. "All children; in the true, spiritual sense, inheritors of the promise made to him."
3. "In Isaac shall thy seed be called. Spoken to Abraham (Genesis 21:12), at the time when Hagar and Ishmael were sent away. Explanations: 1. In the person of Isaac shall thy seed be named. 2. Through Isaac shall the race be born which shall be truly and properly called thy seed."

### John Wesley:
1. "Neither because they are lineally the seed of Abraham, will it follow that they are all children of God." 
2. "This did not hold even in Abraham's own family; and much less in his remote descendants." 
3. "But God then said, 'In Isaac shall thy seed be called' - That is, Isaac, not Ishmael, shall be called thy seed; that seed to which the promise is made."
