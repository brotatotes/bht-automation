# Romans 9:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, the commentators make it clear that being a physical descendant of Abraham does not automatically make one a true child of God. The promise of God's inheritance is reserved for those who are spiritually connected to Abraham, a chosen and special seed. The selection of Isaac as the seed signifies God's sovereign choice, highlighting the importance of divine election and the fulfillment of His promise. Thus, this verse emphasizes that true lineage is not determined by flesh and blood, but by being spiritually united with God's chosen people.

### Henry Alford:
1. "Those only shall be called truly and properly, for the purposes of the covenant, thy seed, who are descended from Isaac, not those from Ishmael or any other son."
2. "In Isaac shall thy seed be called" - this means that only those who are descendants of Isaac will inherit the promise.
3. Thol. renders καλεῖν here by erwecken, 'to raise up' - implying that being called as the seed of Abraham is a special and elevated status.

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Not in the line of mere fleshly descent from Abraham does the election run; else Ishmael, Hagar's child, and even Keturah's children, would be included, which they were not."
2. "The true election are such of Abraham's seed as God unconditionally chooses, as exemplified in that promise."

### Albert Barnes:

2. "But in Isaac - This was the promise; Genesis 21:12."
3. "Shall thy seed ... - Thy true people. This implied a selection, or choice; and therefore the doctrine of election was illustrated in the very commencement of the history of the nation."

### John Calvin:
1. "Paul mentions this, to show that the hidden election of God overrules the outward calling, and that it is yet by no means inconsistent with it, but, on the contrary, that it tends to its confirmation and completion."
2. "For if there ought to have been any natural progeny, which fell not away from the covenant; this ought to have been especially the case with those who obtained the privilege at first."
3. "It hence follows, that some men are by special privilege elected out of the chosen people, in whom the common adoption becomes efficacious and valid."

2. "All children; in the true, spiritual sense, inheritors of the promise made to him."
3. "In Isaac shall thy seed be called. Spoken to Abraham (Genesis 21:12), at the time when Hagar and Ishmael were sent away. Explanations: 1. In the person of Isaac shall thy seed be named. 2. Through Isaac shall the race be born which shall be truly and properly called thy seed."

### John Gill:
1. "Being Abraham's seed, they were his natural children, and the children of God by national adoption; but, they were not all the spiritual children of Abraham, nor the children of God by the special grace of adoption."
