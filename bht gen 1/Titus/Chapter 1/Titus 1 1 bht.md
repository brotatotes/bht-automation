## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:

Romans 1:5); and (2) the production in believers of a full knowledge (not ‘acknowledging’) of the truth, or entire Gospel revelation."

### John Gill:
1. "Paul, before his conversion, was a servant of sin, of divers lusts and pleasures, and which he owns in this epistle, Titus 3:3 but being called by grace, he became free from the vassalage of sin, and became a servant of God, and of righteousness."
2. "And an apostle of Jesus Christ: constituted, qualified, and sent by him to preach his Gospel; and who had his mission, commission, and doctrine from him; and was an ambassador of his, who represented him, and preached him; and had a power of working miracles to confirm his mission and ministry."
