# Titus 1:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse in question is a unique combination of faith and knowledge, as the writer is an apostle according to both the faith and truth held by God's elect. The aim of the apostleship is to produce genuine faith in the chosen ones and to impart a full knowledge of the truth. This faith and knowledge is intended to lead to godliness, aligning with the vital and spiritual worship of God. Additionally, the verse emphasizes that this faith and knowledge is based on God's eternal election.

2. "According to (better, ‘with a view to’), introduces the double design of his apostle-ship, viz: (1) the production of faith in God’s chosen ones (or of that genuine faith which only the chosen have) (cf.
