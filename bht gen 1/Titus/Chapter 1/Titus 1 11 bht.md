# Titus 1:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, there is a call to silence those who spread false teachings, described as stopping their mouths or muzzling their words. These individuals are depicted as subverting families and overthrowing their beliefs, causing harm to households. Motivated by their pursuit of personal gain, they teach things contrary to God's truth and sound doctrine. To curb their destructive influence, there is a need for discipline and restraint, like putting a bit into the mouth of an unruly horse, to ensure that their unruly tendencies are controlled.
