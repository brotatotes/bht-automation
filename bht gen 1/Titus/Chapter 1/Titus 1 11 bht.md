# Titus 1:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, commentators describe a situation where certain individuals must be silenced and restrained because of the harm they cause. Their teachings corrupt entire families, undermine domestic authority, and promote harmful and pernicious ideas. The commentators suggest that just as a bit is used to control an unruly horse, these individuals need to be muzzled and silenced through the use of sound arguments and reasoning based on the scriptures. The imagery of stopping their mouths serves as a reminder for all to exercise restraint and thoughtfulness in our own speech.
