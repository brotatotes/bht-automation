# Titus 1:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This verse describes a group of people known for their habit of lying, to the point where it became a governing vice in their society. They were even proverbially referred to as liars, much like other countries are known for their distinctive vices. The mention of evil wild beasts may refer to both literal wild creatures and the savage nature of these Cretians. Interestingly, the verse also mentions a Cretan sage who was considered a prophet and revered for his predictions.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "To Cretanize" was proverbial for to lie: as "to Corinthianize" was for to be dissolute.
2. "They love 'fables' (Titus 1:14); even the heathen poets laughed at their lying assertion that they had in their country the sepulchre of Jupiter."
3. "Crete was a country without wild beasts. Epimenides' sarcasm was that its human inhabitants supplied the place of wild beasts."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The hexameter verse quoted is from a lost poem by Epimenides, a Cretan sage of the sixth century B.C., who is well called 'a prophet of their own,' for he is described by classic writers as a philosophic seer and priest, venerated for his predictions, around whose memory popular legends gathered, and to whom almost sacred honours came to be paid." 

2. "Impossible to infer that Paul ascribed an inspired character to heathen sages."

3. "The vices here ascribed to the national character (falsehood, violence, and gluttony) find confirmation from other authors."

### John Gill:
1. "The Cretians are always liars: living is a sin common to human nature, and appears in men as early, or earlier than any other; and all men are guilty of it, at one time or another; but all are not habitually liars, as it seems these Cretians were: lying was a governing vice among them."
2. "Some countries are distinguished by their vices; some for pride; some for levity, vanity, and inconstancy; some for boasting and bragging some for covetousness; some for idleness; some for effeminacy; some for hypocrisy and deceit; and others, as the Cretians, it seems, for lying; this was their national sin."
3. "By evil beasts are meant beasts of prey, savage and mischievous ones; and are so called, to distinguish them from other beasts, as sheep, and the like, which are not so; and perhaps Crete might abound with such evil beasts; for the Cretians are said to excel in hunting."

### John Wesley:
1. "A prophet — So all poets were anciently called." 
2. "Diogenes Laertius says that Epimenides, the Cretan poet, foretold many things." 
3. "Evil wild beasts — Fierce and savage."
