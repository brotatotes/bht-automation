# Titus 1:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Bible verse emphasizes that purity is determined by the disposition of the individual, not the inherent nature of things. It suggests that to those with a purified heart, all external things are pure and can be used without contamination. However, those who are tainted by sin or lack faith find impurity in everything, as their own nature corrupts even the most innocent objects. Ultimately, the verse highlights the role of faith and personal holiness in perceiving the purity or impurity of the world around us.
