# Titus 1:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, we learn that for those who are pure in heart and faith, everything in life is pure and can be used for their benefit. On the contrary, for those who are tainted by impurity and lack faith, nothing in life can be seen as pure or beneficial. Impurity affects not only one's actions but also their self-perception, making it impossible for them to see anything as pure or good. This distinction of purity lies in the disposition of the individual, not in the objects themselves, and a truly pure mind can find grace in all things.
