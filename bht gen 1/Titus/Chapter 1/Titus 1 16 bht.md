# Titus 1:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, individuals are described as professing or confessing their knowledge of God, but their actions deny Him. Their theoretical knowledge does not align with their practical knowledge of God. These individuals are referred to as abominable, emphasizing their heinous sins and the disgust that a pure mind feels towards them. They are also described as reprobates, rejected after trial, lacking in genuine spiritual knowledge of God and living their lives in contradiction to their profession.

2. "deny him—the opposite of the previous 'profess' or 'confess' Him."
3. "abominable—themselves, though laying so much stress on the contracting of abomination from outward things."

### John Gill:
1. "They profess that they know God,.... That there is a God; that there is but one, only, true, and living God, the God of Israel, as professed by the Jews; and that this God is Father, Son, and Spirit, as believed by the Christians: for the persons the apostle speaks of were judaizing Christians."

2. "Yet this knowledge was but notional; it lay in theory and profession only; they had not a spiritual experimental knowledge of God in Christ, which only has eternal life connected with it."

3. "They were not professed, but practical atheists; they owned there was a God, and boasted of their knowledge of him; but their lives and conversations showed that they had no true knowledge of him, and that the fear of him was not before their eyes; these gave the lie to their profession."
