# Titus 1:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In due times and according to God's commandment, the Gospel is revealed, making known the promise of eternal life and the fullness of Christ's grace. The preaching of the Gospel, entrusted to humanity, serves as the vehicle for the manifestation of God's word, unveiling His eternal purpose and bringing forth the truth that leads to godliness. This divine commission, agreed upon by the Father and the Son, aligns perfectly with the particularities of human existence and the need for redemption.
