# Titus 1:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, the Apostle Paul left Titus behind on an island to continue the work he had begun, setting things in order and establishing the church. It was crucial to organize the church properly, appointing Church officers, such as elders or bishops, to preserve pure doctrine and provide guidance. This appointment aimed to prevent idle talk, promote faithful teaching, and correct behavior. The task was to form the young converts into a Gospel order, instruct them in sound doctrine, and direct their faith and practice through proper discipline.
