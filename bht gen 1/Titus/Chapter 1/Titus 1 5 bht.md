# Titus 1:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, the author left Titus behind in Crete to address certain deficiencies in the churches. Titus was instructed to appoint elders in each city and continue the work of setting things in order. These elders were to be men of integrity, chosen from among the faithful, to oversee and guide the churches. The Apostle Paul entrusted Titus with the task of establishing proper church order and appointing qualified leaders to preserve and teach sound doctrine.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "For this reason I left thee behind in Crete that thou mightest carry forward the correction of those things which are defective."
2. "Mightest appoint city by city elders."
3. "As I prescribed to thee."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The word rendered 'set in order,' ἐπιδιορθώσῃ epidiorthōsē, occurs nowhere else in the New Testament. It means, properly, 'to make straight upon, and then to put further to rights, to arrange further.'" 
2. "The word 'ordain' has now acquired a technical signification which it cannot be shown that it has in the New Testament. It means, in common usage, to 'invest with a ministerial function or sacerdotal power...'; but the word used here does not necessarily convey this meaning, or imply that Titus was to go through what would now be called an ordination service."
3. "That the same rank is denoted also by the terms Presbyter and Bishop here, is further apparent because the qualifications which Paul states as requisite for the 'bishop' are not those which pertain to a prelate or a diocesan bishop, but to one who was a pastor of a church, or an evangelist."

### Marvin Vincent:
