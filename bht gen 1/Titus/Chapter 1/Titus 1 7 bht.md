# Titus 1:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In describing the qualifications of a bishop, commentators recognize the importance of an unblemished reputation and the responsibility of governing the house of God. They highlight the interchangeable use of the terms bishop and elder, emphasizing the need to adhere to the language of the Holy Spirit. The qualities required include being blameless, not self-willed, and not easily provoked to anger. A bishop must be a faithful steward, not driven by personal gain, but rather focused on the edification and welfare of others.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "For it behoves an overseer to be blameless, as God’s steward, not self-willed, not soon provoked, not a brawler, not a striker, not greedy of gain, but hospitable, a lover of good, self-restrained, just, holy, continent, holding fast." 
2. "The faithful word which is according to the instruction, that he may be able both to exhort in healthy teaching and to reprove the gainsayers."
3. "The overseer is not merely a servant and commissioned agent of the Church. According to the Apostle’s teaching, church government does not grow up out of the ground."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The reason why I said 'blameless,' is the very idea of a 'bishop' involves the necessity for such blamelessness, if he is to have influence over the flock."
2. "The Church is God's house, over which the minister is set as a steward."
3. "Not making the Gospel a means of gain. In opposition to those 'teaching for filthy lucre's sake'."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "A man, in order to perform the duties of such an office, should be one against whom no accusation could lie." 
2. "The gist of the offence - the very 'head and front' - is that of being self-complacent; a trait of character which, of necessity, makes a man imperious, dogmatical, impatient of contradiction, and unyielding."
3. "Such a man, evidently, is not fit for the office of a minister of the gospel."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The qualifications of the elders are fixed by those of the bishop."
2. "The overseers must have the qualifications of approved presbyters."
3. "Self-willed. Only here and 2 Peter 2:10 (note)."
4. "Soon angry. Rarely in LXX and Class. Irascible."

### John Calvin:
1. "For a bishop ought to be blameless, as a governor of the house of God." - The commentary emphasizes the importance of a bishop having an unspotted reputation, as they are appointed to govern the house of God.

2. "The office of a bishop...is a government of the house of God." - This quote highlights the honorable nature of the role of a bishop, as they are entrusted with the responsibility of governing the household of God.

3. "There is no distinction between a presbyter and a bishop." - The commentary challenges the distinction made between presbyters and bishops, arguing that the Holy Spirit uses both terms interchangeably without any distinction. This challenges the prevailing custom and emphasizes the need to adhere to the language of the Holy Spirit.

Note: The commentary also discusses the vice of self-will and the corruption in the ancient Church where one individual was called bishop, but these quotes do not significantly contribute to the understanding of the verse.

1. "As the steward of God — To whom he intrusts immortal souls."
