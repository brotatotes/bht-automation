# Titus 2:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Bible verse describes the manifestation of God's grace as a transformative education, a discipline that requires self-denial and training in godliness. This grace, embodied in Jesus, brings salvation to all people and is the ultimate ground of redemption. It is a guiding light that illuminates the way to holy living, available to people from all walks of life. The Gospel, the declaration of God's grace, not only proclaims the message of salvation but also empowers the hearts of believers. Like the dawning of a new day, this grace breaks through the darkness and shines brightly for all to see.
