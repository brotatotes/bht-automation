## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "The education which the Christian receives from 'the grace' of God is a discipline often trying to flesh and blood: just as children need disciplining."
2. "The discipline which it exercises teaches us to deny ungodliness and worldly lusts, and to live soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present world where such self-discipline is needed."
3. "We deny 'worldly lusts' when we withhold our consent from them, when we refuse the delight which they suggest, and the act to which they solicit us, nay, tear them up by the roots out of our soul and mind."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The saving economy of God is educative." 
2. "Ungodliness: the contrary of eujsebeia." 
3. "Worldly lusts: the phrase N. T. o. Kosmikov worldly."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The design of the Gospel epiphany of grace was to tutor or discipline men into virtue." 
2. "God's grace in Christ is pædagogic, disciplinary, practical." 
3. "The end or design of such discipline is given negatively and positively: (1) 'Having denied' the old unconverted life... we should (2) live with due control over ourselves, (b) with due regard for others' rights, and (c) with due piety or devotedness to the Divine honour."

### John Gill:
1. "The persons effectually taught by the Gospel are the 'us', to whom it was come, not in word only, but in power."
2. "To 'deny' these [ungodliness and worldly lusts], is to abhor and detest them, and to abstain from them, and have nothing to do with them."
3. "The Gospel then is no licentious doctrine; it is according to godliness, and teaches and promotes it; it is a holy faith."

### John Wesley:
1. "We should live soberly - In all purity and holiness. Sobriety, in the scripture sense, is rather the whole temper of a man, than a single virtue in him."
2. "Sobriety is no less than all the powers of the soul being consistently and constantly awake, duly governed by heavenly prudence, and entirely conformable to holy affections."
3. "And righteously - Doing to all as we would they should do to us. And godly - As those who are consecrated to God both in heart and life."
