# Titus 2:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This Bible verse speaks about the discipline and education that Christians receive through the grace of God. By denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, they live a sober, righteous, and godly life. This discipline entails abstaining from and detesting such desires, while also prudently and justly carrying out their duties towards others. The Gospel promotes godliness and teaches believers to live with self-control and piety, cultivating purity and holiness in all aspects of life.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "The education which the Christian receives from 'the grace' of God is a discipline often trying to flesh and blood: just as children need disciplining."
2. "The discipline which it exercises teaches us to deny ungodliness and worldly lusts, and to live soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present world where such self-discipline is needed."
3. "We deny 'worldly lusts' when we withhold our consent from them, when we refuse the delight which they suggest, and the act to which they solicit us, nay, tear them up by the roots out of our soul and mind."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "That denying ungodliness and worldly lusts - 'That by denying ourselves of these, or refusing to practice them, we should lead a holy life.'"
2. "We should live soberly - It means that we should exercise a due restraint on our passions and propensities."
3. "Righteously - Justly - This refers to the proper performance of our duties to our fellow-men; and it means that religion teaches us to perform those duties with fidelity, according to all our relations in life."

### Marvin Vincent:

### John Calvin:

2. "Piety is religion towards God. Righteousness has place among men. He who is endowed with both of these lacks nothing for perfect virtue."

2. "God’s grace in Christ is pædagogic, disciplinary, practical."

### John Gill:
1. "The persons effectually taught by the Gospel are the 'us', to whom it was come, not in word only, but in power."
