## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The forcible 'Himself, His whole self, the greatest gift ever given,' must not be overlooked."
2. "An appropriate image in addressing bond-servants: from all iniquity—the essence of sin, namely, 'transgression of the law': in bondage to which we were till then."
3. "The aim of His redemption was to redeem us, not merely from the penalty, but from the being of all iniquity."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Unto himself;” that is, they are no longer to be regarded as their own, but as redeemed for his own service, and for the promotion of his glory." - Notes, 1 Corinthians 6:19-20.

2. "It does not mean, as the word would seem to imply - and as is undoubtedly true - that they are to be a unique people in the sense that they are to be unlike others, or to have views and principles unique to themselves; but that they belong to the Saviour in contradistinction from belonging to themselves." - Notes, 1 Peter 2:9.

3. "This passage, therefore, should not be used to prove that Christians should be unlike others in their manner of living, but that they belong to Christ as his redeemed people." - Notes, 1 Peter 2:9.

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Gave himself for us [εδωκεν εαυτον υπερ ημων]. See on 1 Timothy 2:6, and comp. Galatians 1:4. Uper on behalf of; not instead of."
2. "Might redeem [λυτρωσηται]. Only here, Luke 24:21; 1 Peter 1:18. See on 1 Timothy 2:6. Neither lutron ransom, lutrwsiv redemption, nor lutrwthv redeemer occur in Paul."
3. "A peculiar people (laon periousion). Laov people only here in Pastorals. In Paul ten times, always in citations. Most frequently in Luke and Acts; often in Hebrews and Revelation. Periousiov N. T. o. A few times in LXX, always with laov. See Exodus 19:5; Exodus 23:22; Deuteronomy 7:6; Deuteronomy 14:2; Deuteronomy 26:18. The phrase was originally applied to the people of Israel, but is transferred here to believers in the Messiah - Jews and Gentiles."

### John Calvin:
1. "His grace, therefore, necessarily brings along with it 'newness of life,' because they who still are the slaves of sin make void the blessing of redemption."
2. "A peculiar people, zealous of good works; by which he means that, so far as concerns us, the fruit of redemption is lost, if we are still entangled by the sinful desires of the world."
3. "It is as certain as any word the mouth of God hath spoken, that 'there is no peace to the wicked.' A guilty conscience, and an impure, will keep up the amity with Satan and enmity with God."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Who gave himself for us" - Paul's great doctrine (Galatians 1:4; Galatians 2:20; 1 Timothy 2:6).

2. "That he might redeem us" - Final clause, ινα and the aorist middle subjunctive of λυτροω, old verb from λυτρον (ransom), in N.T. only here, Luke 24:21; 1 Peter 1:18.

3. "A people for his own possession" - A late word (from περιειμ, to be over and above, in papyri as well as περιουσια), only in LXX and here, apparently made by the LXX, one's possession, and so God's chosen people. See 1 Peter 2:9 (λαος εις περιποιησιν).

### John Gill:
1. "Not another, or another's, but himself; not merely his own things, but his own self; not the world, and the riches of it, not gold and silver, and such like corruptible things, as the price of redemption; not the cattle on a thousand hills for sacrifice; not men nor angels, but himself." 
2. "Christ was made sin, and a curse for his people, that he might redeem them from both, and deliver them from the punishment due to sin; which he has done by bearing it in his own body on the tree."
3. "Christ has a peculiar people among these, a church whom he loves, and for whom he has given himself, that he might sanctify and cleanse them from their sins; which he has done by shedding his blood for them, and washing them in it, which cleanses from all sin."

### John Wesley:
1. "Who gave himself for us — To die in our stead." This quote highlights the selfless act of Jesus sacrificing himself for humanity, taking on the punishment that we deserved.
2. "That he might redeem us — Miserable bondslaves." This quote emphasizes the idea that Jesus' sacrifice was to free us from the bondage of sin, offering redemption and liberation.
3. "As well from the power and the very being, as from the guilt, of all our sins." This quote suggests that Jesus' sacrifice not only forgives our sins but also breaks the power and hold that sin has over us, allowing us to live a transformed life.
