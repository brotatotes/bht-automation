# Titus 2:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As ministers of God's word, we are called to speak with vigor and authority, commanding respect and admonishing others when necessary. We must proclaim sound doctrine boldly and faithfully, rebuking with all authority those who stray from the truth. It is vital that our actions align with our words, living in a way that no one can despise us, even though opposition and criticism may arise from those who do not know God. We are to strive to live above reproach, reflecting the character of Christ and effectively representing the Gospel message.
