## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Workers at home": active in household duties (Proverbs 7:11; 1 Timothy 5:13).
2. "Good": kind, beneficent (Matthew 20:15; Romans 5:7; 1 Peter 2:18). Not churlish and niggardly, but thrifty as housewives.
3. "Obedient": rather "submissive," as the Greek is translated; (see on 1 Peter 2:18; Ephesians 5:22; Colossians 3:18).
4. "Their own": marking the duty of subjection which they owe them, as being their own husbands (Ephesians 5:22; Colossians 3:18).
5. "Blasphemed": "evil spoken of." That no reproach may be cast on the Gospel, through the inconsistencies of its professors (Titus 2:8; Titus 2:10; Romans 2:24; 1 Timothy 5:14; 1 Timothy 6:1). "Unless we are virtuous, blasphemy will come through us to the faith" [THEOPHYLACT].

### John Calvin:
