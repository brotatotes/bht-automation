# Titus 2:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Servants are instructed to please their masters in all things, seeking to gain their goodwill and approval. This does not mean compromising moral integrity, but rather carrying out their duties in a way that is both respectful and obedient. They are encouraged to refrain from arguing or contradicting their masters, as well as from any dishonest or deceitful behavior. The goal is to cultivate a spirit of submission and integrity, adorning the teachings of Christ in their everyday lives.
