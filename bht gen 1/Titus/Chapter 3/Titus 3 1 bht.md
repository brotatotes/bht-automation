## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson Fausset Brown:
1. "Put them in mindâ€”as they are in danger of forgetting their duty, though knowing it."
2. "The opposition of Christianity to heathenism, and the natural disposition to rebellion of the Jews under the Roman empire (of whom many lived in Crete), might lead many to forget practically what was a recognized Christian principle in theory, submission to the powers that be."
3. "Willing obedience is implied in 'ready to every good work.' Compare Titus 3:1, as showing that obedience to the magistracy would tend to good works, since the magistrate's aim generally is to favor the good and punish the bad."

### Philip Schaff:

3. "It included also large numbers of Jews, the most seditious of the subjects of the Empire. It was secretly spread over many provinces, and bound its converts in a society, with pass-words and an organization of its own, which might be easily abused for political ends by agitators, and which could scarcely fail to awaken suspicion in the government."

### John Gill:
1. "Put them in mind to be subject to principalities and powers... the higher powers ordained of God."
