In this Bible verse, the passage refers to a person who holds divergent beliefs or practices, promoting divisions within the church. These heretics combine moral corruption with their erroneous teachings, their actions serving as evidence against their doctrine. Recognizing their distorted mindset and sinful nature, it is advised to confront and admonish them, giving them an opportunity to repent.
