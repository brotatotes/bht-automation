# Titus 3:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, a heretic is described as someone who stubbornly holds their own opinion in defiance of the teachings accepted by the church, leading to divisions and disputes. They go against fundamental doctrines, particularly those relating to the Trinity and the person of Christ. The recommended response to such individuals is to reject them after offering admonition and having no further association with them. This verse emphasizes the negative consequences of self-will and argues against the Popish definition of heresy as mere difference in fundamental beliefs.
