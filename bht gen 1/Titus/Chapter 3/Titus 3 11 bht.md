# Titus 3:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The passage being described presents a picture of someone who has gone astray, become morally corrupted, and is aware of their own wrongdoing. This person is like a decaying building that is beyond repair, having opposed the teachings or principles they themselves acknowledge as true. Their own conscience condemns them, as they are fully convinced within themselves that their actions are morally wrong. Their persistence in their perverse ways only leads to self-condemnation, demonstrating their desperate and hopeless condition.
