# Titus 3:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse described in the commentaries highlights a person who is self-condemned and morally corrupted. This individual is aware of their wrongdoing and feels guilt within themselves, as their own conscience serves as a witness to their actions. They have become perverse and separated themselves not only from the faith but also from the church itself. There is no hope of restoration or recovery for this person who continues in their sinful ways despite frequent admonition.
