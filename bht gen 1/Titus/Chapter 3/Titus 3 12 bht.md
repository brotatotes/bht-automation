# Titus 3:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this verse, Paul instructs Titus to hasten to him to Nicopolis and sends greetings to Artemas and Zenas, who are both mentioned as ministers of the Gospel. Nicopolis is believed to be the city in Epirus named after the battle of Actium, signifying victory. This request suggests that Paul desired Titus's assistance in ministry or to obtain an update on the state of the churches in Crete. The mention of wintering in Nicopolis indicates Paul's intention to continue his work there during the season.
