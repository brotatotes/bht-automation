# Titus 3:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this Bible verse, Paul is making arrangements for Titus and another minister to take over in Crete. John Wesley suggests that Titus was an evangelist, traveling from place to place, assisting the apostles. Furthermore, there is discussion about which Nicopolis is being referenced, with John Gill stating that it may be the town in Epirus founded in memory of the battle of Actium. The reasons for having Titus come to Paul could be to assess the state of the churches in Crete or to provide assistance or send him elsewhere.

2. "Very probably not the Nicopolis in Macedonia, as the vulgar subscription asserts: (indeed, none of those subscriptions at the end of St. Paul's epistles are of any authority:) rather it was a town of the same name which lay upon the sea-coast of Epirus."
3. "Hence it appears, he was not there yet; if so, he would have said, to winter here. Consequently, this letter was not written from thence."
