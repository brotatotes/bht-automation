# Titus 3:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The verse being described here is a powerful reminder that salvation is not earned through our own works or righteousness, but rather through the kindness, love, and grace of God. It emphasizes the importance of baptism as a sacrament that signifies and seals our regeneration, renewal, and sanctification. The outward act of baptism is not the source of these blessings, but rather the means through which the Holy Spirit works in us, ultimately leading to our justification and acceptance before God.
