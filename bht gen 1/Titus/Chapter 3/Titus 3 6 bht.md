# Titus 3:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The pouring out of the Spirit includes the grace received before and after baptism, as well as the abundant and richly communication of grace. This pouring out is a significant metaphor, encompassing both Old Testament references and the events of Pentecost. It is an act in which the Father, through the mediation and merits of Christ, pours out the Holy Spirit as a channel of love and grace. This pouring out not only takes place collectively on Pentecost but also in the hearts of individuals who are regenerated and renewed, receiving every supply of grace from the hands of God.
