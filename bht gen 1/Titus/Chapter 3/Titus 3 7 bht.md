# Titus 3:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This verse speaks of our justification through the grace of God, which is not earned through human effort but declared through regeneration. Through this justification, we are made heirs of eternal life, a free gift bestowed upon believers by God. The process of regeneration shows us as adopted children and justifies us, giving us the right and opportunity to enjoy the inheritance of eternal life in accordance with the justice and holiness of God.
