# Titus 3:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Through the grace of God, believers are justified, not through their own works. This justification is a declarative one, revealing the righteousness received through regeneration. In this state, believers are made heirs, sharing in the hope of eternal life. This inheritance is freely given, not earned through labor, and is a result of God's act of adoption. The connection between practical admonition and the rich doctrines of Gospel grace and the privileges of the children of God is characteristic of Paul's writing.
