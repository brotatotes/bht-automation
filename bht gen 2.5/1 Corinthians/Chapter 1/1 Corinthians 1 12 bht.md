# 1 Corinthians 1:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Corinthians were divided into factions, each claiming allegiance to a different leader - Paul, Apollos, Cephas, or Christ. These designations were not necessarily formal parties, but rather represented the spirit of contention among them. Paul refused to be flattered by those who made his name their party cry, emphasizing that their allegiance should be to Christ alone. The followers of Apollos preferred his more philosophical preaching, while some boasted of being exclusively followers of Christ. This partisan use of Christ's name added another party to the existing divisions. The unity of the Church should be centered on Christ, not on human leaders.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "You are all in the habit of alleging against one another, some your special attachment to Paul, some to Apollos, some to Cephas, others to no mere human teacher, but barely to Christ, to the exclusion of us his Apostles."
2. "These designations are not used as pointing to actual parties formed and subsisting among the Corinthians, but as representing the spirit with which they contended against one another, being the sayings of individuals, and not of parties."
3. "You are all in the habit of alleging against one another, some your special attachment to Paul, some to Apollos, some to Cephas, others to no mere human teacher, but barely to Christ, to the exclusion of us his Apostles."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Paul will not allow himself to be flattered even by those who made his name their party cry, so as to connive at the dishonor thereby done to Christ." 
2. "Apollos, doubtless, did not willingly foster this spirit of undue preference; nay, to discourage it, he would not repeat his visit just then."
3. "If it be wrong to boast 'I am of Peter,' how much more so to boast 'I am of the Pope!'"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "I am of Paul - It has been doubted whether Paul meant to affirm that the parties had actually taken the names which he here specifies, or whether he uses these names as illustrations, or suppositions, to show the absurdity of their ranging themselves under different leaders." 
2. "It can scarcely be doubted that Paul here meant to say that there were parties existing in the church at Corinth, who were called by the names of himself, of Apollos, of Cephas, and of Christ." 
3. "Why this sect professed to be the followers of Christ, is not certainly known."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "What I mean is this."
2. "The followers of Apollos preferred his more philosophical and rhetorical preaching to the simpler and more direct utterances of Paul."
3. "The state of the Corinthian church offered the most favorable ground for Paul's Jewish-Christian adversaries, who took advantage of the reaction created by the looser views and practice of Gentile Christians."

### John Calvin:
1. "My reason for saying that there are contentions among you is, because every one of you glories in the name of some individual."
2. "In any other point of view it is not likely that there were any parties that espoused the separate interests of ministers joined together by a sacred agreement."
3. "The unity of the Church consists more especially in this one thing — that we all depend upon Christ alone, and that men thus occupy an inferior place, so as not to detract in any degree from his pre-eminence."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "People naturally have different tastes about styles of preaching and that is well."
2. "This partisan use of the name of Christ may have been made in the name of unity against the other three factions, but it merely added another party to those existing."
3. "In scouting the names of the other leaders they lowered the name and rank of Christ to their level."

### John Gill:
1. "He was the minister for them, and they were desirous of being called and distinguished by his name."
2. "His bodily presence weak, made no figure in the pulpit; his speech low and contemptible; his discourses plain, not having that flow of words, and accuracy of expression, as Apollos had."
3. "They were for Christ without his ministers; they were wiser than their teachers; they were above being under any ministrations and ordinances."

### John Wesley:
1. "Now this I say — That is, what I mean is this: there are various parties among you, who set themselves, one against an other, in behalf of the several teachers they admire."
2. "And I of Christ — They spoke well, if they had not on this pretence despised their teachers."
3. "Perhaps they valued themselves on having heard Christ preach in his own person."
