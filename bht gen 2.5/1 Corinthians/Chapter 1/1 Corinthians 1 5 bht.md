# 1 Corinthians 1:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Corinthians were commended for being rich in the preaching of the word and in their understanding of it. They were enriched by God's abundant mercies and were bestowed with the power of speech and knowledge. The apostle Paul expressed gratitude for their aptitude in giving utterance to divine truth and their apprehension of the truth. The Corinthians had a spiritual experiential knowledge of the Gospel and possessed gifts of knowledge, elocution, and utterance. These gifts were admired by the Corinthians and served as a foundation for the reproofs that would follow.
