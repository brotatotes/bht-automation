# 1 Corinthians 10:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The sin of Baal-peor, which involved idolatry and fornication, serves as a warning to the Corinthians about the dangers of practicing sexual immorality. The connection between idolatry and fornication was close, as prostitution was even part of the worship in Corinth. The punishment for this vice was severe, with twenty-three thousand perishing in one day. The discrepancy in the number of deaths is reconciled by the fact that the actual number likely fell between twenty-three thousand and twenty-four thousand. This serves as a reminder of the seriousness of fornication and the need to avoid it.
