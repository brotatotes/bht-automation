# 1 Corinthians 11:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the Christian life, neither sex is independent or superior to the other. The man and the woman are designed for union and society, with each being necessary for the comfort and well-being of the other. This arrangement is not a result of cultural norms, but rather an appointment and command of the Lord. Christianity recognizes and strengthens the original plan of humanity, where the man and the woman are mutually dependent and should treat each other with respect and promote each other's welfare. In Christ, there is no distinction of sex, as all are equal and united.
