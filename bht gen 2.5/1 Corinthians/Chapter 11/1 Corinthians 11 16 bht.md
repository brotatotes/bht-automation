# 1 Corinthians 11:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
If anyone is contentious and disagrees with the reasons given, they are being self-sufficient and argumentative. The usage of true churches of God is a valid argument for external rites. The custom of women speaking unveiled was prevalent in the churches and is supported by the testimonies of Tertullian and Chrysostom. Contentiousness should be banished from the churches, and those who are obstinate and fond of quarrelling should be restrained. The custom of each place is of sufficient weight to determine prudent and peaceable men, but those who are contentious, not conscientious, should not be allowed to disturb the peace of the church.

1. "Contentious (œÜŒπŒªŒøŒΩŒµŒπŒ∫ŒøœÇ). Old adjective (œÜŒπŒªŒøœÉ, ŒΩŒµŒπŒ∫ŒøœÇ), fond of strife. Only here in N.T. If he only existed in this instance, the disputatious brother."
2. "Custom (œÉœÖŒΩŒ∑Œ∏ŒµŒπŒ±ŒΩ). Old word from œÉœÖŒΩŒ∑Œ∏Œ∑œÇ (œÉœÖŒΩ, Œ∑Œ∏ŒøœÇ), like Latin consuetudo, intercourse, intimacy. In N.T. only here and 1 Corinthians 8:7 which see."
3. "In the sculptures of the catacombs the women have a close-fitting head-dress, while the men have the hair short" (Vincent).
