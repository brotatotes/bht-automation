# 1 Corinthians 11:29 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Those who eat and drink without discerning the body of Christ bring judgment upon themselves. This judgment is not eternal damnation, but rather a temporal punishment or chastisement intended to prevent condemnation. The body of Christ is not physically present in the elements, but is spiritually present and must be appreciated and discerned by the soul. Eating and drinking unworthily at the Lord's table is injurious to oneself, not to others, and it stems from a failure to distinguish the Lord's supper from an ordinary meal. By not discerning the sacred tokens of the Lord's body, one fails to appreciate the depth and significance of the communion.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "For he who eats and drinks judgment to himself."
2. "κρῖμα , as is evident by 1 Corinthians 11:30-32 , is not ‘ damnation ’ ( κατάκριμα ), as rendered in our E. V., a mistranslation, which has done infinite mischief."
3. "The mystery of these, spiritually present in the elements, he, not being spiritual, does not appreciate."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The judgment is described as temporal." 
2. "He that eateth and drinketh, eateth and drinketh judgment to himself, IF he discern not the body."
3. "The Lord's body is His literal body appreciated and discerned by the soul in the faithful receiving, and not present in the elements themselves."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Eateth and drinketh damnation - This is evidently a figurative expression, meaning that by eating and drinking improperly he incurs condemnation."
2. "The word here used (κρῖμα krima) properly denotes judgment; the result of judging, that is, a sentence; then a sentence by which one is condemned, or condemnation; and then punishment."
3. "Not discerning the Lord’s body - Not discriminating between the bread which is used on this occasion and common and ordinary food."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "This false and horrible rendering has destroyed the peace of more sincere and earnest souls than any other misread passage in the New Testament."
2. "Krima is a temporary judgment, and so is distinguished from katakrima condemnation, from which this temporary judgment is intended to save the participant."
3. "Such also is the primary meaning of discern (discernere to part or separate), so that discerning implies a mental act of discriminating between different things."

### John Calvin:
1. "He who shall eat unworthily, eateth judgment to himself...this food, otherwise health-giving, will turn out to their destruction, and will be converted into poison to those that eat unworthily."
2. "They handle the precious body of Christ irreverently, that is to say, without washing their conscience."
3. "The body is presented to them, though their unworthiness deprives them of a participation in it."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "For he that eateth or drinketh, eateth and drinketh judgment unto himself, if he discern not the body."
2. "Discerning the body" sounds very abrupt to us who are accustomed to the fuller form; but it is perhaps all the more emphatic.
3. By "eating and drinking Judgment" is meant incurring the effects of the Divine displeasure.

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "If he discern not the body (μη διακρινων το σωμα). So-called conditional use of the participle, "not judging the body.""
2. "Thus he eats and drinks judgment (κριμα) on himself."
3. "Eating the bread and drinking the wine as symbols of the Lord's body and blood in death probes one's heart to the very depths."

### John Gill:
1. "nor is eternal damnation here meant; but with respect to the Lord's own people, who may through unbelief, the weakness of grace, and strength of corruption, behave unworthily at this supper, temporal chastisement, which is distinguished from condemnation with the world, and is inflicted in order to prevent it, 1 Corinthians 11:32" 
2. "he is injurious to nobody but himself: this may serve to make the minds of such easy, who are not so entirely satisfied with some persons who sit down with them at the Lord's table, when they consider that it is to their own injury, and not to the hurt of others they eat and drink"
3. "because they distinguish not the Lord's supper from an ordinary and common meal, but confound them together, as did many of the Corinthians, who also did not distinguish the body of Christ in it from the body of the paschal lamb; or discern not the body of Christ, and distinguish it from the bread, the sign or symbol of it"

### John Wesley:
1. "For he that eateth and drinketh so unworthily as those Corinthians did, eateth and drinketh judgment to himself." 
2. "Temporal judgments of various kinds." 
3. "Not distinguishing the sacred tokens of the Lord's body from his common food."
