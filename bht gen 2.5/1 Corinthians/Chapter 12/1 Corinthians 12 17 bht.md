### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The eye is the most wonderful organ and supremely useful, the very light of the body."
2. "And yet how grotesque it would be if there were nothing else but a great round rolling eye! A big 'I' surely!"

### John Gill:
1. "If the whole body were an eye,.... And nothing else, where were the hearing? there would be no ear, and so no sense of hearing." 
2. "If the whole were hearing: or only consisted of a member capable of the sense of hearing, where were the smelling? there would be no nose, the organ of smelling, and that sense would be wanting." 
3. "Thus if the church only consisted of ministers of the Gospel, of men of eminent light and knowledge, qualified for the preaching of the word to others, there would be no hearers; and on the other hand, if it only consisted of hearers, of such who only could hear the word to their own advantage, there would be none of a quick understanding, or of a quick smell to discern perverse things, to distinguish truth from error, to discern spirits, and direct the rest of the members to wholesome and savoury food, and preserve them from what would be hurtful and pernicious to them."
