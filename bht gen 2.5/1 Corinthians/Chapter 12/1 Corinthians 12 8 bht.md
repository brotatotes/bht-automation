# 1 Corinthians 12:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The distinction between the word of wisdom and the word of knowledge lies in their practical and theoretical aspects. The word of wisdom refers to the skill of organizing the Christian life according to foundational principles, while the word of knowledge pertains to understanding and insight into the Scriptures and the mind of God. These gifts are all given by the same Spirit and should not be a source of pride, as they are meant to be useful and necessary for the body of believers.
