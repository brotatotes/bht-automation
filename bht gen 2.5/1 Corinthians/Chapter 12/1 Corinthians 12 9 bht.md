## BHT:

It is characterized by a deep confidence in God's promises and the ability to rely on Him for supernatural acts. The gifts of healings mentioned refer to various types of diseases requiring different forms of healing. These gifts were bestowed by the Holy Spirit on early church leaders and were meant to demonstrate the power of God. This extraordinary trust in God and the ability to heal were seen as rare and valuable endowments in the early Christian community.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "A faith, enabling a man to place himself beyond the region of mere moral certainty, in the actual realization of things believed, in a high and unusual manner."
2. "In, i.e. by and through, as the effective cause and the medium."
3. "Gifts of (miraculous) healings; plur., to indicate the different kinds of diseases, requiring different sorts of healing."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Faith...confidence in God, by the impulse of His Spirit, that He would enable them to perform any required miracle."
2. "Its nature, or principle, is the same as that of saving faith, namely, reliance on God."
3. "Saving faith does not save by its intrinsic merit, but by the merits of Him who is the object of it."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Many of the most useful people in the church are distinguished mainly for their simple confidence in the promises of God; and often accomplish more by prayer and by their faith in God than others do who are distinguished for their wisdom and learning."
2. "Humble piety and reliance in the divine promises, and that measure of ardor, fearlessness, and zeal which result from such confidence; that belief that all obstacles must be and will be overcome that oppose the gospel; and that God will secure the advancement of his cause, will often do infinitely more in the promotion of his kingdom than the most splendid endowments of learning and talent."
3. "Faith is one of the highest endowments of the Christian life; and yet, though all may obtain it, it is one of the rarest endowments. Perhaps by many it is despised, because it may be obtained by all; because it is a grace in which the poor and the humble may be as much distinguished as the man of splendid talents and profound learning."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Faith. Not saving faith in general, which is the common endowment of all Christians, but wonder - working faith.


### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Faith (œÄŒπœÉœÑŒπœÇ). Not faith of surrender, saving faith, but wonder-working faith like that in 1 Corinthians 13:2 (Matthew 17:20; Matthew 21:21)." 
2. "Gifts of healings (œáŒ±œÅŒπœÉŒºŒ±œÑŒ± ŒπŒ±ŒºŒ±œÑœâŒΩ). ŒôŒ±ŒºŒ±, old word from ŒπŒ±ŒøŒºŒ±, common in LXX, in N.T. only in this chapter. It means acts of healing as in Acts 4:30 (cf. James 5:14) and Luke 7:21 (of Jesus)."
3. "Note ŒµŒΩ here as just before."

### John Gill:
1. "Not the grace of faith, which is common to all believers, though given by the same Spirit: but rather the doctrine of faith, and ability to preach it, and boldness and intrepidity of spirit to assert and defend it in the face of all opposition..."
2. "To another the gifts of healing by the same Spirit; of healing all manner of sicknesses and diseases..."
3. "Now these gifts were bestowed in common, by the Spirit, on apostles, prophets, and pastors, or elders of the church, in those early times..."

### John Wesley:
1. "Faith may here mean an extraordinary trust in God under the most difficult or dangerous circumstances."
2. "The gift of healing need not be wholly confined to the healing diseases with a word or a touch."
3. "And thus it may be with regard to other gifts likewise. As, after the golden shields were lost, the king of Judah put brazen in their place, so, after the pure gifts were lost, the power of God exerts itself in a more covert manner, under human studies and helps."
