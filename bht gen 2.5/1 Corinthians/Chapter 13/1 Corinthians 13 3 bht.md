# 1 Corinthians 13:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Acts of self-sacrifice, such as giving all one's possessions to the poor or even offering one's body to be burned, may seem commendable, but they are worthless without true love. Love is more valuable than any material possessions or acts of martyrdom. Without love, these deeds profit nothing and do not save a person. Love, as defined by the commandment to love God and one's neighbor, is indispensable, incomparable, and eternal. Even martyrdom, though esteemed highly, is regarded as nothing if it is not motivated by love. Ultimately, without love, all other actions and gifts are rejected by God and are of no benefit to oneself.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Both the deeds mentioned in this verse are such as ordinarily are held to be the fruits of love, but they may be done without it, and if so, are worthless."
2. "He evidently means in self-sacrifice: for country, or friends."
3. "It leaves παραδῶ standing in a very vague and undefined meaning 'deliver, to what?'"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "As the three youths did, 'yielded their bodies'... These are most noble exemplifications of love in giving and in suffering." 
2. "Yet they may be without love; in which case the 'goods' and 'body' are given, but not the soul, which is the sphere of love." 
3. "Without the soul God rejects all else, and so rejects the man, who is therefore 'profited' nothing."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "If all that a man had were dealt out in this way, in small portions, so as to benefit as many as possible, and yet were not attended 'with true love toward God and toward man,' it would be all false, hollow, hypocritical, and really of no value in regard to his own salvation."
2. "Though I should be willing to lay down my life in the most painful manner, and have not charity, it would profit me nothing."
3. "If there is no true piety, there can be no benefit in this to my soul. It will not save me. If I have no true love to God, I must perish, after all. 'Love,' therefore, is more valuable and precious than all these endowments."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The verb means to feed out in morsels, dole out."
2. "The change to burned might have been suggested by the copyist's familiarity with Christian martyrdoms."
3. "We are horrified to read in Cyprian's letter that even in prison, even when death was imminent, there were some of the confessors who were puffed up with vanity and pride."

### John Calvin:
1. "A work, otherwise so commendable, has, indeed, a fair show in the sight of men, and is applauded by them, and yet is regarded as nothing in the sight of God."
2. "Even martyrdom, the most lovely and excellent of all acts, is regarded as nothing, if the mind is destitute of love."
3. "As love is the only rule of our actions, and the only means of regulating the right use of the gifts of God, nothing, in the absence of it, is approved of by God."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "And though I bestow [1] all my goods to feed the poor, and though I give (‘deliver up’) my body to be burned [2] a practice not unknown even to heathenism, as witness Sutteeism in India, happily now abolished. In the early Church, martyrdom was held in such honour as at length to be fanatically coveted. Yet without love, this will avail me nothing."
2. "But what is the love meant here? Certainly, not mere natural benevolence, even in its most disinterested form. Fundamentally, it can only be what Israel was familiar with even from the days of their wilderness journeyings: 'Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart and soul and mind and strength, and thy neighbour as thyself.'"
3. "Such then, is the love here opened up in its varied outgoings towards our fellow-men, and held forth as indispensable, incomparable, eternal."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Bestow to feed, to nourish, from morsel or bit, and so to feed, by putting a morsel into the mouth like an infant (or bird)." 
2. "There were even some who courted martyrdom in later years (time of Diocletian)."
3. "I am helped nothing. Ουδεν in the accusative case retained with passive verb."

### John Gill:
1. "But of what avail was all this, when what these men did, they did not from a principle of love to God, nor to Christ, nor even to the poor, to whom they gave their substance; but to have honour and applause from men, and have and obtain eternal life hereafter?"
2. "The apostle here respects martyrdom, and by a prophetic spirit has respect to future times, when burning men's bodies for religion would be in use, which then was not; and suggests that there might be some, as according to ecclesiastical history there seems to have been some, who, from a forward and misguided zeal, and to get themselves a name, and leave one behind them, have exposed themselves to the flames, and yet 'have not' had 'charity', true love to God, a real affection for Christ, or to his saints."
3. "Such things may profit others, but not a man's self; giving all his goods to the poor may be of advantage to them, and giving his body to be burned in the cause of religion may be of service to others, to confirm their faith, and encourage them to like sufferings when called to them; but can be of no avail to themselves in the business of salvation; which is not procured by works of righteousness, even the best, and much less by such which proceed from wrong principles, and are directed to wrong ends; the grace of God being wanting, and particularly that of love."

### John Wesley:
1. "And though I — Deliberately, piece by piece. Give all my goods to feed the poor, yea, though I deliver up my body to be burned - Rather than I would renounce my religion."
2. "And have not the love — Hereafter described."
3. "It profiteth me nothing — Without this, whatever I speak, whatever I have, whatever I know, whatever I do, whatever I suffer, is nothing."
