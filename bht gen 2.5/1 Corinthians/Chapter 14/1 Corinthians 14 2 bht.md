# 1 Corinthians 14:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When someone speaks in tongues, they are not speaking to men, but to God. The gift of interpretation of tongues is rare, so generally no one understands the speaker. The mysteries spoken are hidden from the hearers and sometimes even from the speaker themselves. Speaking in tongues may be a spiritual gift, but it is of no profit if it cannot be understood by others. The speaker may be delivering important truths, but they are lost upon those who cannot comprehend them.

1. "The faculty of speaking intelligibly, and to the edification of the church, is of more value than the power of speaking a foreign language."
