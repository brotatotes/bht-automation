# 1 Corinthians 14:30 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
If a revelation is made to another prophet while one is speaking, the first should hold his peace and give the next one a chance to speak. This is to avoid confusion and allow for orderly communication of important truths. The one who was speaking should conclude his discourse and be silent, allowing the one with the revelation to share it. The purpose of this instruction is to ensure that the Spirit is not hindered and that all speakers voluntarily submit to the control of the Spirit.

2. "For this only is the true liberty of the Spirit — not that every one be allowed to blab out rashly whatever he pleases, but that all, from the highest to the lowest, voluntarily allow themselves to be under control, and that the one Spirit be listened to, by whatever mouth he speaks."

### John Gill:
1. "If anything be revealed to another that sitteth by,.... To another prophet that sits, and hears, and tries, and judges what he hears; if he has a clearer revelation made to him of what the other is speaking of, and has a more distinct knowledge of it, and is capable of removing any difficulty that attends it, and of expressing it more plainly, and of proving it more largely, and of setting it in an easier light to the understandings of men:
let the first hold his peace." 
2. "Hence it may be observed, that the custom of the primitive churches was to hear the word sitting, and the prophet or preacher stood, or sat, as he thought fit."
3. "But this is to be understood only of those prophets or preachers, not of the common people; for it must not be thought that any that rose up, and pretended to a revelation, might be indulged to deliver it, and the speaker give way to him, which might be attended with much confusion, and many bad consequences; but only such who were known to have gifts, and who at certain times had peculiar revelations made unto them."
