# 1 Corinthians 15:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Through the sin of Adam, death entered the world, affecting all people with temporal death. However, Christ, the Second Adam, brings life to humanity. Just as Adam, the bringer of death, was of the same nature as the men on whom he brought it, Christ, the bringer of life, is of the same nature as the race of men to whom He brings it. The resurrection through Christ assures that all who are raised up by Him will never die again. Christ is the cause of life and the ground-work and pledge of our resurrection.
