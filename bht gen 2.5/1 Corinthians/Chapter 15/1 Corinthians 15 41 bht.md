# 1 Corinthians 15:41 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The bodies of the saints in heaven will differ not only from those on earth but also from each other. This is similar to the various fountains of light, such as the sun, moon, and stars, which differ from one another in their aspect and properties. The resurrection body will differ greatly from the mortal body, while still maintaining its essential identity. Just as stars differ in magnitude and brilliancy, the glory of the resurrection bodies will vary. The amazing variety observable in the heavens above us is a reflection of the potential for the human body to be transformed into immortal and eternally perfect form.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "There is no allusion whatever here (as some have imagined, even Chrys., Œcum., Theodoret, Calov., Estius, al.) to different degrees of glorification of the bodies of the blessed; the introduction of such an idea confuses the whole analogical reasoning." 
2. "Various fountains of light, so similar in its aspect and properties, differ; the sun from the moon and the stars: the stars (and much more vividly would this be felt under the pure sky of the East than here) from one another."
3. "Why not then a body here from a resurrection body, both bodies, but different?"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "As the various fountains of light, which is so similar in its aspect and properties, differ (the sun from the moon, and the moon from the stars; and even one star from another star, though all seem so much alike); so there is nothing unreasonable in the doctrine that our present bodies differ from our resurrection bodies." 
2. "Though still continuing bodies."
3. "Compare the same simile, appropriate especially in the clear Eastern skies (Daniel 12:3; Matthew 13:43). Also that of seed in the same parable (Matthew 13:24; Galatians 6:7; Galatians 6:8)."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "They not only differed from those on earth, but they differed from each other."
2. "The idea here is, therefore, not only that the bodies of the saints in heaven shall differ from those on earth, but that they shall differ among themselves."
3. "Since we see so great differences in fact in the works of God, why should we doubt that he is able to make the human body different from what it is now, and to endow it with immortal and eternal perfection?"

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Glory [δοξα] . Lustre; beauty of form and color."
2. "As heaven 's high twins, whereof in Tyrian blue The one revolveth, through his course immense Might love his fellow of the damask hue, For like and difference."
3. "Like scarves of amethyst."

### John Calvin:
1. "The substance of the sun and moon is the same, but there is a great difference between them in point of dignity and excellence."
2. "Is it to be wondered, then, if our body puts on a more excellent quality?"
3. "I do not teach that anything will take place at the resurrection but what is already presented before the eyes of all."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "There is here no reference to the different degrees of glory among the saints in heaven... It is simply the amazing variety observable in the spangled vault above us."
2. "The resurrection body will differ greatly from the mortal body, consistently with its essential identity."
3. "Observe the word 'sown' here, not 'buried,' for the similitude of seed cast into the earth is purposely continued."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "For one star differeth from another star in glory... Stars differ in magnitude and brilliancy. The telescope has added more force to Paul's argument." 
2. "In glory... the shekinah glory of God in the LXX, glory in general. It is one of the great words of the N.T." 
3. "Jesus is termed the glory in James 2:1."

### John Gill:
1. "There is one glory of the sun,.... Which is the greater light, the fountain of light, and whose glory exceeds that of the other heavenly bodies."
2. "another glory of the moon; which is the lesser light, and receives its light from the sun, and consequently its glory is inferior."
3. "for one star differeth from another star in glory."

### John Wesley:
1. Yea, and the heavenly bodies themselves differ from each other.
