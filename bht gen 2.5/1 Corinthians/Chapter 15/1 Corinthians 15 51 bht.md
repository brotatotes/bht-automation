# 1 Corinthians 15:51 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
At the resurrection-day, there will be a change that will happen to all believers, whether they are alive or dead. This change is a mystery that has been revealed by God and cannot be discovered by human reason. It is a putting off of the corruptible body for an incorruptible one, and it will happen instantaneously. Some believers will be alive when the Lord comes, and they will not experience physical death but will still be changed. This change will result in receiving a resurrection body, which is spiritual and immortal.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "He proceeds to reveal to them something of the process of the change at the resurrection-day." 
2. "the sleep of death cannot be predicated of (all of us), but the resurrection-change can."  
3. "we all shall not sleep, but shall all be changed." 

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Behold—Calling attention to the 'mystery' heretofore hidden in God's purposes, but now revealed."
2. "I show YOU, who think you have so much knowledge, 'a mystery' which your reason could never have discovered."
3. "The putting off of the corruptible body for an incorruptible by an instantaneous change will, in the case of 'the quick,' stand as equivalent to death, appointed to all men."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "We shall not all sleep - We Christians; grouping all together who then lived and should live afterward, for his discussion has relation to them all. The following remarks may, perhaps, remove some of the difficulty which attends the interpretation of this passage."
2. "That Paul did not expect that the Lord Jesus would soon come, and that the world would soon come to an end, is apparent from a similar place in the Epistle to the Thessalonians."
3. "This change will be instantaneous for it is evident that God can as easily change the living as he can raise the dead; and as the affairs of the world will then have come to an end, there will be no necessity that those who are then alive should be removed by death; nor would it be proper that they should go down to lie any time in the grave. The ordinary laws, therefore, by which people are removed to eternity, will not operate in regard to them, and they will be removed at once to their new abode."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "We shall not all sleep. Not, there is not one of us now living who shall die before the Lord's coming, but, we shall not all die."

### John Calvin:
1. "For that wicked doctrine had derived strength from the circumstance, that they disputed as to this matter carelessly and at their ease; (127) as if it were a matter in which they felt no difficulty. Hence by the term mystery, he admonishes them to learn a matter, which was not only as yet unknown to them, but ought to be reckoned among God’s heavenly secrets."
2. "Paul’s intention is to explain what he had said — that we will be conformed to Christ, because flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God."
3. "We must, however, unravel the difficulty — that it is appointed unto all men once to die; and certainly, it is not difficult to unravel it in this way — that as a change cannot take place without doing away with the previous system, that change is reckoned, with good reason, a kind of death; but, as it is not a separation of the soul from the body, it is not looked upon as an ordinary death."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "We shall not all sleep the sleep of death; for a generation of believers will be 'alive and remain when the Lord comes' (1 Thessalonians 4:15), but we shall all be changed."
2. "A change which in the living will be equivalent to both death and resurrection all but instantaneously occurring."
3. "We shall all sleep, but we shall not all be changed."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "He does not claim that he has explained everything. He has drawn a broad parallel which opens the door of hope and confidence."
2. "Not all of us shall die, Paul means. Some people will be alive when he comes."
3. "Both living and dead shall be changed and so receive the resurrection body."

### John Gill:
1. "Behold, I show you a mystery, a secret, which could never have been discovered by reason, or the light of nature, and what is of pure revelation."
2. "We shall all be changed...from corruption to incorruption, from dishonour to glory, from weakness to power, from being natural to be spiritual bodies."
3. "This change all the saints will undergo, whether dead or alive, at Christ's coming; the dead by a resurrection from the dead, and the living by a secret and sudden power, which will at once render their bodies, without separating them from their souls, immortal and glorious."

### John Wesley:
1. "A mystery — A truth hitherto unknown; and not yet fully known to any of the sons of men."
2. "We — Christians. The Apostle considers them all as one, in their succeeding generations."
3. "But we shall all — Who do not die, be changed - So that this animal body shall become spiritual."
