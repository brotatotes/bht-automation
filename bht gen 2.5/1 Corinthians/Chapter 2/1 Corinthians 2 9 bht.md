2. "The object of the apostle is not to describe the future state of the redeemed. It is to prove that those who are Christians have true wisdom... They have views of that which the eyes of other people have not seen; a view of wisdom, and fitness, and beauty which can be found in no other plan."
3. "The things which God 'has held in reserve' (Bloomfield); that is, what God has appointed in the gospel for his people...
