# 1 Corinthians 3:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The growth of the Corinthian church involved the efforts of Paul and Apollos, but ultimately, it was God who brought about the increase. Their roles were complementary, with Paul establishing the church and Apollos working to build it up. However, the success of their labor was attributed to God's grace. The preaching of the word was seen as essential, and ongoing efforts were necessary for spiritual growth. Each minister had their own gifts and responsibilities in the work, but it was God who caused the growth and gave it its efficacy.
