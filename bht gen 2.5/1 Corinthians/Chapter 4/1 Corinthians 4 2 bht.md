# 1 Corinthians 4:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As stewards of God, we are called to be faithful and honest in our responsibilities. While earthly stewards are subject to human judgment, God's stewards await His judgment in the coming of the Lord. Fidelity is the essential requirement in all human relationships, whether it be in handling money or positions of trust. The apostles acted from a higher principle than a desire to please man, and fidelity is required as an indispensable virtue. A minister should be faithful in preaching the pure Gospel of Christ, seeking to please God and advance His kingdom.
