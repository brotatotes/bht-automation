# 1 Corinthians 4:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The kingdom of God is not in mere words, but in the power of God. It is not established through empty boasting or confident assertions, but through the transformative power of the Spirit. This power is seen in the establishment, protection, and governance of the church, as well as in the self-emptying consecration of preachers. True religion is not about empty speeches, but about the power of God working in our lives. It is through this power that the kingdom of God is manifested and experienced.

Such empty boasts would do little in the great work of founding, governing, and preserving the church and unless people have some higher powers than this they are not qualified to be religious teachers and guides."

### John Gill:
1. "By 'the kingdom of God' is not meant the kingdom of heaven, or the ultimate glory and happiness of the saints; though that is a kingdom prepared by God, which he gives to his children, calls them to by his grace, and will give them an abundant entrance into, when time shall be no more with them; and though that is not attained to 'in', or 'by word', by mere talk and profession; not everyone that says Lord, Lord, shall enter into it; or that professes the name of Christ, and prophesies in it; but 'in' or 'by power'; through the power of God, beginning, carrying on, and finishing a work of grace upon the soul, and keeping it, through faith, unto salvation."
2. "But I rather think the Gospel is here meant, often in Scripture called the kingdom of God, and the doctrines of it, the mysteries of the kingdom; because it is a message from the King of kings; the means of setting up the kingdom or grace in the heart; its subjects are things concerning the kingdom of God; it is what has brought life and immortality, or an immortal life to light; and gives the best account of the invisible glories of the heavenly state, and points out the saints' meetness for it, and title to it; declaring that except a man is born again, and has a better righteousness than his own, even that of Christ's, he shall neither see nor enter into the kingdom of heaven."
3. "Now the Gospel is not in 'word'; though it lies in the word of God, the Scriptures of truth: and treats of the essential word of God, the Lord Jesus Christ; and cannot be preached without words, even the words of men; yet is not to be preached with wisdom of words, with enticing words of man's wisdom, or in the words which man's wisdom teacheth; nor does the efficacy of it lie in, or depend upon the words of the preacher, or on mere moral persuasion: for whenever it is effectual, it comes not 'in word only, but also in power'."

### John Wesley:
1. For the kingdom of God â€” Real religion, does not consist in words, but in the power of God ruling the heart.
