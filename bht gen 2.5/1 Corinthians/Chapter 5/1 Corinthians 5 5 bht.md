# 1 Corinthians 5:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The punishment described involves delivering someone to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, with the goal of saving their spirit. This severe but merciful action aims to bring about the offender's eternal happiness. It contrasts with the harsh forms of excommunication in the Roman Catholic Church. The punishment addresses licentiousness and seeks to recover the offender from ruin. It involves casting them out of the Church and into the power of Satan, with the understanding that the destruction of the flesh is temporary, while the salvation of the spirit is eternal.

2. "Nor is this a form of excommunication... it is what no man, or set of men, have power to do now, since the ceasing of the extraordinary gifts of the Spirit."
