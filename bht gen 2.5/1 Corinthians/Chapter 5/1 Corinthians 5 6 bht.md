# 1 Corinthians 5:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Corinthians were rebuked for their boasting and pride while tolerating a scandalous sin within their midst. The inconsistency and unseemliness of their actions were highlighted. The analogy of leaven was used to illustrate how a little sin can corrupt and spread throughout the entire church. The unity and oneness of the church make it vulnerable to the influence of evil-doers. The danger lies in the present complicity in guilt and the potential for future contagion. Boasting is never good, especially when there is an existing evil that can corrupt the whole church.
