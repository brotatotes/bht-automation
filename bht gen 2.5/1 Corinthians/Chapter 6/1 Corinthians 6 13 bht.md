# 1 Corinthians 6:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The body was not created for the practice of fornication, but for the Lord. Fornication is a sin against one's own body, which is not meant to be destroyed but to be raised to eternal existence. The body and its nourishment are both perishable, and it is unworthy for the immortal mind to be consumed with anxiety about what the body shall eat and drink. Meats are indifferent, but the body is not made to be enslaved to them. Instead, the body of every believer is redeemed to be the Lord's property, and the Lord belongs to it in return.
