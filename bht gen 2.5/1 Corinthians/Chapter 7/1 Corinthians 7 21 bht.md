### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Let it not be a trouble to thee that thou art a servant or slave."
2. "Contentment under one's existing condition, though undesirable, since in our union with Christ all outward disparities of condition are compensated."
3. "If called, being a slave, to Christianity, be contentâ€”but yet, if also thou canst be free, make use of the opportunity of becoming free, rather than by neglecting it to remain a slave."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Let it not be a subject of deep anxiety and distress; do not deem it to be disgraceful; let it not affect your spirits; but be content in the lot of life where God has placed you."
2. "In the sphere of life where God by his providence has placed you, strive to evince the Christian spirit, and show that you are able to bear the sorrows and endure the toils of your humble lot with submission to the will of God, and so as to advance in that relation the interest of the true religion."
3. "Evil as slavery is, and always evil, and only evil, yet the Christian religion requires patience, gentleness, forbearance; not violence, war, insurrection, and bloodshed."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The force of kai even, and the positive injunction of the apostle in vers. 20 and 24, seem to favor the meaning, remain in slavery."
2. "The injunction is to be read in the light of ver. 22, and of Galatians 3:28; Colossians 3:11; 1 Corinthians 12:13, that freeman and slave are one in Christ."
3. "We must be careful to avoid basing our conclusion on the modern sentiment respecting freedom and slavery."

### John Calvin:

2. "If, in place of servitude, you could attain even to liberty, it would be more advantageous for you."
3. "I exhort servants to be of good courage, though a state of freedom is preferable and more to be desired if one has it in his choice."

2. "Let it not be a care to thee."
3. "But if thou canst also become free, the rather use your opportunity for freedom."

### John Gill:
1. "Bear the yoke patiently, go through thy servitude cheerfully, and serve thy master faithfully."
2. "Should a Christian servant have an opportunity of making his escape from his master, or could he by any art, trick, and fraudulent method, obtain his liberty, it would be much more advisable to continue a servant, than to become free by any such means."
3. "When a Christian servant has his freedom offered him by his master, or he can come at it in a lawful and honourable way, this being preferable to servitude, he ought rather to make use of it; since he would be in a better situation, and more at leisure to serve Christ, and the interest of religion."

### John Wesley:
1. Care not for it â€” Do not anxiously seek liberty.
But if thou canst be free, use it rather â€” Embrace the opportunity.
