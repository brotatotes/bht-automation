# 1 Corinthians 7:38 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Paul commends the father who gives his daughter in marriage, while leaving the decision of getting married open to individual cases. The act of giving in marriage is considered good, but refraining from marriage is deemed better in certain circumstances. Celibacy is seen as preferable due to the freedom it allows for serving God, but there should be no imposed necessity that makes marriage unlawful. Marriage itself is a remedy for human weakness, and individuals should use it if they do not possess the gift of continency.
