# 1 Corinthians 8:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
By smiting the weak, one commits a cruel act that is akin to striking an invalid. This is aggravated by the fact that it violates the law of love and harms the brethren, leading them into error and sin. The conscience is sensitive to such a blow, and by sinning against the weak, one also sins against Christ Himself. The intimate union between Christ and His members means that offending them is to offend Him, and injuring them is to injure the head. This contemptuous behavior is an insult to Christ and shows a disregard for His sacrifice.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "τύπτοντες] smiting: τί γὰρ ἀπηνέστερον ἀνθρώπου γένοιτʼ ἂν τὸν νοσοῦντα τύπτοντος?" (Chrys. p. 176)

### Albert Barnes:
1. "You violate the law which requires you to love your brethren, and to seek their welfare, and thus you sin against them."
2. "And by your conduct they are led further into error, and believe that the idol is something, and is to be honored. They are thus led into sin, and their conscience is more and more perverted, and oppressed more and more with a sense of guilt."
3. "Because they are so intimately united to Christ that to offend them is to offend him; to injure the members is to injure the head; to destroy their souls is to pain his heart and to injure his cause."

### John Calvin:
1. "For if the soul of every one that is weak is the price of Christ’s blood, that man who, for the sake of a very small portion of meat, hurries back again to death the brother who has been redeemed by Christ, shows how contemptible the blood of Christ is in his view."
2. "Hence contempt of this kind is an open insult to Christ."
3. "When it is built up in what is evil so as daringly and rashly to rush on farther than the individual thinks to be lawful for him."

2. "Ye sin against Christ. That fact they were overlooking."
3. "One may wonder if Paul knew the words of Jesus in Matthew 25:40, 'ye did it unto me.'"

### John Gill:
1. "Through sitting at meat in an idol's temple, and thereby violating the new commandment of love..."
2. "It is contrary to the law of love to wound a brother; it is an aggravation of the sin to wound a weak one..."
3. "What serves most to enhance the crime and guilt is, ye sin against Christ, who has so loved this weak brother as to die for him..."
