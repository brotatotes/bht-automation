# 1 Corinthians 8:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
To us, there is one God, the Father, who is the source and goal of our lives. The Lord Jesus Christ, who is equal to God, is the immediate agent in the creation of all things. The work of creation implies divinity, and since Jesus created all things, he must be God. Christians submit their lives to God and receive their laws from Him, acknowledging that there is only one God and one Lord, Jesus Christ, who is the object of divine worship.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "TO US (emphatic: however that matter may be, we hold) there is ONE GOD, the Father... of Whom are all things, and we unto Him." 
2. "one Lord Jesus Christ... by Whom are all things, and we... by Him." 
3. "The inference from the foregoing is that, per se, the eating of meat offered to idols is a thing indifferent, and therefore allowed."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "God the FATHER is the end for whom and for whose glory believers live."
2. "In [Christ]: all things are said to be created ... 'for Him.' So entirely are the Father and Son one."
3. "As all things are by Christ by creation, so they (we believers especially) are restored by Him by the new creation."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "From him Christians receive their laws, and to him they submit their lives. And this idea is so far from supposing inferiority in the Lord Jesus to God, that it rather supposes equality; since a right to give laws to people, to rule their consciences, to direct their religious opinions and their lives, can appropriately pertain only to one who has equality with God."
2. "The universe; for so the phrase τὰ πάντα ta panta properly means. No words could better express the idea of the universe than these; and the declaration is therefore explicit that the Lord Jesus created all things."
3. "The work of creation is expressly in this passage ascribed to the Lord Jesus. But the work of creation cannot be performed by a creature. There can be no delegated God, and no delegated omnipotence, or delegated infinite wisdom and omnipresence. The work of creation implies divinity; or it is impossible to prove that there is a God; and if the Lord Jesus made 'all things,' he must be God."

### John Calvin:
1. "All things have their origin from one Being: he alone, therefore, is God."
2. "For this reason our Lord is spoken of as one."
3. "While, therefore, our religion acknowledges but one Lord, this is no hindrance in the way of civil governments having many lords, to whom honor and respect are due in that one Lord."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "yet to us (Christians) there is one God, the Father, of whom are all things as their primal Source, and we unto him as their last End; and one Lord Jesus Christ, through whom are all things as the immediate Agent in their production, and we through him."
2. "From this state of mind sprang the conception pervading alike the East and the West in different forms, and far from being confined to the vulgar, nor originating with them that there exist intermediate and subordinate divinities, or emanations from the supreme Divinity through whom the two extremities meet."
3. "Now what Christianity does is not to extinguish this conviction and this emotion, out of which the universe came to be thus ignorantly peopled, but to disclose the sublime Reality that underlies all these dreamings, namely, that while there is one Fontal Source of all things, 'one God, the Father, of whom are all things, there is also 'one (Mediatorial) Lord, even Jesus Christ, through whom are all things,' and through whose intervention 'we through Him' are brought nigh to this 'one God,' otherwise unapproachable."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Yet to us there is one God, the Father." 
2. "As the source of the universe and also our goal is God." 
3. "Here Paul calls Jesus Lord and not God."

### John Gill:
1. "In this Christians and Jews agree with the best and wisest philosophers of the Gentiles, that there is but one God."
2. "We Christians know him to be 'the Father'; by whom meant either God essentially considered, the one God, Father, Son, and Spirit, called the Father, not in relation to any person in the Godhead, but in relation to the creatures."
3. "Christ is the one Lord of all, as he is God over all, the Creator and Former of all things; and he is so likewise as Mediator, having all power, dominion, and government put into his hands."

### John Wesley:
1. "Yet to us — Christians."
2. "There is but one God — This is exclusive, not of the One Lord, as if he were an inferior deity; but only of the idols to which the One God is opposed."
3. "And one Lord — Equally the object of divine worship."
