## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "His making the gospel to be without cost, was not his ŒºŒπœÉŒ∏œåœÇ, but his Œ∫Œ±œçœáŒ∑ŒºŒ± only: and these two are not identical."
2. "What then is my reward (in prospect) that I ( ·ºµŒΩŒ±, like ·ΩÖœÄœâœÇ in classical Greek, with a fut. indic., points to the actual realization of the purpose, with more precision than when followed by the subjunctive."
3. "What reward have I in prospect that induces me to preach gratuitously) in order not to use (as carrying out my design not to use)[to the full] (Œ∫Œ±œÑŒ±œáœÅ. see ref. and note: not, to abuse, as E. V.) my power in the gospel."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

2. "[Paul's] 'reward'...is the gaining of the more." 
3. "The 'reward' is...that he may gain the more; it was for this end, not to have matter of glorying, that he did so."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Though I have been called by miracle, and though necessity is laid upon me, so that I cannot but preach the gospel, yet how shall I so do it as to make it proper for God to reward me as a voluntary agent?"
2. "I may make the gospel of Christ without charge - Without expense to those who hear it. I will support myself by my own labor, and will thus show that I am not urged to preaching by mere 'necessity,' but that I love it."
3. "All that This case proves is, that it would be proper only where a 'necessity' was laid on a man, as it was on Paul; when he could not otherwise show that his heart was in the work, and that he was voluntary and loved it."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Abuse [Œ∫Œ±œÑŒ±œáœÅŒ∑œÉŒ±œÉŒ∏Œ±Œπ] . See on ch. 1 Corinthians 7:31. Rev., correctly, use to the full.


### John Calvin:
1. "I am under the necessity of preaching the gospel: if I do it not, wo is unto me, for I resist God‚Äôs calling. But it is not enough to preach, unless I do it willingly; for he who fulfils the commandment of God unwillingly, does not act, as becomes him, suitably to his office. But if I obey God willingly, it will in that case be allowable for me to glory."
2. "Paul, it is true, went a greater length than the ordinary calling of pastors required, because he refrained from taking pay, which the Lord allows pastors to take. But as it was a part of his duty to provide against every occasion of offense that he foresaw, and as he saw, that the course of the gospel would be impeded, if he made use of his liberty, though that was out of the ordinary course, yet I maintain that even in that case he rendered to God nothing more than was due."
3. "Whatever works are comprehended under the law, are falsely termed works of supererogation...Hence even if they were doing an hundred-fold more than they do, they would not, even in that case, exceed the limits of the duty that they owe."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "[...] I may make the Gospel of Christ without charge that for the good of others I forego an undoubted right."
2. "[...] to the Jews I became as a Jew, that I might gain the Jews."
3. "[...] to them that are under the law, as under the law, not being myself under the law, that I might, etc."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "So as not to use to the full (ŒµŒπœÇ œÑŒø ŒºŒ∑ Œ∫Œ±œÑŒ±œáœÅŒ∑œÉŒ±œÉŒ∏Œ±)." 
2. "ŒïŒπœÇ œÑŒø for purpose with articular infinitive and perfective use of Œ∫Œ±œÑŒ± (as in 1 Corinthians 7:31) with œáœÅŒ∑œÉŒ±œÉŒ∏Œ± (first aorist middle infinitive)."

### John Gill:
1. "None at all, I have none to expect, hope for, or claim, in a way of debt."
2. "All the reward that remains is only this, verily, that when I preach the Gospel, which I am obliged to do, I may make the Gospel of Christ without charge."
3. "His reason for it is, that I abuse not my power in the Gospel; his right of having a maintenance, whilst he was preaching the Gospel."
