# 1 John 2:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The commandment of love is both old and new, as Christianity first put love to brethren on the new and highest motive of instinctive love to Christ. The newness of the commandment is shown supremely in Christ and in disciples when they walk as Jesus did. The true light is the revelation of God in Christ, and the darkness of sin and ignorance gradually passes away as the light shines. The commandment, though given long ago, is truly new in Him and in us, as it is constantly renewed and practiced throughout our lives.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "This reference of the two clauses I hold fast against Düsterdieck, who maintains that the ὅ refers to the content of the ἐντολή, viz. walking in brotherly love: that the commandment finds its fulfilment (ἀληθές ἐστιν?) in the walk of Christians in union with Christ."
2. "Is it not probable that this form of sentence introduces the explanation of the paradox? Is it probable, as would be the case on the other view, that so startling a proposition (after 1Jn 2:7) as πάλιν ἐντολὴν καινὴν γράφω ὑμῖν, would remain altogether unexplained?"
3. "But to this there are several objections which he has not noticed: 1) the probable logic of the sentence. The Apostle has made what is apparently a paradoxical assertion. He has stated that the commandment is not new but old, and then has, notwithstanding, asserted its newness."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Christianity first put love to brethren on the new and highest MOTIVE, instinctive love to Him who first loved us, constraining us to love all, even enemies, thereby walking in the steps of Him who loved us when enemies." 
2. "The new commandment finds its truth in its practical realization in the walk of Christians in union with Christ."
3. "The light is now shining already, though but partially until the day bursts forth."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "And yet, that which I write to you, and particularly enjoin on you, deserves in another sense to be called a new commandment, though it has been also inculcated from the beginning, for it was called new by the Saviour himself."
2. "That is, which commandment or law of love was illustrated in him, or was manifested by him in his contact with his disciples. That which was most prominent in him was this very love which he enjoined on all his followers."
3. "The ancient systems of error, under which people hated each other, have passed away, and you are brought into the light of the true religion."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The commandment of love is both old and new."
2. "The fact that the old commandment is new is true in Him and in us."
3. "The true light is the revelation of God in Christ."

### John Calvin:
1. "He says new, because God, as it were, renews it by daily suggesting it, so that the faithful may practice it through their whole life."
2. "Let him, then, who would reach the goal of wisdom, as to the right way of living, make proficiency in love."
3. "Hence the word truth means this, that they stood, as it were at the goal, for it is to be taken for a completion or a perfect state."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "To walk as Christ walked is to put in practice the old commandment and so make it new (ever new and fresh), as love is as old as man and fresh in every new experience."
2. "This newness is shown supremely in Christ and in disciples when they walk as Jesus did."
3. "Dawn is here. Is John thinking of the second coming of Christ or of the victory of truth over error, of light over darkness (cf. John 1:5-9), the slow but sure victory of Christ over Satan as shown in the Apocalypse?"

### John Gill:
1. "The command of brotherly love is a new one; that is, it is an excellent one, as a new name is an excellent name, and a new song is an excellent one."
2. "The love which this new commandment requires is really and truly in the saints, implanted in them in regeneration, is a fruit of the Spirit, and which faith works by, and will always continue in them; and should be in its actings like Christ's, true, sincere, cordial, affectionate, constant, and universal."
3. "The darkness of sin and ignorance, of a state of nature, and of the kingdom of Satan, in which the people of God are before conversion; which then passes away gradually, by little and little, for it is not removed at once, or wholly gone."

### John Wesley:
1. "A commandment which, though it also was given long ago, yet is truly new in him and in you."
2. "For there is no comparison between the state of the Old Testament believers, and that which ye now enjoy."
3. "The darkness of that dispensation is passed away; and Christ the true light now shineth in your hearts."
