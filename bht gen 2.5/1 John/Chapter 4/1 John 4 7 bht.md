# 1 John 4:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Love is the test of being born of God and flows from a sense of God's love to us. All love comes from God as its fountain, and even human love is a reflection of something in the Divine nature itself. Persistence in loving is proof of being begotten of God, while claiming to love God but hating one's brother is a lie. Real love shows that we have God's Spirit and belong to Him, assimilating us to Him. Loving one another is a command of God and evidence of regeneration.
