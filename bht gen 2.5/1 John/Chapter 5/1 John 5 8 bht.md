# 1 John 5:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The water, the blood, and the Spirit are three witnesses that converge upon the truth that Jesus is the Son of God. The Spirit, whose witness is infallible, testifies to Jesus' divine Messiahship. Water baptism serves as a public symbol of the purity of Jesus' religion. The shedding of Jesus' blood, whether on the cross or represented in the Lord's Supper, is a witness to the truth of his Sonship. These three witnesses, the Spirit, the water, and the blood, are united in their testimony of Jesus as the Incarnate Son of God.
