# 1 Peter 1:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Peter, in his letter to the elect strangers of the dispersion, addresses Christians as travelers and emphasizes their role in spreading the knowledge of Christ. The term elect refers to both the calling to hear the gospel and the election to eternal life. Peter, using his chosen name, appeals to his apostleship to address churches with which he had no immediate connection. The metaphor of being strangers and sojourners on earth highlights the temporary nature of their existence and their ultimate citizenship in heaven. The scattered Christians, primarily of Jewish descent, are described as the people of God who are away from their ancestral home.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to the elect strangers of the dispersion."
2. "Belonging to the Jewish dispersion, as in reff."
3. "There is no reason to exclude Gentile Christians from among them, as forming part of the Israel of God."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Christians, if they rightly consider their calling, must never settle themselves here, but feel themselves travelers."
2. "As the Jews in their dispersion diffused through the nations the knowledge of the one God, preparatory to Christ's first advent, so Christians, by their dispersion among the unconverted, diffuse the knowledge of Christ, preparatory to His second advent."
3. "The election to hearing, and that to eternal life, are distinct. Realization of our election is a strong motive to holiness."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He here addresses them as elect; in the following verse he shows them in what way they were elected."
2. "He would regard them still as the people of God, though dispersed abroad; as those who were away from what was properly the home of their fathers."
3. "It is not necessarily implied that these persons were strangers to Peter, or that he had never seen them; though this was not improbably the fact in regard to most of them."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "As Paul in his letters does not call himself by his original name of Saul, so Peter calls himself, not Simon, but Peter, the name most significant and precious both to himself and to his readers, because bestowed by his Lord."
2. "He [Peter] is addressing churches with which he had no immediate connection, and which were distinctively Pauline. Hence he appeals to his apostleship in explanation of his writing to them, and as his warrant for taking Paul's place."
3. "Though applied primarily to Hebrews scattered throughout the world, it has here a wider, spiritual sense, contemplating Christians as having their citizenship in heaven."

### John Calvin:
1. "For as it was not then sufficient for the victim to be slain and the blood to be poured out, except the people were sprinkled; so now the blood of Christ which has been shed will avail us nothing, except our consciences are by it cleansed." 
2. "We hence conclude, that election is not to be separated from calling, nor the gratuitous righteousness of faith from newness of life."
3. "He invites us to notice the effect, by which he sets forth and bears witness to our election. That effect is the sanctification of the Spirit, even effectual calling, when faith is added to the outward preaching of the gospel, which faith is begotten by the inward operation of the Spirit."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Peter uses this name, not Cephas or Simon, because he is writing to Christians scattered over Asia Minor."
2. "The picture in the metaphor here is that heaven is our native country and we are only temporary sojourners here on earth."
3. "The Christian is a pilgrim on his way to the homeland."

### John Gill:
1. "The writer of this epistle describes himself first by his name, Peter, the same with Cephas, which signifies a rock, or stone; a name given him by Christ at his first conversion, and which respected his after firmness, solidity, resolution, and constancy..."
2. "The persons he writes to are the strangers scattered throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia: these Jews here intended are called strangers; not in a metaphorical sense, either because they were, as the wicked are, estranged from the womb, and alienated from the life of God, as all unconverted men are, and as they were before conversion; for now they were no more strangers in this sense..."
3. "In these places however, it seems, dwelt many Jews, who were converted to Christ, to whom the apostle inscribes this epistle, and whom he further describes in the following verse."

2. "Scattered — Long ago driven out of their own land."
