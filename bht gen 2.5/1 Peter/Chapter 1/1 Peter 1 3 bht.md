# 1 Peter 1:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
God, in His great mercy, has begotten believers again unto a living hope through the resurrection of Christ. This hope is not a dead hope, but a hope that has life in itself and looks for life as its object. It is a hope that overcomes death and brings about faith and love. The believers' regeneration is a definite historical act accomplished by God's grace, and it is through this new birth that they are able to have a living hope in the future good that God has promised. This hope is a result of God's mercy and the believers' relationship with Christ, and it is a hope that is rooted in the resurrection of Christ, which is the cause of their own resurrection.

2. "When he gives thanks to God, he invites the faithful to spiritual joy, which can swallow up all the opposite feelings of the flesh."

3. "By the resurrection of Christ — Which is not only a pledge of ours, but a part of the purchase-price.
