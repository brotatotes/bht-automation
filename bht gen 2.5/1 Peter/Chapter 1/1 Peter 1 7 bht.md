## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The fact of your faith being proved, and so, by an easy transition, the result of that proof, the purified and proved faith itself." 
2. "Gold though perishable yet needs fire to try it, the inference lying in the background, how much more does your faith, which is being proved for eternity, not for mere temporary use, need a fiery trial?" 
3. "Praise and glory and honour in the revelation of Jesus Christ."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "That your faith so proved 'may be found (aorist; once
	for all, as the result of its being proved on the judgment-day)
	unto (eventuating in) praise,' c., namely, the praise to be
	bestowed by the Judge."
2. "If gold, though perishing, is yet tried with fire in order to remove dross and test
	its genuineness, how much more does your faith, which shall never
	perish, need to pass through a fiery trial to remove whatever is
	defective, and to test its genuineness and full value?"
3. "At Christ's revelation shall take place also the
	revelation of the sons of God."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The testing of [faith], the process of showing whether it was or was not genuine, was a much more important and valuable process than that of testing gold in the fire." 
2. "It pertains to that which is eternal and indestructible, and it is therefore of more importance to show its true quality, and to free it from every improper mixture."
3. "That honor might be done to it before assembled worlds."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The expression is equivalent to your approved faith."
2. "The comparison is between the approved faith and the gold; not between the faith and the proof of the gold."
3. "Might be found [ŒµœÖœÅŒµŒ∏Œ∑] . In accord with the preceding expressions, and indicating discovery as the result of scrutiny."

### John Calvin:
1. "And though the words seem to have a different meaning, he yet compares faith to gold, and makes it more precious than gold, that hence he might draw the conclusion, that it ought to be fully proved."
2. "Both modes of trial may very suitably be applied to faith; for when there is much of the dregs of unbelief remaining in us, and when by various afflictions we are refined as it were in God‚Äôs furnace, the dross of our faith is removed, so that it becomes pure and clean before God."
3. "For our life is now hidden in Christ, and will remain hidden, and as it were, buried, until Christ shall appear from heaven; and the whole course of our life leads to the destruction of the external man, and all the things we suffer are, as it were, the preludes of death."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "It points them at once to the ultimate object of their possible subjection to many painful things now."
2. "The comparison between the probation of character and the testing of metals, which occurs so often elsewhere, has a limited application here."
3. "But the descriptions are cumulative rather than ascensive, word being added to word in order to convey some faint conception of the gracious reward which is to be found at last."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Faith stands the test of fire better than gold, but even gold is refined by fire."
2. "As in 2 Peter 3:14, this is the result of the probation by God as the Refiner of hearts."
3. "Here probably both to God and man in the result."

### John Gill:
1. "The trying of [faith] is abundantly more precious than gold; for not only as gold being tried in the fire is purged from its dross, and is proved to be genuine and shines the brighter, so faith, being tried in the fire of afflictions, is purged from unbelief; and the believer is proved to be a true believer."
2. "The very trying of [faith] has an influence on other graces, for great usefulness; for the trying of faith works patience, and that, experience, and that, hope."
3. "[Faith] will be found unto praise and honour and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ... his faith will be praised for its steadiness and constancy, notwithstanding all persecutions and tribulations."

### John Wesley:
1. "That the trial of your faith ‚Äî That is, your faith which is tried."
2. "Which is much more precious than gold ‚Äî For gold, though it bear the fire, yet will perish with the world."
3. "May be found ‚Äî Though it doth not yet appear. Unto praise ‚Äî From God himself. And honour ‚Äî From men and angels. And glory ‚Äî Assigned by the great Judge."
