## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The statement of the fact, however, has been felt to be accompanied by such great difficulties, that other meanings have been sought for the passage than that which the words present at first sight."
2. "What was the intent of that preaching, and what its effect is not here revealed; the fact merely is stated."
3. "That inference every intelligent reader will draw from the fact here announced: it is not purgatory, it is not universal restitution; but it is one which throws blessed light on one of the darkest enigmas of the divine justice: the cases where the final doom seems infinitely out of proportion to the lapse which has incurred it."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Oldest manuscripts. Greek, 'was continuing to wait on' (if haply men in the hundred twenty years of grace would repent) until the end of His waiting came in their death by the flood."
2. "The same water which drowned the unbelieving, buoyed up the ark in which the eight were saved."
3. "Noah preached to their ears, but Christ in spirit, to their spirits, or spiritual natures."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The meaning here is, that they did not obey the command of God when he called them to repentance by the preaching of Noah."
2. "Noah was not disheartened. Sustained by the Spirit of Christ - the presence of the Son of God - he continued to preach."
3. "The thought on which the apostle makes his remarks turn, and which leads him in the next verse to the suggestions about baptism, is, that water was employed in their preservation, or that they owed their safety, in an important sense, to that element."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "By water. Some take this as instrumental, by means of water; other as local, by passing through the water, or being brought safely through the water into the ark." 
2. "Rev., in margin, were brought safely through water."
3. "Into which they were gathered, and in which they were saved."

### John Calvin:
1. "as the power of the Spirit of Christ shewed itself to be vivifying in him, and was known as such by the dead, so it will be towards us."
2. "after having then said that Christ was manifested to the dead, he immediately adds, When there were formerly unbelievers; by which he intimated, that it was no injury to the holy fathers that they were almost hidden through the vast number of the ungodly."
3. "The sum of what is said is this, that the world has always been full of unbelievers, but that the godly ought not to be terrified by their vast number; for though Noah was surrounded on every side by the ungodly, and had very few as his friends, he was not yet drawn aside from the right course of his faith."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The â€˜disobedientâ€™ means here again, as in 1 Peter 2:7-8, 1 Peter 3:1 disbelieving, refusing belief and withstanding truth." 
2. "The â€˜waitingâ€™ is given in the imperfect tense to bring out its lengthened continuance. It is expressed, too, by a verb for which Paul has a particular fondness, and which conveys the idea of the intenseness or patience of the waiting."
3. "All that he has in view is (as the indefinite â€˜water,â€™ not â€˜ the water,â€™ indicates) that it was by means of water that the few entering the ark which floated thereon were preserved."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "These spirits now in prison once upon a time (Ï€Î¿Ï„Îµ) were disobedient (typical rebels, Hart calls them)."
2. "Waited (Î±Ï€ÎµÎ¾ÎµÎ´ÎµÏ‡ÎµÏ„Î¿). Imperfect middle of the double compound Î±Ï€ÎµÎºÎ´ÎµÏ‡Î¿Î¼Î±, late verb, probably first by Paul (1 Corinthians 1:7), though in the apocryphal Acta Pauli (iii) and other late writings cited by Nageli (p. 43)."
3. "They came through the water in the ark and so were saved by the water in spite of the flood around them. Peter lays stress (Hart) on the water rather than on the ark (Hebrews 11:7) for the sake of the following illustration."

### John Gill:
1. "But as they that entered into the ark were but few, so are those that enter in at the strait gate, or believe in Christ; and they that went into the ark were saved by the water bearing up the ark, even by that by which others were destroyed; as the very same thing, for different reasons, is the cause or means of destruction and salvation."
2. "So Christ is set, for the fall and rising of many, is a stumblingblock to some, and the power and wisdom of God to others; and the Gospel, and the ministers of it, are the savour of life unto life to some, and the savour of death unto death to others."
3. "This instance of the dispensation of the providence of God to the old world is very appropriately, though by way of digression, introduced by the apostle; showing, that in times past, as then, God's usual method has been to afford the outward means to ungodly men, and to bear with them long, and then bring down his vengeance upon them, and save his own people; and this suffering saints might depend upon would be their case, and therefore should bear their afflictions patiently."

### John Wesley:
1. "When the longsuffering of God waited"
2. "All the time the ark was preparing"
3. "During which Noah warned them all to flee from the wrath to come"
