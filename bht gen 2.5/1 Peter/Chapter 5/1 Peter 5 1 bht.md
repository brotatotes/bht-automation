# 1 Peter 5:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Peter, as an eyewitness of Christ's sufferings, exhorts the elders to faithfully shepherd the flock. His authority comes from his personal experience and his participation in the sufferings of Christ. The term elder implies a shared responsibility and not a position of primacy. Peter's exhortation is gentle and kind, emphasizing the importance of willingly serving and caring for the church. He does not assert his apostolic authority but speaks as a fellow elder and a witness of Christ's sufferings. The language used by Peter is not commanding but exhorting, reflecting his humility and desire for unity among the elders.

1. "To put one's self on a level with those whom we exhort, gives weight to one's exhortations." 
2. "The presidents over the presbyters and deacons, by whatever name designated, angel, bishop, or moderator, c., though of the same ORDER as the presbyters, yet have virtually succeeded to a superintendency of the Church analogous to that exercised by the apostles."
3. "Witness—an eye-witness of Christ's sufferings, and so qualified to exhort you to believing patience in suffering for well-doing after His example."

### Albert Barnes:

3. "Anyone, who is himself an heir of salvation, may appropriately exhort his fellow-Christians to fidelity in the service of their common Lord."

### Marvin Vincent:

2. "The word is used in the New Testament to denote a witness in court."
3. "Partaker: This use of the word, expressing a present realization of something not yet attained, occurs in no other writer in the New Testament."

### John Calvin:
1. "In opposition to the first vice he sets alacrity or a willing attention; to the second, liberality; to the third, moderation and meekness, by which they are to keep themselves in their own rank or station." 
2. "But though he was an Apostle, he yet knew that authority was by no means delegated to him over his colleagues, but that on the contrary he was joined with the rest in the participation of the same office."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The best authorities also insert ‘therefore,’ which the A. V. omits. This implies that what is to be said of the duties of elders is to be urged specially on the ground of the considerations with which the previous chapter has closed..."
