# 1 Peter 5:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
God, the source of all grace, will not cease His work of perfecting His grace in believers until it is fully realized in glory. This assurance brings comfort to those who endure suffering, as it is a necessary part of the journey towards the eternal glory to which they are called. God Himself will complete the work, establishing and strengthening believers so that they may overcome every obstacle. This work of grace is made possible through Christ, who is the life and head of all existence for believers.
