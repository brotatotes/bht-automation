# 1 Peter 5:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Greet one another with a kiss of love, a common method of affectionate salutation in the times of the apostles. Peace be with all true Christians who are in Christ Jesus. The kiss of love is a sincere act that corresponds with the sincerity of the heart. It is a holy kiss, opposite to anything impure, and expresses true love and affection. This salutation of peace is derived from Christ Himself and is extended to all who are in Christ, chosen before the foundation of the world.
