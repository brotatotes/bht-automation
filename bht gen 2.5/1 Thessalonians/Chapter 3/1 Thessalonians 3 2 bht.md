1. "Minister [διακονον] . See on Matthew 20:26; Mark 9:35. Not in the official sense of deacon which occurs only in the Pastorals. Diakonov minister and diakonia ministry or service are common expressions of service to Christ or to men."

### John Calvin:
1. "It is, on the other hand, a great thing that he deprives himself of a brother and fellow-laborer, and one to whom, as he declares in Philippians 2:20, he found no equal, inasmuch as all aimed at the promotion of their own interests."
2. "In the mean time, (555) he procures authority for the doctrine which they had received from Timothy, that it may remain the more deeply impressed upon their memory."
3. "Thus, when the Thessalonians heard that Paul was going on with indefatigable zeal, and was by strength of faith surmounting all dangers and all difficulties, and that his faith continued everywhere victorious against Satan and the world, this brought them no small consolation."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The expression ‘fellow-labourer with God is supported by 1 Corinthians 3:9."
2. "Paul bestows these commendatory titles on Timothy partly from his affection for his young assistant, partly to illustrate still further his love for the Thessalonians."
3. "Timothy was sent in the interest of their faith, to explain to them that the troubles in which they were involved were no proof that their faith was foolish, and to encourage them to maintain it."

### John Gill:
1. "And our fellow labourer in the Gospel of Christ; he was a labourer, and not a loiterer in the Lord's vineyard; one that laboured in the word and doctrine..."
2. "The doctrines of the Gospel are calculated for that purpose, and the ministers of it should be Barnabases, sons of consolation."
3. "These saints might be in some doubt about the grace of faith, whether it was right or not, or about the doctrine of faith they had received; and therefore Timothy is sent to comfort them under their afflictions, which might have created these doubts, and to remove them, by showing them that their faith was like precious faith with the apostles."
