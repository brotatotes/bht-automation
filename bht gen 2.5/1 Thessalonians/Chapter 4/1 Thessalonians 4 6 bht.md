2. "To say that more than one kind of sin must be mentioned because of œÄŒµœÅ·Ω∂ œÄŒ¨ŒΩœÑœâŒΩ œÑŒøœçœÑœâŒΩ, is mere trifling: the œÄŒ¨ŒΩœÑŒ± œÑŒ±·ø¶œÑŒ± generalizes from the sin mentioned to a wider range."
3. "How œÑ·ø∑ œÄœÅŒ¨Œ≥ŒºŒ±œÑŒπ can ever signify œÑŒø·øñœÇ œÄœÅŒ¨Œ≥ŒºŒ±œÉŒπŒΩ, 'business affairs' (De W., alt.), I cannot imagine."
