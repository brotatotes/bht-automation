# 1 Thessalonians 5:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Thessalonians had no need for Paul to write about the times and seasons of the Lord's coming because he had already taught them everything they needed to know. The distinction between times and seasons is that times refer to chronological periods, while seasons refer to opportune times. The Thessalonians were already well-informed about the suddenness of Christ's coming, as Paul had emphasized this during his time with them. Writing about the specific timing would have been unnecessary and indulging in vain curiosity.
