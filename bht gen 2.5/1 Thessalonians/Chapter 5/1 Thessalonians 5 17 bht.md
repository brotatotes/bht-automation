# 1 Thessalonians 5:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Pray without ceasing, not just in spirit, but with direct supplications to God. Prayer should be unceasing, with no gaps between times of prayer. We are to be regular and constant in the observance of stated seasons of prayer, maintaining an uninterrupted and constant spirit of prayer. We should not omit our resolved times of devotion, nor relax our earnestness through disappointment or decay of faith. Believers should be daily found in the performance of this duty, as their wants daily return upon them.
