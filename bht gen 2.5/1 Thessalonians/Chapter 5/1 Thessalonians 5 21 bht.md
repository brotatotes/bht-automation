## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "But try all (such œáŒ±œÅŒØœÉŒºŒ±œÑŒ±): see 1 Corinthians 12:10; 1 Corinthians 14:29; 1 John 4:1." 
2. "In this, and in all things, hold fast the good."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "You ought indeed not to 'quench' the manifestations of 'the Spirit,' nor 'despise prophesyings'; 'but,' at the same time, do not take 'all' as genuine which professes to be so; 'prove (test) all' such manifestations." 
2. "This precept negatives the Romish priest's assumption of infallibly laying down the law, without the laity having the right, in the exercise of private judgment, to test it by Scripture." 
3. "As the result of your 'proving all things,' and especially all prophesyings, 'hold fast the good, and hold yourselves aloof from every appearance of evil.'"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Prove all things - Subject everything submitted to you to be believed to the proper test."
2. "Hold fast that which is good - Which is in accordance with reason and the word of God; which is adapted to promote the salvation of the soul and the welfare of society."
3. "No popular current in favor of any doctrine; no influence which name and rank and learning can give it, is to commend it to us as certainly worthy of our belief. By whomsoever held, we are to examine it freely before we embrace it; but when we are convinced that it is true, it is to be held, no matter what current of popular opinion or prejudice maybe against it; no matter what ridicule may be poured upon it; and no matter though the belief of it may require us to die a martyr‚Äôs death."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Prove all things. A general exhortation, not confined to prophesyings; but Paul elsewhere insists that a test be applied to phenomena which claim to be supernatural."
2. "Hold fast that which is good. These words are associated in early Christian writers with an apocryphal saying ascribed to Jesus, and very frequently quoted, 'show yourselves approved money-changers.'"
3. "By some ancient writers the two are cited together as Paul's; by others they are distinguished, as by Origen, who cites the saying as an injunction of Jesus, and adds, 'and also (observing) the teaching of Paul, who says, 'prove all things, hold fast the good, abstain from every form of evil.'"

### John Calvin:
1. "Prove all things, meaning, that although all do not speak precisely according to set rule, we must, nevertheless, form a judgment, before any doctrine is condemned or rejected."
2. "Paul admonishes the Thessalonians to keep the middle path between these two extremes, while he prohibits them from condemning anything without first examining it."
3. "For it does not become the pious to show such lightness, as indiscriminately to lay hold of what is false equally with what is true."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Prove all things. Neither in regard to these manifestations of the Spirit‚Äôs presence, nor in any matter, were they to be led by prejudice and appearances and first impressions, but they were to put things to the proof, to test them."
2. "The Thessalonians were to judge by the moral quality of the prophesyings, or of whatever else came before them. And this moral discernment was to result in a practical choice."
3. "Having tested all things by their real character, they are to abstain from evil of every form. Even though it had the appearance of good, even though it was in the form of pretended spiritual wisdom or zeal for Christ, they were to abstain from it."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Prove all things... Even the gift of prophecy has to be tested... to avoid error." 
2. "Hold fast that which is good... Keep on holding down the beautiful (noble, morally beautiful)." 
3. "Present imperative Œ∫Œ±œÑ-Œµœáœâ (perfective use of Œ∫Œ±œÑŒ±- here)."

### John Gill:
1. "Prove all things,.... That are said by the prophets, all the doctrines which they deliver; hear them, though they have not the gift of tongues, and all desirable advantages; do not reject them on that account."
2. "Hold fast that which is good; honest, pleasant, profitable, and agreeable to sound doctrine, to the analogy of faith, and the Scriptures of truth."
3. "Such should be held fast, that no man take it away; and be retained, though a majority may be against it, for the multitude is not always on the side of truth."

### John Wesley:
1. "Meantime, prove all things - Which any preacher recommends. (He speaks of practice, not of doctrines.)"
2. "Try every advice by the touchstone of scripture..."
3. "Hold fast that which is good - Zealously, resolutely, diligently practise it, in spite of all opposition."
