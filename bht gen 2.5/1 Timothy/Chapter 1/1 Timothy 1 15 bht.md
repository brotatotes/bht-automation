# 1 Timothy 1:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This saying is faithful and worthy of acceptance. Christ came into the world to save sinners, and the depth of His mercy intensifies Paul's sense of unworthiness. Paul humbly acknowledges himself as the chief of sinners, recognizing that his own sins appear greater in his sight compared to others. This is not a phrase of mock humility, but a sincere appreciation of Paul's own sins. It is a doctrine that can be depended on as certainly true and should be received by all, as all are sinners in need of a Savior.

### Henry Alford:
1. "faithful (worthy of credit: ἀντὶ τοῦ , ἀψευδὴς καὶ ἀληθής , Thdrt. Cf. Revelation 21:5 , οὗτοι οἱ λόγοι ἀληθινοὶ καὶ πιστοί εἰσιν : similarly Revelation 22:6 [or, one belonging to those who are of the πίστις ]."
2. "to save sinners (to be taken in the most general sense, not limited in any way), of whom (sinners; not, as Wegscheider, σωζομένων or σεσωσμένων : the aim and extent of the Lord’s mercy intensifies the feeling of his own especial unworthiness)"
3. "I am (not, ‘ was ’) chief (not, ‘one of the chief,’ as Flatt, nor does πρῶτος refer to time , which would not be the fact (see below): the expression is one of the deepest humility: αὐτὸν ὑπερβαίνει τῆς ταπεινοφροσύνης ὅρον , says Thdrt.: and indeed it is so, cf. Php 3:6 ; 1 Corinthians 15:9 ; Acts 23:1 ; Acts 24:16 ; but deep humility ever does so: it is but another form of ἐμοὶ τῷ ἁμαρτωλῷ , Luke 18:13 ; other men’s crimes seem to sink into nothing in comparison, and a man’s own to be the chief and only ones in his sight)"
