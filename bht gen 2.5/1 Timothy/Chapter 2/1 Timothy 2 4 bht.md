# 1 Timothy 2:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
God desires the salvation of all people and it is our responsibility to pray for the salvation of others. This does not suggest that everyone will be saved, but rather that God's will is for all to have the opportunity to accept or reject salvation. Salvation is available to all, and it should be offered to everyone. If someone is not saved, it is their own choice and a great sin. The nature of salvation is found in the deep knowledge of the eternal truth. God's will for the salvation of all is absolute and unchangeable.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Since He wishes that all should be saved, do you also wish it; and if you wish it, pray for it. For prayer is the instrument of effecting such things [CHRYSOSTOM]."
2. "Paul does not say, 'He wishes to save all'; for then he would have saved all in matter of fact; but 'will have all men to be saved,' implies the possibility of man's accepting it (through God's prevenient grace) or rejecting it (through man's own perversity)."
3. "Our prayers ought to include all, as God's grace included all."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "God wills that all people should be saved. It would be in accordance with his benevolent nature. He has made ample provision for it. He uses all proper means to secure their salvation. He uses no positive means to prevent it, and if they are not saved it will be their own fault."
2. "This verse proves: (1) That salvation is provided for all - for if God wished all people to be saved, he would undoubtedly make provision for their salvation; and if he had not made such provision, it could not be said that he desired their salvation, since no one can doubt that he has power to provide for the salvation of all; (2) That salvation should be offered to all people..."
3. "If God did not wish their salvation, and if he had made no provision for it, they could not be to blame if they rejected the gospel. If God wishes it, and has made provision for it, and they are not saved, the sin must be their own - and it is a great sin, for there is no greater crime which a man can commit than to destroy his own soul, and to make himself the eternal enemy of his Maker."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Prayer to God for all is acceptable to him, because he wills the salvation of all." 
2. "Epignwsiv [knowledge] is a favorite Pauline word. It signifies advanced or full knowledge."
3. "The logical relation in the writer's mind between salvation and the knowledge of the truth is not quite clear. Knowledge of the truth may be regarded as the means of salvation, or it may be the ideal goal of the whole saving work."

### John Calvin:
1. "Hence we see the childish folly of those who represent this passage to be opposed to predestination."
2. "There is no people and no rank in the world that is excluded from salvation; because God wishes that the gospel should be proclaimed to all without exception."
3. "The duty arising out of that love which we owe to our neighbor is, to be solicitous and to do our endeavor for the salvation of all whom God includes in his calling, and to testify this by godly prayers."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "No assertion of the universal love of God can be more clear than this."
2. "Men were tempted to draw a line of demarcation in their prayers, and could hardly bring themselves to pray for a Nero or a Tigellinus."
3. "The nature of the 'salvation' is expressed in the words that stand as in opposition with it. It is found in the 'knowledge' mil and deep, more than the mere gnosis of the understanding, of the truth which is eternal."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "God's wish and will in so far as he can influence men."
2. "First aorist passive infinitive of ÏƒÏ‰Î¶Ï‰ with accusative of general reference."
3. "Paul is anxious as in Colossians and Ephesians that the Gnostics may not lead the people astray."

### John Gill:
1. "The will of God, that all men should be saved, is not a conditional will, or what depends on the will of man, or on anything to be performed by him, for then none might be saved; and if any should, it would be of him that willeth, contrary to the express words of Scripture; but it is an absolute and unconditional will respecting their salvation, and which infallibly secures it."
2. "The will of God concerning man's salvation is entirely one, invariable, unalterable, and unchangeable."
3. "The will of God, the sovereign and unfrustrable will of God, has the governing sway and influence in the salvation of men; it rises from it, and is according to it; and all who are saved God wills they should be saved."

### John Wesley:
1. "Who willeth seriously all men - Not a part only, much less the smallest part."
2. "To be saved â€” Eternally. This is treated of, 1 Timothy 2:5,6."
3. "And, in order thereto, to come - They are not compelled."
