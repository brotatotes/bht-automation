## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "He is ONE in essence and one in purpose not of different minds to different nations or individuals, but of one mind towards all."
2. "There is no necessity that the idea should, as De W. and Schleierm., be connected with that of a mutual covenant, and so be here far-fetched as regards the context..."
3. "In the face of Œµ·º∑œÇ Œ∏ŒµœåœÇ, Œµ·º∑œÇ ŒºŒµœÉŒØœÑŒ∑œÇ Œ∏ŒµŒø·ø¶ Œ∫Œ±·Ω∂ ·ºÄŒΩŒ∏œÅœéœÄœâŒΩ, to maintain gravely such a position, shews utter blindness from party bias even to the plainest thoughts expressed in the plainest words."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The one God‚ÄîGod's unity in essence and purpose is a proof of His comprehending all His human children alike in His offer of grace..." 
2. "The one God is common to all... The one Mediator is mediator between God and all men potentially."
3. "The man‚Äîrather 'man,' absolutely and genetically: not a mere individual man: the Second Head of humanity, representing and embodying in Himself the whole human race and nature."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "There is but one Mediator; and but one is necessary. Prayer offered to the 'saints,' or to the 'Virgin,' is idolatry."
2. "All are on the same level, and the servant may feel that, in the gift of a Mediator, God regarded him with the same interest that he did his master."
3. "Jesus was truly and properly a man, having a perfect human body and soul, and is often called a man in the New Testament."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The universality of the grace is grounded in the unity of God." 
2. "One divine purpose for all implies one God who purposes." 
3. "The man Christ Jesus. The phrase only here."

### John Calvin:
1. "there is one God who justifieth the circumcision by faith, and the uncircumcision through faith."
2. "he mentions the human nature rather than the divine. This ought to be carefully observed."
3. "they who have actually learned the office of Christ will be satisfied with having him alone, and that none will make mediators at their own pleasure but those who neither know God nor Christ."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "There is one God... the Unity of the Godhead is more than the negation of plurality; that it implies oneness of purpose, unchanging and unvarying."
2. "That purpose is one of an unalterable love."
3. "If one only, and that as being 'a man,' then his mediation must be for all humanity, and the whole human race has been redeemed by him."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "One God. Regular Pauline argument for a universal gospel."
2. "One mediator. Late word from ŒºŒµœÉŒøœÇ, a middle man."
3. "Himself man. No 'himself' in the Greek."

### John Gill:
1. "For there is one God... who, in a providential way, is the Saviour of all men... and in a way of special grace is the one God, the one covenant God of all sorts of men, of Jews and Gentiles."
2. "A Mediator is of more than one, and has to do with two parties; and these at variance among themselves, between whom he stands as a middle person; his business is to bring them together, and make peace between them; and such an one is Christ."
3. "He who is the Mediator between God and man, has assumed a nature which is common to them all... there is but one Mediator between God and all sorts of men, through whom both Jews and Gentiles have an access to God, and peace with him."

### John Wesley:
1. "There is one God - And they who have not him, through the one Mediator, have no God."
2. "One mediator also - We could not rejoice that there is a God, were there not a mediator also; one who stands between God and men, to reconcile man to God, and to transact the whole affair of our salvation."
3. "This excludes all other mediators, as saints and angels, whom the Papists set up and idolatrously worship as such: just as the heathens of old set up many mediators, to pacify their superior gods."
