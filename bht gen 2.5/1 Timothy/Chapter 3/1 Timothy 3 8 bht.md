### John Gill:
1. "The apostle proceeds to give the qualifications, and so the rules for choosing another sort of officers in the church, deacons."
2. "Their characters are, that they be 'grave'; in their speech, gesture, and dress; honest, and of good report among men; and chaste in their words and actions."

### John Wesley:
1. "Likewise the deacons must be serious ‚Äî Men of a grave, decent, venerable behaviour."
2. "But where are presbyters? Were this order essentially distinct from that of bishops, could the apostle have passed it over in silence?"
3. "All that is gained (above food and raiment) by ministering in holy things is filthy gain indeed; far more filthy than what is honestly gained by raking kennels, or emptying common sewers."
