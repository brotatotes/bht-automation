## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "IN honourable (excellent) works"; the sphere or element in which the good report of her had place.
2. she . . . brought up childrenâ€”either her own, or those of others, which is one of the "good works"; a qualification adapting her for ministry to orphan children, and to mothers of families.
3. washed . . . saints' feetâ€”after the example of the Lord; a specimen of the universal spirit of humbly "by love serving one another," which actuated the early Christians.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "If she have brought up children - Either her own or others. The idea is, if she has done this in a proper manner."
2. "If she have lodged strangers - If she has been characterized by hospitality - a virtue greatly commended in the Scriptures."
3. "If she have diligently followed every good work - This is one of the characteristics of true piety. A sincere Christian will, like God, be the friend of all that is good, and will be ready to promote every good object according to his ability."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The phrase includes good deeds of all kinds, and not merely special works of beneficence."

### John Calvin:

2. "And at the same time he holds out this as an honorable reward to godly matrons, who have not spared themselves, that they, in their turn, shall be received into the bosom of the Church in their old age."
3. "By a figure of speech, in which a part is taken for the whole, he means by the washing of the feet all the services which are commonly rendered to the saints; for at that time it was customary to 'wash the feet.'"

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The Greek word seems purposely chosen to leave it open whether the children thus brought up were her own or those, orphans or destitute, of whom she had taken charge."
2. "The isolated position of a small Christian community in an Asiatic town, the utter loneliness of a Christian traveller arriving in such a town, gave a prominence to the exercise of hospitality which made it incumbent on poor as well as rich."
3. "As in John 13:14, the typical instance of extremest humility in ministration, analogous to the test of kissing a leperâ€™s flesh which Francis of Assisi imposed on his disciples."

### Archibald T. Robertson:

3. "Experience that qualified her for eleemosynary work."
