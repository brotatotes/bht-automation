### Henry Alford:
1. "Against a presbyter entertain not an accusation, except before two or three witnesses."
2. "The Œ∫Œ±œÑŒ∑Œ≥ŒøœÅŒØŒ±ŒΩ œÄŒ±œÅŒ±Œ¥Œ≠œáŒµœÉŒ∏Œ±Œπ being used not of mere citation, but of entertaining the charge as a valid one: in other words, as including citation and conviction as well."
3. "He is only recalling the attention of Timotheus to a known and prescribed precaution, which was in this case especially to be always observed."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "A judicial conviction was not permitted in Deuteronomy 17:6; Deuteronomy 19:15, except on the testimony of at least two or three witnesses."
2. "But Timothy's entertaining an accusation against anyone is a different case, where the object was not judicially to punish, but to admonish: here he might ordinarily entertain it without the need of two or three witnesses; but not in the case of an elder..."
3. "How important then was it that Timothy should not, without strong testimony, entertain a charge against presbyters, who should, in order to be efficient, be 'blameless' (1 Timothy 3:2; Titus 1:6)."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The ministers of religion often give offence to wicked people by their rebukes of sin... wicked people would rejoice to see an accusation against them sustained; the cause of religion would be liable to suffer much when its ministers were condemned as guilty of gross offences, and it is right, therefore, that the evidence in the case should be as free as possible from all suspicion that it is caused by malignity, by hatred of religion, or by conspiracy, or by a desire to see religion disgraced."
2. "The character of a minister of the gospel is of value, not only to himself and family, as is the case with that of other people, but is of special value to the church, and to the cause of religion. It is the property of the church. The interests of religion depend much on it, and it should not be wantonly assailed."
3. "If a minister of the gospel has been proved to be guilty of crime, the honor of religion, as well as simple justice, requires that he shall be punished as he deserves. He sins against great light; he prostitutes a holy office, and makes use of the very reputation which his office gives him, that he may betray the confidence of others; and such a man should not escape. There should be no 'benefit of clergy', and neither a black coat, nor bands, nor the lawn should save a villain."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Receive not an accusation. It means a formal accusation before a tribunal." 
2. "A pleonastic formula, except in case." 
3. "On condition that two witnesses testify."

### John Calvin:
1. "But it may be thought strange, that he represents, as peculiar to elders, a law which is common to all. God lays down, authoritatively, this law as applicable to all cases, that they shall be decided 'by the mouth of two or three witnesses.'"
2. "This is a necessary remedy against the malice of men; for none are more liable to slanders and calumnies than godly teachers."
3. "And this is what Satan, as I have said, chiefly labors to accomplish; for not only is the saying of Plato true in this instance, that 'the multitude are malicious, and envy those who are above them,' but the more earnestly any pastor strives to advance the kingdom of Christ, so much the more is he loaded with envy, and so much the fiercer are the assaults made on him."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The rule of ‚Äòtwo or three witnesses,‚Äô which in Deuteronomy 19:15 is given as applicable to all judicial testimony, is here specialized as applying √† fortiori to a case where there was a presumption in favour of the accused."
2. "Against an elder. Here the context is obviously in favour of the official sense."
3. "The rule of ‚Äòtwo or three witnesses,‚Äô which in Deuteronomy 19:15 is given as applicable to all judicial testimony, is here specialized as applying √† fortiori to a case where there was a presumption in favour of the accused."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Against an elder... Receive not."
2. "Accusation... Except at the mouth of."
3. "At the mouth of... upon the basis of."

### John Gill:
1. "A charge against a pastor of a church is not to be easily received; it should not be listened to privately, unless it clearly appears by such a number of witnesses... that it is really fact." 
2. "The affair of an elder shall not be put upon a trial, much less sentence pass, until it has been privately proved against him, by proper testimonies, beyond all exception; only in such a case, should a church admit a charge against its elder."
3. "The reason of this rule is, because of his high office and the honour of the church, which is concerned in his... for such a person to be charged, even though he may be cleared."

### John Wesley:
1. "Do not even receive an accusation, unless by two or three witnesses." 
2. "St. Paul forbids an elder to be even cited on such evidence, his reputation being of more importance than that of others."
3. "His reputation being of more importance than that of others."
