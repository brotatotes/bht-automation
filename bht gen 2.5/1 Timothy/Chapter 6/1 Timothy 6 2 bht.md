## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:

3. "These things (viz. those immediately preceding, relating to slaves) teach and exhort."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Let them not, because they are brethren, despise them."
2. "But all the more (so much the more: with the greater good will) do them service because they are faithful and beloved who receive the benefit."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It is quite clear, from the New Testament, as well as from facts now, that God may convert people when pursuing any kind of wickedness."
2. "The apostle would have Timothy teach that Christianity did not rudely assail the existing institutions of society, and especially did not teach those who were in subordinate ranks to be disrespectful to these above them."
3. "In all the relations of life, we should respect those above us the more in proportion to the excellency of their character."

### Marvin Vincent:

### John Calvin:
1. "It is no small honor, that God has made them equal to earthly lords, in that which is of the highest importance; for they have the same adoption in common with them; and therefore this ought to be no slight inducement to bear slavery with patience."
2. "Slavery is much more easily endured under mild lords, who love us, and whom we love in return. There is also the bond of faith which binds very closely together those who are of different conditions."
3. "Let us learn to honor the graces of God when they shall be placed before our eyes; and when we shall see a man who has some token of the fear of God and of faith, let us value him so much the more, that we may seek to cherish the closest friendship with him."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The risk contemplated was, lest the new sense of fraternity should pass into a revolutionary claim to equality." 
2. "The rendering is, however, altogether wrong, and we must read, 'because they who receive the benefit (i.e. as on a footing of reciprocity) are faithful and beloved.'"
3. "We note in this the delicate and generous tact with which St. Paul, following or coinciding with Seneca, implies that in the increased activity of their service slaves may assume a new position as benefactors, and as it were confer a favour on their masters."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Let not despise them...He must not presume on the equality of Christian brotherhood not allowed by the state's laws."

3. "when believing servants serve their believing masters readily and faithfully, their masters are well pleased with them, delight in their service, and consider it as a benefit to them"

### John Wesley:
1. "Let them not despise them ‚Äî Pay them the less honour or obedience."
2. "They that live in a religious community know the danger of this; and that greater grace is requisite to bear with the faults of a brother, than of an infidel, or man of the world."
3. "Serve them so much the more diligently. Because they are joint partakers of the great benefit - Salvation."
