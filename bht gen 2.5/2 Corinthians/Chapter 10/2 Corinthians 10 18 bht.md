# 2 Corinthians 10:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Believers should not seek self-commendation but rather the commendation of the Lord. The Lord's approval is what truly matters, as it signifies that they can withstand the final trial. Self-commendation holds no value and is not approved by God or good men. Ultimately, it is God's judgment and commendation that carry true significance.

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1.  Is approved (Î´Î¿ÎºÎ¹Î¼Î¿Ï‚). Accepted (from Î´ÎµÏ‡Î¿Î¼Î±) by the Lord. The Lord accepts his own recommendation (ÏƒÏ…Î½Î¹ÏƒÏ„Î·ÏƒÎ¹Î½, see on 2 Corinthians 3:1).
