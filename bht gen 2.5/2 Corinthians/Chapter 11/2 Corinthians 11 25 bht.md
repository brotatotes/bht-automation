## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The beating by Roman magistrates at Philippi (Acts 16:23) is the only one recorded in Acts, which does not profess to give a complete journal of his life..."
2. "Once was I stoned‚Äî (Acts 16:23- :)."
3. "Thrice . . . shipwreck‚Äîbefore the shipwreck at Melita (Acts 16:23- :). Probably in some of his voyages from Tarsus, where he stayed for some time after his conversion..."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Thrice was I beaten with rods...This was a frequent mode of punishment among the ancient nations, and as Paul was often persecuted, he would be naturally subjected to this shameful punishment."
2. "Once I was stoned...The instance referred to here occurred at Lystra; Acts 14:19...had the assault been completed; had the history related that a stone was thrown...a contradiction between the history and the Epistle would have ensued."
3. "Thrice I suffered shipwreck...shipwrecks in those seas were by no means such unusual occurrences as to render this account improbable."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Thrice I suffered shipwreck. The shipwreck at Malta, being later, is, of course, not referred to; so that no one of these three is on record."
2. "A night and a day [ŒΩœÖœáŒ∏Œ∑ŒºŒµœÅŒøŒΩ] . A compound term occurring only here in the New Testament, and rarely in later Greek."
3. "Have I been in the deep [ŒµŒΩ œÑœâ Œ≤œÖŒ∏œâ œÄŒµœÄŒøŒπŒ∑Œ∫Œ±] . Lit., I have made (spent) a night and a day in the deep."

### John Calvin:
1. "We have not, however, a complete narrative, nor is there mention made in it of every particular that occurred, but only of the principal things."
2. "While the narrative contained in the Acts of the Apostles gives an account of only one instance in which Paul was actually stoned, there was, previously to that, 'an assault' made upon Paul and Barnabas at Iconium."
3. "Truth is necessarily consistent; but it is scarcely it possible that independent accounts, not having truth to guide them, should thus advance to the very brink of contradiction without falling into it."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Thrice was I beaten with rods...this was an illegal act, inflicted barbarously and with cruel aggravations."
2. "Once was I stoned...he was 'supposed to be dead.'"
3. "Thrice I suffered shipwreck...clinging to some plank and escaping with difficulty."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Thrice was I beaten with rods... It was forbidden to Roman citizens... but Paul endured it."
2. "Once was I stoned... At Lystra."
3. "Thrice I suffered shipwreck... We know nothing of these."

### John Gill:
1. "Thrice was I beaten with rods....there is no room to doubt." 
2. "Once was I stoned....by whom he was left for dead." 
3. "A night and a day I have been in the deep....this phrase may signify that the ship in which he was was drove from the coast into the sea."

### John Wesley:
1. Thrice I have been shipwrecked ‚Äî Before his voyage to Rome.
In the deep ‚Äî Probably floating on some part of the vessel.
