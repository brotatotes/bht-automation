# 2 Corinthians 11:27 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Paul endured labor, weariness, watchings, hunger, thirst, and frequent fastings. His self-devotion seems almost superhuman, especially considering his constant infirm health. He also experienced cold and nakedness, often resulting from insufficient clothing. Paul's toil and moil, loss of sleep, and danger led to his watchings. His long journeys and frequent preaching were painful and troublesome to the flesh. Despite these hardships, Paul served Christ with a pure conscience, not despising less illustrious trials. He had no certain dwelling place and lacked the comforts of life, yet he appeared before noble-men, governors, and kings without shame.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "by labour and weariness, by watchings, by hunger and thirst, by fastings frequently, in cold and nakedness." 
2. "voluntary fastings, ‚Äòad purificandam mentem et edomandam carnem,‚Äô as Estius, see also ch. 2Co 6:5 note."
3. "in cold and nakedness (insufficient clothing: or, literally, when thrust into prison after his scourgings, or after his shipwrecks)."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Hunger and thirst" are not synonymous with "foodlessness" (as the Greek of "fasting" means), but are its consequences.
2. "Cold" resulting from "nakedness," or insufficient clothing, as the Greek often means: as "hunger and thirst" result from "foodlessness."
3. "When we remember that he who endured all this was a man constantly suffering from infirm health, such heroic self-devotion seems almost superhuman."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The word Œ∫ŒøÃÅœÄŒøœÇ kopos (from Œ∫ŒøÃÅœÄœÑœâ koptoÃÑ, 'to beat, to cut') means, properly, 'wailing and grief,' accompanied with beating the breast. Hence, the word means 'toil, labor, wearisome effort.'"
2. "This word (ŒºŒøÃÅœáŒ∏ŒøœÇ mochthos) is a stronger term than the former. It implies painful effort; labor producing sorrow."
3. "In watchings often - In loss of sleep, arising from abundant toils and from danger."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Watchings. See on ch. 2 Corinthians 6:5.


### John Calvin:
1. "For how may we better distinguish Christ‚Äôs servants than by proofs so numerous, so various, and so important?"
2. "That man, therefore, who will be signalized by so many marks of distinction, will not despise those that are less illustrious, and less thoroughly tried, nor will he on that account be elated with pride"
3. "For the main thing is ‚Äî that we serve Christ with a pure conscience. All other things are, as it were, additional."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "In labour and travail, in watchings often, in hunger and thirst."
2. "In fastings often not voluntary fastings, which he would not mention as a privation he had endured, but in the sense of the next clause."
3. "In cold and nakedness such as he would doubtless often experience in his travels through inhospitable regions."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "In labour and travail (Œ∫ŒøœÄœâ Œ∫Œ± ŒºŒøœáŒ∏œâ). Both old words for severe work, combined here as in 1 Thessalonians 2:9; 2 Thessalonians 3:8, 'by toil and moil' (Plummer)."
2. "In cold (ŒµŒΩ œàœÖœáŒµ). Old word from œàœÖœáœâ, to cool by blowing. See Acts 28:2."
3. "See the picture of the aged Paul later in the Roman dungeon (2 Timothy 4:9-18)."

### John Gill:
1. "Through long journeys and frequent preaching... the labours of the apostle were painful and troublesome to the flesh." 
2. "He doing that freely without asking the assistance of any, which in some places would have been prejudicial to his designs, and the spread of the Gospel."
3. "Having no certain dwelling place to retire unto and abide in, during any severe season there might be, and wanting the comforts of life to support him under such inconveniences."

### John Wesley:
1. "Having no place where to lay my head; no convenient raiment to cover me; yet appearing before noble-men, governors, kings."
2. "Not being ashamed."
3. "In cold and nakedness."
