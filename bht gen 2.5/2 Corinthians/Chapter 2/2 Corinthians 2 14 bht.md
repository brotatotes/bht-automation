2. "Though as good soldiers of Jesus Christ we seemed to be almost everywhere victorious, we feared greatly that Corinth, apparently our most wonderful triumph, was to prove a sad exception; but, blessed be God, it has not been so, but 'in every place' even there He makes the sweet savour of the knowledge of Him in Christ, diffused through us, to go up as that of the offering up of an acceptable sacrifice."
3. "According to the classical usage of the word, the true rendering of this clause is, 'who triumphs over us,' or 'leads us in triumph;' and some of the best interpreters think themselves bound so to interpret it, understanding the apostle to mean that God had so subdued his anxieties and fears as to make him feel as one conquered and carried in triumph as a captive."

3. "Thanks are also given to God, that he maketh manifest the savour of his knowledge by us in every place."

### John Wesley:
