# 2 Corinthians 3:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When the heart of Israel turns to the Lord, the veil is taken away, allowing them to understand their own Scriptures and see their true beauty. This conversion will be a mass conversion of the people, and the veil will vanish at once when they look upon Christ. The true and full meaning of the Bible can only be obtained by turning to God. The prophecies of the Old Testament will be seen in their proper light and fulfilled in Christ, and the true nature and end of the law will be discovered.
