# 2 Corinthians 3:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The new covenant, distinguished from the law, brings life through the Spirit, while the letter of the law brings knowledge of sin. The new covenant emphasizes spiritual holiness and the spirit of outward observances, rather than the letter. God has made ministers sufficient for the new covenant, which provides forgiveness and peace, unlike the condemning nature of the law. The spirit of the Gospel, empowered by the grace of the Spirit, works effectually on the hearts of believers.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The new Covenant, i.e. the gospel, as distinguished from the law."
2. "The letter killeth, brings the knowledge of sin, its guilt and its punishment."
3. "The Spirit giveth life, not merely life eternal, but the whole new life of the man of God."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "ministers not of the mere literal precept, in which the old law, as then understood, consisted; 'but of the Spirit,' that is, the spiritual holiness which lay under the old law, and which the new covenant brings to light."
2. "No piety of spirit could exempt a man from the yoke of the letter of each legal ordinance under the Old Testament; for God had appointed this as the way in which He chose a devout Jew to express his state of mind towards God. Christianity, on the other hand, makes the spirit of our outward observances everything, and the letter a secondary consideration."
3. "True spirituality rests on the whole written word, applied to the soul by the Holy Spirit as the only infallible interpreter of its far-reaching spirituality. The letter is nothing without the spirit, in a subject essentially spiritual. The spirit is nothing without the letter, in a record substantially historical."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It refers properly to his sense of the responsibility and difficulty of the work of the ministry; and to the fact that he did not esteem himself to be sufficient for this work in his own strength."
2. "He has supplied our deficiency; he has rendered us competent, or fit; if a word may be coined after the manner of the Greek here, 'he has sufficienced us for this work.'"
3. "The spirit here seems to refer to the New Testament, or the new dispensation in contradistinction from the old. That was characterized mainly by its strictness of Law, and by its burdensome rites, and by the severe tone of its denunciation for sin. It did not in itself provide a way of pardon and peace. Law condemns; it does not speak of forgiveness."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Hath made us sufficient as ministers."
2. "Of a new covenant, in contrast with the Mosaic."
3. "The letter, which is 'spirit and life'."

### John Calvin:
1. "Now this he makes to consist in the efficacy of the Spirit."
2. "For by the term letter he means outward preaching, of such a kind as does not reach the heart; and, on the other hand, by spirit he means living doctrine, of such a nature as worketh effectually on the minds of men, through the grace of the Spirit."
3. "The meaning of this passage, however, is as follows â€” that, if the word of God is simply uttered with the mouth, it is an occasion of death, and that it is lifegiving, only when it is received with the heart."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "not we are fit of our-selves. . . but our fitness is from God" 
2. "The expression 'able ministers' in the Authorised Version is now unsuitable from its ambiguity" 
3. "but not of the law itself, considered as a code of duty, to be obeyed on pain of death, but of the spirit that word of the Gospel which, instinct with quickening power, 'is spirit and life'"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Late causative verb from Î¹ÎºÎ±Î½Î¿Ï‚ (verse 2 Corinthians 3:5) first aorist active indicative, 'who (God) rendered us fit.'"
2. "As ministers of a new covenant (Î´Î¹Î±ÎºÎ¿Î½Î¿Ï…Ï‚ ÎºÎ±Î¹Î½Î·Ï‚ Î´Î¹Î±Î¸Î·ÎºÎ·Ï‚). Predicate accusative with Î¹ÎºÎ±Î½Ï‰ÏƒÎµÎ½."
3. "Only God can make us that."

### John Gill:
1. "Our sufficiency is of God, he hath made us able, or sufficient ministers: such ministers as are not of men's, but God's making, are sufficient ones."
2. "The Gospel, and the ministry of it, is nothing else but an exhibition of the covenant of grace, its blessings and promises."
3. "The law is 'the letter', not merely because written in letters, for so likewise is the Gospel; but because it is a mere letter, hereby showing what is to be done or avoided, without any efficacy in it."

### John Wesley:
1. "Not of the law, fitly called the letter, from God's literally writing it on the two tables."
2. "But of the Spirit â€” Of the gospel dispensation, which is written on the tables of our hearts by the Spirit."
3. "Yea, if we adhere to the literal sense even of the moral law, if we regard only the precept and the sanction as they stand in themselves, not as they lead us to Christ, they are doubtless a killing ordinance, and bind us down under the sentence of death."

- Attempt 1 BHT: The verse 2 Corinthians 3:6 contrasts the old covenant of the law with the new covenant of the Spirit. The old covenant brought knowledge of sin and its consequences, while the new covenant brings life and spiritual holiness. The letter of the law without the spirit is powerless, but the spirit without the letter lacks a solid foundation. God has made ministers sufficient for the new covenant, which emphasizes the spirit of outward observances rather than the letter. The new covenant provides forgiveness and peace, unlike the condemning nature of the law.
