# 2 Corinthians 5:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
At the judgment-seat of Christ, every individual will be revealed as they truly are, with their deeds done through the body being judged. This judgment is not to determine salvation, which is by grace alone, but to determine the rewards or consequences of one's actions. The judgment will be fair and visible to all, with the assembled universe and individuals themselves recognizing its righteousness. The righteous will also be judged, and their deeds done in the body will be taken into account in fixing their final state.
