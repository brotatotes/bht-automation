## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The verse asserts strongly, with a view to substantiate and explain 2 Corinthians 5:2, the truth of the resurrection or glorified body."
2. "To this Meyer rightly objects, that it is open to the difficulty of making á¼”Î½Î´Ï…ÏƒÎ¹Ï‚ and Î³Ï…Î¼Î½ÏŒÏ„Î·Ï‚, and that in the very sense in which they are opposites, to co-exist; no clothing but that of a body is thought of here."
3. "Of all these we may say, that if the Apostle had meant by Î³Ï…Î¼Î½Î¿Î¯ to hint at any other kind of Î³Ï…Î¼Î½ÏŒÏ„Î·Ï‚ than that which the similitude obviously implies, he would have certainly indicated it."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

3. "Stripped of our present body."

3. "The whole expression, being clothed - naked is equivalent to we shall not be found naked because we shall be clothed."

### John Calvin:
1. "The wicked, too, are stripped of the body, but as they bring nothing within the view of God, but a disgraceful nakedness, they are, consequently, not clothed with a glorious body."
2. "Believers...receive the glorious robe of immortality."
3. "The Apostle...makes mention here of a twofold clothing, with which God invests us â€” the righteousness of Christ, and sanctification of the Spirit in this life; and, after death, immortality and glory."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Rendered as in our Authorised Version, a shade of doubt is undoubtedly conveyed to every English ear; while full certainty as to his eternal future is, in every varied form, conveyed here in almost every verse down to the ninth."
2. "And though competent scholars question whether in Biblical Greek the same certainty is conveyed by the particle here used as in classical Greek, yet, since this is only doubted, while it is admitted that the context must be our chief guide, we seem shut up by the present context in order to exclude that shade of doubt which the Authorised Version suggests to render the words as we have done."
3. "As to the word 'naked' here, it would be a mistake to refer it, as some do, to the spiritual 'defencelessness' in which the wicked will be found at the great day... The next verse points to the real allusion to that notion (so natural to all thoughtful Pagans, who were strangers to the doctrine of a resurrection) that the body, in its very nature, is nothing better than a clog to the only real part of man, his soul, which will never be capable of full development till disengaged by death from that encumbrance."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Being clothed (ÎµÎ½Î´Ï…ÏƒÎ±Î¼ÎµÎ½Î¿). First aorist middle participle, having put on the garment."
2. "Naked (Î³Ï…Î¼Î½Î¿). That is, disembodied spirits, 'like the souls in Sheol, without form, and void of all power of activity' (Plummer)."

### John Gill:
1. "If so be that being clothed,.... This supposition is made with respect to the saints who shall be alive at Christ's second coming, who will not be stripped of their bodies, and so will 'not be found naked', or disembodied, and shall have a glory at once put upon them, both soul and body."
2. "Seeing we are clothed, have not only put on the new man, and are clothed and adorned with the graces of the Spirit, but are arrayed with the best robe, the wedding garment, the robe of Christ's righteousness, we shall not be found naked."
3. "Some read these words as a wish, 'O that we were clothed, that we might not be found naked!' and so is expressive of one of the sighs, and groans, and earnest desires of the saints in their present situation after the glories of another world."

### John Wesley:
1. If being clothed â€” That is, with the image of God, while we are in the body.
We shall not be found naked â€” Of the wedding garment.
