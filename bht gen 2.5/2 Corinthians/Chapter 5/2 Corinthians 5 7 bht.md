# 2 Corinthians 5:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Believers are called to live by faith, not by appearance or sight. This means confidently expecting unseen realities to influence our actions as if they were seen. Although we may not physically see God or heavenly things, their importance and nature remain unchanged. Faith serves as the eye of the soul, looking to Christ for righteousness, peace, and salvation. Through faith, we receive and walk in Him. In this life, we walk by faith, but in the future, we will have the full sight of God.
