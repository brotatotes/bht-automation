## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "After a question beginning with πῶς , τίς , and the like, a second question is regularly introduced by δέ . Thus Hom. Od. α . 225, τίς δαίς , τίς δὲ ὅμιλος ; see Hartung, Partikellehre, i. 169."
2. "βελίαρ ] Heb. בְּלִיַּעַל , ‘contemptibleness,’ ‘wickedness:’ found 1Sa 2:12 al., and variously translated by the LXX. Theod. has retained the original form in Judges 19:22 ."
3. "It appears to have been subsequently personified, and used, as here, for a name of the Evil One (see Stanley). The termination - αρ is stated by Meyer to have arisen from the frequent permutation of λ and ρ in the dialect of the Grecian Jews."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "As Satan is opposed to God, and Antichrist to Christ; Belial being here opposed to Christ, must denounce all manner of Antichristian uncleanness."
2. "Belial—Hebrew, 'worthlessness, unprofitableness, wickedness.'"
3. "he that believeth with an infidel—Translate, 'a believer with an unbeliever.'"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "What accordance, what unison is there; what strings are there which being struck will produce a chord or harmony?"
2. "The persons to whom Paul referred, the pagan, wicked, unbelieving world, were governed by the principles of Satan, and were 'taken captive by him at his will'... and so it should be with the followers of the one in relation to the followers of the other."
3. "The believer... should not select his partner in life and his chosen companions and friends from this class, but from those with whom he has sympathy, and with whom he has common feelings and hopes."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Primarily of the concord of sounds."
2. "Belial is a transcript of the Hebrew, meaning worthlessness or wickedness."
3. "Here a synonym for Satan."

### John Calvin:
1. "As there is an irreconcilable variance between Christ and Satan, so we also must keep aloof from partnership with the wicked."
2. "When Paul says that a Christian has no participation with an unbeliever, he does not mean as to food, clothing, estates, the sun, the air... but as to those things that are peculiar to unbelievers, from which the Lord has separated us."
3. "For from what holds good as to the two heads, he comes down without delay to the members."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "And what concord hath Christ with Belial?" - It evidently is meant as a synonym for Satan (Stanley).
2. "or what portion hath a believer with an unbeliever?" - It is not their having different speculative opinions about religion that makes intimate fellowship between them impracticable; it is that a believer is supposed to live for fundamentally different ends, and to have entirely different interests and modes of action, from an unbeliever.
3. "(See on chap. 2 Corinthians 5:16-17.)" - The commentary refers to another chapter and verse for further understanding.

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Paul graphically sums up the contrast between Christ and Belial (Satan), the heads of the contending forces of good and evil."
2. "Here by 'unbeliever' (απιστου) Paul means 'disbeliever,' not just an unconverted man who yet approves Christ."
3. "Concord (συμφωνησις). Symphony."

### John Gill:
1. "Belial is a wicked man, who does not succeed and does not prosper."
2. "Children of Belial are children that break off the yoke of heaven (i.e., the law) from their necks."
3. "Between Christ personal, and Belial the devil, there is no concord, but a perpetual enmity."

### John Wesley:
1. What concord hath Christ — Whom ye serve.
With Belial — To whom they belong.
