# 2 Corinthians 7:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Apostle Paul initially regretted the severity of his rebukes in his previous letter to the Corinthians, but upon seeing the positive impact it had on them, he no longer regretted it. He rejoiced in the fact that his letter had made them sorry, even though it was only for a season. Paul's regret was temporary, and he was glad that he had caused them sorrow because it ultimately led to their spiritual growth. The sorrow they experienced was genuine, heartfelt, and had a lasting effect.
