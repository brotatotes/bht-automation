## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Such cunningly-devised fables would be the mythologies of the heathen, the cabalistic stories of the Jews; and these may be alluded to, and perhaps also the fables of the Gnostics, which could, it is true, only be in their infancy, but still might be pointed at by St. Peter."
2. "the power (viz., that conferred on Him by the Father at His glorification, of which the following scene testified, and the actuality of which He himself asserted, when He said, Matthew 28:18 , ἐδόθη μοι πᾶσα ἐξουσία ἐν οὐρανῷ καὶ ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς : in the strength of which He will come to judge the world) and coming (i. e., as ever, second and glorious coming: not, as Erasm. and many others, His first coming."
3. "ἐπόπτης is a technical word, used of those who were admitted to the highest degree of initiation in the Eleusinian mysteries: and, considering the occasion to which allusion is made, there seems no reason for letting go altogether this reference here: 'admitted as initiated spectators.'"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "A precautionary protest of the Spirit against the rationalistic theory of the Gospel history being myth." 
2. "A specimen of His power was given at the Transfiguration also of His 'coming' again, and its attendant glory."
3. "As initiated spectators of mysteries, we were admitted into His innermost secrets, namely, at the Transfiguration."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The doctrines which they held about the coming of the Saviour were not, like many of the opinions of the Greeks, defended by weak and sophistical reasoning, but were based on solid evidence - evidence furnished by the personal observation of competent witnesses."
2. "The advent of the Saviour is commonly represented as connected with the exhibition of power... The 'power' evinced will be by raising the dead; summoning the world to judgment; determining the destiny of men, etc."
3. "The evidence as it lay in Peter’s mind was, that that transfiguration was designed to furnish proof to them that the Messiah would certainly appear in glory, and to give them a view of him as coming to reign which would never fade from their memory."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Cunningly devised...artfully framed by human cleverness." 
2. "The reference here may be to the Jewish myths, rabbinical embellishments of Old - Testament history; or to the heathen myths about the descent of the gods to earth, which might be suggested by his remembrance of the transfiguration; or to the Gnostic speculations about aeons or emanations, which rose from the eternal abyss..."
3. "Eye-witnesses...Majesty. Used in only two passages besides this: Luke 9:43, of the mighty power (Rev., majesty) of God, as manifested in the healing of the epileptic child; and Acts 19:27, of the magnificence of Diana."

### John Calvin:
1. "For we have not followed cunningly devised fables." 
2. "And they were encouraged to persevere, when they were sure of the prosperous issue of their calling."
3. "But let us remember that the gospel was not at the beginning made up of vague rumors, but that the apostles were the authentic preachers of what they had seen."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "For we did not follow cunningly devised myths, when we made known to you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ."
2. "The ‘myths’ are defined as ‘cunningly devised,’ or cleverly elaborated."
3. "For it was not as having followed cleverly-contrived myths that we made known to you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but as having become eye-witnesses of His majesty."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Cunningly devised fables (σεσοφισμενοις μυθοις). Associative instrumental case of μυθος (old term for word, narrative, story, fiction, fable, falsehood)."
2. "Some of the false teachers apparently taught that the Gospel miracles were only allegories and not facts (Bigg)."
3. "Peter clearly felt that he and James and John were lifted to the highest stage of initiation at the Transfiguration of Christ."

### John Gill:
1. "we have not followed cunningly devised fables"
2. "when we made known unto you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ"
3. "But were eyewitnesses of his majesty"

### John Wesley:
1. "These things are worthy to be always had in remembrance For they are not cunningly devised fables."
2. "But if what they advanced of Christ was not true, if it was of their own invention, then to impose such a lie on the world as it was, in the very nature of things, above all human power to defend, and to do this at the expense of life and all things only to enrage the whole world, Jews and gentiles, against them, was no cunning, but was the greatest folly that men could have been guilty of."
3. "But were eyewitnesses of his majesty — At his transfiguration, which was a specimen of his glory at the last day."
