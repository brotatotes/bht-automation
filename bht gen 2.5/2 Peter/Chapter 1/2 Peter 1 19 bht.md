# 2 Peter 1:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The prophetic word is a more secure and sure confirmation of God's truth than even the voice heard at the Transfiguration. It is compared to a lamp shining in a dark place, making objects distinct and enabling us to behold things that would otherwise be invisible. Believers are encouraged to give earnest heed to the prophetic word, which serves as a guiding light until the day dawns and the day-star arises. The prophetic word is seen as a clearer light than the Old Testament, and it is emphasized that without attending to the light of the word, one is immersed in darkness.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "we possess, more secure...the prophetic word, as now having in our own ears begun its fulfillment."
2. "the written word of God...as being of wider and larger reference, embracing...a broader basis for the Christianâ€™s trust"
3. "the testimony of the Transfiguration presented only the glory of Christ in the days of His flesh, whereas the prophetic word substantiates His future glory also."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The fulfilment of prophecy so far in Christ's history makes us the surer of what is yet to be fulfilled, His consummated glory."
2. "The day, when it dawns upon you, makes sure the fact that you saw correctly, though indistinctly, the objects revealed by the lamp."
3. "Christ's arising in the heart by His Spirit giving full assurance, creates spiritually full day in the heart, the means to which is prayerfully giving heed to the word."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "A literal translation of the passage would be, 'and we have the prophetic word more firm.'"
2. "The prophecies resemble a candle, lamp, or torch, in a dark room, or in an obscure road at night. They make objects distinct which were before unseen; they enable us to behold many things which would be otherwise invisible."
3. "Meantime we should avail ourselves of all the light which we have, and should apply ourselves diligently to the study of the prophecies of the Old Testament which are still unfulfilled, and of those in the New Testament which direct the mind onward to brighter and more glorious scenes than this world has yet witnessed."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "We have the word of prophecy made more sure, i.e., we are better certified than before as to the prophetic word by reason of this voice."
2. "We have the word of prophecy as a surer confirmation of God's truth than what we ourselves saw, i.e., Old - Testament testimony is more convincing than even the voice heard at the transfiguration."
3. "Peter knew a sounder basis for faith than that of signs and wonders. He had seen our Lord Jesus Christ receive honor and glory from God the Father in the holy mount; he had been dazzled and carried out of himself by visions and voices from heaven; but, nevertheless, even when his memory and heart are throbbing with recollections of that sublime scene, he says, 'we have something surer still in the prophetic word.'"

### John Calvin:
1. "But the solution of this knot is not difficult: for here the Apostle had a regard to his own nation, who were acquainted with the prophets, and their doctrine was received without any dispute. As, then, it was not doubted by the Jews but that all the things which the prophets had taught, came from the Lord, it is no wonder that Peter said that their word was more sure." 
2. "In short, Peter reminds us that as long as we sojourn in this world, we have need of the doctrine of the prophets as a guiding light; which being extinguished, we can do nothing else but wander in darkness; for he does not disjoin the prophecies from the gospel, when he teaches us that they shine to shew us the way."
3. "This is a remarkable passage: we learn from it how God guides us. The Papists have ever and anon in their mouth, that the Church cannot err. Though the word is neglected, they yet imagine that it is guided by the Spirit. But Peter, on the contrary, intimates that all are immersed in darkness who do not attend to the light of the word."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "And we have a more sure word, namely the prophetic word; or, 'we have something surer still, namely the prophetic word.'"
2. "The comparison thus becomes one between the exceptional testimony of the heavenly voice and the familiar testimony of Israelâ€™s ancient Scriptures."
3. "The prophetic word to which believers are to give earnest heed is a lamp which is to go on shining until the Christ of whom it testifies appears."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The Transfiguration scene confirmed the Messianic prophecies and made clear the deity of Jesus Christ as God's Beloved Son."
2. "The word of prophecy is a surer confirmation of Christ's deity than the Transfiguration."
3. "Hold your mind upon the prophetic word made more sure, as unto a lamp shining in a dark place, until the day dawn and the day-star arise."

### John Gill:
1. "We have also a more sure word of prophecy... the apostle would never put the sacred writings in comparison with them."
2. "The Gospel that came by Christ, and is preached by his apostles, and is contained in the writings of the New Testament, is a much clearer light, and at least equally to be attended to."
3. "The prophecy concerning Christ's second coming is a surer evidence... since he said it, to whom all things were known from the beginning, and whose counsel shall stand, and not one word of his shall ever fail."

### John Wesley:
1. "The words of Moses, Isaiah, and all the prophets, are one and the same word, every way consistent with itself."
2. "Such anciently was the whole world, except that little spot where this lamp shone."
3. "As is the difference between the light of a lamp and that of the day, such is that between the light of the Old Testament and of the New."
