# 2 Peter 2:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
If someone outwardly reforms and escapes the corruptions of the world, but then becomes entangled in them again, their last state is worse than the first. This relapse into the pollutions of the world is worse because it is no longer excused by ignorance. Apostates who go back to their former vices become more abandoned than ever. It is better not to have known the way of righteousness than to knowingly and willfully despise the commands of the Lord. By renouncing the world, we can escape its filth and pollution.
