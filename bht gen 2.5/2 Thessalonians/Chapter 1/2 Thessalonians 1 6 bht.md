### Albert Barnes:
1. "There will be a future judgment, because it is proper that God should punish those who now persecute you."

"If it is right to punish wickedness here, it is not wrong to punish it in the future world...In like manner, many a man lives a life of profligacy; or is an open scoffer; or aims to cast off the government of God; or is a seducer of innocence; and yet lives in the midst of wealth, and goes down in calmness and peace to the grave; Psalms 73:3-5; Job 21:23-33. Why is it not just that such an one should be punished in the future world? compare Psalms 73:16-20."

3. "He designed to show more clearly how unjust and confused the government of the world would be, if God did not defer punishments and rewards till another judgment, for in this way the name of God were a thing that was dead."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "A righteous thing 'with God' means by the side of God (œÄŒ±œÅŒ± Œ∏Œµœâ) and so from God's standpoint. This is as near to the idea of absolute right as it is possible to attain." 
2. "To recompense affliction to them that afflict you (Œ±ŒΩœÑŒ±œÄŒøŒ¥ŒøœÖŒΩŒ± œÑŒøŒπœÇ Œ∏ŒªŒπŒ≤ŒøœÖœÉŒπŒΩ Œ∑ŒºŒ±œÇ Œ∏ŒªŒπœàŒπŒΩ). Second aorist active infinitive of double compound Œ±ŒΩœÑ-Œ±œÄŒøŒ¥ŒπŒ¥œâŒº, old verb, either in good sense as in 1 Thessalonians 3:9 or in bad sense as here."

2. "And it is remarkable that about this time, at the passover, the Jews raising a tumult, a great number (some say thirty thousand) of them were slain."
3. "St. Paul seems to allude to this beginning of sorrows, 1 Thessalonians 2:16, which did not end but with their destruction."
