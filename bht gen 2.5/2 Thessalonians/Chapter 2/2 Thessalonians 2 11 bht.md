# 2 Thessalonians 2:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
God, in His righteous judgment, sends a strong delusion to those who have rejected the truth and have chosen to believe falsehoods. This is not a mere passive state, but an active power of misleading. It is a consequence of their deliberate rejection of the truth and their preference for sin over holiness. God allows them to be blinded and gives them up to the delusions of Satan. This serves as a punishment for their rejection of the Gospel and their refusal to love the truth.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "πέμπει must not for a moment be understood of permissiveness only on God’s part He is the judicial sender and doer it is He who hardens the heart which has chosen the evil way."
2. "The E.V. has weakened, indeed almost stultified the sentence, by rendering ἐνέργ . πλάνης ‘a strong delusion,’ i.e. the passive state resulting, instead of the active cause."
3. "In order that they should believe the falsehood (which the mystery of sin is working among them. It is better here to take τῷ definite, referring to what has gone before, than abstract), that (the higher or ultimate purpose of God) all might be judged (i.e. here ‘condemned,’ by the context) who did not (looking back over their time of probation) believe the truth, but found pleasure in iniquity."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The best safeguard against error is 'the love of the truth.'" 
2. "God judicially sends hardness of heart on those who have rejected the truth, and gives them up in righteous judgment to Satan's delusions."
3. "They first cast off the love of the truth, then God gives them up to Satan's delusions, then they settle down into 'believing the lie': an awful climax."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "If a man strongly prefers error to truth, and sin to holiness, it is not wrong to allow him freely to evince his own preference."
2. "God often places people in circumstances to develop their own nature, and it cannot be shown to be wrong that He should do so."
3. "God does not interpose by direct power to preserve them. Can anyone doubt this? Yet this is not especially the doctrine of revelation."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Strong delusion... means an active power of misleading." 
2. "The lie... gives the generic sense, falsehood in all its forms." 
3. "All wrongdoing has an element of falsity."

### John Calvin:
1. "Errors will not merely have a place, but the wicked will be blinded, so that they will rush forward to ruin without consideration."
2. "Assuredly we have a notable specimen of this in the Papacy. No words can express how monstrous a sink of errors there is there, how gross and shameful an absurdity of superstitions there is, and what delusions at variance with common sense."
3. "None that have even a moderate taste of sound doctrine can think of such monstrous things without the greatest horror."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Here is the definite judicial act of God who gives the wicked over to the evil which they have deliberately chosen."
2. "A working of error. Terrible result of wilful rejection of the truth of God."
3. "That they should believe a lie. A contemplated result of changing the truth of God into the lie."

### John Gill:
1. "God may be said to send; because it is not a bare permission but a voluntary one; or it is his will that error should be that truth may be tried."
2. "The efficacy of error is not to be considered as a sin, of which God cannot be the author, but as a punishment for sin."
3. "Without this it is not to be accounted for, that the followers of antichrist should give into such senseless notions... a spirit of slumber is given them, and eyes that they should not see, and ears that they should not hear, because of their rejection of the Gospel."

### John Wesley:
1. Therefore God shall send them — That is, judicially permit to come upon them, strong delusion.
