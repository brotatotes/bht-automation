# 2 Timothy 1:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
God has not given us a spirit of cowardice, but rather a spirit of power, love, and correction. This power enables us to overcome obstacles and face dangers, while love drives out fear and compels us to speak the truth boldly yet lovingly. Additionally, this spirit of power and love produces a sound mind, characterized by prudence and discretion. It is the nature of the gospel to inspire courage, cast out fear, and bring about a balanced and well-disciplined mind. As servants of Christ, we are fortified against opposition and strengthened to resist temptation, all for the glory of God and the good of souls.
