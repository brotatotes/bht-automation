# 2 Timothy 2:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Some individuals in the early church distorted Paul's teachings on the resurrection, claiming that it had already occurred in a spiritual sense. This false belief undermined the foundation of faith and denied the true meaning of the resurrection. They equated the resurrection with conversion or baptism, rather than acknowledging the bodily resurrection of believers. This erroneous teaching threatened the faith of some, but true believers could not be swayed by such deception. It is important to have a correct understanding of the resurrection and guard against false interpretations that can rob us of our hope in the future bodily resurrection.
