# 2 Timothy 2:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Those who belong to the Lord will depart from iniquity. The church is compared to a great house, where there are vessels of different materials and purposes. The presence of both righteous and sinful individuals in the church is not surprising, as the church embraces a variety of characters. This diversity is necessary and even ornamental, as each vessel has its proper use and honor in the church.
