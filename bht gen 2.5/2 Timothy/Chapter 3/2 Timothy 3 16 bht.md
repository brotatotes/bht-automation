# 2 Timothy 3:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
All Scripture is divinely inspired and therefore useful. It is inspired by God in such a way that everything in it, from its narratives to its phrases and words, is exactly as He intended. The purpose of Scripture is to perfect and equip the man of God for every good work. It is profitable for teaching, conviction, restoration, and discipline. The Scriptures are a powerful means of reformation and are the complete and sufficient rule in all things touching perfection. They are the breath of God, written by the Spirit, and continually inspire those who read them with earnest prayer.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Every Scripture (not ‘every writing:’ the word, with or without the art., never occurs in the N. T. except in the sense of ‘Scripture;’ and we have it, as we might expect in the later apostolic times, anarthrous in 2 Peter 1:20, πᾶσα προφητεία γραφῆς."
2. "θεόπνευστος ‘divinitus inspirata,’ Vulg., is an expression and idea connected with πνεῦμα (properly breath), the power of the divine Spirit being conceived of as a breath of life: the word thus amounts to 'inspired,' 'breathed through,' 'full of the Spirit.'"
3. "that the man of God may be perfect (ready at every point: ‘aptus in officio,’ Beng.), thoroughly made ready to every good work (rather to be generally understood than officially: the man of God is not only a teacher, but any spiritual man: and the whole of the present passage regards the universal spiritual life)."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "All Scripture is God-inspired and therefore useful"; because we see no utility in any words or portion of it, it does not follow it is not God-inspired. It is useful, because God-inspired; not God-inspired, because useful.
2. Verbal inspiration does not mean mechanical dictation, but all "Scripture is (so) inspired by God," that everything in it, its narratives, prophecies, citations, the whole—ideas, phrases, and words—are such as He saw fit to be there.
3. Since Paul is speaking of Scripture in general and in the notion of it, the only general reason why, in order to perfecting the godly, it should extend to every department of revealed truth, must be that it was intended to be the complete and sufficient rule in all things touching perfection.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "All Scripture... [includes] the whole of the Old Testament, and is the solemn testimony of Paul that it was all inspired."
2. "The word... Θεόπνευστος Theopneustos... properly means, God-inspired... the life was in the breath... as much to be traced to [God] as life is."
3. "The Scriptures are a powerful means of reformation, or of putting men into the proper condition in regard to morals... No reformation can be permanent which is not based on the principles of the word of God."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Every divinely-inspired Scripture is, besides being so inspired and for that reason, also profitable."
2. "Reproof: conviction. Correction: restoring to an upright state. Instruction: chastisement or discipline."
3. "Specially of God's chastisement by means of sorrow and evil."

### John Calvin:
1. "Our religion...that we know that God hath spoken to us, and are fully convinced that the prophets did not speak at their own suggestion, but that, being organs of the Holy Spirit, they only uttered what they had been commissioned from heaven to declare."
2. "Whoever then wishes to profit in the Scriptures, let him first of all, lay down this as a settled point, that the Law and the Prophets are not a doctrine delivered according to the will and pleasure of men, but dictated by the Holy Spirit."
3. "We need not wonder if there are many who doubt as to the Author of the Scripture; for, although the majesty of God is displayed in it, yet none but those who have been enlightened by the Holy Spirit have eyes to perceive what ought, indeed, to have been visible to all, and yet is visible to the elect alone."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "All Scripture is given by inspiration of God."
2. "Every Scripture, so far as it is inspired, works for the completeness of 'the man of God,' of the minister of Christ, and of his work."
3. "It is of small use acknowledging the inspiration of Scripture as a dogma, unless you use it for its appointed work."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Every scripture inspired of God is also profitable." 
2. "Inspired of God (θεοπνευστος). 'God-breathed.'"
3. "Profitable (ωφελιμος). See 1 Timothy 4:8. See Romans 15:4."

### John Gill:
1. "The Scriptures are the breath of God, the word of God and not men; they are 'written by the Spirit'"


### John Wesley:
1. "All scripture is inspired of God." 
2. "The Spirit of God not only once inspired those who wrote it, but continually inspires, supernaturally assists, those that read it with earnest prayer."
3. "Hence it is so profitable for doctrine, for instruction of the ignorant, for the reproof or conviction of them that are in error or sin, for the correction or amendment of whatever is amiss, and for instructing or training up the children of God in all righteousness."
