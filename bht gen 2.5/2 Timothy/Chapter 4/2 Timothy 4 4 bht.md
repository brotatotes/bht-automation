# 2 Timothy 4:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When people turn away from the truth, they will turn aside to fables and myths. This is a righteous retribution for rejecting the truth. The people themselves will choose to turn away, preferring these fables over the truth. The fables they turn to will be idle, trifling, and unprofitable, akin to old wives' tales. It is a consequence of their rejection of the truth that they are given over to a mind void of sense and judgment, attending to these idle and fabulous things.
