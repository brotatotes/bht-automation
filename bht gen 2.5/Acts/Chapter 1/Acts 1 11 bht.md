## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "There is a propriety in the address, ·ºÑŒΩŒ¥œÅ . ŒìŒ±ŒªŒπŒªŒ±·øñŒøŒπ . It served to remind them of their origin, their call to be His disciples, and the duty of obedience to Him resting on them in consequence."
2. "His corporeal identity is implied in Œø·ΩóœÑŒøœÇ ·ΩÅ ·º∏Œ∑œÉŒø·ø¶œÇ."
3. "‚ÄòNon ii, qui ascendentem viderunt, dicuntur venturum visuri . Inter ascensionem et inter adventum gloriosum nullus interponitur eventus eorum utrique par: ideo hi duo conjunguntur. Merito igitur Apostoli ante datam Apocalypsin diem Christi ut valde propinquum proposuerunt. Et congruit majestati Christi, ut toto inter ascensionem et inter adventum tempore sine intermissione expectetur.‚Äô Bengel."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "as if your now glorified Head were gone from you never to return: He is coming again not another, but 'this same Jesus'; and 'as ye have seen Him go, in the like manner shall He come'‚Äîas personally, as visibly, as gloriously" 
2. "let the joyful expectation of this coming swallow up the sorrow of that departure."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "There might have been an impropriety in their earnest desire for the mere bodily presence of the Lord Jesus, when it was more important that he should be in heaven."
2. "This was said to comfort them. The same tried friend who had been so faithful to them would return."
3. "It is proper that he should come to vindicate his people, and raise them up to glory. Here they have been persecuted, oppressed, put to death. Their character is assailed; they are poor; and the world despises them. It is fit that God should show himself to be their friend; that he should do justice to their injured names and motives; that he should bring out hidden and obscure virtue, and vindicate it; that he should enter every grave and bring forth his friends to life."

### John Calvin:
1. "Let us first learn out of this place that we must not seek Christ either in heaven, either upon earth, otherwise than by faith; and also, that we must not desire to have him present with us bodily in the world; for he that doth either of those two shall oftentimes go farther from him."
2. "But we are not here to dispute of his form; only the apostles are taught that Christ must abide in heaven until such time as he appear at the latter day. For the desiring of his corporeal presence is here condemned as absurd and perverse."
3. "Therefore, according to their commandment, let us not go about to pull him out of the heavens with our own inventions; neither let us think that we call handle him with our hands, or perceive him with our other senses, more than we can see him with our eyes."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Why stand ye gazing up into heaven? The angels, while comforting them with the solemn assurance He would return to earth again, still gently reprove these loving followers of Jesus, who remained gazing upwards, not without a hope He might reappear."
2. "Their duty now was not quiet contemplation and still waiting, but real earnest work."
3. "It is a reproof which belongs to all ages of the Christian Church."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Who also...to narrate two parallel events."
2. "Jesus had told them...should have been prepared."
3. "The personal name assures them...divine Saviour."

### John Gill:
1. "Reproving them for their curiosity in looking after Christ with their bodily eyes, who was no more in common to be seen this way, but with an eye of faith."
2. "They were not to remain on that spot, or stand gazing there; they were to go to Jerusalem, and abide there, as Christ had ordered, till they should receive the Holy Spirit in an extraordinary way."
3. "He shall come in the same flesh, in the same human nature; he shall come in the clouds of heaven, and shall be attended with his mighty angels, as he now was."
