### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: After the Ascension and before Pentecost, the number of disciples had increased, possibly due to the gathering of those who had previously been disciples. The use of Ï„Îµ in Acts is significant in determining the reading, even when Î´Î­ seems more appropriate. It is likely that the disciples were not in Jerusalem at this time, as many of the five hundred brethren who saw the risen Lord remained in Galilee. The nature of their future work began to become clearer to them. The phrase the number of the names refers to the number of individuals gathered together, which was about 120. This gathering in the upper room had no special significance in the number 120. Peter took the lead in the election of a new apostle, which was characteristic of him. The election of a minister and pastor should be by the church, and the selection of Matthias to fill the office of an apostle was a case where it was right and proper for one to be chosen by the ministry only. The few days between the Ascension and Pentecost are referred to as those days. Peter, due to his personal friendship with Jesus, held a prominent position in the early Church. The gathering of 500 brethren who saw the risen Lord took place in Galilee prior to this occasion. It was necessary for Matthias to be chosen to replace Judas so that the appointment made by Christ would not be made void by the treachery of one man. The order of the apostles remained intact despite Judas's demise. The mention of the number of disciples gathered together indicates that they were all present when Peter delivered his sermon. They were united in both place and mind, and they formed a church state where they devoted themselves to the Lord and to one another. The number of individuals gathered together in the upper room was about 120, but there were undoubtedly more disciples in other places, as over 500 saw the risen Lord at once.
