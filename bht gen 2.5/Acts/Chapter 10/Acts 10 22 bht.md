### John Calvin:
1. "Cornelius‚Äô servants commend their master not ambitiously, or to the end they may flatter him, but that Peter may the less abhor his company."
2. "Cornelius could not have the Jews, who retained the worship of the true God alone, to be witnesses of his godliness, unless he had professed that he worshipped the God of Abraham with them."
3. "Although they lean most of all to this argument, that they may persuade him that which they go about, that all this matter is governed by the commandment of God, as if they should say, That he is not so much called by a mortal man as by God, who had so commanded by his angel."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Besides being one who ‚Äòfeared God,‚Äô Cornelius was a ‚Äòjust‚Äô man, a man of rectitude; and he was beloved, trusted, and respected, not merely by the Gentiles, but by ‚Äòthe Jews,‚Äô and not only by some partial members of the Jewish community whom he had served, but by ‚Äòall the Jews.‚Äô"
2. "Warned from God. The words ‚Äòfrom God‚Äô do not strictly and literally appear in the original: but their sense is implied in the verb, which is the same that Heathens would employ for the communication of a Divine oracle."
3. "The ‚Äòword of hearing‚Äô was the instrumentality used for the saving of his soul, and for the instruction of the world through his conversion."

Then to be called or receive a name from one's business as in Acts 11:26; Romans 7:3."

### John Gill:
1. "A just man; before God, and in his sight, through the imputation of Christ's righteousness to him; and who was a new man, created in righteousness and true holiness."
2. "and worshipped him, both internally and externally; for both sorts of worship are included in the fear of God."
3. "they intimate hereby, that he did not send for him of himself, he was not led to it by any fancy of his own, or any curiosity in him; nor should he have presumed to have used such freedom with Peter, but that he had some instructions from God himself."
