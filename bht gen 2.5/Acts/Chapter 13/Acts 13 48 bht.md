## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The key to the word here is the comparison of ref. 1 Cor. εἰς διακονίαν τοῖς ἁγίοις ἔταξαν ἑαυτούς, with ref. Rom. αἱ οὖσαι (ἐξουσίαι) ὑπὸ τοῦ θεοῦ τεταγμέναι εἰσίν: in both of which places the agents are expressed, whereas here the word is absolute." 
2. "It may be worth while to protest against all attempts to join ἐπίστευσαν with εἰς ζωὴν αἰώνιον, which usage will not bear."
3. "Wordsworth well observes that it would be interesting to enquire what influence such renderings as this of præordinati in the Vulgate version had on the minds of men like St. Augustine and his followers in the Western Church in treating the great questions of free will, election, reprobation, and final perseverance."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Glad to perceive that their accession to Christ was a matter of divine arrangement as well as apostolic effort."
2. "Glorified the word of the Lord by a cordial reception of it."
3. "A divine ordination to eternal life is the cause, not the effect, of any man's believing."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The Gentiles rejoiced that from the mouths of Jews themselves they now heard a different doctrine."
2. "They honored it as a message from God; they recognized and received it as the Word of God."
3. "It was, in fact, that doctrine expressed in an act. It was nothing but God’s disposing them to embrace eternal life."

### John Calvin:
1. "We do then honor the word of God as we ought, when we submit ourselves obediently to it by faith; as it cannot be more grievously blasphemed than when men refuse to believe it."
2. "And here we must note the restraint, [reservation,] when he saith that they believed, (but) not all in general, but those who were ordained unto life."
3. "Therefore, let us hold and mark that which Luke saith, that those were ordained before unto life, who, being in-grafted into the body of Christ by faith, do receive the earnest and pledge of their adoption in Christ."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "These Heathens openly expressed their joy and gratitude when they found from Paul that even in the sacred and jealously guarded oracles of the Hebrew race, they too, who had no connection with the Land of Promise, and who could claim no kinship to the chosen people, were all included in the grand scheme of salvation by Messiah."
2. "Preserving then rigidly the rendering of the English Version, we have to determine what meaning should be attached to the words ‘ordained to eternal life.’ Those ‘ordained’ are they of whom Holy Scripture so often speaks as ‘The Chosen,’ ‘The Called of God’ all spiritual life, be it remembered, in its origin, progress, and completion, being from Him and His eternal counsel alone."
3. "Dean Alford’s words in a very able note on Romans 8:28 are golden: ‘God’s sovereignty (which includes His elective and predestinating decrees) on the one side, man’s free-will on the other, are plainly declared to us. All attempts to bridge over the gulf between the two in the present imperfect condition of man are futile. . . . Our duty and our wisdom is to receive, believe, and to act on both these Divine statements.’"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The joy of the Gentiles increased the fury of the Jews."
2. "It was the gospel of grace and liberty from legalism that Paul had proclaimed."
3. "The Spirit of God does move upon the human heart to which some respond, as here, while others push him away."

### John Gill:
1. "They were glad; not that the Jews were likely to have the Gospel taken away from them, but that it was to be preached to them."
2. "They spake well of the Gospel and gave glory to God."
3. "Faith is not the cause, or condition of the decree of eternal life, but a means fixed in it, and is a fruit and effect of it."

### John Wesley:
1. "As many as were ordained to eternal life — St. Luke does not say fore-ordained. He is not speaking of what was done from eternity, but of what was then done, through the preaching of the Gospel."
2. "During this sermon those believed, says the apostle, to whom God then gave power to believe."
3. "The sum is, all those and those only, who were now ordained, now believed."
