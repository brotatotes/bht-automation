# Acts 13:50 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Prominent women in Antioch, both for and against Christianity, played a significant role in the events. These women, who were either Jewish proselytes or inclined towards Judaism, had a strong religious influence. The expulsion of Paul and Barnabas from Antioch was likely due to the influence of Jewish ecclesiastics and the chief men of the city. The devout and honorable women, who were likely connected to the magistrates, played a part in opposing the spread of the gospel. The persecution faced by the apostles was tumultuous, leading them to retreat for the sake of peace.
