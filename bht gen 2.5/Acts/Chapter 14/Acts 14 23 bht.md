# Acts 14:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
After the disciples had chosen elders, Paul and Barnabas appointed them to take charge of the churches. The word ordain in this context does not refer to the ecclesiastical sense of setting apart by the imposition of hands, but rather to the act of appointing or selecting. The apostles' role was to guide and conduct the elections of the churches, ensuring that respected elders were chosen. By commending the churches to the Lord, Paul and Barnabas acknowledged that although the elders were feeble and inexperienced, they would be safe in the hands of Jesus.

### Henry Alford:

2. "For if 'ordination' was by prayer and fasting (see Acts 13:3), why should it be said they first 'ordained elders,' and after that 'prayed with fasting?' Whereas if the first clause refer to the choice and the second to the ordination, all is natural."
3. "They committed them, that is, all these churches, to the Lord—Jesus."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The word 'ordain' we now use in an ecclesiastical sense, to denote 'a setting apart to an office by the imposition of hands.' But it is evident that the word here is not employed in that sense."
2. "All that seems to be implied is, that they were to take the charge of the churches during the absence of the apostles."

3. "Commended [παρεθεντο]. See on set before, Luke 9:16; and commit, 1 Peter 4:19."

### John Calvin:
1. "Christ did not only send his apostles to preach the gospel, but he commanded also that there should be pastors appointed, that the preaching of the gospel might be perpetual and in daily use."
2. "They had a double end and reason of their prayer; the first, that God would direct them with the spirit of wisdom and discretion to choose the best and most meet men... the second end of their prayer was, that God would furnish with necessary gifts those pastors which were chosen."
3. "We gather hereby... the only refuge and aid, if the Lord keep them continually whom he hath once received... he assigneth this office to God as proper to him, to save and defend all those who by true faith have embraced his word."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "And when they had appointed for them elders." 
2. "There is some doubt here as to whether the Greek word translated ‘ordained,’ or, more accurately, ‘appointed’ signified that Paul and Barnabas simply conducted and guided the elections of the churches, or whether the two apostles themselves appointed these elders (or presbyters). The latter is the more probable..."
3. "Presbyters or elders chosen by Paul and Barnabas acting under the light of the Divine Spirit, would be more likely to command respect when the apostles were far away, than any elders chosen by popular voice."
