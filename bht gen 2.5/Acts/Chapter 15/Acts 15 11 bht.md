# Acts 15:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Salvation is attained through the grace of Christ alone, without the need for additional conditions or rituals. Both Jewish and Gentile believers are saved in the same manner, solely by the grace of the Lord Jesus. The grace of Christ is the sufficient and only cause of our salvation, and it is not to be fettered with unnecessary requirements. Circumcision and adherence to the law do not contribute to salvation; rather, salvation is obtained through the power of the blood of Jesus. The doctrine of grace is clear and refutes any notion of salvation by ceremony or ritualism.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Seeing that we all in common believe that the grace of Christ is the sufficient, and only cause of our salvation, it can neither be reasonable nor according to God’s will, to fetter that grace with superfluous and vexatious conditions."
2. "κἀκεῖνοι are the Gentile Christians, not our fathers; their ground of trust is the same as ours: ours, no more than theirs."
3. "It can neither be reasonable nor according to God’s will, to fetter that grace with superfluous and vexatious conditions."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Through the grace of the Lord Jesus—that is, by that only."
2. "Circumcision in our case being no advantage, and in their case uncircumcision no loss."
3. "Grace doing all for both, and the same for each."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "We shall be saved, even as they - In the same manner, by the mere grace of Christ." 
2. "So far from being necessary to their salvation, they are really of no use in ours." 
3. "We are to be saved, not by these ceremonies, but by the mere mercy of God in the Redeemer."

### John Calvin:
1. "Let us return unto the contrary member. If we cannot otherwise attain unto salvation by the grace of Christ, unless the yoke of the law be taken away, it followeth that salvation is not placed in keeping the law, neither are those which believe in Christ subject to the curse of the law; for if he could be saved through grace, who is as yet enwrapped in the yoke of the law, then should Peter’s reasoning be but foolish, which is drawn from contraries: thus, We hope for salvation by the grace of Christ; therefore we are not under the yoke of the law."
2. "Whereby is also refuted their surmise, who say that we are justified by the grace of Christ, because he regenerateth us by his Spirit, and giveth us strength to fulfill the law. Those who imagine this, though they seem to ease the yoke of the law a little, yet they keep souls bound with the cords thereof."
3. "Whereby is also refuted the doting of those who think that the old people, inasmuch as they were content with earthly goods, did think no whit of the heavenly life. But Peter maketh the fathers partners with us of the same faith; and doth make salvation common to both."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The believing Jew, who has tried to keep the law and failed, will be saved like the Gentile through the power of the blood of Jesus."
2. "'Their ground of trust is the same as ours, ours as theirs' (Alford; and see Galatians 2:15 and following verses, where this train of thought is more fully carried out by St. Paul)."
3. "The believing Jew, who has tried to keep the law and failed, will be saved like the Gentile through the power of the blood of Jesus."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "We believe that we are saved through the grace of the Lord Jesus in like manner as they also." 
2. "This thoroughly Pauline note shows that whatever hopes the Judaizers had about Peter were false."
3. "His doctrine of grace is as clear as a bell. He has lifted his voice against salvation by ceremony and ritualism."

### John Gill:
1. "Salvation is by Christ; Jehovah the Father appointed him to be his salvation; he sent him, and he came to save sinners; and he has obtained salvation for them; and it is in him, and in no other."
2. "Salvation is by the grace of Christ; it was grace moved him to engage in this work before the world began; it was good will to men that caused him to come down from heaven, and appear on earth in the form of a servant; it was pure love that influenced him to lay down his life for them."
3. "Salvation, in all its parts and branches, is owing to grace; and so it is with respect to all persons that are saved; some are not saved by their works, and others by the grace of Christ, but they are all saved by grace; and none have any room to boast of themselves against others."

### John Wesley:
1. "The Lord Jesus — He does not here say our Lord; because in this solemn place he means the Lord of all."
2. "We - Jews, shall be saved even as they - Gentiles, namely, through the grace of the Lord Jesus, not by our observance of the ceremonial law."
