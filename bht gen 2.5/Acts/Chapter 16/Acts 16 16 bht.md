## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "It may be remarked that the E. V. of œÄŒøœÅŒµœÖŒøŒºŒ≠ŒΩœâŒΩ Œµ·º∞œÇ ( œÑ·Ω¥ŒΩ ) œÄœÅŒøœÉŒµœÖœáŒÆŒΩ, ‚Äòas we went to prayer,‚Äô has given rise to a curious abuse of the expression ‚Äògoing to prayer,‚Äô in the sense of ‚Äòbeginning to pray,‚Äô among the lower classes in England."
2. "All attempt to explain away such a narrative as this by the subterfuges of rationalism [...] is more than ever futile. The fact of the spirit leaving the girl, and the masters finding the hope of their gains gone, is fatal."
3. "It is difficult to decide internally between the probabilities of œÄœçŒ∏œâŒΩŒ± and œÄœçŒ∏œâŒΩŒøœÇ: I have retained the ancient reading, both from its external authority, and because I find so many Commentators explaining œÄœçŒ∏œâŒΩ to be a name of Apollo, or the serpent Python, that the alteration into the gen. may thus be easily accounted for."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "as we went to prayer... not on the same day with what had just occurred."
2. "a female servant, and in this case a slave."
3. "The reality of this demoniacal possession is as undeniable as that of any in the Gospel history."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Possessed with a spirit of divination - Greek: Python. See the margin. Python, or Pythios, was one of the names of Apollo, the Grecian god of the fine arts, of music, poetry, medicine, and eloquence."
2. "The name Python is said to have been given him because, as soon as he was born, he destroyed with arrows a serpent of that name, that had been sent by Juno to persecute Latona; hence, his common name was the Pythian Apollo."
3. "It is plain that Paul regarded this as a case of demoniacal possession, and treated it accordingly."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Pythian - spirit, presenting phenomena identical with the convulsive movements and wild cries of the Pythian priestess at Delphi."
2. "The heathen inhabitants of Philippi regarded the woman as inspired by Apollo."
3. "And as the word she spake Within the door, all suddenly her visage and her hue Were changed, and all her sleeked hair and gasping breath she drew, And with the rage her wild heart swelled, and greater was she grown, Nor mortal-voiced; for breath of God upon her heart was blown."

### John Calvin:
1. "The devil is the father of lying in such sort, that he covereth himself under the ale and deceivable color of truth."
2. "Seeing that Satan hath a double way to resist the gospel, to wit, because he doth sometimes rage openly, and sometimes he creepeth in craftily under lies, he hath also two kinds of lying and deceiving."
3. "Satan hath never so much liberty granted him of God, save only that the unthankful world may be punished, which is so desirous of a lie, that it had rather be deceived than obey the truth."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "To be possessed by the spirit of Pythoness was, in other words, to be possessed by a prophetic spirit or demon." 
2. "Paul...recognised that she was one of those many unhappy beings who, in the first days of Christianity, were afflicted with grievous soul maladies."
3. "On the difficult question of what these demoniacs mentioned in the various books of the New Testament were...see the weighty remarks of Archbishop Trench."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Certainly Luke does not mean to credit Apollo with a real existence (1 Corinthians 8:4)."
2. "Joint owners of this poor slave girl who were exploiting her calamity, whatever it was, for selfish gain."
3. "As a fortune-teller she was a valuable asset for all the credulous dupes of the community."

### John Gill:
1. "The spirit in her pretended to divine and foretell things to come."
2. "It was a real spirit that possessed her."
3. "Great quantities were got by particular persons, who pretended to such a spirit, by which they told fortunes, and what should befall people hereafter."
