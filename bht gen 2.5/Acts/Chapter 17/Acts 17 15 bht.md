# Acts 17:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
After departing from Berea, Paul sent Timothy to exhort and confirm the Thessalonians while he remained in Athens alone. Athens was a renowned city known for its military talents, learning, eloquence, and politeness. However, it had lost its vitality and energy. The city was filled with statues of deified heroes and temples. Despite its reputation for philosophy and learning, Athens rejected and despised the gospel that Paul preached. Paul waited for Timothy and Silas to join him in Athens, and when it became clear that little fruit would be reaped there, he sent Timothy back to Thessalonica.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Who these were is not said."
2. "The course of Timotheus appears to have been, as far as we can follow it from the slight notices given, as follows: when Paul departed from Berœa, not having been able to revisit Thessalonica as he wished (1 Th 2:18), he sent Timotheus (from Berœa, not from Athens) to exhort and confirm the Thessalonians, and determined to be left at Athens alone (1 Th 3:1), Silas meanwhile remaining to carry on the work at Berœa."
3. "It was a free city. Strabo (ix. 1) gives an epitome of its fortunes from the Roman conquest nearly to this time: Ῥωμαῖοι δʼ οὖν παραλαβόντες αὐτοὺς δημοκρατουμένους ἐφύλαξαν τὴν αὐτονομίαν αὐτοῖς κ.τὴν ἐλευθερίαν."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "He probably wished their company and aid in addressing himself to so new and great a sphere as Athens." 
2. "He waited for them there, as if unwilling to do anything till they came." 
3. "When it appeared that little fruit was to be reaped there, while Thessalonica was in too interesting a state to be left uncherished, he seems to have thought it better to send him back again."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Athens was the most celebrated city of Greece, and was distinguished for the military talents, the learning, the eloquence, and the politeness of its inhabitants."
2. "No city of Greece, or of the ancient world, was so much distinguished for philosophy, learning, and the arts."
3. "In the revolutions of ages it has been ordered that people should bear the torch of learning to Athens from a land unknown to its ancient philosophers, and convey the blessings of civilization to them by that gospel which in the time of Paul they rejected and despised."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "There was no life or energy left among her people."
2. "In this quiet still city of memories, wherever he turned he beheld statues of deified heroes, and temples, and sanctuaries of gods."
3. "The great schools which, after she had lost her power in some way, maintained her reputation in the days of Augustus and his immediate successors were rivalled, if not surpassed, by those of Marseilles, Rhodes, and Rome, and other centres of learning and thought."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "But they that conducted Paul...to Athens. To make sure of his safe arrival."
2. "That they should come to him with all speed. ως ταχιστα as quickly as possible."
3. "Departed. Imperfect active of εξειμ, old Greek word, but rare in N.T."

### John Gill:
1. "Athens, a city in Achaia, dedicated to the studies of philosophy, which though but one, is always used to be called in the plural number; its haven, called the Piraeum, is described as fortified with seven walls."
2. "The city itself stood about two miles from the sea; it had its name either from the Greek word ηθονοη, which signifies the mind of God, as boasting of its divine knowledge; or rather from the word אתין, 'Athen', which may be interpreted 'strangers', it being originally inhabited by the Pelasgi, who were a set of people that moved from place to place."
3. "And receiving a commandment; or 'a letter from him' as one copy and the Syriac version read; that is, the brethren from Paul:
unto Silas and Timotheus for to come to him with all speed; to Athens, where he now was: they departed; from Paul at Athens, and came back to Berea."
