## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The Œø·ΩñŒΩ (as De W. remarks against Meyer and Schneckenburger) does not necessarily give the consequence of what has been stated in Acts 17:16, but only continues the narration." 
2. "·ºêŒΩ œÑ·øá ·ºÄŒ≥ŒøœÅ·æ∑" - "It was the space before the œÉœÑŒø·Ω∞ œÄŒøŒπŒ∫ŒØŒªŒ∑, where the Stoics held their Œ¥ŒπŒ±ŒªŒ≠ŒæŒµŒπœÇ."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Therefore set he himself to lift up his voice to the idol city, but, as his manner was, he began with the Jews."
2. "After that, in the market‚Äîthe Agora, or place of public concourse."
3. "Daily with them that met with him‚Äîor 'came in his way.'"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "With the devout persons - Those worshipping God after the manner of the Jews."
2. "They were Jewish proselytes, who had renounced idolatry, but who had not been fully admitted to the privileges of the Jews."
3. "In this place the philosophers were not infrequently found engaged in public discussion."

### John Calvin:
1. "After that he went to the Gentiles, who, having tasted of the doctrine of the law, though they were not as yet thoroughly nousled up in [imbued with] true godliness, did, notwithstanding, worship the God of Israel, and being desirous to learn, did not refuse those things which they knew were taken out of Moses and the prophets; and because such aptness to be taught was an entrance unto faith, yea, was a certain beginning of faith, the Spirit vouchsafeth them an honorable title, who being only lightly sprinkled with the first rudiments, drew nearer unto the true God; for they be called religious." 
2. "Let us remember that all the religion of the world may be brought to nought. Those are called worshippers of God spiritually who gave their name to the God of Israel. Religion is attributed to them alone; therefore there remaineth nothing else for the rest but the reproach of atheism, howsoever they toil and moil in superstition."
3. "Of whatsoever pomp the idolaters make boast, if their inward affection be examined, there shall be nothing found there but horrible contempt of God, and it shall appear that it is a mere feigned color wherewith they go about to excuse their idols."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Here Paul, no doubt, on account of the intense feeling stirred up by the sight of all this idolatry, slightly deviated from his usual practice of first exclusively addressing himself to Jews and proselytes."
2. "At Athens he seems on the Sabbath days to have laboured in the synagogue among his own people; his week days he spent in the famous ‚ÄòAgora,‚Äô and in the painted porch or cloister of Zeno the Stoic."
3. "The spot where in Athens the philosophers, rhetoricians, and others were in the habit of meeting for conversation and discussion."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Simultaneously with the synagogue preaching at other hours Paul took his stand like Socrates before him and engaged in conversation with those who happened by."
2. "The listeners to Paul in the agora would be more casual than those who stop for street preaching, a Salvation Army meeting, a harangue from a box in Hyde Park."
3. "It was a slim chance either in synagogue or in agora, but Paul could not remain still with all the reeking idolatry around him."

### John Gill:
1. "and a Jewish synagogue being here, the apostle went into it, according to his usual manner, and began with them, as he was wont to do, preaching the Gospel to the Jews first, and then unto the Gentiles."
2. "with them he disputed, not about idolatry, or the worship of many gods, to which they were not addicted; nor about the one true and living God, whom they knew and professed; but about the Son of God, about the Messiah, contending and proving that Jesus of Nazareth was he"
3. "and in the market daily with them that met him; where there was a concourse of people; and where, after the apostle had been once or twice, the people came purposely to meet with him, and to hear his discourses, and reason with him about points in religion"
