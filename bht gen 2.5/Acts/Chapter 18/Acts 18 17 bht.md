# Acts 18:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Greeks expressed their rage by beating Sosthenes, possibly due to their indignation towards those who disturbed the public peace. Gallio's indifference towards the matter is seen as a result of his contempt for the Jews and his unwillingness to favor their persecution of Paul. Some suggest that Gallio may have allowed the beating to happen as a form of punishment for Sosthenes, who had sought to persecute Paul. Overall, Gallio is portrayed as a clear-headed judge who dismisses the mob and shows courage in not being swayed by Jewish subterfuges.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "From this, certainly the right explanation, has arisen the gloss Œø·º± ·ºùŒªŒªŒ∑ŒΩŒµœÇ."
2. "The other gloss, Œø·º± ·º∏ŒøœÖŒ¥Œ±·øñŒøŒπ, has sprung from the notion that this Sosthenes was the same person with the Sosthenes of 1 Corinthians 1:1, a Christian and a companion of Paul."
3. "The carelessness of Gallio about the matter clearly seems to be a further instance of his contempt for the Jews, and indisposition to favour them or their persecution of Paul."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "It is very improbable that this was the same Sosthenes as the apostle afterwards calls 'his brother'."
2. "And Gallio cared for none of those things‚Äînothing loath, perhaps, to see these turbulent Jews, for whom probably he felt contempt, themselves getting what they hoped to inflict on another."
3. "Religious indifference, under the influence of an easy and amiable temper, reappears from age to age."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The Greeks would feel no small measure of indignation at these disturbers of the public peace, and they took this opportunity to express their rage."
2. "By the testimony of ancient writers he [Gallio] was a most mild and amiable man, arid an upright and just judge. There is not the least evidence that he was indifferent to the religion of his country, or that he was of a thoughtless and skeptical turn of mind."
3. "Perhaps it was not easy to quell the riot; perhaps he was not unwilling that he who had joined in a furious and unprovoked persecution should feel the effect of it in the excited passions of the people."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Cared for none of these things. Not said to indicate his indifference to religion, but simply that he did not choose to interfere in this case.


### John Calvin:
1. "There is no cause why such unjust dealing should trouble us at this day when we see the miserable Church oppugned on every side."
2. "The Romans could have wished that the remembrance of the true God had been buried."
3. "Let our magistrates know that they be far more inexcusable if they wink at injuries and wicked facts, if they bridle not the wantonness of the wicked, if they reach not forth their hand to the oppressed."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The better MSS. simply read, 'Then all took,' etc.; the Greeks was a later interpolation."
2. "The utter indifference of these great Roman officials to all religion is well painted in these few words."
3. "Like Pilate, when One greater than Paul stood before him similarly accused, this Roman seemed to favour the accused, possibly owing to the popular dislike of the Jewish race."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The beating did Sosthenes good for he too finally is a Christian (1 Corinthians 1:1), a co-worker with Paul whom he had sought to persecute."
2. "Gallio looked the other way with a blind eye while Sosthenes got the beating which he richly deserved."
3. "Gallio shows up well in Luke's narrative as a clear headed judge who would not be led astray by Jewish subterfuges and with the courage to dismiss a mob."

### John Gill:
1. "These were not the Greeks or Gentiles that were devout persons, or converted to Christianity, and were on the side of Paul, and fell foul on Sosthenes, as being his chief accuser; for this is not agreeably to the spirit and character of such persons, but the profane and unconverted Greeks."
2. "Gallio cared for none of these things; which might not be owing to any sluggishness in him, but to an ill opinion he had of the Jews, as being a turbulent and uneasy people."
3. "Though it did not become him, as a magistrate, to act such a part, whose business it was to keep the public peace, to quell disorders, to protect men's persons, and property, and prevent abuse and mischief, and to correct and punish for it."

### John Wesley:
1. "Then they all took Sosthenes...and beat him - It seems because he had occasioned them so much trouble to no purpose..."
2. "And it seems to have had a happy effect."
3. "For Sosthenes himself was afterward a Christian, 1 Corinthians 1:1."
