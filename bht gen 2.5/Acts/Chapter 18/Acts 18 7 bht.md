# Acts 18:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
After leaving the synagogue, Paul no longer went to the house of Aquila, a Jew, but to the house of a Gentile proselyte. This change signified his separation from the Jews and his focus on the Gentiles. Paul continued his work in the house of Justus, which was conveniently located near the synagogue. This strategic move caught the attention of the synagogue attendees and led to an increase in conversions. By preaching in the house of a Gentile, Paul demonstrated that true godliness could be found outside of idolatry.
