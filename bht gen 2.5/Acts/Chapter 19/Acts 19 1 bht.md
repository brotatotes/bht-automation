## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "By this name were known the eastern parts of Asia Minor, beyond the river Halys, or in comparison with Ephesus, in the direction of that river."
2. "These seem to have been in the same situation as Apollos. They cannot have been mere disciples of John, on account of 'believing on the Lord Jesus.'"
3. "They had received only John's baptism, and had had no proof of the descent of the Holy Spirit, nor knowledge of His gifts."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

3. "There they were, a small and distinct community about twelve in number, still preparing, after the manner of the Baptist, for the coming of the Lord."

### John Calvin:
1. "Luke showeth here that the Church of Ephesus was not only confirmed and increased by Paul‚Äôs return, but also that there was a miracle wrought there, because the visible graces of the Spirit were given to certain rude and new disciples."
2. "Furthermore, it is not known whether they were inhabitants of the city or strangers; neither doth it greatly skill."

2. "Ephesus was one of the great commercial cities of the world, singularly adapted both for inland and maritime commerce."
3. "It is clear that in a sense these disciples of John the Baptist were Christians, for St. Paul‚Äôs question to them respecting the Holy Ghost relates to the period since they believed."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The word for 'upper' (Œ±ŒΩœâœÑŒµœÅŒπŒ∫Œ±) is a late form for Œ±ŒΩœâœÑŒµœÅŒ±... It refers to the highlands and means that Paul did not travel the usual Roman road west by Colossae and Laodicea in the Lycus Valley, cities that he did not visit... Instead he took the more direct road through the Cayster Valley to Ephesus."
2. "The province of Asia included the western part of Asia Minor. The Romans took this country B.C. 130. Finally the name was extended to the whole continent. It was a jewel in the Roman empire along with Africa and was a senatorial province."
