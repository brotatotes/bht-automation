## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Probably the school of Tyrannus was a private synagogue...where he might assemble the believing Jews quietly, and also invite the attendance of Gentiles to hear the word."
2. "But it is also possible that, as commonly supposed, Tyrannus may have been a Gentile sophist."
3. "The name occurs as a proper name...and with Ï„Î¹Î½Î¿Ï‚ (see var. readd.)."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "implying that others, probably a large number, believed."
2. "withdrawing to a separate place of meeting, for the sake both of the converts already made, and the unsophisticated multitude."
3. "probably a converted teacher of rhetoric or philosophy."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The word 'harden,' as applied to the heart, is often used to denote 'insensibility, and opposition to the gospel." 
2. "Separated the disciples - Removed them from the influence and society of those who were seeking to draw them away from the faith."
3. "In the school of one Tyrannus - Who this Tyrannus was is not known. It is probable that he was a Jew, who was engaged in this employment, and who might not be unfavorably disposed toward Christians."

### John Calvin:
1. "For whereas others raising tumults did drive him away, he was requested by these to tarry longer. Now, after that he had endeavored, by the space of three months, to erect the kingdom of God among them, the ungodliness and stubbornness of many doth show itself."
2. "And this do they to no other end, save only because they be desirous (if it can be) to have all men partners in their impiety."
3. "For we see how few come daily, who are ready and apt to hear. And though he had a particular care for the household flock which he had gathered as into a sheepfold, yet he doth not suffer strangers to be destitute of his industry; but continuing the course of his disputation, he trieth whether he can find any which are apt to be taught."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "It was the old story which in Paulâ€™s weary life-work had so often been enacted and re-enacted...His own countrymen, either spurred on by advices from Jerusalem and the Holy Land, or themselves jealous and disturbed at the thought of the hated Gentile sharing in their loved hopes, set themselves to mar and spoil his labours."
2. "Paul at once leaves the Jewish centre where he had been working, and separating his own disciples, Jew as well as Gentile, from the hostile Jews, he began daily to teach in the private synagogues, for this is most probably what the â€˜school of Tyrannusâ€™ was."
3. "Professor Plumptre states the name â€˜Tyrannusâ€™ was not an uncommon one among slaves and freedmen, and suggests that he was a physician, and not improbably a friend of Luke."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "But when some were hardened... The inevitable reaction against Paul went on even in Ephesus though slowly." 
2. "Disobedient... showing the growing disbelief and disobedience... first refusal to believe and then refusal to obey." 
3. "Separated the disciples... Paul now made a separate church as he had done at Thessalonica and Corinth."

### John Gill:
1. "For the Gospel, while it is the savour of life unto life to some, it is the savour of death unto death, to others; as the sun melts the wax, and hardens the clay."
2. "A separation from such who contradict and blaspheme the truths and ordinances of the Gospel, is justifiable."
3. "He taught daily before the court and the governors."


### John Wesley:
1. "The way â€” The Christian way of worshipping God."
2. "He departed â€” Leaving them their synagogue to themselves."
3. "Discoursing daily â€” Not on the Sabbath only, in the school of one Tyrannus - Which we do not find was any otherwise consecrated, than by preaching the Gospel there."
