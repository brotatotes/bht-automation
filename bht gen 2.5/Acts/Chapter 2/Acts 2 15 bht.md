# Acts 2:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The disciples were accused of being drunk, but it was highly improbable for them to be intoxicated at the first hour of prayer in the morning. The third hour, or nine in the morning, was the time of morning prayer, and it was unusual for Jews to eat or drink until this hour had passed. The disciples' response that they were not drunk was a quick and complete answer to the suspicion. It was not the time for drunkenness, especially since it was a high festival day and not the custom to touch food or drink until later.
