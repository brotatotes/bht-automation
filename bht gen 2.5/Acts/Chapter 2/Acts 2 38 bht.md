Repentance is emphasized as a change of mind and heart towards Jesus, not external rituals or penance. Baptism is seen as a visible seal of the remission of sins and a public declaration of faith in Jesus. The gift of the Holy Spirit is promised to those who repent and are baptized.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "[Î¼ÎµÏ„Î±Î½Î¿Î®ÏƒÎ±Ï„Îµ,] The word imports change of mind; here, change from thinking Jesus an impostor, and scorning Him as one crucified, to being baptized in His name, and looking to Him for remission of sins, and the gift of the Spirit."
2. "The miserable absurdity of rendering Î¼ÎµÏ„Î±Î½., or 'pÅ“nitentiam agite,' by 'do penance,' or understanding it as referring to a course of external rites, is well exposed by this passage in which the internal change of heart and purpose is insisted on, to be testified by admission into the number of Christâ€™s followers."
3. "The result of the baptism to which he here exhorts them, preceded by repentance and accompanied by faith in the forgiveness of sins in Christ, would be, the receiving the gift of the Holy Spirit."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Repent - The word denotes change of mind, and here includes the reception of the Gospel as the proper issue of that revolution of mind."
2. "Baptized... for the remission of sins - as the visible seal of that remission."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "True repentance is the only thing in such a state of mind that can give any relief. An ingenuous confession of sin, a solemn purpose to forsake it, and a true hatred of it, is the only thing that can give the mind composure."
2. "We are to direct [a convicted sinner] to repent; to mourn over his sins, and to forsake them. Religion demands that he should at once surrender himself to God by genuine repentance; by confession that God is right and that he is wrong; and by a firm purpose to live a life of holiness."
3. "'The fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace,' etc."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Repent. See on Matthew 3:2. 
In the name [ÎµÏ€Î¹ Ï„Ï‰ Î¿Î½Î¿Î¼Î±Ï„Î¹] . Lit., upon the name. See on Matthew 28:19. 
Remission. See on Luke 3:3; James 5:15.


### John Calvin:
1. "Hereby we see that those do never go away empty which ask at the mouth of the Lord, and do offer themselves unto him to be ruled and taught; for that promise must needs be true, Knock, and it shall be opened unto you."
2. "We must, therefore, know thus much, that Peter did at the first exhort the Jews unto repentance; and that done, he lifted them up with hope of pardon; for he promised them forgiveness of sins, which two things are the two parts of the gospel."
3. "Let us know, therefore, that forgiveness of sins is grounded in Christ alone, and that we must not think upon any other satisfaction save only that which he hath performed by the sacrifice of his death."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Be baptized. The rite of baptism was well known to the Jews: they used to baptize proselytes and their children."
2. "Their belief in Jesus was the ground on which they were to be baptized."
3. "It has been suggested that the usual formula has been avoided here for the sake of euphony."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Change your mind and your life. Turn right about and do it now."
2. "The first thing to do is make a radical and complete change of heart and life."
3. "My view is decidedly against the idea that Peter, Paul, or any one in the New Testament taught baptism as essential to the remission of sins or the means of securing such remission."

### John Gill:
1. "Change your minds, entertain other thoughts, and a different opinion of Jesus of Nazareth, than you have done; consider him, and believe in him, as the true Messiah and Saviour of the world; look upon him, not any more as an impostor, and a blasphemer, but as sent of God, and the only Redeemer of Israel." 
2. "A change of mind will produce a change of actions in life and conversation."
3. "The end for which this was to be submitted to, is, for the remission of sins; not that forgiveness of sin could be procured either by repentance, or by baptism; for this is only obtained by the blood of Christ; but the apostle advises these awakened, sensible, repenting, and believing souls, to submit to baptism, that by it their faith might be led to Christ."

### John Wesley:
1. "Repent - And hereby return to God: be baptized - Believing in the name of Jesus - And ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost - See the three-one God clearly proved." 
2. "The gift of the Holy Ghost does not mean in this place the power of speaking with tongues. For the promise of this was not given to all that were afar off, in distant ages and nations. But rather the constant fruits of faith, even righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost."
3. "Whomsoever the Lord our God shall call - (Whether they are Jews or Gentiles) by his word and by his Spirit: and who are not disobedient to the heavenly calling. But it is observable St. Peter did not yet understand the very words he spoke."
