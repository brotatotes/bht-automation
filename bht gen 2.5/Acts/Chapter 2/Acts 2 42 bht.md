## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "τῇ κοινωνίᾳ] community: the living together as one family, and having things in common. It is no objection to this meaning, that the fact is repeated below, in Acts 2:45; for so is the κλάσις τοῦ ἄρτου in Acts 2:46, and the προσκ. ταῖς προσευχ."(Commentary on Acts 2:42)
2. "The interpretation of ἡ κλ . τ . ἄρτ . [here] as the celebration of the Lord’s Supper has been, both in ancient and modern times, the prevalent one... the κλάσις τοῦ ἄρτου refers, from the custom of the master of the feast breaking bread in asking a blessing; see ch. Acts 27:35, where the Eucharist is out of the question."(Commentary on Acts 2:42)
3. "The appointed times of prayer: see Acts 2:46. But it need not altogether exclude prayer among themselves as well, provided we do not assume any set times or forms of Christian worship, which certainly did not exist as yet."(Commentary on Acts 2:42)

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Giving themselves up to the instructions which, in their raw state, would be indispensable to the consolidation of the immense multitude suddenly admitted to visible discipleship."
2. "Breaking of bread - not certainly in the Lord's Supper alone, but rather in frugal repasts taken together, with which the Lord's Supper was probably conjoined until abuses and persecution led to the discontinuance of the common meal."
3. "Prayers - probably, stated seasons of it."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The word rendered 'continued stedfastly' - προσκαρτεροῦντες proskarterountes - means 'attending one, remaining by his side, not leaving or forsaking him.'"
2. "One evidence of conversion is a desire to be instructed in the doctrines and duties of religion, and a willingness to attend on the preaching of the gospel."
3. "Christians feel that they are a band of brethren, and that, however much they were separated before they became Christians, now they have great and important interests in common; they are united in feelings, in interests, in dangers, in conflicts, in opinions, and in the hopes of a blessed immortality."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Fellowship [κοινωνια] . From koinov, common. A relation between individuals which involves a common interest and a mutual, active participation in that interest and in each other."
2. "Fellowship is the most common rendering. Thus Philippians 1:5 : 'your fellowship in the gospel,' signifying co - operation in the widest sense; participation in sympathy, suffering, and labor."
3. "Breaking [κλασει] . Used by Luke only, and only in the phrase breaking of bread. The kindred verb klazw or klaw, to break, occurs often, but, like the noun, only of breaking bread. Hence used to designate the celebration of the Lord 's Supper."

### John Calvin:
1. "And my reason why I would rather have breaking of bread to be understood of the Lord’s Supper in this place is this, because Luke doth reckon up those things wherein the public estate of the Church is contained."
2. "Therefore, wheresoever the pure voice of the gospel doth sound, where men continue in the profession thereof, where they exercise themselves in hearing the same ordinarily that they may profit, without all doubt there is the Church."
3. "And we must endeavor to keep and observe this order, if we will be truly judged to be the Church before God and the angels, and not only to make boast of the name thereof amongst men."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The teaching of the apostles would especially consist in rehearsing the sayings of Jesus and explaining the doctrines of the faith so far as they were at that time revealed to them."
2. "Communion in the sense of our communion, the Lord’s Supper."
3. "There is no doubt these words refer to a meal taken in common by the brethren, accompanied by the celebration of the Eucharist, following here the example of the last supper of the Lord."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "This partnership involves participation in, as the blood of Christ or co-operation in the work of the gospel or contribution for those in need."
2. "There can be no doubt that the Eucharist at this period was preceded uniformly by a common repast, as was the case when the ordinance was instituted."
3. "To simply explain τη κλασε του αρτου as='The Holy Communion' is to pervert the plain meaning of words, and to mar the picture of family life, which the text places before us as the ideal of the early believers."

### John Gill:
1. "And which is the same with the doctrine of Christ, of which he is the author, preacher, and subject; the substance of which is peace, pardon, righteousness, and salvation by him." 
2. "And so expresses their constant contributions towards the support of the apostles, as ministers of the word and of the poor members of the church; a duty which, in both its branches, is incumbent on those who have it in their power to perform, and which these first Christians were remarkable for."
3. "They observed all opportunities of this kind, and gladly embraced them."

### John Wesley:
1. "And they continued steadfast — So their daily Church communion consisted in these four particulars"
2. "Ye diff'rent sects, who all declare, Lo here is Christ, and Christ is there; Your stronger proofs divinely give"
3. "And show me where the Christians live!"
