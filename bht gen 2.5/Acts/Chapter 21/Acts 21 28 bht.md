# Acts 21:28 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Jews falsely accused Paul of bringing a Gentile into the inner court of the temple, which was forbidden to non-Jews. They sought to create the impression that Paul had defiled the temple and taught against the customs and laws of the Jewish nation. Their accusations were fueled by their hatred for Paul and his teachings, which emphasized the fulfillment of the law in Christ. The Jews also accused Paul of teaching against the people and bringing Greeks into the temple, further adding to their grievances against him.
