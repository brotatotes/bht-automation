# Acts 22:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Paul's companions heard a voice but did not understand what it said. The distinction is made between hearing a voice speak and hearing what it says. They heard some obscure voice but did not discern it as Paul did. They saw Paul surrounded by the light but did not see or hear the voice of Christ. The suddenness and extraordinariness of the light surprised them, but they did not hear the voice distinctly, only a confused noise.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. 9-11. they that were with me—(See
	on Acts 9:7, &amp;c.)


### Marvin Vincent:
1. Heard not [ουκ ηκουσαν] . The verb is to be taken in the sense of understood, as Mark 4:33; 1 Corinthians 14:2, which explains the apparent discrepancy with ch. 9 7.


### John Calvin:
1. "Surely it is no absurd thing to say that they heard some obscure voice; yet so that they did not discern it as Paul himself, whom alone Christ meant to stay and tame with the reprehension."
2. "Therefore, they hear a voice, because a sound doth enter into their ears, so that they know that someone speaketh from heaven; they hear not the voice of him that spake to Paul, because they understand not what Christ saith."
3. "Moreover, they see Paul compassed about with the light, but they see none which speaketh from heaven."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "There is a distinction between hearing a voice speak and hearing what it says...Paul’s companions heard the voice, i.e. knew that it was speaking, and that they did not hear it, i.e. did not know what it said."
2. "The Divine Voice to the ordinary bystander was a voice, but not one uttering articulate words."
3. "On the identity of the ‘light from heaven,’ which shone round about the company of Saul, with the Shekinah or visible glory, which on so many occasions had been seen by Israel..."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The accusative here may be used rather than the genitive as in verse Acts 22:7 to indicate that those with Paul did not understand what they heard."
2. "Just as they beheld the light (Acts 22:9), but did not see Jesus (Acts 9:7)."
3. "It is one of the evidences of the genuineness of this report of Paul's speech that Luke did not try to smooth out apparent discrepancies in details between the words of Paul and his own record already in ch. 9."

### John Gill:
1. "The suddenness, greatness, and extraordinariness of the light surprised them, for it was even miraculous."
2. "They heard the voice of Saul, but not the voice of Christ."
3. "They did not hear it so as to understand it."

### John Wesley:
1. They did not hear the voice — Distinctly; but only a confused noise.
