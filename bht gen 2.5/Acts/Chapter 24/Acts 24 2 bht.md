# Acts 24:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Tertullus, in his address to Felix, employs flattery to win favor, although there is some truth in his words. Felix did bring peace and order to Judea, suppressing violence and promoting the welfare of the nation. However, his administration was burdened by accusations of bad governance and he was eventually recalled to Rome. The phrase by thy providence refers to Felix's role in the administration of the empire. Overall, Tertullus's speech contrasts sharply with the truth, modesty, and integrity of Paul's words. Felix's character is described as infamous and he is seen as a plague to the provinces he governed.
