## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Without the Œ±·ΩêœÑœåŒΩ, this might mean round the Œ≤·øÜŒºŒ±, or round Festus."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The charges seem to have been a jumble of political and religious matter which they were unable to substantiate." 
2. "Vociferous cries that he was unfit to live."
3. "Paul's reply, not given in full, was probably little more than a challenge to prove any of their charges, whether political or religious."

### Albert Barnes:
1. Grievous complaints - Heavy accusations. Doubtless the same with which they had charged him before Felix, Acts 24:5-6. Compare Acts 25:19.
Which they could not prove - Acts 24:13, Acts 24:19.


### John Calvin:
1. "And this is almost always the estate of the servants of Christ, wherefore they must be the more courageous, to pass valiantly through evil report and good report; neither let them think it strange to be evil reported of where they have done good."
2. "In the mean season, they must do their endeavor, that they may not only have a clear conscience before God, but that they may be very well able to defend themselves before men, when they have time and place."
3. "But the defense of Paul doth show what things the Jews laid principally to his charge. The first crime was ungodliness against God, that he overthrew the law and polluted the temple; the other, rebellion against Caesar and the Roman empire, because he raised tumults everywhere."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Without doubt the many grievous complaints alleged included the ‚Äòprofanation of the temple,‚Äô but other points seem to have been urged which they were unable to prove."
2. "The Roman saw through the attempt, and listened and evidently believed Paul‚Äôs denial of any treasonable designs against the emperor."
3. "But in spite of his conviction of the prisoner‚Äôs innocence of what he naturally deemed the graver charge, he seems to have felt that in some way or another the accused had transgressed some of the regulations and laws of his own strange people."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Took their stand around him," "periculum intentantes" (Bengel). Cf. Luke 23:10 about Christ. They have no lawyer this time, but they mass their forces so as to impress Festus.
2. "The charges were no 'heavier' than those made by Tertullus (Acts 24:5-8). Paul's reply proves this and they were also probably on court record (Furneaux)."
3. "Repetition and reiteration and vehemence took the place of proof."

### John Gill:
1. "And laid many and grievous complaints against Paul; which they could not prove." 
2. "His moral conversation, both before and after conversion, was very strict and conformable to the laws of God and man."
3. "But it was his happiness, and to his honour through the grace of God, that his enemies could not make good anyone thing against him."

### John Wesley:
1. Bringing many accusations ‚Äî When many accusations are heaped together, frequently not one of them is true.
