# Acts 25:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The question asked of Paul, as a Roman citizen, contained more than meets the eye. Festus may have wished to make it appear that the obstacle in the way of Paul being tried by the Sanhedrin arose from the prisoner himself. Festus, like Felix, falls victim to fear of the Jews and wishes to gain favor with them. However, Paul declines the offer to go to Jerusalem, as he had no reason to expect that it would facilitate the cause of justice. Festus's proposition was seen as a desire for popularity rather than an inclination to do justice.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The question is asked of Paul as a Roman citizen, having a right to be tried by Roman law: and more is contained in it, than at first meets the eye."
2. "It seems to propose only a change of place; but doubtless in the ·ºêŒ∫Œµ·øñ Œ∫œÅŒπŒ∏·øÜŒΩŒ±Œπ was contained by implication a sentence pronounced by the Sanhedrim."
3. "Festus may very probably have anticipated the rejection of this proposal by Paul, and have wished to make it appear that the obstacle in the way of Paul being tried by the Sanhedrim arose not from him, but from the prisoner himself."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Festus, willing to do the Jews a pleasure‚Äîto ingratiate himself with them." 
2. "Wilt thou go up to Jerusalem, and . . . be judged . . . before me‚Äîor, 'under my protection.'"
3. "If this was meant in earnest, it was temporizing and vacillating. But, possibly, anticipating Paul's refusal, he wished merely to avoid the odium of refusing to remove the trial to Jerusalem."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "In this he evinced rather a desire of popularity than an inclination to do justice."
2. "It is remarkable, however, that he had such a sense of justice and law as not to suffer the case to go out of his own hands."
3. "As the question which he asked Paul was one on which he was at liberty to take his own course, and as Paul had no reason to expect that his going to Jerusalem would facilitate the cause of justice, it is not remarkable that he declined the offer."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Rev., better, to gain favor."
2. "Not with him as judge, but by the Sanhedrim in his presence."

### John Calvin:
1. "For Festus doth not openly contemn or hate Paul; but ambition, and peradventure also desire of gain, got the upper hand, so that, for pleasing the other part, he doth unjustly bring him in danger of death."
2. "Notwithstanding, I marvel that he giveth Paul leave to choose, and doth not rather, according to this authority, command them to carry him whether he would or no."
3. "Nevertheless, it was no thank to him that he was not delivered into the hands of murderers."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "He felt clearly that there was no sufficient evidence to prove the charge of treason or sedition, which was really all he, as an official of the Empire, had to take cognisance of."
2. "[Festus] wished to be popular with the leading men of his province, so he publicly asked the prisoner if he did not think it better for him to have those charges, which exclusively related to Jewish customs and laws, investigated before an ecclesiastical tribunal like the Sanhedrin."
3. "It is not unlikely that Festus anticipated what the reply of Paul to his proposition would be, but he wished that the odium of declining to submit to the Sanhedrin jurisdiction should be thrown on Paul, who, as Festus knew well, could plead if he chose his privileges as a citizen of Rome."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Festus, like Felix, falls a victim to fear of the Jews."
2. "Festus had no more courage to do right than Felix, however plausible his language might sound."
3. "Paul had faced the mob and the Sanhedrin in Jerusalem, two years of trickery at the hands of Felix in Caesarea, and now he is confronted by the bland chicanery of Festus."

### John Gill:

2. "This was what the Jews had requested of him when he was at Jerusalem, that he would send for Paul thither, and there let him be judged."
3. "He was unwilling to do this without the prisoner's consent, he being a freeman of a Roman city."

2. "He [God] might have an occasion of appealing to Rome."
