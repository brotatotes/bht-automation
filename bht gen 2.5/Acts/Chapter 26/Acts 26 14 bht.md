## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "These words are expressed here only. In ch. 9 (see note) we have the fact remarkably preserved by the Hebrew form Œ£Œ±ŒøœçŒª; in ch. 22 he was speaking in Hebrew (Syro-Chald.), and the notice was not required."
2. "The metaphor is derived from oxen at plough or drawing a burden, who, on being pricked with the goad, kick against it, and so cause it to pierce deeper."
3. "It is a Greek, and not (apparently) a Hebrew proverb; but this is no reason why it should not be used in Hebrew, just as it is in Latin."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "It is hard for thee to kick against the pricks."
