## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "œÄœÅ·ø∂œÑŒøœÇ ŒúŒµŒªŒπœÑŒ±ŒØœâŒΩ was probably an official title: the more so, as Publius can hardly have borne the appellation from his estates, during his father‚Äôs lifetime."
2. "If so (and his Roman name further confirms it), Publius was legatus of the Pr√¶tor of Sicily, to whose province Malta belonged."
3. "The three days were probably till they could find a suitable lodging."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "He would hardly be so styled in the lifetime of his father, if his distinction was that of the family."
2. "But it is now ascertained that this was the proper official title of the Maltese representative of the Roman pr√¶tor to Sicily, to whose province Malta belonged."
3. "till proper winter lodgings could be obtained for them."

### Albert Barnes:
1. In the same quarters - In that place, or that part of the island,
Possessions - Property. His place of residence.
The chief man - Greek: the first man. Probably he was the governor of the island,


### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The chief man [œÑœâ œÄœÅœâœÑœâ]. Official title, without reference to his rank and possessions."
2. "Though not occurring as the official designation of the governor of Malta in any ancient author, it has been found in two inscriptions discovered in the island."
3. "It has been found in two inscriptions discovered in the island."

### John Calvin:
1. "Although those who are holpen be unmindful and unthankful for that benefit which they have received, or they be not able to recompense those who have done good to them, yet God himself will abundantly restore to men whatsoever they have bestowed at his commandment; and he hath sometimes appointed, to those which be merciful and given to hospitality, some of his servants, which bring with them a blessing."
2. "Luke mentions the kind of disease that he may the better set forth the grace of God."
3. "The old man was cured thus suddenly only by the laying on of hands and prayer, not without the manifest power of God."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The meaning can hardly be that Publicus was the wealthiest man on the island, for his father was still living. Clearly there is something official in the phrase."
2. "Hackett justly remarks that, if this is the correct view, it really enhances the narrator's accuracy, 'inasmuch as the range of the application of the term is narrower.'"
3. "It is to be observed that the Greek word here translated 'courteously' is not the same that is so rendered in Acts 27:3. This is not in itself a matter of much moment, but it would be an advantage to the English reader to be enabled to follow the use of such words precisely."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "An official title correct in Malta (Ramsay, St. Paul, p. 343)."
2. "Here it is plainly a title and not the common use seen in Acts 13:50; Acts 25:2; Acts 28:17."
3. "In a kindly or friendly manner, all the more so because of the original suspicion of Paul as a criminal."

### John Gill:
1. "In the same quarters were possessions of the chief man of the island...it may be reasonably thought that he was the richest man in the island, and in the greatest honour and dignity." 
2. "Publius was a name common with the Romans...it is not probable that he should leave his own country, and go to Athens, and take upon him the care of that church there." 
3. "This was a very considerable instance of humanity and hospitality, to receive so many strangers at once into his houses...the benefit of which he afterwards enjoyed, and which was a compensation for his liberality and beneficence."

### John Wesley:
1. The chief man of the island ‚Äî In wealth if not in power also.
Three days ‚Äî The first three days of our stay on the island.

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: Acts 28:7 - In the same quarters were possessions of the chief man of the island. The phrase chief man likely refers to an official title, possibly the governor of the island. The three days mentioned in the verse may have been the time it took to find suitable lodging for Paul and his companions.

The chief man's hospitality and kindness towards the strangers is highlighted, especially considering the initial suspicion towards Paul.
