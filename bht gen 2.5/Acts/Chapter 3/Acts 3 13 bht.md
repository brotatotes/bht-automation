# Acts 3:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Peter accuses the crowd of denying, despising, and murdering Jesus, but emphasizes that God has exalted and honored him. The term servant refers to the Messiah, who fulfills the work of redemption. The phrase in the presence of Pilate highlights the contrast between Pilate's judgment and the crowd's actions. The miracle performed in Jesus' name demonstrates God's approval of his Son's work. Peter also reminds the crowd that they should have regarded Jesus as innocent, but instead delivered him up to shame and death.
