# Acts 4:33 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The apostles testified with power and great grace about the resurrection of Jesus, as they were specially appointed witnesses. Their testimony was not uniform, but the Gospels we have today are remnants of their testimony. The grace upon them was from God, not just favor from the people. The apostles continued to give their witness with power even after facing opposition from the Sadducees. The powerful and effective eloquence of their preaching extended beyond the believers, and the resurrection of Jesus was the foundation of their teaching. The favor they had among the people demonstrated God's protection over them.
