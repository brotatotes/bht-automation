## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Prince and a Saviour‚Äîthe first word expressing that Royalty which all Israel looked for in Messiah, the second the Saving character of it which they had utterly lost sight of."
2. "Each of these features in our Lord's work enters into the other, and both make one glorious whole."
3. "How gloriously is Christ here exhibited; not, as in other places, as the Medium, but as the Dispenser of all spiritual blessings!"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "To be a Prince - Œ±ÃìœÅœáŒ∑Œ≥ŒøÃÄŒΩ archeÃÑgon. See the notes on Acts 3:15. In that place he is called the 'Prince of life.' Here it means that he is actually in the 'exercise' of the office of a prince or a king, at the right hand of his Father."
2. "A Saviour - See the notes on Matthew 1:21."
3. "Christ has power to pardon the greatest offender. He is exalted for this purpose; and he is suited to his work. Even his murderers he could pardon; and no sinner need fear that he who is 'a Prince and a Saviour at the right hand of God' is unable to pardon his sins. To him we may come with confidence; and when pressed with the consciousness of the blackest crimes, and when we feel that we deserve eternal death, we may confidently roll all on his arm."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Prince. See on ch. Acts 3:15. 
Repentance - remission. See on Matthew 3:2; James 5:15; Luke 3:3.


### John Calvin:
1. "Christ, which was slain by the hand of men, was lifted up on high by the power of God, that he might bear rule over angels and men."
2. "Christ is placed in the highest degree of honor, that he may govern the people of God, and not that only, but that he may show himself to be a saving captain, or the author of salvation."
3. "Repentance is, I grant, a voluntary conversion, but whence have we this will, save only because God changeth our heart, that it may be made fleshy of a stony heart; flexible, of hard and stubborn; and, finally, righteous of wicked."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "That same Jesus whom you slew and hanged on the cross of shame and agony, hath the God of your fathers exalted to His right hand, to be a Prince, thus describing His kingly dignity a Prince to whom all Israel owes obedience."
2. "By the preaching of the gospel He brought men to a change of heart (repentance), and then through faith in Him, which came with their change of heart, He made them sharers in His forgiveness of sins."
3. "One of the objects of this book of the ‚ÄòActs‚Äô is to show how the apostles of an exclusive nation developed into the Christian missionaries whose message was to a world."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Exalt (œÖœàœâœÉŒµŒΩ) In contrast to their murder of Christ as in Acts 2:23. Peter repeats his charges with increased boldness."
2. "With his right hand (œÑŒ∑ Œ¥ŒµŒæŒπŒ± Œ±œÖœÑŒøœÖ). So instrumental case, or at his right hand (locative case), or even 'to his right hand' (dative case) as in Acts 2:33."
3. "Prince and Saviour (Œ±œÅœáŒ∑Œ≥ŒøŒΩ Œ∫Œ± œÉœâœÑŒ∑œÅŒ±). See on Acts 3:15. Clearly 'Prince' here."

### John Gill:
1. "He is exalted to the highest heavens, and placed in human nature at the right hand of God, on the same throne with him, crowned with glory and honour."
2. "He is the Prince of life and peace, the Head of the church, and over all things for the sake of it."
3. "Christ is appointed to give this grace to the chosen ones, which he does by sending his Spirit to convince of sin, and to take away the stony heart, and give an heart of flesh."

### John Wesley:
1. "Him hath God exalted - From the grave to heaven; to give repentance - Whereby Jesus is received as a Prince..."
2. "...and forgiveness of sins - Whereby he is received as a Saviour."
3. "Hence some infer, that repentance and faith are as mere gifts as remission of sins. Not so: for man co-operates in the former, but not in the latter. God alone forgives sins."
