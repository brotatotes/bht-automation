# Acts 7:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The patriarchs' envy led them to sell Joseph into Egypt, but God remained with him. This incident serves as an example of Israel's opposition to God's purposes, which were ultimately accomplished despite their resistance. Jacob, Joseph's father, eventually went down to Egypt at Joseph's invitation. Although the Bible does not provide specific details about the deaths of the other patriarchs, it is mentioned that Joseph and all his brothers, as well as that entire generation, passed away.
