# Acts 7:38 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Moses served as a mediator between the Angel of the covenant and the people, receiving the living oracles from God and faithfully reporting them to the assembly in the wilderness. The term church in this context refers to the collective body of God's chosen people, specifically the assembly at Mount Sinai. The living words given to Moses are still relevant and powerful today. This testimony to Moses serves to refute the main charge against Stephen. The word lively or living denotes what is vigorous and efficacious, standing in opposition to what is dead or useless.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "That Moses conversed with both the Angel of the covenant and our fathers, implies that he was the mediator between them."
2. "ἐκκλησίᾳ probably, the assembly held for the promulgation of the law at Mt. Sinai, not ‘the Church’ generally."
3. "λόγια ζῶντα living, not = ζωοποιοῦντα, 'life-giving': still less to be understood 'given vivá voce.'"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "in the church—the collective body of God's chosen people; hence used to denote the whole body of the faithful under the Gospel, or particular sections of them."
2. "This is he that was in the church in the wilderness, with the angel . . . and with our fathers—alike near to the Angel of the Covenant, from whom he received all the institutions of the ancient economy, and to the people, to whom he faithfully reported the living oracles and among whom he set up the prescribed institutions."
3. "By this high testimony to Moses, Stephen rebuts the main charge for which he was on trial."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The word 'church' means literally 'the people called out,' and is applied with great propriety to the assembly or multitude called out of Egypt, and separated from the world."
2. "It is clear, therefore, that by 'the angel' here, Stephen intends to designate him who was God."
3. "The word 'lively,' or 'living,' stands in opposition to what is dead, or useless, and means what is vigorous, efficacious."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Lively. Better, living, as Rev. Compare 1 Peter 2:4, 1 Peter 2:5.


### John Calvin:
1. "This was, therefore, a heap of ungodliness most desperate, that their stubbornness could not be broken or overcome with so many benefits of God, but that they did always return unto their nature." 
2. "It was done to the governance of God, when the people could be kept back, with the reverence of neither, from running headlong into wicked rebellion."
3. "For it is not meet that the doctrine of God should be extinguished together with ministers, or that it should be taken away. For what is more unlikely than that that should die whereby we have immortality?"

### Philip Schaff:
1. "God's church is not limited to Judæ. It was in the wilderness; and there Moses, your great lawgiver, was with it."
2. "The second special instance of Divine favour was his solitary communing with the great covenant Angel, the Almighty Being who, under the name Jehovah (the Eternal One), chose Israel as His peculiar people."
3. "He it was who, from the Eternal of hosts on Sinai, received that sacred law, those living words, the deathless charge which should endure as long as the world endures."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Moses is here represented as receiving the law from an angel as in Hebrews 2:2; Galatians 3:19 (Deuteronomy 33:2, LXX) and so was a mediator or middle man between the angel and the people whereas Jesus is the Mediator of a better covenant." 
2. "A λογιον is a little word (diminutive of λογος). Common in the old Greek, LXX, Philo, in ecclesiastical writers for sayings of Christ, Papias (for instance) saying that Matthew wrote in Hebrew (Aramaic) 'Logia of Jesus.'" 
3. "The words from God to Moses are still 'living' today."

### John Gill:
1. "God always had, and will have a church, though that is sometimes in the wilderness."
2. "It was a peculiar honour to Moses, that he was in this church, though it was in the wilderness; even a greater honour than to be in Pharaoh's court."
3. "The law...contained [God's] mind and will, and was a sure and infallible declaration of it; and 'lively' ones, because delivered 'viva voce', with an articulate voice, and in audible sounds, and because it is quick and powerful."

### John Wesley:
1. "This is he — Moses."
2. "Who received the living oracles — Every period beginning with, And the Lord said unto Moses, is properly an oracle."
3. "These are termed living, because all the word of God, applied by his Spirit, is living and powerful, enlightening the eyes, rejoicing the heart, converting the soul, raising the dead."
