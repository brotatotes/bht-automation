## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "From this time, the narrative takes up Saul, and, at first with considerable interruptions (ch. 8, 10, 11, 12.), but after ch. Act 13:1 entirely, follows his history."
2. "It may describe the general dispersion, without meaning that every individual fled."
3. "Connected with Acts 8:4; this word is not without importance, as introducing the next step in the dissemination of the Gospel, according to our Lord‚Äôs command in ch. Acts 1:8."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Saul was consenting unto his death‚ÄîThe word expresses hearty approval."
2. "They were all scattered abroad‚Äîall the leading Christians, particularly the preachers, agreeably to their Lord's injunctions."
3. "Except the apostles‚Äîwho remained, not certainly as being less exposed to danger, but, at whatever risk, to watch over the infant cause where it was most needful to cherish it."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "This was the first persecution against Christians; the first in a series that terminated only when the religion which they wished to destroy was fully established on the ruins of both Judaism and paganism."
2. "Having been, however, more fully instructed than the others, and having been taught their duty by the example and teaching of the Saviour, they resolved, it seems, to remain and brave the fury of the persecutors."
3. "Good thus came out of evil; and the first persecution resulted, as all others have done, in advancing the cause which was intended to be destroyed."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Death [Œ±ŒΩŒ±ŒπœÅŒµœÉŒµŒπ] . Lit., taking off. See on Luke 23:32.


### John Calvin:
1. "When they have power once granted them to do hurt, their boldness increaseth in tract of time, so that they are carried headlong more immoderately."
2. "For they fled not unadvisedly, being discouraged, but because they saw no other means to pacify the fury of the adversaries."
3. "If they had been scattered here and there with fear of persecution, even at the beginning, all men might have rightly called them hirelings."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Returning from the scene of blood, Saul, armed with the authority of the jealous Sanhedrim, at once commenced his savage work, and in a very short time the little flourishing Church of Jerusalem was dispersed."
2. "This expression should not be understood literally; but as many of the great body of Christians, obliged by the violence of the persecution to leave the city, betook themselves to a distance, we can well imagine that the various congregations for a time were dispersed."
3. "But whether or no they were exposed to danger, they felt they had no right to quit the holy city, which they regarded as their post of duty."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Paul himself will later confess that he felt so (Acts 22:20), coolly applauding the murder of Stephen, a heinous sin (Romans 1:32). It is a gruesome picture." 
2. "On that definite day, that same day as in Acts 2:41."
3. "It remains a bit of a puzzle why the Pharisees spared the apostles. Was it due to the advice of Gamaliel in Acts 5:34-40? Or was it the courage of the apostles? Or was it a combination of both with the popularity of the apostles in addition?"

### John Gill:
1. "That Saul consented to the death of Stephen, and approved of that barbarous action, is evident from his taking care of the clothes of the witnesses that stoned him; but the word here used signifies not a bare consent only, but a consent with pleasure and delight."
2. "They seem to be the seventy disciples, and other ministers of the word, on whom the Holy Ghost fell at the day of Pentecost, or was since bestowed; among whom were Philip, who went to Samaria; and Ananias, who was at Damascus; and others that went as far as Phenice, Cyprus, and Antioch."
3. "This scattering by reason of the persecution was of all the preachers, except the apostles; the twelve apostles, who stayed at Jerusalem to take care of the church; to encourage the members of it to suffer cheerfully for the sake of Christ and his Gospel; and to animate them to abide by him."
