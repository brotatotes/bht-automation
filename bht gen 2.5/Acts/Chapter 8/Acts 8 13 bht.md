# Acts 8:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Simon, a magician, attached himself to Philip and was baptized, but it is clear that he did not truly believe in Jesus as the Messiah. He saw baptism as a way to gain power and influence, not as a sign of genuine faith. Simon's amazement at Philip's miracles and signs only furthered his own self-delusion and imposture. He believed in the power of magic and saw Philip as a greater magician. Simon's belief was superficial and temporary, lacking true conviction and a transformed heart.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "He attached himself to Philip, and was baptized like the rest: but we are not, as the sequel shews, to understand that the preaching of the Gospel had made any impression on his heart, but that he accounted for what he saw in his own fashion."
2. "He was convinced, from the works which Philip did, that he was in league with some powerful spirit: he viewed baptism as the initiation into communion with that spirit."
3. "All were baptized who professed belief in Jesus as the Messiah: there was therefore no reason for rejecting Simon, considering besides, that from the nature of the case he would for the time have given up his magical practices."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Left without followers, he thinks it best to join the man who had fairly outstripped him, not without a touch of real conviction."
2. "What a light does this throw on what is called Baptismal Regeneration!"
3. "He continued with Philip, 'was in constant attendance upon' him."

### Albert Barnes:

2. "But there be many who howsoever they be not regenerate with the Spirit of adoption, and do not addict themselves unto God with the true affection of the heart, being overcome with the power of the Word, do not only confess that that is true which is taught, but are also touched with some fear of God, so that they receive doctrine."
3. "Whereas Philip admitted him into his company, it appeareth thereby how hard a matter it is to know hypocrites. And this is a trial of our patience."
