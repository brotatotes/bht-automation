# Acts 8:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Samaritans had received the Holy Spirit, who had come upon them suddenly and rapidly. The Holy Spirit was not an it, but a he, and they had received him in the name of the Lord Jesus. However, the power to bestow the Holy Spirit seemed to be limited to the apostles. The early cessation of miraculous power in the Church is discussed, and the duty of imposition of hands on the baptized belonged exclusively to the apostles. Baptism must have the force it has from the Holy Spirit, and the Samaritans had received the Spirit in baptism.

### Philip Schaff:
