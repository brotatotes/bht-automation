# Acts 9:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Saul, later known as Paul, was breathing out threats and murder against the disciples of the Lord. His blind rage and persecuting spirit burned fiercely, as he punished and compelled them to blaspheme. The words breathing out indicate that threatening and slaughter had become the very breath that Saul breathed. He reveled in the slaughter of the saints, finding pleasure in their deaths. However, this same mouth that once breathed out destruction would later proclaim the Gospel of the grace of God.
