# Acts 9:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Ananias obediently follows the heavenly vision and addresses Saul as Brother Saul, recognizing him as a fellow Christian. Ananias also refers to Jesus as the Lord, emphasizing that Jesus is the one being referred to in the book of Acts. Ananias lays hands on Saul, not for ordination but to impart blessings. He tells Saul to be filled with the Holy Spirit, as Saul will need this special power as an apostle. The act of laying hands on Saul is seen as a custom used by the apostles to impart visible graces of the Spirit. Ananias's greeting to Saul as a brother in Christ is significant, as it signifies the removal of suspicion and the acceptance of Saul into the community of believers.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "I can hardly think, with De W. and Meyer, that these words imply that the Lord had said to Ananias more than is above related: I would rather view them as a natural inference from what was said in Acts 9:15."
2. "It is remarkable again how Paul, speaking there to an infuriated Jewish mob, gives the words spoken just that form which would best gain him a favourable hearing with them."
3. "He there too gives ἀναστὰς βάπτισαι καὶ ἀπόλουσαι τὰς ἁμαρτίας σου , ἐπικαλεσάμενος τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ as part of the exhortation of Ananias."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "How beautifully childlike is the obedience of Ananias to 'the heavenly vision!'"
2. "This clearly shows in what sense the term 'Lord' is used in this book. It is JESUS that is meant, as almost invariably in the Epistles also."
3. "This knowledge by an inhabitant of Damascus of what had happened to Saul before entering it, would show him at once that this was the man whom Jesus had already prepared him to expect."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Putting his hands on him - This was not ‘ordination,’ but was the usual mode of imparting or communicating blessings."
2. "Brother Saul - An expression recognizing him as a fellow-Christian."
3. "Be filled with the Holy Ghost - See the notes on Acts 2:4."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Brother. In Christ.


### John Calvin:
1. "The apostles translated that custom taken from sacrifices to their use, either when they gave the visible graces of the Spirit or when they made any man minister of the Church."
2. "Let the readers note out of the chapter next going before how this ceremony is effectual to give the Spirit."
3. "But seeing Paul received the Spirit by the hand of Ananias, the Papists are more than ridiculous, who will have the bishops alone to lay on their hands."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "And there shall arise from my seed in after times one beloved of the Lord, hearing His voice, enlightening with new knowledge all the Gentiles . . . and till the consummation of the ages, shall he be in the congregations of the Gentiles, and among their princes, as a strain of music in the mouth of all. And he shall be inscribed in the Holy Books, both his work and his word, and he shall be chosen of God for ever."
2. "He at once proceeded to the house indicated to him in the vision, and going up to the dreaded inquisitor, now blind and humbled, greeted him with love and tenderness as one of the brotherhood of Jesus, and told him he was charged by the One who appeared to him in the way to Damascus to restore his sight, and to bestow upon him the gift of the Holy Ghost."
3. "These and similar declarations are important (see note on Acts 9:3), as in later days Paul, in speaking of the evidences, seems to have attached the deepest importance to the fact that he had seen the Lord (see 1 Corinthians 9:1; 1 Corinthians 15:8)."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Brother Saul. All suspicion has vanished and Ananias takes Saul to his heart as a brother in Christ." 
2. "The Lord, even Jesus. Undoubted use of κυριος as Lord and applied to Jesus." 
3. "Be filled with the Holy Spirit. This enduement of special power he will need as an apostle."

### John Gill:
1. "He calls him 'brother', not because he was of the same nation, but because he was now of the same faith; because he was a regenerate person, and belonged to the family of God, and was of the same household of faith."
2. "And this he said, not upon what he had received from Saul's own mouth, for he addressed him in this manner as soon as he came to him; but upon what the Lord had said concerning him."
3. "This same glorious person... hath sent me, that thou mightest receive thy sight; his bodily sight, which he had been without three days, by the imposition of hands."
