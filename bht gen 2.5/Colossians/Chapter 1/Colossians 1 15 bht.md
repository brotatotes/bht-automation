# Colossians 1:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Christ is the visible manifestation of the invisible God, representing His perfections and revealing His righteousness, goodness, wisdom, and power. He is the firstborn in dignity and precedence, holding the highest rank above all creation. As the image of God, Christ is the exact counterpart and reflection of the Father, making God visible to us. He is the stamp of God, the one who has seen Jesus has seen God. Paul uses the terms image and firstborn to express the deity of Jesus Christ in relation to the Father and the universe.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "He is the visible manifestation of that in God which is invisible: the λόγος of the eternal silence, the ἀπαύγασμα of the δόξα which no creature can bear, the χαρακτήρ of that ὑπόστασις which is incommunicably God’s." 
2. "The first and simplest meaning is that of priority of birth. But a secondary and derived meaning of πρωτότοκος, as a designation of dignity and precedence, implied by priority, cannot be denied."
3. "Christ was not only first-born of His mother in the world, but first-begotten of His Father, before the worlds, and that He holds the rank, as compared with every created thing, of first-born in dignity."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "They who have experienced in themselves 'redemption', know Christ in the glorious character here described, as above the highest angels."
2. "'Image' (eicon) involves 'likeness' (homoiosis); but 'likeness' does not involve 'image.' 'Image' always supposes a prototype, which it not merely resembles, but from which it is drawn: the exact counterpart, as the reflection of the sun in the water: the child the living image of the parent."
3. "'First-born of every creature'...is understood by ORIGEN as declaring the Godhead of Christ, and is used by Him as a phrase to mark that Godhead, in contrast with His manhood."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It is probable that, in both cases, the design is to meet some erroneous opinion on this subject that prevailed in those churches, or among those that claimed to be teachers there."
2. "The meaning is, that he represents to mankind the perfections of God, as an image, figure, or drawing does the object which it is made to resemble."
3. "The meaning, then, is, that Christ sustains the most exalted rank in the universe; he is pre-eminent above all others; he is at the head of all things."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Image is more than likeness which may be superficial and incidental. It implies a prototype, and embodies the essential verity of its prototype." 
2. "Thus is brought out the idea of manifestation which lies in image." 
3. "As image points to revelation, so first - born points to eternal preexistence."

### John Calvin:
1. "Christ is called the image of God on this ground — that he makes God in a manner visible to us."
2. "God in himself, that is, in his naked majesty, is invisible, and that not to the eyes of the body merely, but also to the understandings of men, and that he is revealed to us in Christ alone."
3. "For in Christ he shews us his righteousness, goodness, wisdom, power, in short, his entire self."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The image of the invisible God. This indicates the relation to God, immanent and permanent. On this relation rests the actual revelation of God in the Person of Christ."
2. "The firstborn of (or, ‘before’) every creature. 'The first born with respect to every creature; He was born before every creature. He is not the first created... The term ‘first born’ expresses here priority in time, although there maybe an inferential reference to superiority in rank."
3. "In this relation of the Son to the Invisible God is to be found the ground or condition of the whole creation. Although not included in the category of 'creation,' He is most intimately linked with 'every creature.'"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Jesus is the very stamp of God the Father as he was before the Incarnation and is now."
2. "But the one who sees Jesus has seen God."
3. "Paul takes both words to help express the deity of Jesus Christ in his relation to the Father as εικων (Image) and to the universe as πρωτοτοκος (First-born)."

### John Gill:
1. "He is the image of the invisible God...the Father, called 'God', not to the exclusion of the Son or Spirit, who are with him the one God: 'and he is invisible.'"
2. "But chiefly the Father is said to be invisible...in and through Christ, in whom he gives the light of the knowledge of the glory of his person and perfections."
3. "But the sense either is, that he was begotten of the Father in a manner inconceivable and inexpressible by men, before any creatures were in being; or that he is the 'first Parent', or bringer forth of every creature into being."

### John Wesley:
1. "Who is — By describing the glory of Christ, and his pre-eminence over the highest angels, the apostle here lays a foundation for the reproof of all worshippers of angels."
2. "The image of the invisible God — Whom none can represent, but his only begotten Son; in his divine nature the invisible image, in his human the visible image, of the Father."
3. "The first begotten of every creature — That is, begotten before every creature; subsisting before all worlds, before all time, from all eternity."
