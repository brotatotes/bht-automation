# Colossians 1:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
God reconciles man to Himself by taking away the barrier of sin through the blood of Jesus. This reconciliation affects all of creation, both sinful and sinless, bringing harmony and participation in Christ. Sin not only affected the earth but also introduced discord in heaven, causing a loss and retardation in the development of angels. The blood shed on the cross is the means of making reconciliation between God and man, securing peace and harmony. Through Christ, the entire universe is reconciled with God, restoring it to its primal harmony. Reconciliation is only possible through Christ, as He is the bond that connects us to God.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The Scripture phrase, 'God reconciles man to Himself,' implies that He takes away by the blood of Jesus the barrier which God's justice interposes against man's being in union with God."
2. "All creation subsists in Christ, all creation is therefore affected by His propitiation: sinful creation is strictly 'reconciled' from its enmity; sinless creation, comparatively distant from His unapproachable purity, is lifted into nearer participation of Him, and in this wider sense is reconciled."
3. "Sin introduced discord not only on earth, but also in heaven, by the fall of demons; it brought into the abodes of holy angels, though not positive, yet privative loss, a retardation of their highest and most perfect development, harmonious gradation, and perfect consummation."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "By his blood shed on the cross. That blood, making atonement for sin, was the means of making reconciliation between God and man." 
2. "It can mean then, only, that he had executed a plan that was adapted to this; that if fairly and properly applied, the blood of the cross was fitted to secure entire reconciliation between heaven and earth."
3. "Between these, it is designed to produce harmony by the blood of the cross, or by the atonement."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Having made peace. Only here in the New Testament. Having concluded peace; see on John 3:21. The participle is parallel with to reconcile, and marks peace - making and reconciliation as contemporaneous." 
2. "The kindred eijrhnopoiov peacemaker, only in Matthew 5:9. The phrase making peace, in which the two factors of this verb appear separately, occurs only Ephesians 2:15."
3. "All things [τα παντα] . Must be taken in the same sense as in vers. 16, 17, 18, the whole universe, material and spiritual."

### John Calvin:
1. "He declares, accordingly, that we are blessed through Christ alone, inasmuch as he is the bond of our connection with God, and, on the other hand, that, apart from him, we are most miserable, because we are shut out from God."
2. "Now he calls it the blood of the cross, inasmuch as it was the pledge and price of the making up of our peace with God, because it was poured out upon the cross."
3. "This, however, has nothing to do with Paul’s words, which include nothing else than this, that it is through Christ alone, that, all creatures, who have any connection at all with God, cleave to him."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Through Christ the entire universe is reconciled with God."
2. "The absolute totality of created things shall be restored into its primal harmony with its Creator."
3. "Apart from His Person there is no efficacy in the shedding of blood."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "This double compound (απο, κατα with αλλασσω) occurs only here, verse Colossians 1:22; Ephesians 2:16, and nowhere else so far as known."
2. "Sin somehow has put the universe out of joint. Christ will set it right."
3. "This for the benefit of the Docetic Gnostics who denied the real humanity of Jesus and as clearly stating the causa medians (Ellicott) of the work of reconciliation to be the Cross of Christ, a doctrine needed today."

### John Gill:
1. "Reconciliation supposes a former state of amity and friendship, and in such an one man was originally with God; and a breach of that friendship, which was made and issued in real enmity in the heart of man; and also a restoration to friendship again."
2. "God the Father...knew what a state of enmity and rebellion his people would fall into; his thoughts ran upon their peace and reconciliation from everlasting; he called a council of peace about it, and in it drew the model of it; he entered into a covenant of peace with his Son, and, in consequence of it, sent him in the fulness of time to effect it, laying on him the chastisement of their peace."
3. "This peace he has made by his 'blood', that is, by the shedding of it, by his death as a sacrifice, which he underwent on the cross; partly to denote the shame, and chiefly to signify the curse he endured in the room of his people: all which shows the malignant nature of sin, the strictness of justice, and that peace is made in a way of full satisfaction, is upon honourable terms, will be lasting, as it is joyful, being attended with a train of blessings."

### John Wesley:
1. "Through the blood of the cross — The blood shed thereon."
2. "Whether things on earth — Here the enmity began: therefore this is mentioned first."
3. "Or things in heaven — Those who are now in paradise; the saints who died before Christ came."
