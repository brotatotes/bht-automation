# Colossians 2:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The law, including the moral law, is abrogated for believers, as it was a compulsory and accusing code. Christ, by bearing the curse of the broken law, has redeemed us from its curse. The handwriting, which represents the whole law, was nailed to the cross, signifying its cancellation. The death of Jesus had the same effect on the Mosaic law as if it had been affixed to his cross.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The law (including especially the moral law, wherein lay the chief difficulty in obeying) is abrogated to the believer, as far as it was a compulsory, accusing code, and as far as 'righteousness' (justification) and 'life' were sought for by it." 
2. "The 'handwriting'... is the whole law, the obligatory bond, under which all lay; the Jews primarily were under the bond, but they in this respect were the representative people of the world... and in their inability to keep the law was involved the inability of the Gentiles also."
3. "Christ, by bearing the curse of the broken law, has redeemed us from its curse... In His person nailed to the cross, the law itself was nailed to it."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The burdensome requirements of the Mosaic law are abolished, and...all that they were designed to typify had been now accomplished in a better way." 
2. "The ordinances of the Mosaic law were necessary, in order to introduce the gospel; but they were always burdensome."
3. "The death of Jesus had the same effect, in regard to the rites and institutions of the Mosaic religion, as if they had been affixed to his cross."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The law is against us, because it comes like a taskmaster, bidding us do, but neither putting the inclination into our hearts nor the power into our hands."
2. "Law is against us, because the revelation of unfulfilled duty is the accusation of the defaulter, and a revelation to him of his guilt."
3. "Law is against us, because it comes with threatenings and foretastes of penalty and pain."

### John Calvin:
1. "For we know that as to debts the obligation is still in force, so long as the hand-writing remains; and that, on the other hand, by the erasing, or tearing of the handwriting, the debtor is set free." 
2. "This, therefore, is a truly theological reason for proving the abrogation of ceremonies, because, if Christ has fully redeemed us from condemnation, he must have also effaced the remembrance of the obligation, that consciences may be pacified and tranquil in the sight of God, for these two things are conjoined."
3. "The Son of God has not only by his death delivered us from the condemnation of death, but in order that absolution might be made more certain, he abrogated those ceremonies, that no remembrance of obligation might remain. This is full liberty."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The bond in this case was the law, which was written in, took the form of 'ordinances,' i.e., specific commandments."
2. "'It was the law rather than Christ, which was slain and done away with on the cross, because He bore the curse of the law, took away its condemnation."
3. "Men slew Christ, but the Lord slew the law on the cross."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Having blotted out (ŒµŒæŒ±ŒªŒµŒπœàŒ±œÇ). And so 'cancelled.' First aorist active participle of old verb ŒµŒæŒ±ŒªŒµŒπœÜœâ, to rub out, wipe off, erase."
2. "The bond written in ordinances that was against us (œÑŒø Œ∫Œ±Œ∏' Œ∑ŒºœâŒΩ œáŒµŒπœÅŒøŒ≥œÅŒ±œÜŒøŒΩ œÑŒøŒπœÇ Œ¥ŒøŒ≥ŒºŒ±œÉŒπŒΩ)."
3. "And he hath taken it out of the way (Œ∫Œ± Œ∑œÅŒ∫ŒµŒΩ ŒµŒ∫ œÑŒøœÖ ŒºŒµœÉŒøœÖ). Perfect active indicative of Œ±ŒπœÅœâ, old and common verb, to lift up, to bear, to take away."

### John Gill:
1. "God has 'blotted' [the law] out, Christ having engaged as a surety for his people, to pay off all their debts; and this being done by him, God has crossed the debt book of the law, has blotted it out, so that this book is of no force."
2. "It is abolished and done away; it is no more as administered by Moses, as a covenant of works, or as to its rigorous exaction, curse, and condemnation."
3. "Every nail in the cross made a scissure in this handwriting, or bond of the law, that lay against us, whereby it was so rent and torn, as to be of no force."

### John Wesley:
1. "Having blotted out ‚Äî in consequence of his gracious decrees, that Christ should come into the world to save sinners, and that whosoever believeth on him should have everlasting life."
2. "The handwriting against us ‚Äî Where a debt is contracted, it is usually testified by some handwriting; and when the debt is forgiven, the handwriting is destroyed, either by blotting it out, by taking it away, or by tearing it."
3. "The apostle expresses in all these three ways, God's destroying the handwriting which was contrary to us, or at enmity with us. This was not properly our sins themselves, (they were the debt,) but their guilt and cry before God."
