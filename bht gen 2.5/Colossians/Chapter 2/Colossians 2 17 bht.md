# Colossians 2:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Jewish ordinances were shadows of things to come, with the substance belonging to Christ. They were mere types or resemblances, while the blessings of the Christian covenant are the true substance. The Mosaic rituals were an outline or prefiguring of the new dispensation in Christ, and the observances are no longer binding now that the reality has come. Christ is the body and substance of all these shadows, and the contrast between shadows and revelation is emphasized.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "which (if the sing. be read, the relative may refer either to the aggregate of the observances mentioned, or to the last mentioned, i.e. the Sabbath. Or it may be singular by attraction, and refer to all, just as if it were plural, see Mat 12:4) is (or as in rec. are: not, ‚Äòwas,‚Äô or were: he speaks of them in their nature, abstractedly) a shadow (not, a sketch, œÉŒ∫ŒπŒ±Œ≥œÅŒ±œÜŒØŒ± or - œÜŒ∑ŒºŒ±, which meaning is precluded by the term opposed being œÉ·ø∂ŒºŒ±, not the finished picture, but literally the shadow: see below) of things to come..."
2. "the blessings of the Christian covenant: these are the substance, and the Jewish ordinances the mere type or resemblance, as the shadow is of the living man."
3. "if the ordinance of the Sabbath had been, in any form, of lasting obligation on the Christian Church, it would have been quite impossible for the Apostle to have spoken thus. The fact of an obligatory rest of one day, whether the seventh or the first, would have been directly in the teeth of his assertion here: the holding of such would have been still to retain the shadow, while we possess the substance."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The real substance (of the blessings typified by the law) belongs to Christ."
2. "The blessings of the Christian covenant, the substance of which Jewish ordinances were but the type."
3. "The body is of Christ."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "They were only a dim outline of future things, not the reality."
2. "Between those things themselves which are in Christ, and those which only represented or prefigured them, there is as much difference as there is between a body and a shadow."
3. "Having now, therefore, the thing itself the shadow can be to us of no value; and that having come which was prefigured, that which was designed merely to represent it, is no longer binding."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Shadow, not sketch or outline, as is shown by body following."
2. "The Mosaic ritual system was to the great verities of the Gospel what the shadow is to the man, a mere general type or resemblance."
3. "The substance belongs to the Christian economy. It is derived from Christ, and can be realized only through union with Him."

### John Calvin:
1. "The reason why he frees Christians from the observance of them is, that they were shadows at a time when Christ was still, in a manner, absent."
2. "For he contrasts shadows with revelation, and absence with manifestation."
3. "Farther, while our sacraments represent Christ as absent as to view and distance of place, it is in such a manner as to testify that he has been once manifested, and they now also present him to us to be enjoyed."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The whole system of prohibitions and festivals has a typical significance, pointing to 'the things to come,' namely, the new dispensation."
2. "The body is Christ's, belongs to Him; the reality of these observances is found in the new dispensation."
3. "In this substantial reality there is a place for the Lord's Day, which is 'now to be a season of loftier joy, as it commemorates a more august event than either the creation of the universe, or the exodus from Egypt'."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "A shadow (œÉŒ∫ŒπŒ±). Old word, opposed to substance (œÉœâŒºŒ±, body)."

### John Gill:
1. "The distinction of meats is ceased, these shadows are gone."
2. "The feast of tabernacles... was also a representation of the people of God dwelling in the earthly houses of their tabernacles here on earth; and particularly of Christ's dwelling, or tabernacling in human nature."
3. "Christ is the body and substance of all these shadows, in opposition to these sayings and notions of the Jews."

### John Wesley:
1. Which are but a lifeless shadow; but the body, the substance, is of Christ.
