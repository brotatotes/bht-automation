# Colossians 2:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Why are you being prescribed to Handle not, neither taste, nor even touch as if you still lived under the principles of the world? You died with Christ and became dead to the world, so why do you still submit to its ordinances? The picture is that of baptism, where you have come out on the other side of the grave and should not act as if you had not. The bond of decrees was removed on the Cross of Christ, so there is no need to be subject to the ordinances imposed by men.
