## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Handle not, neither taste, nor even touch."
2. "Handle not" (a stronger term than "nor even touch"), "nor taste" with the tongue, "nor even touch," however slight the contact.
3. "The three refer to meats."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Why are ye subject to ordinances of various kinds, such as this - Touch not, taste not, handle not?" 
2. "They allowed themselves no food that was pleasant to the taste, but ate dry, coarse bread, and drank only water."
3. "Intoxicating drinks should be abstained from; but the obligation to do it should be made to rest on solid arguments, and not on passages of Scripture like this."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Touch - taste - handle [Î±ÏˆÎ· - Î³ÎµÏ…ÏƒÎ· - Î¸Î¹Î³Î·Ï‚] . %Aptomai, A. V., touch, is properly to fasten one's self to or cling to."
2. "To get hands on so as to injure, 1 John 5:18. To have intercourse with, 1 Corinthians 7:1; 2 Corinthians 6:17."
3. "No single English word will express all these phases of meaning. Handle comes, perhaps, as near as any other, especially in its sense of treatment, as when we say that a speaker or writer handles a subject; or that a man is roughly handled by his enemies."

### John Calvin:
1. "When persons have once taken upon them to tyrannize over menâ€™s souls, there is no end of new laws being daily added to old ones, and new enactments starting up from time to time." 
2. "Human traditions are a labyrinth, in which consciences are more and more entangled; nay more, are snares, which from the beginning bind in such a way that in course of time they strangle in the end." 
3. "From the very commencement they are unduly rigorous: hence he sets out with their prohibition â€” not simply against eating, but even against slightly partaking."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The climax is reached in 'do not even touch.'" 
2. "The prohibitions are specific in form, and refer to certain kinds of food and drink."
3. "This series of condemned prohibitions cannot be used in support of total abstinence from intoxicating liquors, except through culpable ignorance or dishonesty."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The Pharisees, Essenes, Gnostics made piety hinge on outward observances and rules instead of inward conviction and principle."
2. "Even today men are finding that the noble prohibition law needs enlightened instruction to make it effective."
3. "These three verbs are all in the aorist subjunctive second person singular with Î¼Î·, a prohibition against handling or touching these forbidden things."

### John Gill:
1. "Touch not, taste not, handle not. This the apostle says, not of himself, but in the person of the Jewish doctors."
2. "Some think that these several rules have respect only to meats; as 'touch not', that is, do not eat of things forbidden ever so little; nay, 'taste not', do not let anything of them come within your lips; yea, 'handle not', do not so much as touch them with your fingers."
3. "Others think that touch not regards abstinence from women; see 1 Corinthians 7:1; and respects the prohibition of marriage by some in those times; and 'taste not', the forbearance of certain meats, at certain times, which God had not restrained any from; and 'handle not', that is, make no use of, or enjoy your own goods, and so designs that voluntary poverty which some entered into under the direction of false teachers."

### John Wesley:
1. Touch not â€” An unclean thing.
Taste not â€” Any forbidden meat.
Handle not â€” Any consecrated vessel.
