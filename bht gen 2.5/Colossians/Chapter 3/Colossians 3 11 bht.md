## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "There is no such thing as Greek and Jew [...] circumcision and uncircumcision [...] bondman, freeman." 
2. "Christ absorbs in Himself all distinctions, being to all alike, everything that they need for justification, sanctification, and glorification." 
3. "The unity of the divine life shared in by all believers, counterbalances all differences, even as great as that between the polished 'Greek' and the rude 'Scythian.'"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Where there is neither Greek nor Jew... all are on a level; that there is no distinction of nation in the church; that all are to be regarded and treated as brethren..."
2. "No one is admitted into that blessed society because he is circumcised; no one is excluded because he is uncircumcised. That distinction is unknown, and all are on a level."
3. "The great thing that constitutes the uniqueness of the church is, that Christ is its Saviour, and that all are his friends and followers. Its members lay aside all other distinctions, and are known only as his friends."

### John Calvin:
1. "Christian perfection does not stand in need of those outward observances, nay, that they are things that are altogether at variance with it."
2. "Christ alone holds, as they say, the prow and the stern â€” the beginning and the end."
3. "They are, therefore, superfluous in a state of true perfection, nay more, they ought to have no place, inasmuch as injustice would otherwise be done to Christ."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Where, in the region of the new creation, in contrast with that in which the old man dwelt, there is not (â€˜not only does the distinction not exist, but it cannot exist;â€™ Lightfoot) Greek and Jew, no division as respects nationality, circumcision and uncircumcision, as respects religion, Barbarian, Scythian, as respects civilization (â€˜Scythians, more barbarous than the barbarians;â€™ Bengel), bondman, freeman (so Ellicott), as respects social condition." 
2. "But Christ is all and in all â€˜But,â€™ strongly adversative, presents the contrast with the world of carnal men, where all these distinctions not only exist, but are emphasized and control the conduct."
3. "The first â€˜allâ€™ is neuter, the second probably masculine: â€˜all things and in all persons.â€™ Ellicott: â€˜Christ is the aggregation of all things, distinctions, prerogatives, blessings, and moreover is in all, dwelling in all, and so uniting all in the common element of Himself.â€™"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Race distinctions disappear in Christ and in the new man in Christ."
2. "Class distinctions vanish in Christ."
3. "Christ occupies the whole sphere of human life and permeates all its developments."

### John Gill:
1. "It matters not of what nation a man is, so be it he is but a good man; especially in Christianity, all distinctions of this kind cease."
2. "The grace of God in regeneration is not bestowed upon a man because he is a free man, or withheld from another because he is a bond servant."
3. "Christ is all, and in all; he is 'all' efficiently; he is the first cause of all things, the beginning of the creation of God, the author of the old, and of the new creation, of the regeneration of his people, and of their whole salvation."

### John Wesley:
1. "It matters not what a man is externally, whether Jew or gentile, circumcised, or uncircumcised, barbarian, void of all the advantages of education, yea, Scythian, of all barbarians most barbarous."
2. "Christ is in all that are thus renewed."
3. "Christ is all things in them and to them."
