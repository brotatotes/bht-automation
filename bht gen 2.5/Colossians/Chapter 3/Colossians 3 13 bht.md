# Colossians 3:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Believers are called to forbear and forgive one another, holding back from one another and granting grace to ourselves. Christ's forgiveness of us serves as the reason for our forgiveness of others. We are to forgive as Christ forgave us, freely, entirely, and forever. This forgiveness should extend to any complaint or cause of blame against another, treating them kindly and declaring our forgiveness. By forbearing and forgiving, we reflect the unity and love within the body of Christ.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Forbearing‚Äîas to present offenses. forgiving‚Äîas to past offenses."
2. "Christ‚Äîwho had so infinitely greater cause of complaint against us."
3. "The Lord."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "If another one has given us just occasion of complaint, we are to forgive him; that is, we are: to harbor no malice against him; to be ready to do him good as if he had not given us occasion of complaint; to be willing to declare that we forgive him when be asks it; and, to always afterward treat him as kindly as if he had not injured us."
2. "Even as Christ forgave you, so also do ye - Learn here that Christ has power to forgive sin; Christ forgave us freely, entirely, and forever."
3. "So we should forgive an offending brother."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "One another - one another. Lit., one another - yourselves."
2. "The latter pronoun emphasizes the fact that they are all members of Christ's body - everyone members one of another - so that, in forgiving each other they forgive themselves."

1. "Forbearing one another, and forgiving each other. The pronouns are different, as in Ephesians 4:32; the latter marking more strongly the relation of Christians as members of Christ." 
2. "If (as is probable) a ny man have a complaint (a cause of blame) against any: even as the Lord forgave you."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Forbearing one another (Œ±ŒΩŒµœáŒøŒºŒµŒΩŒø Œ±ŒªŒªŒ∑ŒªœâŒΩ). Holding yourselves back from one another."

3. "Christ's forgiveness of us is here made the reason for our forgiveness of others."

### John Gill:
1. "Forbearing one another,.... Not only bearing one another's burdens, and with one another's weaknesses, but forbearing to render evil for evil, or railing for railing, or to seek revenge for affronts given."
2. "if any man have a quarrel against any; let him be who he will, high or low, rich or poor, of whatsoever age, state, or condition, and let his quarrel or complaint be what it will, ever so great, or ever so just and well founded, yet let him put up with it, and forgive it."
3. "as Mediator, he has procured the remission of sins by the shedding of his blood; and as God he forgives sins freely, fully, forgetting the injuries done, not upbraiding with former offences, and that too without asking, and before there is any appearance of repentance; and so should the saints forgive one another, as they expect to have an application and manifestation of forgiveness to themselves."

### John Wesley:
1. Forbearing one another ‚Äî If anything is now wrong.
And forgiving one another ‚Äî What is past.
