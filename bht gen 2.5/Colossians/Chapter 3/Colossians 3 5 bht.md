## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Mortifyâ€”Greek, 'make a corpse of'; 'make dead'; 'put to death.'"
2. "Habitually repress and do violence to corrupt desires of which the members are the instruments."
3. "Covetousnessâ€”marked off by the Greek article as forming a whole genus by itself, distinct from the genus containing the various species just enumerated. It implies a self-idolizing, grasping spirit; far worse than another Greek term translated 'the love of money'."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Mortify therefore your members - Since you are dead to sin and the world, and are to appear with Christ in the glories of his kingdom, subdue every carnal and evil propensity of your nature." 
2. "The word 'mortify' means to put to death...the meaning here is that they were entirely to subdue their evil propensities, so that they would have no remains of life; that is, they were not at all to indulge them." 
3. "Of all base passions, [covetousness] is the one that most dethrones God from the soul."

### John Calvin:

2. "He conceives of our nature as being, as it were, a mass made up of different vices."
3. "He intimates, however, that we are earthly, so long as the vices of our flesh are vigorous in us, and that we are made heavenly by the renewing of the Spirit."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Kill once for all, is the thought of the original."
2. "The putting to death is to be understood in an ethical, not in a physical sense."
3. "The covetous man sets up another object of worship besides God. There is a sort of religious purpose, a devotion of the soul, to greed."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Paul boldly applies the metaphor of death (Colossians 2:20; Colossians 3:3) pictured in baptism (Colossians 2:12) to the actual life of the Christian."
2. "He is not to go to the other Gnostic extreme of license on the plea that the soul is not affected by the deeds of the body."
3. "Paul's idea is that the body is the temple of the Holy Spirit (1 Corinthians 6:19)."

### John Gill:
1. "The mortification the saints are here exhorted to, in consideration of having a spiritual life in them, and a hope of eternal life in Christ, from whence the apostle argues, is not a mortification or destruction of the body of sin itself, or of the being and principle of it in the soul, where it is, and lives, and dwells, and will as long as the saints are in this tabernacle, but of the deeds of the body, or of sinful actions, as to the life and conversation." 
2. "These members, or deeds of the body, or acts of sin, are called 'your': for as the old man is ours, the vitiosity of nature is what we bring into the world with us, and is rooted and incorporated into us; so the actions that flow from it, and are done by it, are not to be ascribed to God, nor even to Satan, but they are our own actions, and which are performed by the members of our mortal body, or by the faculties of our souls."
3. "The covetous man, and the idolater, worship the same for matter and substance, even gold and silver; the covetous man lays up his money, makes no use of it, as if it was something sacred; he looks at it, and adores it, and puts his trust and confidence in it, and his heart is so much set upon it, that he neglects the worship of the true God; and indeed no man can serve God and mammon."

### John Wesley:
1. "Mortify therefore â€” Put to death, slay with a continued stroke."
2. "Which together make up the body of sin."
3. "Covetousness â€” According to the derivation of the word, means the desire of having more, or of any thing independent on God."
