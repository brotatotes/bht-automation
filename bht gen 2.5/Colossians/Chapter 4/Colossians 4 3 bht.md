# Colossians 4:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Paul, as a prisoner, desired liberation so that he could speak the mystery of Christ. He asked for prayers that a door for the word would be opened, indicating the removal of hindrances in preaching the gospel. The figure of a door represents the difficulty of confidently speaking about the gospel. Paul's request for prayers shows the importance of intercessions from brethren and the difficulty of persevering in defending the gospel. The mystery of Christ is the central focus of the gospel, and Paul's imprisonment did not limit his activity in spreading it.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "This would, seeing that the Apostle was a prisoner, naturally be given first and most chiefly, as far as he was concerned, by his liberation."
2. "λαλῆσαι: inf. of purpose so that we may speak."
3. "διʼ ὃ κ. δ.: for (on account of) which (mystery) I am (not only a minister but) also bound."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "a door for the word." Not as in Ephesians 6:19, where power of "utterance" is his petition.
2. "the mystery of Christ" (Colossians 1:27).
3. "on account of which I am (not only 'an ambassador,' Colossians 1:27, but) ALSO in bonds."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "With all the supplications which you offer for other persons and things; or at the same time that you pray for them."
2. "To preach the gospel. He earnestly desired to have liberty to preach the gospel, and asked them to pray that this might be restored to him."
3. "Called in Ephesians 6:19, the 'mystery of the gospel;'"

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Door of utterance (quran tou logou). Rev., better, a door for the world." 
2. "There may be an allusion to a release from imprisonment."
3. "See also entering in, 1 Thessalonians 1:9; 1 Thessalonians 2:1. And the parallel passage, Ephesians 6:19."

### John Calvin:
1. "Who then, in the present day, would dare to despise the intercessions of brethren, which Paul openly declares himself to stand in need of?"
2. "As we have a signal example of modesty, in the circumstance that Paul calls others to his assistance, so we are also admonished, that it is a thing that is replete with the greatest difficulty, to persevere steadfastly in the defense of the gospel, and especially when danger presses."
3. "For he here intimates, by all elegant metaphor, that it is in no degree easier for us to speak confidently respecting the gospel, than to break through a door that is barred and bolted."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "That (indicating the purport and purpose of the petition) God would open onto us a door for the word."
2. "The figure is a natural one. In Ephesians 6:19, ‘utterance’ occurs; but here the reference is to the removal of the hindrances in the way of preaching the gospel, not to the opening of his mouth."
3. "In behalf of which I am also in bonds (have been and am bound). The imprisonment still continued, limiting, but not destroying his activity; comp. Ephesians 6:20: ‘I am an ambassador in a chain.’"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "At the same time."
2. "A door for preaching."
3. "The mystery which is Christ."

### John Gill:
1. "The apostle desires they would pray for him, and his fellow ministers, and which he says not in dissimulation, under a guise of humility, but in true humility and lowliness of mind."
2. "That whereas he could not go abroad to preach it, the hearts of men might be inclined to come to him, and hear it from his mouth; and that the door of their hearts might be opened, that they might attend unto it; that it might have an entrance into them, and a place in them."
3. "The Gospel, of which Christ is the author, preacher, sum, and substance; the whole of which is a mystery; the wisdom of God in a mystery; all the doctrines of it are mysteries."

### John Wesley:
1. "That God would open to us a door of utterance." 
2. "Give us utterance, that we 'may open our mouth boldly.'"
3. "Give us an opportunity of speaking, so that none may be able to hinder."
