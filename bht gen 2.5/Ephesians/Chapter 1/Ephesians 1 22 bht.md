# Ephesians 1:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Christ is the head over all things and the church is His body, filled with and exemplifying His fulness. He is given as the head over all things to the church for her advantage, ensuring that no weapon formed against it shall prosper. The giving of Christ to the church as its head is an honorable gift from God, to overrule all things for its good and perform all the good offices of a head. As the head, Christ provides guidance, government, life, and influence to the church and its members, who have a continual and effectual communication of activity, growth, and strength from Him.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "CHRIST is Head over all things: the Church is the BODY of Christ, and as such is the fulness of Him who fills all with all: the Head of such a Body, is Head over all things."
2. "The church, being the Body of Christ, is dwelt in and filled by God: it is His πλήρωμα in an especial manner - His fulness abides in it, and is exemplified by it."
3. "He is the Author and Giver of all things. The reference is, I think, to the Father, not to Christ. In ch. Ephesians 4:10, where Christ’s filling all things is spoken of, we have the active voice, denoting the bare objective fact: whereas here the reciprocal middle implies a filling for Himself, which can hardly be predicated of any but the Father."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "HIM He gave as Head over all things to the Church." 
2. "He is OVER ("far above") all things; in contrast to the words, "TO the Church," namely, for her advantage." 
3. "For the Head and body are not severed by anything intervening, else the body would cease to be the body, and the Head cease to be the Head."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The universe is under his control and direction for the welfare of his people."
2. "Earthly kings and rulers; kingdoms and nations are under his control."
3. "The church, therefore, is safe. All the great powers of heaven, earth, and hell, are made subject to its Head and King; and no weapon that is formed against it shall prosper."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Not merely set Him over the Church, but gave Him as a gift." 
2. "Him is emphatic: and Him He gave."
3. "The Church [τη εκκλησια]. See on Matthew 16:18."

### John Calvin:
1. "The apostle shews that it was not a mere honorary title, but was accompanied by the entire command and government of the universe."
2. "Since Christ alone is called 'the head,' all others, whether angels or men, must rank as members."
3. "The Church is His body, and, consequently, that those who refuse to submit to Him are unworthy of its communion; for on Him alone the unity of the Church depends."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The passage plainly says that Christ is given to the Church, and the next verse as plainly indicates that He is Head of the Church. What, then, is His relation to ‘all things?’ Evidently that of Head also."
2. "The word itself suggests two ideas: that the members are ‘called out,’ and that they form one assembly."
3. "Visible unity is the end, and will come from within rather than from without. Probably the truest unity is to be reached through the freest divergencies in externals."

3. "Gave to the church Christ as Head."

### John Wesley:
