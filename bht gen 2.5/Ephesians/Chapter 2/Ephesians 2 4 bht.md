# Ephesians 2:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
God, being rich in compassion and mercy, loved us with great love and saved us through His Son, Jesus Christ. Our spiritual life is the primary focus, including our participation in Christ's resurrection and exaltation. God's mercy is His wealth, and He is willing to impart it to us. His love led to the gift of a Savior and the bestowment of salvation. We begin to truly live when we are united with Christ and share in His life. This salvation is solely due to God's undeserved goodness and His great love for us.
