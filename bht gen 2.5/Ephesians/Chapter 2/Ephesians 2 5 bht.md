# Ephesians 2:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
There must be a spiritual resurrection of the soul before there can be a comfortable resurrection of the body. We are already seated in Christ and will be seated by Him in the future. Salvation is not something to be waited for in the future, but something that is already realized. Even when we were dead in sin, God, who is rich in mercy, has made us alive together with Christ. This resurrection is a result of God's grace, not our own works.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "God, who is rich in mercy, on account of the great love which he bare unto us, even being dead in sin, hath quickened us... It was love to the alienated and the lost. That is true love - the sincerest and the purest benevolence - love, not like that of people, but such only as God bestows." 
2. "The meaning is, that there was such a connection between Christ and those whom the Father hath given to him, that his resurrection from the grave involved their resurrection to spiritual life. It was like raising up the head and the members - the whole body together."
3. "By grace ye are saved - Paul’s mind was full of the subject of salvation by grace, and he throws it in here, even in an argument, as a point which he would never have them lose sight of."

### John Calvin:
1. "For when we were yet without strength, in due time Christ died, for the ungodly. — But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us." 
2. "Whether the words, by grace ye are saved, have been inserted by another hand, I know not; but, as they are perfectly agreeable to the context, I am quite willing to receive them as written by Paul."
3. "They show us that he always feels as if he had not sufficiently proclaimed the riches of Divine grace, and accordingly expresses, by a variety of terms, the same truth, that everything connected with our salvation ought to be ascribed to God as its author."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "When He was raised physically, all His people were raised ideally in Him; and in consequence of this connection with Him, they are, through faith, actually quickened and raised." 
2. "A past act with permanent results is indicated. The emphasis rests on the word 'grace,' love to the undeserving."
3. "This emphatic mention of grace (grace, not works) is to make the readers feel what their own hearts might otherwise have caused them to doubt, the real and vital truth, that they have present and actual fellowship with Christ, yea and even in the resurrectionary and glorifying power of God."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Even when we were dead (κα οντας ημας νεκρους). Repeats the beginning of verse Ephesians 2:1, but he changes υμας (you Gentiles) to ημας (us Jews)."
2. "Quickened us together with Christ (συνεζωοποιησεν τω Χριστω). First aorist active indicative of the double compound verb συνζωοποιεω as in Colossians 2:13 which see. Associative instrumental case in Χριστω. Literal resurrection in the case of Jesus, spiritual in our case as pictured in baptism."
3. "By grace have ye been saved (χαριτ εστε σεσωσμενο). Instrumental case of χαριτ and perfect passive periphrastic indicative of σωζω. Parenthetical clause interjected in the sentence. All of grace because we were dead."
