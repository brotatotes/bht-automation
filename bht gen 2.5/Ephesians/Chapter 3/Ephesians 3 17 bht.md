# Ephesians 3:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Christ is asked to make his home in our hearts, taking entire possession. This dwelling is not in our heads or tongues, but in our hearts, where no good thing dwells but Himself and His grace. To be rooted and grounded in love is to be firmly established, like a tree with deep roots, and founded, like a building on a foundation. Love is the fundamental grace, flowing from Christ's love realized in the soul, and it should be thoroughly fixed in our minds, resembling a well-founded building or deeply-planted tree.
