2. "The change lies not in the old man, who can never be altered, but in the conversation; he is not in the same power, but he retains the same sinful nature; he is put off, but he is not put out; and though he does not reign, he rages, and often threatens to get the ascendant."
3. "The old man, or the vitiosity of nature, has its lusts; and these are deceitful; they promise pleasure and profit, but yield neither in the issue; they promise liberty, and bring into bondage; they promise secrecy and impunity, but expose to shame, and render liable to punishment."

### John Wesley:
1. The old man ‚Äî That is, the whole body of sin. All sinful desires are deceitful; promising the happiness which they cannot give.
