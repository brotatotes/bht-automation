# Ephesians 4:27 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Do not give the devil an opportunity to work in your life by harboring anger and resentment. The devil is always looking for a chance to lead us into sin, and one way he does this is by tempting us to hold onto anger. By giving in to anger, we open ourselves up to the influence of Satan and hinder the work of God in our lives. It is important to guard our hearts and not allow the devil to gain a foothold.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "nor again (there is a slight climax: see below. The rec. μήτε would require that μή before should be capable of being taken as μήτε , which it clearly cannot, on account of its position after ὁ ἥλιος ) give scope (opportunity of action"
2. "which you would do by continuing in a state of παροργισμός"
3. "to the devil (not, to the slanderer , as Erasm., al.: διάβολος as a substantive always has this personal meaning in the N. T.; see reff.)."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. 27. Neither give place—that
	is, occasion, or scope, to the devil, by continuing in
	"wrath." The keeping of anger through the darkness of
	night, is giving place to the devil, the prince of darkness ( :-).


### Albert Barnes:
1. "Do not yield to the suggestions and temptations of Satan, who would take every opportunity to persuade you to cherish unkind and angry feelings, and to keep up a spirit of resentment among brethren."
2. "Many of our feelings, when we suppose we are merely defending our rights, and securing what is our own, are produced by the temptations of the devil."
3. "The devil is always busy when we are angry, and in some way, if possible, will lead us into sin; and the best way to avoid his wiles is to curb the temper, and restrain even sudden anger."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Place. Room.


### John Calvin:
1. "I am aware of the interpretation which some give of this passage. Erasmus, who translates it, 'neither give place to the Slanderer,' (calumniatori ,) shews plainly that he understood it as referring to malicious men."
2. "But I have no doubt, Paul’s intention was, to guard us against allowing Satan to take possession of our minds, and, by keeping in his hands this citadel, to do whatever he pleases."
3. "Before the poison of hatred has found its way into the heart, anger must be thoroughly dislodged."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Give place, give free play, room in the heart, to the devil, i.e., Satan."
2. "The clause gives a reason why sinful anger should be avoided: it opens to Satan the heart which has been redeemed from his power by Christ."
3. "It is doubtful if the word diabolos ever means simply slanderer, or blasphemer, when used as a noun."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Neither give place to the devil (μηδε διδοτε τοπον τω διαβολω)."
2. "Present active imperative in prohibition, either stop doing it or do not have the habit."
3. "See Romans 12:19 for this idiom."

### John Gill:
1. "Do not give place to the devil."
2. "Give such no room, nor reason, to calumniate the doctrine and ways of Christ."
3. "Do not give way to Satan."

### John Wesley:
1. Neither give place to the devil — By any delay.
