# Ephesians 5:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
We are called to have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather to reprove them. The works of darkness produce no benefit to the body or soul, and as believers, we are to abstain from giving any consent, advice, approbation, or assistance to such works. Our lives should be a standing rebuke of a sinful world, and we should be ready to express our disapproval of wickedness in every form. This includes oral rebuke, showing the immorality of such works and quickening the conscience of those involved. Avoiding fellowship with darkness is not enough; we are called to actively reprove and convict by shining the light of truth on the darkness.

### Henry Alford:
1. "and have no fellowship with (better than ‘ be not partakers in ,’ as De W., which would require a genitive)"
2. "the unfruitful works of darkness"
3. "but rather even reprove them"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Plants cannot bear 'fruit' in the absence of light. Sin is 'darkness,' and its parent is the prince of darkness."
2. "Graces, on the other hand, as flourishing in 'the light,' are reproductive, and abound in fruits; which, as harmoniously combining in one whole, are termed (in the singular) 'the FRUIT of the Spirit.'"
3. "'Have no fellowship,' does not imply that we can avoid all intercourse, but 'avoid such fellowship as will defile yourselves'; just as light, though it touch filth, is not soiled by it; nay, as light detects it, so, 'even reprove sin.'"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The unfruitful works - The deeds of darkness that produce no 'benefit' to the body or the soul."
2. "But rather reprove them - By your life, your conversation, and all your influence."
3. "Their lives should be a standing rebuke of a sinful world, and they should be ever ready to express their disapprobation of its wickedness in every form."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Have fellowship [συγκοινωνειτε]. Works which bring no blessing with them." 
2. "Unfruitful works [εργοις τοις ακαρποις]. Works which bring no blessing with them."
3. "Reprove [ελεγχετε]."

### John Calvin:
1. "It is not enough that we do not, of our own accord, undertake anything wicked. We must beware of joining or assisting those who do wrong."
2. "In short, we must abstain from giving any consent, or advice, or approbation, or assistance; for in all these ways we have fellowship."
3. "Rather than the truth of God shall not remain unshaken, let a hundred worlds perish."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "But rather even reprove them. To have no fellowship is not enough… ‘Reprove’ points to oral rebuke, such as shows the immorality of such works, quickens the conscience of the person doing them, with a view to his improvement."
2. "Some with less accuracy explain the word ‘convince by evidence,’ inferring that our duty is simply to let ‘the light of Divine truth shine into the darkened minds of men, and upon their evil deeds.’"
3. "The danger in the application of this command arises from wrong motives in the heart of the reprover, not from any too strict view of the sinfulness of the works of darkness."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Have no fellowship with...works." 
2. "Unfruitful...applied to darkness." 
3. "Reprove...convict by turning the light on the darkness."

### John Gill:
1. "The contrary is impracticable: conversation with them in things sinful and superstitious should be abstained from."
2. "Fellowship is not to be maintained 'with the works of darkness'; which are sins, so called, because they are opposite to light."
3. "It is contrary to the character of saints to have fellowship with such."

### John Wesley:
1. Reprove them — To avoid them is not enough.
