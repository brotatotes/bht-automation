# Ephesians 5:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Do not be intoxicated with wine, which leads to profligacy and excess. Instead, be filled with the Spirit, experiencing an ecstatic exhilaration like that caused by wine. This filling of the Spirit should result in a joy expressed through Christian hymns and continual thankfulness. The contrast between being drunk with wine and being filled with the Spirit is clear - one leads to worldly songs and debauchery, while the other leads to spiritual songs and a life of gratitude. Christians should abstain from intoxication and allow the Holy Spirit to fill them with His presence and joy.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "And (καί is subordinate, introducing a particular after a general: so Herod. i. 73, τῶνδε εἵνεκα καὶ γῆς ἱμέρῳ … see Hartung i. 145) be not intoxicated with wine, in which practice (not, ἐν οἴνῳ, but ἐν τῷ μεθύσκεσθαι οἴνῳ the crime is not in God’s gift, but in the abuse of it: and the very arrangement of the sentence, besides the spirit of it, implies the lawful use of wine see 1Ti 5:23) is profligacy." 
2. "But (contrast, see above) be filled (antith. to μεθύσκεσθε οἴνῳ; not to μεθύσκεσθε alone, so that ἐν πνεύματι should be opposed to οἴνῳ: see below) with (ἐν, as ch. Ephesians 1:23, but also ‘in:’ let this be the region in, and the ingredient with which you are filled) the Spirit."
3. "If this is so, if you are full of the Spirit, full in Spirit, there will be a joy indeed, but not that of ἀσωτία: one which will find its expression not in drunken songs, but in Christian hymns, and continual thankfulness."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The effect in inspiration was that the person was 'filled' with an ecstatic exhilaration, like that caused by wine."
2. "Hence arose the abstinence from wine of many of the prophets, for example, John the Baptist, namely, in order to keep distinct before the world the ecstasy caused by the Spirit, from that caused by wine."
3. "Such a one expresses his joy, not in drunken or worldly songs, but in Christian hymns of thankfulness."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "All intoxication is prohibited in the Scriptures - no matter by what means it is produced... Since therefore there is danger of intoxication in the use of wine, as well as in the use of ardent spirits, why should we not abstain from one as well as the other?"
2. "Wine is so frequently the cause of this, by the ungrateful abuse of the bounty of providence in giving it, that the enormity is represented by a very strong and beautiful 'figure' as contained in the very liquor."
3. "Let Christians, when about to indulge in a glass of wine, think of this admonition. Let them remember that their bodies should be the temple of the Holy Spirit, rather than a receptacle for intoxicating drinks."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Be not drunk [μη μεθυσκεσθε] . See on John 2:10. 
Wherein. In drunkenness, not in wine. 
Excess [ασωτια] . Rev., riot. Lit., unsavingness. See on riotous living, Luke 14:13.


### John Calvin:
1. "Be not intemperate in drinking."
2. "The meaning therefore is, that drunkards throw off quickly every restraint of modesty or shame; that where wine reigns, profligacy naturally follows; and consequently, that all who have any regard to moderation or decency ought to avoid and abhor drunkenness."
3. "This is a pleasant kind of drunkenness, which stimulates you, not to wanton dances or foolish songs, by which the Gentiles render homage to their deities, but to psalms, to hymns, to spiritual songs, by which you rejoice, and sing, and offer praise to the Lord, not with indecent roaring, as is the custom of drunk people, but inwardly in your minds and hearts."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Be not made drunk. To be taken literally, since the vice deserved then, and has ever since deserved, such special mention."
2. "The contrast is between the verbs, as the original indicate. 'Spirit' does not refer to the human spirit, but to the Holy Spirit, as dwelling in our spirit."
3. "The Christian's joy is not brief intoxication, but abiding exaltation in the fellowship of the Holy Spirit."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Be not drunken with wine... Forbidden as a habit and to stop it also if guilty." 
2. "Riot... in N.T. only here, Titus 1:6; 1 Peter 4:4."
3. "But be filled with the Spirit... In contrast to a state of intoxication with wine."

### John Gill:
1. "The sin of drunkenness here dehorted from, is a custom, or habit, of voluntary excessive drinking of any strong liquor, whereby the mind is disturbed, and deprived of the use of reason."
2. "Excessive drinking of it, and this voluntary, and with design, and on purpose; otherwise persons may be overtaken and intoxicated, through ignorance of the strength of the liquor, and their own weakness."
3. "They are filled with the Spirit, in whom his grace is a well of living water, and out of whose belly flow rivers of it; and who have a large measure of spiritual peace and joy."

### John Wesley:
1. "Wherein is excess — That is, which leads to debauchery of every kind."
2. "But be ye filled with the Spirit — In all his graces, who gives a more noble pleasure than wine can do."
