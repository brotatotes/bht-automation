# Ephesians 6:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The shield of faith is described as a large, oblong shield that intercepts and quenches all the fiery darts of the enemy. It conquers temptations and overcomes the world.

By relying on God's promises and aid, faith blunts the edge and quenches the heat of the enemy's attacks.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The shield of faith will certainly intercept, and so 'quench, all the fiery darts' (an image from the ancient fire-darts, formed of cane, with tow and combustibles ignited on the head of the shaft, so as to set fire to woodwork, tents, &c.)"
2. "Faith conquers him, and his darts of temptation to wrath, lust, revenge, despair, &c."
3. "It overcomes the world, and so the prince of the world."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Faith here is made to occupy a more important place than either of the other Christian graces. It bears, to the whole Christian character, the same relation which the shield does to the other parts of the armor of a soldier."
2. "As long as the soldier had his shield, he felt secure; and as long as a Christian has faith, he is safe. It comes to his aid in every attack that is made on him, no matter from what quarter; it is the defense and guardian of every other Christian grace; and it secures the protection which the Christian needs in the whole of the spiritual war."
3. "The only way to meet [the fiery darts of the wicked] is by the 'shield of faith;' by confidence in God, and by relying on his gracious promises and aid. It is not by our own strength; and, if we have not faith in God, we are wholly defenseless."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The shield here described is that of the heavy infantry; a large, oblong shield, four by two and a half feet, and sometimes curved on the inner side."
2. "Temptation is thus represented as impelled from a distance. Satan attacks by indirection - through good things from which no evil is suspected."
3. "Faith, in doing away with dependence on self, takes away fuel for the dart. It creates sensitiveness to holy influences by which the power of temptation is neutralized. It enlists the direct aid of God."

### John Calvin:
1. "He who possesses the excellencies of character which are here described is protected on every hand."
2. "If the word of God shall have its efficacy upon us through faith, we shall be more than sufficiently armed..."
3. "Faith will be found capable, not only of blunting their edge, but of quenching their heat."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "In the Christian armor 'faith' is the shield; and we should have this on all occasions."
2. "Faith entirely covers and defends the Christian."
3. "Quench all the fiery darts of the evil one, the personal Evil One."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The shield of faith...a large stone against the door in Homer, from Œ∏œÖœÅŒ±, door, large and oblong." 
2. "To quench...first aorist active infinitive of œÉŒ≤ŒµŒΩŒΩœÖŒº, old word, to extinguish." 
3. "All the fiery darts...sometimes ablaze in order to set fire to the enemies' clothing or camp or homes."

### John Gill:
1. "The grace of faith, which is like a golden shield, precious, solid, and substantial; and like a shield of mighty men, by which mighty things are done, and by which the believer not only repels, but conquers the enemy."
2. "The shield of faith is of use to quench the fiery darts of Satan's temptations; so that they may not have the malignant influence they are designed for; which is chiefly done by faith's dealing with the blood of Christ."
3. "And there were ways of quenching the fiery darts alluded to; which was done by skins and hides of beasts made wet, or anointed with alum."

### John Wesley:
1. "Continually exercise a strong and lively faith."
2. "Use [faith] as a shield, which will quench all the fiery darts, the furious temptations, violent and sudden injections of the devil."
3. "Faith...a sort of universal covering to every other part of the armour."
