# Galatians 1:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
There are two interpretations of this verse. One suggests that James, the Lord's brother, was an apostle but not necessarily one of the Twelve. The other interpretation suggests that James was an apostle in a broader sense, similar to Barnabas. The term brother could refer to a uterine brother or a step-brother of Jesus. The theory that James was the son of Alpheus is considered unlikely. It is widely agreed that James, the son of Mary and Cleophas, held a prominent position among the apostles and presided over the church in Jerusalem.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "This verse admits of two interpretations, between which other considerations must decide."
2. "That James, the Lordâ€™s brother, was one Ï„á¿¶Î½ á½°Ï€Î¿ÏƒÏ„ÏŒÎ»Ï‰Î½, but not necessarily of the Twelve."
3. "We must then adopt (2): which is besides in consonance with other notices respecting the term á¼€Ï€ÏŒÏƒÏ„Î¿Î»Î¿Ï‚, and the person heve mentioned."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The history speaks of 'apostles'; and Paul's mention of a second apostle, besides Peter, reconciles the Epistle and the history."
2. "James, the Lord's brotherâ€”This designation, to distinguish him from James the son of Zebedee, was appropriate while that apostle was alive."
3. "James was the Lord's brother, not in our strict sense, but in the sense, 'cousin,' or 'kinsman'."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "That the James here referred to was an apostle is clear."
2. "The whole construction of the sentence demands this supposition."
3. "It is probable that this was the James referred to here, as it is evident from the Acts of the Apostles that he was a prominent man among the apostles in Jerusalem."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Not, I saw none other of the apostles, but I saw James." 
2. "The Lord's brother means that James was a son of Joseph and Mary."
3. "The explanations [of the Lord's brothers] which differ from that of Helvidius have grown, largely, out of the desire to maintain the perpetual virginity of Mary."

### John Calvin:
1. "Almost all the ancients are agreed that he was one of the disciples, whose surname was 'Oblias' and 'The Just,' and that he presided over the church at Jerusalem."
2. "It appears to me, therefore, far more probable, that the person of whom he is speaking is the son of Alpheus."
3. "This is fully consistent with the opinion commonly held, that Alpheus or Cleopas was the husband of the sister of Mary, the mother of our Lord, and consequently that James, the son of Alpheus, was our Lordâ€™s cousin-german."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The exceptive words 'but only,' (or, 'if not,' 'save,' 'unless it be') do not necessarily imply that this James was one of the twelve Apostles, and identical with James the younger (who is called 'James the son of AlphÃ¦us'); but it intimates rather, in connection with what precedes, and with his characteristic title here given, that he was, like Barnabas (Acts 14:14; comp. Acts 9:27), an Apostle only in the wider sense, who, owing to his character, position, and relationship to the Lord, enjoyed apostolical authority."  
2. "â€˜Brotherâ€™ is not cousin (for which Paul has the proper Greek term, Colossians 4:10), but either a uterine brother, i.e., a younger son of Joseph and Mary (which is the most natural view; comp. the words â€˜tillâ€™ and â€˜first bornâ€™ in Matthew 1:25, and Luke 2:7); or a son of Joseph from a previous marriage, and hence a step-son of Mary and a step-brother of Jesus."
3. "The cousin-theory of the Roman church (dating from Jerome and Augustine at the close of the fourth century) is exegetically untenable, and was suggested chiefly by a doctrinal and ascetic bias in favor of the perpetual virginity of Mary and Joseph, The following reasons are conclusive against it and in favor of a closer relationship."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "James the brother of the Lord, is here termed an apostle, though not one of the twelve as Barnabas is later so called." 
2. "Paul is showing his independence of and equality with the twelve in answer to the attacks of the Judaizers."

### John Gill:
1. "This James was James the less, the son of Mary the wife of Cleophas...and so our Lord and this James were brothers' children, as was supposed."
2. "Persons in such a relation, and even uncles and nephews, were called brethren by the Jews."
3. "Christ had brethren or relations according to the flesh, distinct from his disciples and apostles, and his brethren among them."

### John Wesley:
1. "Other of the apostles I saw none, save James the brother (that is, the kinsman) of the Lord." 
2. "Therefore when Barnabas is said to have 'brought him into the apostles,' Acts 9:27, only St. Peter and St James are meant."
