## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "They were aware of the liberty in Christ which allowed them to eat with Gentiles, and had practised it: and now, being still aware of it, and not convinced to the contrary, from mere fear of man they adopted a contrary course."
2. "It was not now a question of using a liberty, but of asserting a truth, that of justification by the faith of Christ, and not by the works of the law."
3. "As exhibiting Peterâ€™s relation to James, and his fear of those who were of the circumcision, whose leader we should have naturally supposed him to have been."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "joined in hypocrisy," namely, in living as though the law were necessary to justification, through fear of man, though they knew from God their Christian liberty of eating with Gentiles, and had availed themselves of it already.
2. "It was not a question of liberty, and of bearing with others' infirmities, but one affecting the essence of the Gospel, whether the Gentiles are to be virtually 'compelled to live as do the Jews,' in order to be justified."
3. "Even Barnabas: one least likely to be led into such an error, being with Paul in first preaching to the idolatrous Gentiles: showing the power of bad example and numbers."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Those who had been converted to Christianity... would naturally regard [Peter] as a leader."
2. "They attempted to conceal from those who had come down from James the fact that they had been in the habit of associating with the Gentiles, and of eating with them."
3. "The fact... that the conduct of Peter was exciting so unhappy an influence as even to lead so worthy and good a man as [Barnabas] was into hypocrisy and error, made it the more proper that Paul should publicly notice and reprove the conduct of Peter."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Their act was hypocrisy, because it was a concealment of their own more liberal conviction, and an open profession of still adhering to the narrow Pharisaic view."
2. "It was 'a practical denial of their better spiritual insight' (Wieseler)."
3. "In Paul only here... on which see note."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "We have here no mere accommodation to weak brethren for the sake of charity and peace, but a duplicity and self-contradiction at the expense of truth."
2. "The logical tendency of this conduct was evidently to break up the communion of the two branches of the church."
3. "The word 'even' implies sadness arising from respect and affection."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "One example in Polybius means to pretend to act a part with. That idea here would help the case of the rest of the Jews, but does not accord with Paul's presentation."
2. "Was carried away with their dissimulation."
3. "It was a solemn moment when Paul saw the Jerusalem victory vanish and even Barnabas desert him as they followed the timid cowardice of Peter."

### John Gill:
1. "The Jews that were members of this church at Antioch...concealed their true sentiments, and acted the very reverse of them, and of their former conduct."
2. "So good a man as [Barnabas] was...yet so forcible was the example of Peter, and the other Jews, that, as with a mighty torrent, he was carried away with it, and not able to withstand it."
3. "Such is the force of example in men who are had in great veneration and esteem."

### John Wesley:
1. "Dissembled with him, so that even Barnabas was carried away with their dissimulation." 
2. "Was borne away, as with a torrent, into the same ill practice."
