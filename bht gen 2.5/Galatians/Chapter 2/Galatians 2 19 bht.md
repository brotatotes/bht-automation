# Galatians 2:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Through faith in Christ, Paul died to the law and was crucified with Christ. He no longer lived for himself, but Christ lived in him. This death to the law was a complete break, a severance from its power over him. The law had led Paul to Christ, but now he was dead to it and lived in faith in the Son of God. This death to the law was not for the purpose of living in sin, but to live unto God in a new life of obedience and gratitude.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "And this ἐγώ, as that in Romans 7:0, is purely and bona fide ‘I Paul;’ not ‘I and all believers’) by means of the law died to the law that I should live to God."
2. "I am (‘and have been,’ perf.) crucified with Christ: but it is no longer I that live, but (it is) Christ that liveth in me."
3. "I live in faith, viz. that of the Son of God who loved me and gave Himself up for me."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "For, proving his indignant denial of the consequence that 'Christ is the minister of sin' and of the premises from which it would follow. Christ, so far from being the minister of sin and death, is the establisher of righteousness and life." 
2. "I am entirely in Him."
3. "So by believing union to Christ in His death, we, being considered dead with Him, are severed from the law's past power over us."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He acted as though it were not; or it ceased to have influence over him."
2. "In this sense Paul was dead to the Law of Moses. He ceased to observe it as a ground of justification."
3. "He had become dead to it; see this sentiment more fully explained in the note at Romans 7:9."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "For am dead, render died. Faith in Christ created a complete and irreparable break with the law which is described as death to the law."
2. "The law itself was the instrument of this break, see next verse Egw is emphatic. Paul appeals to his personal experience, his decided break with the law in contrast with Peter's vacillation."
3. "With death to the law a new principle of life entered. For the phrase, see Romans 6:10, Romans 6:11."

### John Calvin:
1. "You deceive wretched men by the false notion, that they must live by the law; and, under that pretext, you keep them in the law."
2. "It is not to Christ...that the law is more hurtful than beneficial; but the law carries within itself the curse which slays us."
3. "He shews that the kind of death, on which the false apostles seized as a ground of quarrel, is a proper object of desire; for he declares that we are dead to the law, not by any means that we may live to sin, but that we may live to God."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The 'I' is here Paul himself, and not Peter. The law itself led him to Christ, so that it would be sinful and foolish to return to it again, as Peter did."
2. "The law is a schoolmaster to lead to Christ, by developing the sense of sin and the need of redemption. But the very object of a schoolmaster is to elevate the pupil above the need of his instruction and tuition."
3. "That I might live unto God, a new life of obedience to the law of Christ, and gratitude for the redeeming mercy of God. The death of the old man of sin is followed by the resurrection of the new man of righteousness."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "I through the law died to the law (εγω δια νομου νομω απεθανον). Paradoxical, but true."
2. "See Romans 7:4; Romans 7:6 for picture of how the law waked Paul up to his real death to the law through Christ."

### John Gill:
1. "He owns he was dead unto it, not in such sense as not to regard it as a rule of walk and conversation, but so as not to seek for life and righteousness by it."
2. "He became dead to the law, which says, do this and live."
3. "Now the end of his being dead unto it, delivered from it, and being directed to Christ for righteousness, was, says he, that I might live unto God."

### John Wesley:
1. "Applied by the Spirit to my heart, and deeply convincing me of my utter sinfulness and helplessness."
2. "To all hope of justification from it."
3. "Not continue in sin. For this very end am I, in this sense, freed from the law, that I may be freed from sin."
