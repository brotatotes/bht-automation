# Galatians 3:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
A man's covenant, once confirmed, cannot be annulled or supplemented by anyone else. This principle applies even more so to God's covenant, which is everlasting and cannot be changed. The covenant made with Abraham, based on faith, cannot be invalidated by the later introduction of the Law. If human contracts are binding, how much more so is God's covenant? The covenant between God and man is unchangeable and cannot have new conditions added to it. It is a firm and inviolable agreement that binds both parties to its faithful fulfillment.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "A (mere) man's covenant (not 'testament,' as Olsh., after Aug., al.; for there is here no introduction of that idea: the promise spoken to Abraham was strictly a covenant, and designated διαθήκη in the passages which were now in the Apostle's mind, see Genesis 15:18; Genesis 17:7."
2. "To make it 'even' and take it with ἀνθρώπου, is contrary to its usage."
3. "No one notwithstanding (that it is merely a human covenant) sets aside or supplements (with new conditions, Jos. Antt. xvii. 9. 4 describes Archelaus as ὁ ἐν ταῖς ἐπιδιαθήκαις ὑπὸ τοῦ πατρὸς ἐγγεγραμμένος βασιλεύς, 'in his father's subsequent testament:’ and again says of Antipas, B. J. ii. 2. 3, ἀξιῶν τῆς ἐπιδιαθήκης τὴν διαθήκην εἶναι κυριωτέραν, ἐν ᾗ βασιλεὺς αὐτὸς ἐγέγραπτο. Nothing is implied as to the nature of the additions, whether consistent or inconsistent with the original covenant: the simple fact that no additions are made, is enounced)."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "None does so who acts in common equity. Much less would the righteous God do so." 
2. "The promise is everlasting, and more peculiarly belongs to God."
3. "So legal Judaism could make no alteration in the fundamental relation between God and man."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "God cannot have two ways of justifying and saving people; and if he revealed a mode to Abraham, and that mode was by faith, then it could not be by the observance of the Law which was given so long after."
2. "But even that could not be annulled. How much less, therefore, could a covenant made by God be treated as if it were vain."
3. "No one can change it. No new conditions can be annexed; nor can there be any drawing back from its terms. It binds the parties to a faithful fulfillment of all the conditions."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Though a man's covenant yet no man disannulleth it."
2. "Yet a man's covenant confirmed no one disannulleth, etc."
3. "The doctrine of the Judaisers, while virtually annulling the promise, was apparently only the imposing of new conditions."

### John Calvin:
1. "It is highly disgraceful and base that the testimony of God should have less weight with us than that of a mortal man."
2. "Human contracts are admitted on all hands to be binding: how much more what God has established?"
3. "If human bargains be so firm that they can receive no addition, how much more must this covenant remain inviolable?"

### Philip Schaff:
1. "There is a touch of tenderness in the appeal here, as if to make amends for the severity of the foregoing rebuke."
2. "If even changeable men keep legal contracts sacred, how much more the unchangeable God."
3. "The designation of the ‘Old and New Testament’ (instead of ‘Covenant’) arose from this mistranslation, and is especially improper in the case of the Old Covenant (since God cannot die), but has become so well established that it must be retained."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "After the manner of men (κατα ανθρωπον). After the custom and practice of men, an illustration from life."
2. "Yet a man's covenant ratified."
3. "Both parties can by agreement cancel a contract, but not otherwise."

### John Gill:
1. "I speak after the manner of men; agreeably to a Talmudic form of speech in use among the Jews, 'the law speaks according to the language of the children of men', or 'after the manner of men." 
2. "If a covenant made between men, or a man's will and testament, be confirmed, signed, sealed, and witnessed, no other man can make them void, or take anything from them, or add anything to them, only the parties concerned by their own will and consent."
3. "If this be the case among men, much less can the covenant of God, confirmed by two immutable things, his word and oath, or his will and testament, or any branch of it, be ever disannulled, or be capable of receiving any addition thereunto."

### John Wesley:
1. "Though it be but a man's covenant, yet, if it be once legally confirmed, none - No, not the covenanter himself, unless something unforeseen occur." 
2. "which cannot be the case with God."
3. "Disannulleth, or addeth thereto — Any new conditions."
