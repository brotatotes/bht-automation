# Galatians 3:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The law was added because of transgressions, to make them more fully conscious of their sins and to emphasize the objective fact of righteousness. It was a preparatory dispensation for the Jewish nation, revealing sin as positive transgression and throwing it into contrast with the divine ideal. The law was not independent but subordinate to the promise and the work of the Mediator. It was given to make known transgressions, rouse men to the expectation of Christ, and restrain sin. The law was ordained by angels and delivered into the hand of Moses as a mediator.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The law, though misunderstood by the Judaizers as doing so, was really added for a different purpose, namely, 'because of (or as the Greek, 'for the sake of') the transgressions,' that is, to bring out into clearer view the transgressions of it... to make men more fully conscious of their 'sins,' by being perceived as transgressions of the law, and so to make them long for the promised Saviour." 
2. "The law was a preparatory dispensation for the Jewish nation, intervening between the promise and its fulfilment in Christ." 
3. "God delegated the law to angels as something rather alien to Him and severe. He reserved 'the promise' to Himself and dispensed it according to His own goodness."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The Law was not useless, but that it was given by God for great and important purposes, and especially for purposes closely connected with the fulfillment of the promise made to Abraham and the work of the Mediator."
2. "The whole arrangement of the Mosaic economy, including all his laws, was with reference to the Messiah. It was a part of a great and glorious whole. It did not stand by itself. It was incomplete and in many respects unintelligible until he came."
3. "The Law was wholly subordinate, and could not make the promise of no effect. It was not an independent scheme; not a thing that stood by itself; but a scheme subordinate and tributary, and wholly under the control of the Mediator, and a part of the plan of redemption."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "In order to set upon already existing sins the stamp of positive transgression of law."
2. "Its office was, in revealing sin as positive transgression, to emphasize the objective, actual, contrary fact of righteousness according to the divine ideal, and to throw sin into contrast with that grand ideal."
3. "This estimate of the law does not contradict Paul's assertions in Romans 7:12-25."

### John Calvin:
1. "The law was published in order to make known transgressions, and in this way to compel men to acknowledge their guilt."
2. "It means that the law was given in order to rouse men to the expectation of Christ."
3. "Since the beginning of the world, God has held no intercourse with men, but through the agency of his eternal Wisdom or Son."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The difficulty leads the Apostle to a profound exposition or the relation of the Mosaic to the Christian religion."
2. "It was superadded because of the transgressions."
3. "The disease of sin must reach the crisis before the restoration could take place."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "It was added because of transgressions... to make transgressions palpable."
2. "Till the seed should come."
3. "Ordained through angels... By the hand of a mediator."

### John Gill:
1. "it was added because of transgressions... for the sake of restraining transgressions... and also for the detecting, discovering, and making known transgressions"
2. "hence it is clear there can be no justification by it, and yet it is not useless and insignificant"
3. "Moses is the mediator here meant, who stood between God and the people of Israel; not to make peace between them, but to show the word of God from him to them"

### John Wesley:
1. "The moral law was added to the promise to discover and restrain transgressions, to convince men of their guilt, and need of the promise, and give some check to sin."
2. "And this law passeth not away; but the ceremonial law was only introduced till Christ, the seed to or through whom the promise was made, should come."
3. "And it was ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator - It was not given to Israel, like the promise to Abraham, immediately from God himself; but was conveyed by the ministry of angels to Moses, and delivered into his hand as a mediator between God and them, to remind them of the great Mediator."
