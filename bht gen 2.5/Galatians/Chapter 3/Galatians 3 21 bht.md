# Galatians 3:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Law and the promises are not in conflict with each other, as the Law does not have the power to give life or righteousness. The Law is an externally prescribed rule that cannot internally impart spiritual life to those who are dead in sin. If the Law had the ability to give life, then righteousness would have come through it. However, righteousness can only come through the promise to Abraham and its fulfillment in the Gospel of grace. Therefore, there is no antagonism between the Law and the promises.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The Law being thus set over against the promises, being given through a mediator between two, the promises by the one God, it might seem as if there were an inconsistency between them."
2. "Notwithstanding all the above features of contrast between the Law and the promises, it is not against them, for it does not pretend to perform the same office; if it did, then there would be this rivalry, which now does not exist."
3. "If life, the result, had been given by the law, then righteousness, the condition of life, must have been by it also: reasoning from the whole to its part."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The law, as an externally prescribed rule, can never internally impart spiritual life to men naturally dead in sin and change the disposition."
2. "If the law had been a law capable of giving life, 'verily righteousness would have been by the law.'"
3. "Righteousness can only come through the promise to Abraham and through its fulfillment in the Gospel of grace."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Is the Law of Moses to be regarded as opposed to the promises made to Abraham? Does this follow from any view which can be taken of the subject? The object of the apostle in asking this question is, evidently, to take an opportunity to deny in the most positive manner that there can be any such clashing or contradiction."
2. "God forbid - It cannot be. It is impossible. I do not hold such an opinion. Such a sentiment by no means follows from what has been advanced."
3. "The fact, therefore, that no one can be justified by the pure law revealed on Mount Sinai, forever settles the question about the possibility of being justified by law."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Does it follow from the difference between the law and the promises that they are in antagonism?" 
2. "If the law is against the promises, and makes them invalid, it follows that life must come through the law."
3. "The meaning is substantially the same with either reading: in the one case proceeding from, in the other residing in the law."

### John Calvin:
1. "Is the law then against the promises of God? The certainty and steadiness of the divine purpose being admitted, we are bound equally to conclude that its results are not contrary to each other."
2. "Who will now dare to imagine a disagreement between the law and the promises?"
3. "The law would be opposed to the promises, if it had the power of justifying; for there would be two opposite methods of justifying a man, two separate roads towards the attainment of righteousness."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "If the law had the power to break sin and to impart righteousness and life, it would indeed be a rival of the promise and enter into conflict with it."
2. "Make alive implies that we are spiritually dead by nature."
3. "But Paul maintains, in opposition to the vain conceit of the self-righteous Jews and Judaizing Christians, that the law condemns all alike."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Far from it (μη γενοιτο)."
2. "Which could make alive (ο δυναμενος ζωοποιησα)."
3. "Verily (οντως)."

### John Gill:
1. "The law requires as much of a dead sinner, as it did of Adam in innocence, but gives him no life, activity, and strength to perform."
2. "The law is subservient to the promises."
3. "The law disannuls the promises, but is subservient to them."

### John Wesley:
1. "But yet the law cannot give life, as the promise doth."
2. "If there had been a law which could have given life — Which could have entitled a sinner to life, God would have spared his own Son."
3. "Righteousness, or justification, with all the blessings consequent upon it, would have been by that law."
