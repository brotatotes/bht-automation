## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Is it the Apostle? or is it not rather GOD, and is not this indicated by the reference to Abraham‚Äôs faith in the next verse, and the taking up the passive ·ºêŒªŒøŒ≥ŒØœÉŒ∏Œ∑ by Œ¥ŒπŒ∫Œ±ŒπŒø·øñ ·ΩÅ Œ∏ŒµœåœÇ in Gal 3:8?"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "He who supplied and supplies to you the Spirit still, to the present time."
2. "These miracles do not prove grace to be in the heart."
3. "This cannot be because the law was then unknown to you when you received those gifts of the Spirit."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The gift of the Holy Spirit to them was not imparted in consequence of the observance of the Law of Moses, but in connection with the preaching of the gospel."
2. "The obvious reference, it seems to me, is to God, who had furnished or imparted to them the remarkable influences of the Holy Spirit, and this had been done in connection with the preaching of the gospel, and not by the observance of the Law."
3. "If, however, it refers to Paul, it means that he had been made the agent or instrument in imparting to them those remarkable endowments, and that this had been done by one who had not enforced the necessity of obeying the Law of Moses, but who had preached to them the simple gospel."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The gift of the Spirit, and the bestowment of miraculous powers, is a purely divine operation in believers, which is not merited by legal works, but can be received and experienced only through the message of faith."
2. "He that ministereth is God."
3. "Miracles: Either miracles, as Mark 6:2; 1 Corinthians 12:10, or miraculous powers, as 1 Corinthians 12:6; Philippians 2:13; Ephesians 2:2. The analogy of these latter passages favors the second meaning."

### John Calvin:
1. "All the gifts of the Holy Spirit... are the fruits of the gospel." 
2. "Their new teachers deprived them of those gifts when they left the gospel." 
3. "In proportion to the value which they attached to those gifts... they ought the more carefully and resolutely to adhere to the gospel."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The present tense ministereth and worketh is used to indicate the continued communication and abundant supply of the spiritual gifts."
2. "Paul probably means the moral miracles of regeneration and conversion."
3. "Others understand here physical miracles wrought ‚Äòamong you,‚Äô i.e., in the midst of you."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Supplieth. It is God."
2. "Worketh miracles. It is a great word for God's activities."
3. "The principal verb for 'doeth he it' is not expressed."

### John Gill:
1. "He therefore that ministereth to you the Spirit,.... By whom he means not himself, nor any other minister of the Gospel, in whose power it does not lie to minister the Spirit..."
2. "...the folly and stupidity of the members of this church, who had not only received through the Gospel the Spirit, as a spirit of regeneration, at least many of them, but had seen the Gospel confirmed by the extraordinary gifts, signs, and wonders of the Holy Ghost..."
3. "...these extraordinary gifts of the Spirit, and these miracles done among them, did not attend the preaching of the law, or the doctrine of justification by works, taught by the false apostles, but the doctrine of faith, of justification by faith in the righteousness of Christ..."

### John Wesley:
1. "And, at the present time, Doth he that ministereth the gift of the Spirit to you, and worketh miracles among you, do it by the works of the law..." 
2. "That is, in confirmation of his preaching justification by works, or of his preaching justification by faith?"
3. "Do it by the works of the law..."
