In Galatians, Ishmael mocked Isaac, displaying pride and jealousy. This mirrors the persecution of believers justified by grace through faith by legalistic Judaizers.

This serves as a reminder that the persecution of believers by those who reject God's grace is a recurring pattern throughout history.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "And Sarah saw the son of Hagar … מְצַחֵק’ (παίζοντα μετὰ Ἰσαὰκ τοῦ υἱοῦ αὐτῆς, LXX); and some deny that צָחַק ever means ‘he mocked.' But certainly it does: see Genesis 19:14."
2. "τὸν κατὰ πνεῦμα, sc. γεννηθέντα, him that was born after the Spirit, i.e. in virtue of the promise, which was given by the Spirit."
3. "οὕτως καὶ νῦν] 'nec quicquam est quod tam graviter animos nostras vulnerare debeat, quam Dei contemptus, et adversus ejus gratiam ludibria: nec ullum magis exitiale est persequutionis genus, quam quum impeditur animæ salus.' Calv."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Being the older by natural birth, he haughtily prided himself above him that was born by promise: as Cain hated Abel's piety."
2. "The language, though referring primarily to Isaac, born in a spiritual way... is so framed as especially to refer to believers justified by Gospel grace through faith, as opposed to carnal men, Judaizers, and legalists."
3. "The Jews persecuted Paul, not for preaching Christianity in opposition to heathenism, but for preaching it as distinct from Judaism."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The persecution here referred to, was the injurious treatment which Isaac received from Ishmael, or the opposition which subsisted between them."
2. "Christians, the children of the promise, are persecuted by the Jews, the inhabitants of Jerusalem, 'as it now is,' and who are uninterested in the promises, as Ishmael was."
3. "The persecutions of the Christians arose, therefore, mainly from the Jews, from those who were in bondage to the Law, and to rites and customs; and Paul’s allusion here to the case of the persecution which Isaac the free-born son endured, is exceedingly pertinent and happy."

### John Calvin:
1. "There cannot then be a doubt that he maliciously endeavored to provoke the child Isaac by reproachful language."
2. "No persecution ought to distress us so much as to see our calling attempted to be undermined by the reproaches of wicked men."
3. "Nothing ought to wound our minds so deeply as contempt of God, and reproaches cast upon His grace: nor is there any kind of persecution more deadly than when the salvation of the soul is assailed."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Persecuted him. According to the Hebrew text, Genesis 21:9, Ishmael was simply ‘laughing’ or ‘mocking’ at the festival in honor of the weaning of Isaac; whereupon Sarah said unto Abraham: ‘Cast out this bondwoman and her son.'"
2. "This insolence was repeated in the aggressions of the Arab tribes, especially the Hagarenes on the Israelites (Psalms 83:7; 1 Chronicles 5:10; 1 Chronicles 5:19), and on a still grander scale in the persecutions of the Mohammedans against Jews and Christians."
3. "So now the Christian church which is born of the Spirit, is persecuted by the Jewish synagogue which is born after the flesh."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Persecuted (εδιωκεν). Imperfect active of διωκω, to pursue, to persecute."
2. "Genesis 21:9 has in Hebrew 'laughing,' but the LXX has 'mocking.'"
3. "So now (ουτος κα νυν) the Jews were persecuting Paul and all Christians (1 Thessalonians 2:15)."

### John Gill:
1. "There is nothing but flesh in them; they are without God, and Christ, and the Spirit, and have neither true faith, nor hope, nor love, not any other grace."
2. "The carnal Jews, who trusted in themselves that they were righteous, and despised others, persecuted the spiritual seed that believed in Christ, both by words and deeds."
3. "Though there is no persecution of men's persons and estates, yet there never was a greater persecution of the doctrines of grace, and of the righteousness of Christ, and the saints more mocked at and derided for maintaining them."

### John Wesley:
1. "But as then, he that was born after the flesh persecuted him that was born after the Spirit, so it is now also." 
2. "And so it will be in all ages and nations to the end of the world."
