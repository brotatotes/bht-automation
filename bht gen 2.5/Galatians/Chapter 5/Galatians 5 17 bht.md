# Galatians 5:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The desires of the flesh and the Spirit are in constant opposition to one another, preventing either from being fully carried out. This conflict is like a tug of war or a spiritual duel, with each principle working to prevent the other from accomplishing its desires. The inclinations and desires of the flesh are contrary to those of the Spirit, and they can never harmonize. This conflict between reason and appetite, between conscience and depravity, is present in every person who is awakened to a sense of duty and responsibility. However, this struggle is also a sign of regeneration and a state of grace, with the Spirit ultimately winning the victory.
