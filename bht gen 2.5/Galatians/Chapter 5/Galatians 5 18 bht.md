# Galatians 5:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
By submitting to the teachings and guidance of the Holy Spirit, believers are no longer under the control of the Mosaic law but are under a different dispensation - the dispensation of the Spirit. The Spirit leads and guides believers as moral and responsible beings, freeing them from the restraints and control of the law. This freedom allows believers to fulfill the law of love and transforms the law from a yoke for trembling slaves into a rule for loving and grateful children and freemen. Through the Spirit, believers are led into greater degrees of grace and ultimately to glory, experiencing deliverance from the guilt and power of sin.
