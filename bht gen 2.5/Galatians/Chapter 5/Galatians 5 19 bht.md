## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "œÜŒ±ŒΩŒµœÅŒ¨ (emphatic), plain to all, not needing, like the more hidden fruits of the Spirit, to be educed and specified: and therefore more clearly amenable to law, which takes cognizance of œÑ·Ω∞ œÜŒ±ŒΩŒµœÅŒ¨."
2. "Etym. Mag. It does not seem to include necessarily the idea of lasciviousness: "Demosthenes, making mention of the blow which Meidias had given him, characterizes it as in keeping with the well-known ·ºÄœÉŒ≠ŒªŒ≥ŒµŒπŒ± of the man (Meid. 514). Elsewhere he joins Œ¥ŒµœÉœÄŒøœÑŒπŒ∫·ø∂œÇ and ·ºÄœÉŒµŒªŒ≥·ø∂œÇ and œÄœÅŒøœÄŒµœÑ·ø∂œÇ." Trench, New Test. Synonyms, p. 64."
3. "The best word for it seems to be wantonness, 'protervitas.'"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The hidden fleshly principle betrays itself palpably by its works, so that these are not hard to discover, and leave no doubt that they come not from the Spirit."
2. "The results of the flesh are not dignified by the name 'fruit'; they are but works."
3. "This passage shows that 'the flesh' does not mean merely sensuality, as opposed to spirituality: for 'divisions' in the catalogue here do not flow from sensuality."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The world is full of illustrations of what corrupt human nature produces."
2. "It is evident here that the word œÉŒ±ÃÄœÅŒæ sarx, 'flesh,' is used to denote corrupt human nature, and not merely the body."
3. "If the word, therefore, is used to denote human nature, the passage furnishes a sad commentary on its tendency, and on the character of man."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "You have a clearly defined standard by which to decide whether you are led by the Spirit or by the flesh."
2. "Adultery [ŒºŒøŒπœáŒµŒπŒ±]. To be dropped from the text."
3. "Uncleanness [Œ±Œ∫Œ±Œ∏Œ±œÅœÉŒπŒ±]. See on 1 Thessalonians 2:3. Lasciviousness [Œ±œÉŒµŒªŒ≥ŒµŒπŒ±]. See on Mark 7:22."

### John Calvin:
1. "If men knew themselves, they would not need this inspired declaration, for they are nothing but flesh; but such is the hypocrisy belonging to our natural state, we never perceive our depravity till the tree has been fully made known by its fruits."
2. "Anger and hatred differ chiefly in this, that anger is short, and hatred is lasting."
3. "He says that these works are manifest, so that no man may think that he will gain anything by evading the question; for what avails it to deny that the flesh reigns in us, if the fruit betrays the quality of the tree?"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Sensual sins like fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness prevailed in heathenism."
2. "Idolatry and witchcraft, the sorcerers monopolized the word for a while in their magical arts."
3. "Personal relations expressed by eight words, all old words, sins of the spirit, like enmities, strife, jealousies, wraths, factions, divisions, heresies, envyings."

### John Gill:
1. "By 'flesh' is meant corrupt nature, as before, and by the works of it, not only external acts of sin, but inward lusts."
2. "A clear case it is, that they are contrary to the Spirit, both to the Spirit of God, and to the principle of grace he forms in the heart."
3. "Lasciviousness or wantonness, all lustful dalliance, everything that leads on to acts of uncleanness, or attends them, as impure words, filthy gestures, and the like."

### John Wesley:
1. "Works are mentioned in the plural because they are distinct from, and often inconsistent with, each other." 
2. "But 'the fruit of the Spirit' is mentioned in the singular, Galatians 5:22, as being all consistent and connected together."
3. "Lasciviousness ‚Äî The Greek word means anything inward or outward that is contrary to chastity, and yet short of actual uncleanness."
