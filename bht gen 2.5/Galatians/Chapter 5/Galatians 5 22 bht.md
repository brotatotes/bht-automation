3. "peace with God in a man's own conscience, produced there by the Spirit of God, in consequence of peace being made by the blood of Christ... peace with men, with the saints, and with all others; for such who are under a work of the Spirit of God, and are influenced and led by him, seek after the things which make for peace and edification among the brethren, and are desirous if possible to live peaceably with all men"

### John Wesley:
1. "Love - The root of all the rest."
