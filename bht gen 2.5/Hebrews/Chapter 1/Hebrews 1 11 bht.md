### Henry Alford:
1. "Thou remainest...and thy years shall not fail."
2. "They all shall wax old as a garment."
3. "To them only can be referred the following image, ὡσεὶ περιβόλαιον ἑλίξεις αὐτούς."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "They—The earth and the heavens in their present state and form 'shall perish'... 'Perish' does not mean annihilation."
2. "'Perish'... just as it did not mean so in the case of 'the world that being overflowed with water, perished' under Noah."
3. "The covenant of the possession of the earth was renewed with Noah and his seed on the renovated earth. So it shall be after the perishing by fire."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He that created the universe by a word, can destroy it by a word and he that formed the present frame of nature can cause it to be succeeded by another not less wonderful and glorious."
2. "Let us not be alarmed then at any revolution. Let us not fear though we should see the heavens rolled up as a scroll, and the stars falling from their places. God, the Creator and the Redeemer, presides over all. He is unchanged."
3. "The heavens here are compared to a garment, meaning that as that grows old and decays, so it will be with the heavens and the earth. The language is evidently figurative; and yet who can tell how much literal truth there may be couched under it?"

### Marvin Vincent:
1. They [αυτοι] . The heavens : not heaven and earth. 
Remainest [διαμενεις] . Note the present tense : not shalt remain. Permanency is the characteristic of God in the absolute and eternal present.


### Philip Schaff:
1. Hebrews 1:11. They all, i.e the heavens and the earth. The language and the imagery are taken largely from Isaiah 34:4; Isaiah 51:6.

### John Gill:
1. "But thou remainest; without any change or alteration, neither in his natures, divine or human, as God or man, nor in his office as Mediator; as a priest, he has an unchangeable priesthood, and ever lives to make intercession; as a King, his kingdom is an everlasting one, and of it there will be no end; and as a prophet, he will be the everlasting light, of his people."
2. "They all shall wax old as doth a garment; garments in time wax old, and lose their beauty and usefulness, unless when a miracle is wrought, as in the case of the children of Israel in the wilderness."
3. "The present form and fashion of them shall pass away; the curse will be removed from them, and they will be renewed and purified, but the substance of them will continue; otherwise there would be no place, either for the righteous or the wicked."
