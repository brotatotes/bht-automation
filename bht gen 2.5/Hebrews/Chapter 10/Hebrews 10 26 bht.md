# Hebrews 10:26 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The warning is directed towards those who deliberately abandon Christianity for Judaism, rejecting the sacrifice of Christ. This sin is committed by real converts who have received the knowledge of the truth and consciously choose to turn away from it. By doing so, they shut the door of repentance behind them and there is no other sacrifice for sins that can save them. This deliberate rejection of the only atonement made for sin leaves them in a desperate and hopeless state, with no possibility of being saved.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "It is most important here to keep this cardinal point distinctly in mind: that the ·ºëŒ∫ŒøœÖœÉŒØœâœÇ ·ºÅŒºŒ±œÅœÑŒ¨ŒΩŒøŒΩœÑŒµœÇ are not mere professors of religion, but real converts..."
2. "For there is but One true sacrifice for sins: if a man, having availed himself of that One, then deliberately casts it behind him, there is no second left for him."
3. "...in proportion to his willing rejection of it, has it ceased to operate for him. He has in fact, as Del. observes, shut the door of repentance behind him, by the very fact of his being in an abiding state of willing sin."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "A violation not only of the law, but of the whole economy of the New Testament."
2. "Such sinning, where a consciousness of Gospel obligations not only was, but is present."
3. "For there is but ONE Sacrifice that can atone for sin; they, after having fully known that sacrifice, deliberately reject it."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "If after we are converted and become true Christians we should apostatize, it would be impossible to be recovered again, for there would be no other sacrifice for sin; no way by which we could be saved."
2. "The sentiment would not be correct if it referred to any but real Christians. It would not be true that one who had been somewhat enlightened, and who then sinned 'wilfully,' must look on fearfully to the judgment without a possibility of being saved."
3. "Should a man [deliberately break away from the restraints and obligations of the Christian religion], there is no sacrifice for sins which could save him. He would have rejected deliberately the only atonement made for sin, and there will be no other made."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The willful sin is the abandonment of Christianity for Judaism."
2. "The truth is the revelation through Christ."
3. "Of course not. For the Levitical sacrifices are abolished. It is Christ's sacrifice or none."

### John Calvin:
1. "Those who sin, mentioned by the Apostle, are not such as offend in any way, but such as forsake the Church, and wholly alienate themselves from Christ."
2. "He denies, then, that any sacrifice remains for them who renounce the death of Christ, which is not done by any offense except by a total renunciation of the faith."
3. "The clause, 'after having received the knowledge of the truth,' was added for the purpose of aggravating their ingratitude; for he who willingly and with deliberate impiety extinguishes the light of God kindled in his heart has nothing to allege as an excuse before God."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The willing sinner is one who will sin."
2. "Nor is it a single act that is denounced, but a permanent state, continuance in a sinful course, and such continuance as implies apostasy."
3. "They rejected that one sacrifice which completed and ended the sacrifices of the ancient Law, against their better knowledge, and resolved to return to their former sinful life; and for them there is no longer remaining any sacrifice for sin."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "If we sin wilfully (ŒµŒ∫ŒøœÖœÉŒπœâœÇ Œ±ŒºŒ±œÅœÑŒ±ŒΩŒøŒΩœÑœâŒΩ Œ∑ŒºœâŒΩ)."
2. "After that we have received (ŒºŒµœÑŒ± œÑŒø ŒªŒ±Œ≤ŒµŒπŒΩ)."
3. "There remaineth no more (ŒøœÖŒ∫ŒµœÑ Œ±œÄŒøŒªŒµŒπœÄŒµœÑŒ±)."

### John Gill:
1. "It intends a total apostasy from the truth, against light and evidence, joined with obstinacy."
2. "After men have embraced and professed the truths of the Gospel, and particularly this great truth of it, that Jesus Christ is the only Saviour of men by his blood and sacrifice; and yet after this, against all evidence, all the light and convictions of their own consciences, they wilfully deny this truth, and obstinately persist in the denial of it."
3. "Seeing there is no more, no other sacrifice for sin, no other Saviour, nor any salvation in any other way, the case of these men must be desperate; there is no help for them, nor hope of them; for by this their sin they shut up against themselves, in principle and practice, the way of salvation."

### John Wesley:
1. "After having received the experimental knowledge of the gospel truth, there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins." 
2. "None but that which we obstinately reject."
