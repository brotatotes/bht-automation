# Hebrews 12:26 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The voice of God at Mount Sinai shook the earth, and the author applies it to the first advent of Jesus Christ. However, the shaking mentioned here goes beyond the physical earth and includes the heavens as well. This signifies the complete shaking that will occur at the second coming of Christ, with prodigies in the world of nature accompanying the overthrow of all kingdoms that oppose Him. The introduction of the gospel was a momentous event, and apostatizing from it is more fearful and dangerous than apostatizing from the Law. Ultimately, this points to the second coming of Jesus Christ for judgment.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "whose voice (see on last verse) shook the earth then"
2. "and I will shake not only the earth, but also the heaven"
3. "the best treasures of all nations should be brought to adorn that temple"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The announcement of His coming to break up the present order of things, is to the ungodly a terror, to the godly a promise, the fulfilment of which they look for with joyful hope."
2. "The shaking began at the first coming of Messiah; it will be completed at His second coming, prodigies in the world of nature accompanying the overthrow of all kingdoms that oppose Messiah."
3. "The two advents of Messiah are regarded as one, the complete shaking belonging to the second advent, of which the presage was given in the shakings at the first advent: the convulsions connected with the overthrow of Jerusalem shadowing forth those about to be at the overthrow of all the God-opposed kingdoms by the coming Messiah."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The apostle evidently applies this passage as it is done in Haggai, to the first advent of the Redeemer."
2. "The apostle lays emphasis on the fact that not only the earth was to be shaken but also heaven."
3. "The introduction of the gospel was a much more solemn and momentous thing than the giving of the Law - and that, therefore, it was much more fearful and dangerous to apostatize from it."

### John Calvin:
1. "He quotes on the subject the testimony of the Prophet Haggai, though he gives not the words literally; but as the Prophet foretells a future shaking of the earth and the heaven, the Apostle borrows the idea in order to teach us that the voice of the Gospel not only thunders through the earth, but also penetrates above the heavens." 
2. "But if at the commencement of Christâ€™s kingdom, not only the lower parts of the world were shaken, but his power also reached the heaven, the Apostle justly concludes that the doctrine of the Gospel is sublimer than that of the Law, and ought to be more distinctly heard by all creatures."
3. "The whole Jewish polity, civil and religious, is generally supposed to be intended here. But as the shaking of the nations is mentioned in Haggai 2:6, Macknight thought that by 'the earth' is meant heathen idolatry, and by 'heaven' the Jewish economy, so called because it was divinely appointed. If this be allowed, then we see a reason for the change which the Apostle has made in the words: the original is both in Hebrew and in the Sept., 'I shake (or will shake) the heaven and the earth;' but the Apostle says: 'I shake not only the earth, but the heaven also.'"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "He hath promised and it still holds."
2. "The author applies this 'yet once more' and the reference to heaven to the second and final 'shaking' at the Second Coming of Jesus Christ for judgement."
3. "The Second Coming of Jesus Christ for judgement."

### John Gill:
1. "Whose voice then shook the earth,.... That is, at the giving of the law on Mount Sinai."
2. "This shook the earth, Sinai, and the land about it, and the people on it; which made them quake and tremble."
3. "Not only the land of Judea, and particularly Jerusalem, and the inhabitants of it, who were all shaken, and moved, and troubled at the news of the birth of the Messiah, the desire of all nations."

### John Wesley:
1. "But now â€” With regard to his next speaking."
2. "It is a joyful promise to the saints, though dreadful to the wicked."
3. "This universal shaking began at the first coming of Christ. It will be consummated at his second coming."
