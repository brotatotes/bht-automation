# Hebrews 12:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
God's love for His children is demonstrated through His discipline and correction. He chastens and scourges every son whom He receives, showing His fatherly care and watchful love. This discipline is a proof of His love and a means of shaping His children into holiness. It is a hard lesson for God's children to learn and understand, but it is a universal rule that trials and suffering are sent by God to those whom He truly loves. Through His discipline, God accepts His children and admits them to the privileges of sonship.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "For whom the Lord loveth, He chasteneth, yea, and scourgeth every son whom He receiveth." - Hebrews 12:6
2. "The LXX, instead of כְּאָב , have expressed כֵּאֵב , the Pihel of כָּאֵב ‘to feel pain,’ and have taken it as = ‘to cause pain,’ as the Hiphil הִכְאִיב occurs sometimes...Certainly by this rendering the parallelism with the first hemistich, and the whole expression, gain in completeness, whereas according to the Masoretic punctuation there is an appearance of lameness about it."
3. "For the translation of כֵּאֵב by μαστιγοῦν, to scourge, to whip, instead of generally to punish."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "and—Greek, 'yea and,' 'and moreover'; bringing out an additional circumstance."
2. "scourgeth—which draws forth 'blood' (Hebrews 12:4)."
3. "receiveth—accepts. Takes to Himself as a son 'in whom He delighteth' (Proverbs 3:12)."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It means that it is a universal rule that God sends trials on those whom he truly loves."
2. "The very fact that he corrects us shows that he has toward us a father’s feelings, and exercises toward us a paternal care."
3. "The meaning is the same as in the former part of the verse, that every one who becomes a child of God is treated by him with that watchful care which shows that he sustains toward him the paternal relation."

2. "Admits to filial privileges : acknowledges as his own."
3. "Of adopting or approving customs."

### John Calvin:
1. "For whom the Lord loveth, etc. This seems not to be a well­founded reason; for God visits the elect as well as the reprobate indiscriminately, and his scourges manifest his wrath oftener than his love; and so the Scripture speaks, and experience confirms."
2. "Let us then remember that the taste of God’s love towards us cannot be had by us under chastisements, except we be fully persuaded that they are fatherly scourges by which he chastises us for our sins."
3. "For when the faithful see that God interposes in their punishment, they perceive a sure pledge of his love, for unless he loved them he would not be solicitous about their salvation."

### Philip Schaff:

2. "This is a hard lesson for God's children to learn and to understand." 
3. "See Hebrews 5:7 about Jesus."

### John Gill:
1. "Now these are chastened by him, and loved while they are chastened; their chastening is in love, as appears from the nature of God's love to them, which changes not."
2. "From the ends of it, which are, among others, that they might be more and more partakers of holiness, and not be condemned with the world."
3. "Such are received by God into his heart's love and affection, with complacency and delight; and into the covenant of his grace, to share all the blessings and promises of it."
