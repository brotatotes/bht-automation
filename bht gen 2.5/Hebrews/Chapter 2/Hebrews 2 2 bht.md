## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "For if the word which was spoken by means of angels was made binding, and every transgression and disobedience received just recompense of reward."
2. "The law was introduced by the mere subordinate messengers of God, but was enforced with strict precision: how much more shall they be punished who reject that Gospel, which was brought in by the Son of God Himself, and continues to be confirmed to us by God‚Äôs present power."
3. "The law was so established, that the transgression of it, so as to disannul the terms and conditions of it, had by divine constitution the punishment of death temporal, or excision, appointed unto it."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "When it is said, Galatians 3:19- :, 'God spake,' it is meant He spake by angels as His mouthpiece..."
2. "The Gospel was first spoken by the Lord alone."
3. "Transgression is by doing evil; disobedience is by neglecting to do good."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It was indeed given by Yahweh, but it was the common opinion of the Hebrews that it was by the ministry of angels."
2. "It was not safe to violate it, but it took notice of the slightest failure to yield perfect obedience to its demands."
3. "The slightest infraction of the Law was sure to be punished. It made no provision for indulgence in sin; it demanded prompt, implicit, and entire obedience."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The O. T. is made to furnish proof that such subordination is inconsistent with man's ultimate destiny to sovereignty over all creation."
2. "The abolition of the old limitations is the emancipation of man from subordination to the angels."
3. "The word spoken by angels...realized itself in the event as securely founded in the divine holiness, and eternal in its principles and obligations."

### John Calvin:
1. "Steadfast, or 'firm,' or sure, etc.; that is, it was the word of authority, for God required it to be believed."
2. "Firmness means authority."
3. "The doctrine of which God shows himself to be the avenger is by no means unprofitable or unimportant."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "If the attendance of angels at the giving of the Law added force and dignity to the precepts of that economy, how much greater is the honour and the authority of the Gospel which was given by Him whom angels worship and serve."
2. "The ministration of angels in giving the Law is referred to as a mark of the inferiority of the law."
3. "Recompence of reward is a happy tautology. What is given back to a man in return for what he has done, whether good or bad, is the meaning of the Greek, as it is the meaning of both expressions in old English."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "For if ... proved steadfast (Œµ Œ≥Œ±œÅ ... ŒµŒ≥ŒµŒΩŒµœÑŒø Œ≤ŒµŒ≤Œ±ŒπŒøœÇ). Condition of first class, assumed as true."
2. "Through angels (Œ¥Œπ' Œ±Œ≥Œ≥ŒµŒªœâŒΩ). Allusion to the use of angels by God at Sinai as in Acts 7:38; Acts 7:53; Galatians 3:19, though not in the O.T., but in Josephus (Ant. XV. 156)."
3. "Recompense of reward (ŒºŒπœÉŒ∏Œ±œÄŒøŒ¥ŒøœÉŒπŒ±ŒΩ). Late double compound, like ŒºŒπœÉŒ∏Œ±œÄŒøŒ¥ŒøœÑŒ∑œÇ (Hebrews 11:6), from ŒºŒπœÉŒ∏ŒøœÇ (reward) and Œ±œÄŒøŒ¥ŒπŒ¥œâŒº, to give back. The old Greeks used ŒºŒπœÉŒ∏ŒøŒ¥ŒøœÉŒπŒ±."

### John Gill:
1. "This is called 'the word', and a terrible one it was; it was a voice of words, which they that heard entreated they might hear no more."
2. "And this was 'steadfast'; firm, and sure, being the word of God, which cannot pass away, until it be fulfilled."
3. "Every precept of the law had a penalty annexed to it; and every breach of it was punished as that penalty required; and that according to the strict justice of God, and the just demerit of sin; and none escaped, but suffered the punishment due to the violation of the precept either in themselves, or in their surety."

### John Wesley:
1. "In giving the law, God spoke by angels; but in proclaiming the gospel, by his Son." 
2. "Steadfast ‚Äî Firm and valid." 
3. "Every transgression ‚Äî Commission of sin. Every disobedience ‚Äî Omission of duty."
