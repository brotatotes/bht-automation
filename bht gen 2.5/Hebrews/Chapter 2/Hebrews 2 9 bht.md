Jesus, through His suffering and death, was exalted and crowned with glory and honor. His exaltation is the consummation of His work for us, making His death effective for every person. He tasted death Himself to encourage us to be bold in facing it. His exaltation over the angels was achieved through His humiliation and death. By becoming lower than the angels and experiencing death, Jesus conquered death and was glorified. His death on the cross was for the redemption of every person, and through His grace, He tasted death for all.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "His exaltation after sufferings is the perfecting or consummation of His work for us: without it His death would have been ineffectual; with it, and from it, flows the result that His tasting of death is available for every man." 
2. "He is crowned as the Head in heaven of our common humanity, presenting His blood as the all-prevailing plea for us."
3. "As a physician first tastes his medicines to encourage his sick patient to take them, so Christ, when all men feared death, in order to persuade them to be bold in meeting it, tasted it Himself, though He had no need."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "We see Jesus, for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honor, so as that, by the grace of God, he might taste of death for every man." 
2. "How could words affirm more clearly that the atonement made by the Lord Jesus was unlimited in its nature and design? How can we express that idea in more clear or intelligible language?" 
3. "When we looker human nature in the person of the Lord Jesus, we see it honored there to a degree that is commensurate with all our desires, and that fills us with wonder."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Christ's exaltation and preeminence over the angels was won through humiliation and death."
2. "He was glorified in humiliation. 'The humiliation is only the glory not yet begun.'"
3. "To be called to the office of 'apostle and high-priest of our confession'... was a signal token of God's favor."

### John Calvin:
1. "He presents to our meditation the glory after the resurrection, which David extends to all the gifts by which man is adorned by God’s bounty."
2. "Christ obtained anything for himself individually, as sophists say, who have devised the notion that he first earned eternal life for himself and then for us..."
3. "By saying for every man, he means not only that he might be ample to others, as Chrysostom says, who brings the example of a physician tasting first a bitter draught, that the patient might not refuse to drink it; but he means that Christ died for us, and that by taking upon him what was due to us, he redeemed us from the curse of death."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "We do not see man triumphant, but we do see Jesus... Jesus has conquered death."
2. "Jesus in his humanity was put lower than the angels 'for a little while'... Because of the suffering of death we see Jesus crowned... 'with glory and honour.'"
3. "The author... here puts Christ's death in behalf of, and so instead of, every man as the motive for his incarnation and death on the Cross."

### John Gill:
1. "Jesus became lower than the angels, by, or through suffering death; in that respect he was lower than they, who die not; this proved him to be in a condition below them, and showed how pertinent the above words were to him, and how they were fulfilled in him."
2. "Christ died, not merely as an example, or barely for the good of men, but as a surety, in their room and stead."
3. "Christ was made a little lower than the angels by becoming man, and assuming a body frail and mortal, that he might die for his church and people."

### John Wesley:
1. "He was made a little lower than the angels — Who cannot either suffer or die."
2. "That by the grace of God, he might taste death — An expression denoting both the reality of his death, and the shortness of its continuance."
3. "For every man — That ever was or will be born into the world."
