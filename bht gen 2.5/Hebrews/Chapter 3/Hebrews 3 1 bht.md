## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Whence (i. e. seeing that we have such a helper: it is connected with the result of ch. 2: not, surely, with ch. Hebrews 1:1 , as De W. The fact just announced in Hebrews 2:18 , is a reason for κατανοήσατε : see below), hely brethren" 
2. "partakers (see on μετέχειν , ch. Hebrews 2:14 ; and reff. here) of a heavenly calling"
3. "the Apostle and High Priest (notice that but one art. covers both ἀπόστ . and ἀρχ ., thereby making it certain that both words belong to τῆς ὁμολογίας ) of our profession, Jesus"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Wherefore—Greek, 'Whence,' that is, seeing we have such a sympathizing Helper you ought to 'consider attentively,' 'contemplate'; fix your eyes and mind on Him with a view to profiting by the contemplation." 
2. "He alone holds both offices combined, and in a more eminent degree than either, which those two brothers held apart."
3. "The words 'of our profession,' mark that it is not of the legal ritual, but of our Christian faith, that He is the High Priest."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The character and work of the Son of God are worthy of the profound and prayerful consideration of every man; and especially every Christian should reflect much on him. Of the friend that we love we think much; but what friend have we like the Lord Jesus?"
2. "The Lord Jesus, under the new dispensation, filled the place of Moses and of the high priest under the old, and that the office of 'apostle' and 'high priest,' instead of being now separated, as it was between Moses and Aaron under the old dispensation, was now blended in the Messiah."
3. "It became necessary, therefore, to show that all that was dignified and valuable in that office was to be found in the Christian system. This was done by showing that in the Lord Jesus was found all the characteristics of a high priest, and that all the functions which had been performed in the Jewish ritual were performed by him."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Drawing a conclusion from ch. 2 9 - 18."
2. "Holy brethren (see ch. 2 11) are worshippers of God, taking the place of God 's O. T. people, as called and consecrated to ethical and spiritual service according to the Christian ideal."
3. "The expression points to the lordship of the world to be (ch. 2 5); and the world to be is the abiding world, the place of realities as contrasted with types and shadows."

### John Calvin:
1. "If then we seek rightly to know him, we must inquire what sort of being he is; yea, he must be clothed with his own power, lest we lay hold on an empty shadow and not on him."
2. "For the calling of the godly cannot be otherwise confirmed than by a thorough surrender of themselves to Christ."
3. "We ought sedulously to attend to Christ, for he is the sole instructor of our faith, and has confirmed it by the sacrifice of himself; for confession, or profession, is to be taken here for faith, as though he had said, that the faith we profess is vain and of no avail, unless Christ be its object."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Holy brethren. No mere complimentary title, but descriptive of the blessed brotherhood to which Christ and all who believe belong."
2. "Partakers of, partners in a ‘calling’ that comes from heaven and leads to it, besides giving the tastes and spirit appropriate to our destiny."
3. "When the high priest went into the holy place on the day of Atonement, he was called the apostle, the messenger of the nation whom he represented, and for whom as priest he pleaded. So Christ has entered into the holy place as our accepted Messenger and Priest. To reject Him now is a double insult."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Consider (κατανοησατε). First aorist active imperative of κατανοεω, old compound verb (κατα, νους), to put the mind down on a thing, to fix the mind on as in Matthew 7:3; Luke 12:24."
2. "Even Jesus (Ιησουν). No 'even' in the Greek, just like the idiom in Hebrews 2:9, the human name held up with pride."
3. "The Apostle and High Priest of our confession (τον αποστολον κα αρχιερεα της ομολογιας ημων). In descriptive apposition with Ιησουν and note the single article τον.

### John Gill:
1. "They all had the same Father, belonged to the same family, were the adopted sons of God, the brethren of Christ, of one another, and of the apostle."
2. "And this is said to be 'heavenly', because the grace by which the saints are called is from heaven, and it is to heaven they are called."
3. "He is to be 'considered' in the greatness and dignity of his person, as the Son of God; and in his wondrous grace and love in assuming human nature, and dying for his people; and in the relations he stands in to them as a Father, husband, brother, friend."

### John Wesley:
1. "The heavenly calling — God calls from heaven, and to heaven, by the gospel."
2. "Consider the Apostle — The messenger of God, who pleads the cause of God with us."
3. "And High Priest — Who pleads our cause with God. Both are contained in the one word Mediator. He compares Christ, as an Apostle, with Moses; as a Priest, with Aaron. Both these offices, which Moses and Aaron severally bore, he bears together, and far more eminently."
