### Albert Barnes:
1. "The 'object' is to show that Christians have a great High Priest as really as the Jews had; to show wherein he surpassed the Levitical priesthood; to show how all that was said of the Aaronic priesthood, and all the types pertaining to that priesthood, were fulfilled in the Lord Jesus; and to state and illustrate the nature of the consolations which Christians might derive from the fact that they had such an High Priest."
2. "In no part of the Bible can there be found so full an account of the design of the Mosaic institutions, as in Heb. 5‚Äì10 of this Epistle; and were it not for this, the volume of inspiration would be incomplete. We should be left in the dark on some of the most important subjects in revelation; we should ask questions for which we could find no certain answer."
3. "The object of the apostle now is to show why the fact that we have such a High Priest, is a reason why we should hold fast our professed attachment to him."

1. "Great high priest (ŒºŒµÃÅŒ≥Œ±ŒΩ) Emphasizing Christ's priestly character to Jewish readers, as superior to that of the Levitical priests."
2. "Passed into the heavens (Œ¥ŒπŒµŒªŒ∑ŒªœÖŒ∏ŒøÃÅœÑŒ± œÑŒøœÖÃÄœÇ ŒøœÖÃìœÅŒ±ŒΩŒøœÖÃÅœÇ) Rend. 'passed through the heavens.' Through, and up to the throne of God of which he wields the power, and is thus able to fulfill for his followers the divine promise of rest."

### John Calvin:
1. "Whosoever regards the doctrine as not confirmed, dishonors the Son of God, and deprives him of his honor as a priest; nay, such and so great a pledge ought to render us confident, so as to rely unhesitantly on the Gospel."
2. "For we have said that the Son of God sustained a twofold character when he was sent to us, even that of a teacher and of a priest."
3. "The design of both [apostleship and priesthood] is to enable us to come to God."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "We have a High Priest, a great High Priest, transcending in personal and official dignity all that ever bore the name, for He is Jesus, the Son of God, each title implying His superiority."
2. "No doubt His sacrifice has ceased, and He Himself has passed through the heavens beyond clouds and stars, even into the heaven of heavens, to the very throne of God itself."
3. "The objection that we have no sacrifice or priest is met by the fact that our High Priest has completed His work on earth, and has gone... into heaven to the throne of God itself, an evidence of the efficacy of His mediation and the means of perpetuating it."

1. "This great high priest believers 'have', and have an interest in him; he is called to this office, and invested with it; he has been sent to do his work as a priest; and he has done the greatest part of it, and is now doing the rest; and saints receive Christ as such, and the blessings of grace from him, through his sacrifice and intercession."
2. "Jesus, the Son of God: the former of these names signifies a Saviour, and respects his office; the latter is expressive of his dignity, and respects his person; who is the Son of God in such sense as angels and men are not; not by creation, nor adoption; but by nature; not as man and Mediator, but as God, being of the same nature with his Father, and equal to him; and it is this which makes him a great high priest, and gives virtue and efficacy to all he does as such."
3. "The priesthood of Christ is an argument to enforce this duty, for he is the high priest of our profession; he has espoused our cause, and abode by it; he has bore witness to the truth of the Gospel himself; he prays for the support of our faith; he pities and succors; and he is passed into the heavens, where he appears for us, owns us, and will own us."

### John Wesley:
1. "Having therefore a great high priest ‚Äî Great indeed, being the eternal Son of God."
2. "That is passed through the heavens - As the Jewish high priest passed through the veil into the holy of holies."
