3. "Unbeliefâ€”Greek, rather 'disobedience'."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Since there is a rest spoken of in the Scriptures, implying that it is to be enjoyed by some, and since they to whom it was first promised did not inherit it, it follows that it must still be in reserve."
2. "It could not be supposed that God would prepare such a rest in vain, for it would follow that if he had suited up a world of rest, he designed that it should be occupied."
3. "As he knew, therefore, that they to whom it was first offered would not enter in, it must be that he designed it for some others, and that it 'remained' to be occupied by us now."
