# Hebrews 5:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The high priest, being taken from among men, is appointed for men in matters relating to God. He offers gifts and sacrifices for sins, including animal whole burnt offerings. The efficiency of the high priest depends on his human sympathy and divine appointment. The role of the high priest is to bring offerings to the altar on behalf of men in things pertaining to God. The proper office of a priest is to present a sacrifice for sin, and it is improper to give the name priest to a minister of the gospel. The ancient priesthood was abolished, and angels are not capable of obtaining God's favor because they have no sacrifice.
