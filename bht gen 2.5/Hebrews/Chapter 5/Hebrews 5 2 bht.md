# Hebrews 5:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The high priest is compassionate towards the ignorant and erring, showing leniency and making allowances for their sins of ignorance and errors. This sympathy is rooted in the high priest's own sense of personal infirmity and weakness. The priest's role is to plead with God for the sinner, bridling his natural disgust and impatience, and showing compassion despite the loathsomeness of sensuality and the frequent falls of the penitent. The true position of a priest is to have a blended feeling of sorrow and blame, sympathizing with sinners while recognizing their guilt. Christ, as the ultimate high priest, became a partaker of our infirmities, showing forbearance and kindness towards us.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "He is compassionate towards the ignorant and erring."
2. "And thus the propriety of the next clause is rendered still greater; both these, ἄγνοια and πλάνη, being the results of ἀσθένεια, with which he himself is encompassed."
3. "On the exclusion on the one side from these designations of 'sinners with a high hand,' and the inclusion in them, as above, of much more than sins, strictly speaking, of ignorance."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Who can...have compassion—Greek,
	'estimate mildly,' 'feel leniently,' or
	'moderately towards'; 'to make allowance for';
	not showing stern rigor save to the obstinate."
	
2. "ignorant—sins not
	committed in resistance of light and knowledge...all other sins, namely, ignorances and errors, were confessed and expiated with sacrifices by the high priest."
	
3. "out of the way—not
	deliberately and altogether wilfully erring, but deluded through the
	fraud of Satan and their own carnal frailty and thoughtlessness."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The high priest is taken from among men, in order that he may have a fellow-feeling for those on whose behalf he officiates."
2. "If he were taken from an order of beings superior to people, he would be less qualified to sympathize with those who felt that they were sinners, and who needed pardon."
3. "They can enter into the feelings of those who are conscious of guilt; they can sympathize with those who tremble in dread of death; they can partake of the emotions of those who expect soon to appear before God."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Here it denotes a state of feeling toward the ignorant and erring which is neither too severe nor too tolerant."
2. "Atonement for sins of ignorance was required by the Levitical law as a means of educating the moral perception."
3. "Sympathy belongs to the high-priestly office, and grows out of the sense of personal infirmity."

### John Calvin:
1. "The priest ought to be kind and gentle to sinners, because he partakes of their infirmities."
2. "Christ is a brother to us, not only on account of unity as to flesh and nature, but also by becoming a partaker of our infirmities."
3. "The sum of what is said is, that Christ is a brother to us, not only on account of unity as to flesh and nature, but also by becoming a partaker of our infirmities, so that he is led, and as it were formed, to show forbearance and kindness."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The true position of a priest in relation to those who are not only suffering, but are also guilty, is between the two. His is a blended feeling of sorrow and blame." 
2. "The persons for whom the priest acts are not innocent, or the function would cease; they are sinners, and are described as ignorant and out of the way."
3. "Sympathy for all such is the duty and the qualification of the true priest; made the more easy that he is himself beset with infirmity, and the more obligatory that he himself needs the same treatment."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "If the priest is cordially to plead with God for the sinner, he must bridle his natural disgust at the loathsomeness of sensuality, his impatience at the frequently recurring fall, his hopeless alienation from the hypocrite and the superficial, his indignation at any confession he hears from the penitent."
2. "Sins of ignorance (both accidence and sudden passion) as opposed to high-handed sins of presumption and deliberate purpose."
3. "The priest himself has weakness lying around him like a chain. Not so Jesus."

### John Gill:
1. "These he does not insult and upbraid, nor break out into anger and indignation against; but pities them, and sympathizes with them; has a just measure of compassion suitable to their condition." 
2. "Bears with them with great moderation and temper."
3. "He was 'clothed' with it, as the Syriac version renders it; as Joshua the high priest was with filthy garments."

### John Wesley:
1. "Who can have compassion — In proportion to the offence: so the Greek word signifies."
2. "On the ignorant — Them that are in error."
3. "Seeing himself also is compassed with infirmity — Even with sinful infirmity; and so needs the compassion which he shows to others."
