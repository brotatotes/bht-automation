# Hebrews 6:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Hope is represented by an anchor, which serves as a firm and secure foundation for the soul. This hope is not satisfied with earthly goods but penetrates into the heavenly realm, where it clings to God Himself and heavenly goods. Just as an anchor holds a ship in the midst of a storm, hope keeps the soul steady and immovable in the face of trials and tribulations. This hope is based on Christ as our Redeemer and enters into heaven itself, where it is fixed and unshakable.
