# Hebrews 6:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Believers in Christ have tasted the good word of God and experienced the powers of the world to come. This refers to the comforting promises of the gospel and the spiritual powers bestowed by the indwelling Spirit to equip Christians in their battle against sin, the world, and the devil. By faith, Christians make the world to come a present reality, though it is only a foretaste of the perfect future. These powers, both outward and inward, are characteristic of the new spiritual world inaugurated by Christ's work.
