## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Christ unites these offices in their highest sense, and so restores the patriarchal union of these offices."
2. "This title of God, 'the Most High,' handed down by tradition from the primitive revelation, appears in the Phoelignician god 'Elion,' that is, Most High. It is used to imply that the God whom Melchisedec served is THE TRUE GOD, and not one of the gods of the nations around."
3. "As priest he first blessed Abraham on God's part; next he blessed God on Abraham's part: a reciprocal blessing. Not a mere wish, but an authoritative and efficacious intercession as a priest."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Names, however, were frequently given on account of some quality or characteristic of the man."
2. "That his genealogy was not recorded, while that of every other priest mentioned was so carefully traced and preserved, furnished another striking illustration."
3. "He was not in a 'line' of priests; he was preceded by no one in the sacerdotal office, nor was he followed by any."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. For this Melchisedec, etc. See Genesis 14:18-20; Psalms 110:0.


### John Calvin:
1. "It was doubtless no common thing that in a country abounding in the corruptions of so many superstitions, a man was found who preserved the pure worship of God."
2. "He is then called the King of righteousness, because of what he effects in diffusing righteousness on all his people."
3. "But as peace among the Hebrews means also a prosperous and happy state, it may be so taken here: yet I prefer to understand it here of that inward peace which tranquilizes the conscience and renders it confident before God."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "It is a daring thing to put Melchizedek above Aaron, but the author does it."
2. "Melchizedek is the only one in his line and stands alone in the record in Genesis."
3. "He is called 'priest' and note Ï„Î¿Ï… Ï…ÏˆÎ¹ÏƒÏ„Î¿Ï… applied to God as the Canaanites, Phoenicians, Hebrews did."

### John Gill:
1. "some have thought him to be more than a man; some, that he was an angel; others, that he was the Holy Ghost; and others, that he was a divine person superior to Christ, which needs no refutation"
2. "it is most proper not to inquire curiously who he was, since the Scripture is silent concerning his genealogy and descent; and that as it should seem on purpose, that he might be a more full and fit type of Christ"
3. "he brought with him bread and wine, not for sacrifice, as the Papists would have it; but as Jarchi, a Jewish interpreter on the place observes, they used to do so to such as were fatigued in war; for this is to be considered as a neighbourly action, done in point of interest and gratitude"

### John Wesley:
1. "Christ, as appears from his type, Melchisedec, who was greater than Abraham himself."
2. "A priesthood altogether excellent, new, firm, perpetual."
3. "Genesis 14:18, etc."
