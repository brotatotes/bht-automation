# Hebrews 7:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus serves as both God's surety for man and man's surety for God. The Greek term used implies that Jesus' appointment as a surety is by God and encompasses the relations and bearings of both a covenant and a testament. Jesus is a pledge, guaranteeing the fulfillment of the covenant between God and man. His suretyship is secured by an oath and his responsibility for the salvation of sinners. Through his death, Jesus becomes the everlasting pledge and security to law, justice, and the universe, ensuring no harm results from the pardon and salvation of sinners. The covenant of grace, of which Jesus is the surety, is unchangeable, eternal, and founded in the grace of God.

2. "The surety (ÎµÎ³Î³Ï…Î¿Ï‚). Vulgate sponsor. Old word, here only in the N.T., adjective (one pledged, betrothed), from ÎµÎ³Î³Ï…Î·, a pledge, here used as substantive like ÎµÎ³Î³Ï…Î·Ï„Î·Ï‚, one who gives a pledge or guarantee."

### John Gill:
1. "What is intended may be called both a testament and a covenant; a testament, because it is founded in the good will and pleasure of God, and respects an inheritance bequeathed by God the Father to his children, which was confirmed and comes to them by the death of Christ the testator; and a covenant, it being a compact or agreement made by the Father with Christ, as the representative of all the elect."

3. "Christ drew nigh to his Father in the council of peace, and undertook to be the Saviour and Redeemer of his people... Christ is not the surety for the Father to his people, but for them to the Father; to satisfy for their sins, work out righteousness, preserve and keep them, and make them happy; which is an instance of matchless love."

### John Wesley:
1. "Of so much better a covenant â€” Unchangeable, eternal."
2. "Was Jesus made a surety â€” Or mediator."
3. "The original word means either a covenant or a last will and testament."
