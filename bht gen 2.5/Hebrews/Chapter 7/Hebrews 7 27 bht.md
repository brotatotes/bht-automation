# Hebrews 7:27 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The high priests in the Old Testament had to offer sacrifices daily for their own sins and for the sins of the people. However, Jesus, as the ultimate high priest, did not need to offer sacrifices daily because he was sinless. His sacrifice was so perfect and complete that it only needed to be offered once for all sins. This sacrifice put an end to the need for any further sacrifices, as it was sufficient for all time. Jesus offered himself as the perfect sacrifice, without any spot of sin, and it was acceptable to God.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The allusion is to the daily offerings of the priests...because the high priests in fact lead and represent the whole priesthood." 
2. "The most probable solution of the difficulty however is that καθʼ ἡμέραν...belongs not to οἱ ἀρχιερεῖς, but only to Christ: 'who has not need day by day, as the high priests had year by year.'"
3. "It becomes more and more familiar to the reader: 'once struck, the note sounds on ever louder and louder.'"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The 'daily' strictly belongs to Christ, not to the high priests."
2. "The negation is twofold: He needeth not to offer (1) daily nor (2) to offer for His own sins also."
3. "The sufficiency of the one sacrifice to atone for all sins for ever, resulted from its absolute spotlessness."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The Jewish high priest was a sinful man... But it was not so in the case of Jesus. He was so holy that he needed no sacrifice for himself, and all that he did was in behalf of others."
2. "The offering which he made, though presented but once, was so ample and perfect that it had sufficient merit for all the sins of the world, and needed never to be repeated."
3. "He made such an atonement that it was not needful that it should be repeated. Thus, he put an end to sacrifice, for when he made the great atonement it was complete, and there was no need that any more blood should be shed for human guilt."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Who needeth not daily (kaq' hJmeran). Apparently inconsistent with ch. 9 7, but the sense is, 'who hath no need day by day as the high priest had (year by year) to offer sacrifices,' etc. The great point is repetition, whether daily or yearly." 
2. "Once [εφαπαξ]. Rend. once for all. Contrasted with daily."
3. "When he offered up himself [εαυτον ανενεγκας]. A new thought. For the first time Christ appears as victim."

### John Calvin:
1. "One of the defects of the ancient priesthood was, that the high priest offered sacrifices for his own sins; how then could he have pacified God for others, who had God justly displeased with himself?"
2. "Then they were by no means equal to the work of expiating for sins."
3. "The case with Christ was wholly different; for he himself needed no sacrifice, as he was sprinkled with no spot of sin; and such was the sacrifice, that it was alone sufficient to the end of the world, for he offered himself."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "For the sins (τον). Only the article in the Greek with repetition of υπερ or of αμαρτιων."
2. "When he offered up himself (εαυτον ανενεγκας). First aorist active participle of αναφερω, to offer up."
3. "Old verb for sacrifice to place on the altar (1 Peter 2:5; 1 Peter 2:24)."

### John Gill:
1. "He (the high priest) offers sacrifices for the sins of the people, for his own 'first', and afterwards for the sins of the people."
2. "Christ needed not to offer for his own, nor could he, for he had none of his own; what he had was by imputation."
3. "Christ offered himself, his whole human nature, soul and body, and both as in union with his divine nature; and this being offered to God freely and voluntarily, in the room and stead of his people, was acceptable to God."

### John Wesley:
1. "Who needeth not to offer up sacrifices daily..."
2. "He offered once for all: not for his own sins..."
3. "...he offered up himself 'without spot to God.'"
