# Hebrews 7:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Melchisedec, the priest of God, is shown to be greater than the Levitical priests. While the Levitical priests had to trace their genealogy back to Levi, Melchisedec's descent was not counted from them. He took tithes from Abraham, implying his superiority, and blessed him as a priest of God. Melchisedec's position was acknowledged by Abraham, who recognized his superiority by accepting his blessing. This highlights the enduring nature of Melchisedec's priesthood and his status as the possessor of the promises.
