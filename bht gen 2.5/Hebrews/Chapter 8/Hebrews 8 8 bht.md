### Albert Barnes:
1. "The word 'covenant' with us commonly denotes a compact or agreement between two parties that are equal, and who are free to enter into the agreement or not. In this sense, of course, it cannot be used in relation to the arrangement which God makes with man."
2. "The word, therefore, is used in a more general sense, and more in accordance with the original meaning of the Greek word... The word which they employ - Œ¥ŒπŒ±Œ∏Œ∑ÃÅŒ∫Œ∑ diatheÃÑkeÃÑ - never means a compact or agreement as between equals."
3. "The word Œ¥ŒπŒ±Œ∏Œ∑ÃÅŒ∫Œ∑ diatheÃÑkeÃÑ is derived from a verb - Œ¥ŒπŒ±œÑŒπÃÅŒ∏Œ∑ŒºŒπ diatitheÃÑmi - meaning to place apart, to set in order; and then to appoint, to make over, to make an arrangement with. Hence, the word Œ¥ŒπŒ±Œ∏Œ∑ÃÅŒ∫Œ∑ diatheÃÑkeÃÑ - means properly the 'arrangement or disposition' which God made with people in regard to salvation."

### John Calvin:
1. "To remedy this evil, he promised a new and a different covenant, the fulfillment of which prophecy was the abrogation of the old covenant."
2. "There is no doubt but that the Prophet includes the whole dispensation of Moses when he says, 'I have made with you a covenant which you have not kept.'"
3. "Now, by the days which the prophet mentions, all agree that Christ‚Äôs kingdom is signified; it hence follows, that the old covenant was changed by the coming of Christ."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The covenant, as a revelation of God‚Äôs holiness, was faultless; but as the people fell away under it, it failed as a covenant of works to establish abiding fellowship between them and God." 
2. "The prediction that follows is taken from the last great series of his prophecies (chaps, 30-31), which are distinctly Messianic."
3. "The covenant is ‚Äòfor‚Äô them rather than with them, though in a sense it was both and is so described."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The covenant was all right, but the Jews failed to keep it. Hence God made a new one of grace in place of law."

3. "ŒöŒ±ŒπŒΩŒøœÇ is fresh, on new lines as opposed to the old (œÄŒ±ŒªŒ±ŒπŒøœÇ) as in 2 Corinthians 3:6; 2 Corinthians 3:14; ŒΩŒµŒøœÇ is young or not yet old."

### John Gill:
1. "The words are cited from Jeremiah 31:31 in which God promises a 'new covenant'; so called, not because newly made; for with respect to its original constitution, it was made from eternity."

3. "The time of doing all this is called 'the days to come'; the last days, the days of the Messiah, which were future in Jeremiah's time: and a 'behold' is prefixed to the whole, as a note of attention, this being an affair of great moment and importance; and as a note of demonstration, or as pointing to something that was desired and expected; and as a note of admiration, it containing things wonderful and marvelous."

### John Wesley:
1. "I make a new covenant with the house of Israel - With all the Israel of God, in all ages and nations." 
2. "It is new in many respects, though not as to the substance of it."
