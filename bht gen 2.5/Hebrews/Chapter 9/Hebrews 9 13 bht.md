# Hebrews 9:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The blood of Christ is emphasized as the ultimate means of purification and salvation, surpassing the cleansing power of animal sacrifices. The ashes of the red heifer are seen as a provision for removing ceremonial defilement, symbolizing the connection between purification and the shedding of blood. The heifer's sacrifice and the use of its ashes with water serve as a symbolic representation of the Law and its role in cleansing those who have become defiled. While the Levitical law provided remedies for various forms of defilement, it is acknowledged that these rituals only served to cleanse the flesh and not the conscience. Ultimately, the blood of Christ is the true means of purging sin and restoring communion with God.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "If the blood of mere brutes could purify in any, however small a degree, how much more shall inward purification, and complete and eternal salvation, be wrought by the blood of Christ."
2. "The water of separation, made of the ashes of the red heifer, was the provision for removing ceremonial defilement whenever incurred by contact with the dead."
3. "In our wilderness journey we are continually contracting defilement by contact with the spiritually dead, and with dead works, and need therefore continual application to the antitypical life-giving cleansing blood of Christ, whereby we are afresh restored to peace and living communion with God in the heavenly holy place."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It was needful ... that there should be some method in which they could be declared to be cleansed from their 'uncleanness.'"
2. "It was, therefore, a provision of convenience, and at the same time was designed to keep up the idea, that all purification was somehow connected with the shedding of blood."
3. "The offering thus made removed the obstructions to the worship of God so far as to allow him who had been defiled to approach him in a regular manner."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The two examples selected cover the entire legal provision for removing uncleanness, whether contracted by sin or by contact with death." 
2. "The Levitical law required two remedies : the Christian economy furnishes one for all phases of defilement." 
3. "The literal rendering of the participle brings out better the incidental or occasional character of the defilement."

### John Calvin:
1. "The cleansing of the flesh they leave explained of what avails among men, as the heathens had their expiations to blot out the infamy of crimes. But this explanation is indeed very heathenish; for wrong is done to God’s promises, if we restrict the effect to civil matters only."
2. "Often does this declaration occur in the writings of Moses, that iniquity was expiated when a sacrifice was duly offered. This is no doubt the spiritual teaching of faith. Besides, all the sacrifices were destined for this end, that they might lead men to Christ; as the eternal salvation of the soul is through Christ, so these were true witnesses of this salvation."
3. "If the blood of beasts was a true symbol of purgation, so that it cleansed in a sacramental manner, how much more shall Christ who is himself the truth, not only bear witness to a purgation by an external rite, but also really perform this for consciences? The argument then is from the signs to the thing signified; for the effect by a long time preceded the reality of the signs."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "This case of the ‘ashes of the heifer’ is one of the most suggestive symbols of the Law" - This quote emphasizes the symbolic significance of the 'ashes of the heifer' as a representation of the Law.

3. "its ashes laid up in a clean place to be used with water in cleansing those who had been defiled" - This quote explains the purpose of the heifer's ashes in purifying individuals who have become defiled.

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "This ceremonial ritual does serve 'for the cleansing of the flesh,' but not for the conscience." 
2. "The cow was αμωμον, the individual καθαρος." 
3. "The blood of bulls and goats was offered for sins."

### John Gill:
1. "but neither of them can purge from sin"
2. "the ashes and the water mixed together made the water of separation, or of sprinkling; for so it is called by the Septuagint, υδωρ ραντισμου, 'the water of sprinkling'"
3. "the purification for sin, though it only sanctifieth to the purifying of the flesh"

### John Wesley:

2. "Consumed by fire as a sin-offering."
3. "Re-admitted them to the temple and the congregation."
