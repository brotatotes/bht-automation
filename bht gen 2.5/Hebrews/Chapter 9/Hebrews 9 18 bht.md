# Hebrews 9:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The first covenant was not inaugurated without blood, as the rites and sacrifices were still subsisting. The Old Testament formally began on the day of its inauguration, which was ratified by the slaying of victims and sprinkling their blood. The death of the victim was necessary to confirm the covenant, and all solemn covenants under the Law were made valid by the death of a victim. The blood of the sacrifices in the first covenant was typical of the blood of Christ, which ratified the new covenant.

2. "·ºêŒ≥Œ∫Œ±ŒπŒΩŒØŒ∂œâ is an Alexandrine verb: used in the LXX for to re-create or make anew: also for to put forth as new, to inaugurate."
3. "Notice that the reference is, here, simply to the first enc√¶nia of the law when it was put forth as new: not to any subsequent renewal of sacrifices by death."

	strictly a testament."
3. "When regarded as the typical representative of the new, [the old dispensation] is strictly a Testament."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The admitted principle which the apostle had stated, that the death of the victim was necessary to confirm the covenant, was the 'reason' why the first covenant was ratified with blood."
2. "We then see why he offered the sacrifice and sprinkled the blood. It was not on the basis of such reasoning as this: 'The death of a man who makes a will is indispensable before the will is of binding force, therefore it was that Moses confirmed the covenant made with our fathers by the blood of a sacrifice;' but by such reasoning as this: 'It is a great principle that in order to ratify a covenant between God and his people a victim should be slain, therefore it was that Moses ratified the old covenant in this manner.'"
3. "The first testament - Or rather covenant - the word 'testament' being supplied by the translators."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Neither hath the first (covenant) been inaugurated without blood."
2. "A testament is of force after men are dead. It has no force so long as the testator is alive."

### John Calvin:
1. "...men were even then reminded, that it could not be valid and efficacious except death intervened."
2. "For the majesty of God is justly to be dreaded by us, and the way to his presence is nothing to us but a dangerous labyrinth, until we know that he is pacified towards us through the blood of Christ, and that this blood affords to us a free access."
3. "So doctrine itself, however unchangeable may be the will of God, cannot be efficacious for our benefit, unless it be dedicated by blood, as is plainly set forth in this verse."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Whence neither hath the first covenant been inaugurated (or ratified) without blood."
2. "All solemn covenants under the Law were made valid by the death of a victim which represented the covenanting persons, and pledged them on peril of their lives to faithfulness."
3. "If the rendering 'testament' is preferred, and 'testator,' it is best to regard Hebrews 9:16-17 as an illustrative argument, a parallel case, suggested partly by the mention of an inheritance and partly by the double meaning of the Greek word (covenant or testament), which is applied to any arrangement or distribution by will, or in any other way."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The first covenant (Œ∑ œÄœÅœâœÑŒ∑). Supply Œ¥ŒπŒ±Œ∏Œ∑Œ∫Œ∑ as in Hebrews 9:1."
