# James 1:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Blessed is the man who endures temptation and comes out unscathed, for he shall receive the crown of life, which is the promise of eternal glory. This crown is not like the athlete's crown, but rather the kingly crown, symbolizing a kingdom. Temptations and trials test our faith and produce patient endurance, proving our love for God. The trials we face are aids and helps to our happiness, for they refine us and prepare us for the crown of life. It is those who love God and endure all things who will receive this crown, as it is promised to them.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Affliction, persecution, sickness, etc., may be regarded as, in a certain sense, temptations to sin... the question comes before us whether we will adhere to the religion on account of which we are persecuted, or apostatize from it, and escape these sufferings." 
2. "In each and every case, whether by affliction, or by direct allurements to do wrong, the question comes before the mind whether we have religion enough to keep us, or whether we will yield to murmuring, to rebellion, and to sin."
3. "For when he is tried - In any way - if he bears the trial. He shall receive the crown of life."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The meaning is not, as the A. V. suggests, when his trial is finished, but when he has been approved by trial." (Commentary)
2. "The figure is not that of the athlete's crown, for an image from the Grecian games, which the Jews despised, would be foreign to James' thought and displeasing to his readers." (Commentary)
3. "Rather the kingly crown, the proper word for which is diadhma, diadem. In Psalms 20:3 (Sept.), stefanov is used of the royal crown." (Commentary)

### John Calvin:
1. "It is, however, a paradox, that they are not happy to whom all things come according to their wishes, but such as are not overcome with evils."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "A man who has been tempted, and has come victorious out of the temptation, is a far nobler man than one who preserves a moral character, because he has never been tempted."

3. "Earthly trials are the flowers of which the heavenly garland is made."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "This beatitude (μακαριος) is for the one who has come out unscathed." 
2. "The crown of life (τον στεφανον της ζωης). The same phrase occurs in Revelation 2:10. It is the genitive of apposition, life itself being the crown."
3. "The Lord. Not in the oldest Greek MSS., but clearly implied as the subject of επηγγειλατο (he promised, first aorist middle indicative)."

### John Gill:
1. "Blessed is the man that endureth temptation...and bears up under it...and endures afflictions in such manner as not to murmur and repine at them, but is quiet and still, and bears them patiently and constantly, and so endures to the end...they are happy now, and shall be hereafter." (100 words)
