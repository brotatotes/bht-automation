# James 2:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Faith and works are inseparable, as faith is demonstrated through actions. Believers are called to exhibit their faith through deeds, as faith is unseen by others. The emphasis is on the evidence of genuine faith, rather than the method of salvation. Works serve as proof of a living faith, and without them, faith is dead. True faith leads to a righteous life and is displayed through acts of kindness and service to others. This reminds us that faith without works is empty and lacks substance.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Thou hast faith, and I have works: shew me thy faith without the works, and I will shew thee my faith by my works."
2. "The whole difficulty found in this verse by Commentators has arisen from overlooking the fact that it continues the argument from the previous verses."
3. "And the reason why this has been overlooked, is, the occurrence between the two of the general clause in James 2:17."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Show" does not mean here to prove to me, but exhibit to me. Faith is unseen save by God. To show faith to man, works in some form or other are needed.
2. The question here is not as to the ground on which believers are justified, but about the demonstration of their faith: so in the case of Abraham.
3. That work of faith demonstrated, but did not contribute to his justification. The tree shows its life by its fruits, but it was alive before either fruits or even leaves appeared.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The two things referred to, faith and works, were not independent things, which could exist separately, without the one materially influencing another - as, for example, charity and chastity, zeal and meekness; but that the one was the germ or source of the other, and that the existence of the one was to be known only by its developing itself in the form of the other."
2. "You have one form or manifestation of religion in an eminent or prominent degree, and I have another. You are characterized particularly for one of the virtues of religion, and I am for another; as one man may be particularly eminent for meekness, and another for zeal, and another for benevolence, and each be a virtuous man."
3. "I will furnish in this way the best and most certain proof of the existence of faith. It is implied here that true faith is adapted to lead to a holy life, and that such a life would be the appropriate evidence of the existence of faith."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Without [œáœâœÅŒπœÇ] . Rev., more literally, apart from."
2. "And I will shew thee, etc. The Rev. brings out the antithesis more sharply."
3. "I by my works will shew, etc."

### John Calvin:
1. "Unless thy faith brings forth fruits, I deny that thou hast any faith."
2. "Thou hast faith only, I have also works in addition to my faith; now, prove to me that you have true faith without having works connected with it, and I will prove my faith by its fruits, even good works."
3. "This verse is a key to the meaning of James: faith is to be proved by works; then faith properly justifies and saves, and works prove its genuineness."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "To show faith without works is simply an impossibility."
2. "Justification is denied to a dead faith, and affirmed only of a living faith - a faith which manifests itself in works."
3. "We shall not then be examined as to the pureness of our creed or the extent of our knowledge, but whether we have fed the hungry, clothed the naked, visited the sick, and ministered to the afflicted."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The point lies in œáœâœÅŒπœÇ, which means not 'without,' but 'apart from,' as in Hebrews 11:6, 'the works that properly belong to it and should characterise it' (Hort). James challenges the objector to do this."
2. "It is not faith or works, but proof of real faith (live faith vs. dead faith). The mere profession of faith with no works or profession of faith shown to be alive by works."
3. "James is not here discussing 'works' (ceremonial works) as a means of salvation as Paul in James 2:3; James 2:4, but works as proof of faith."

### John Gill:
1. "You say you have faith, be it so that you have; I have works, you see I have, I say nothing about my faith at present; now, show me thy faith without thy works, if thou canst; see what ways, means, and methods thou canst make use of, to make it appear to me, or any other, that you have the faith you talk of."
2. "Faith is an inward principle in the heart; a hidden thing, and cannot be seen and known but by external acts; and where it is right, it is operative, and shows itself by works, which is not practicable in those who have none."
3. "In short, works may deceive, and do not infallibly prove truth of faith, yet it is certain, that where they are not, but persons live in a continued course of sinning, there cannot be true faith."

### John Wesley:
1. But one ‚Äî Who judges better.
Will say ‚Äî To such a vain talker. Show me, if thou canst, thy faith without thy works.
