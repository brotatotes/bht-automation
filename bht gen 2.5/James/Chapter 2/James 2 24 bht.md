## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Ye see (not imperative, nor interrogative) that by (from, out of, as a source) works a man is justified (accounted righteous before God, as above: not, as Calvin, 'Fructibus cognoscitur et approbatur ejus justitia'), and not by (from) faith only."
2. "St. James never says that a man is not justified by faith, provided that faith include in it the condition of obedience: but by faith ŒºœåŒΩŒøŒΩ, œáœâœÅ·Ω∂œÇ ·ºîœÅŒ≥œâŒΩ, is no man justified."
3. "ŒºœåŒΩŒøŒΩ must be joined with œÄŒØœÉœÑŒµœâœÇ, not with Œø·ΩêŒ∫, as Theile, 'Appositionis lege explenda est oratio: non solum fide, sed etiam operibus.‚Ä¶ nempe cum fide conjungendis.'"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Faith to justify must, from the first, include obedience in germ (to be developed subsequently), though the former alone is the ground of justification." 
2. "The scion must be grafted on the stock that it may live; it must bring forth fruit to prove that it does live."
3. "Faith without works is faith severed from its proper fruits."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It must be by a faith that shall produce good works, and whose existence will be shown to men by good works."
2. "In other words, no man will be justified who has not a faith which will produce good works, and which is of an operative and practical character."
3. "Thus he maintains, as Paul always did, that nothing else than a holy life can show that a man is a true Christian, and is accepted of God."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Ye see then, from this example of Abraham, how that by works a man is justified."
2. "The meaning is, ‚Äònot by faith simply,‚Äô by a faith without works, which cannot justify either in whole or in part."
3. "He only asserts that justifying faith must not be alone, but must be productive of works."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Is justified... not 'is made righteous,' but 'is shown to be righteous.'" 
2. "James is discussing the proof of faith, not the initial act of being set right with God." 
3. "Faith is what we must all have... only it must show itself also in deeds as Abraham's did."

### John Gill:
1. "Good works do not go before justification as causes or conditions, but follow it as fruits and effects."
2. "The Apostle Paul speaks of justification before God; and James speaks of it as it is known by its fruits unto men."
3. "The one speaks of good works as causes, which he denies to have any place as such in justification; and the other speaks of them as effects flowing from faith, and showing the truth of it, and so of justification by it."

### John Wesley:
1. "Ye see then that a man is justified by works, and not by faith only." 
2. "They do not speak of the same faith: St. Paul speaking of living faith; St. James here, of dead faith."
3. "They do not speak of the same works: St. Paul speaking of works antecedent to faith; St. James, of works subsequent to it."
