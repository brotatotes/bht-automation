# James 4:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When we pray, it is important to examine our motives and intentions. If we ask for things with selfish desires and for the purpose of self-indulgence, our prayers may go unanswered. God does not promise to hear prayers that are offered for improper objects or with improper motives. Instead, our prayers should be aligned with God's will and for His glory. When we pray with a proper spirit and intention, our desires will be in line with God's plan, and we will receive what we ask for.

### Albert Barnes:

2. "Because ye ask amiss - Ye do it with a view to self-indulgence and carnal gratification."
3.

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Ye ask. Amiss. Lit., evilly: with evil intent."
2. "Consume it upon. More correctly, spend it in. The sense is not lay out expense upon your pleasures, but spend in the exercise of; under the dominion of."

### John Calvin:

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Ye ask, and receive not: as if to anticipate the reply of his readers that they did ask, but still did not receive the object of their desires."
2. "because ye ask amiss: or wrongly, wickedly; either in an improper spirit, without faith in God as the Hearer of prayer; or rather for improper objects, for worldly things which are pernicious in themselves or prejudicial to the petitioner for the sole purpose of self-gratification, without any thought of the glory of God. Such asking is equivalent to not asking."
3. "that ye may consume it (that which ye ask) on, or spend it in, your lusts: in order to gratify your own sinful desires. The meaning is: if you pray in a proper spirit, these selfish desires, which are the occasion of those bitter contentions among you, would cease to exist."

### John Wesley:
1. But if ye do ask, ye receive not, because ye ask amiss - That is, from a wrong motive.
