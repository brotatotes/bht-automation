# James 5:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Those who endure trials are considered happy, as seen in the example of Job. It is important to look beyond Job's sufferings and focus on the mercy shown to him by God. The Lord is both pitiful and merciful, not laying on the patient endurer more trials than they can bear. The end of the Lord brings a happy conclusion to the trials. Those who exercise patience in their sufferings and endure until the end will find God's hand delivering them. The patience of Job had its perfect work and resulted in his restoration.
