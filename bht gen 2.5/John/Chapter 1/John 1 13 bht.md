# John 1:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The exclusive divine birth of those who become children of God through faith is emphasized. It denies any human source of this sonship and highlights the immense force of being born of God. This spiritual birth is not a result of human power or natural hereditary descent, but a true spiritual filiation. The work of being born again is solely the work of God, and no human can accomplish it.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "John here negatives any such claim, and asserts the exclusive divine birth of all who become children of God by faith."
2. "It is to be noticed that the conjunctions here are not the merely disjunctive ones οὔτε … οὔτε, but οὐδὲ … οὐδέ, which rise in climax from one clause to another."
3. "Or perhaps this may be earned somewhat further, and we may better satisfy the climax by regarding the ἐξ αἱμάτων as indicating the mere phenomena of physical generation wherever found: then rising to ἐκ θελήματος σαρκός, the instigation of that capacity by sexual desire: then rising still higher to the most exalted instance of that desire, ἐκ θελήματος ἀνδρός."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "A sonship therefore not of mere title and privilege, but of nature, the soul being made conscious of the vital capacities, perceptions, and emotions of a child of God, before unknown." 
2. "Not of superior human descent, not of human generation at all, not of man in any manner of way. By this elaborate threefold denial of the human source of this sonship, immense force is given to what follows."
3. "Right royal gift, and He who confers must be absolutely divine. For who would not worship Him who can bring him into the family, and evoke within him the very life, of the sons of God?"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Before, the sinner is 'dead' in sins...now he begins truly to live." 
2. "It is not by human power or agency that men become children of the Most High."
3. "If men are saved they must be born again...this work is the work of God, and 'no man' can do it for us."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The three clauses, however, really express but one main idea; what that is must be learnt from the contrast in the closing words, ‘but (they were begotten) of God.’"
2. "These believers have received the right to become ‘children of God’ by virtue of a true spiritual filiation, being begotten of God."
3. "The threefold denial that men become children of God by virtue of any natural hereditary descent."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Which were born (ο εγεννηθησαν). First aorist passive indicative of γενναω, to beget, 'who were begotten.' By spiritual generation (of God, εκ θεου), not by physical (εξ αιματων, plural as common in classics and O.T., though why it is not clear unless blood of both father and mother; εκ θεληματος σαρκος, from sexual desire; εκ θεληματος ανδρος, from the will of the male)." 
2. "But b of the old Latin reads qui natus est and makes it refer to Christ and so expressly teach the Virgin Birth of Jesus."
3. "The Virgin Birth is doubtless implied in verse John 1:14, but it is not stated in verse John 1:13."

### John Gill:
1. "all that believe in the name of Christ are; and which is the evidence of their being the sons of God"
2. "regeneration is ascribed to another will and power, even to the will and power of God, and denied of this"
3. "let a man be ever so great, or good, or eminent, for gifts and grace, he cannot communicate grace to another, or to whom he will"

2. "Not by descent from Abraham, nor by the will of the flesh."
3. "But of God - By his Spirit."
