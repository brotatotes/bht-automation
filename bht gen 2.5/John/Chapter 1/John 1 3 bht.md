# John 1:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
All things were made through the Word, including matter and evil itself. The Word's role in creation parallels the Incarnation, as both unfold and infold finite being according to the will of the Father. The Word's relation to creation does not make Him a mere instrument, but highlights a distinct role alongside the Father. The creation of all things is a becoming, contrasting with the eternal being of God. The Word's role in creation refutes the notions of eternal matter and the involvement of angels or aeons.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "This parallelism of itself refutes the Socinian interpretation of Ï€Î¬Î½Ï„Î±, 'all Christian graces and virtues,' 'the whole moral world.'"
2. "Nothing was made without Him (the Î»ÏŒÎ³Î¿Ï‚); all matter, and implicitly evil itself, in the deep and inscrutable purposes of creation."
3. "That which was made by Him was life (i.e. having life), and that life was the light of men."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "All things, c.â€”all things absolutely..."
2. "without Him was not any thingâ€”not one thing."
3. "that was madeâ€”This is a denial of the eternity and non-creation of matter..."

### Albert Barnes:

2. "The 'Word,' or the Son of God, is therefore appropriately called 'God.'"
3. "The work of 'creation' is uniformly ascribed in the Scriptures to the Second Person of the Trinity."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The main conception of creation which is present in the writings of St. John is expressed by the first notice which he makes of it : All things came into being through the Word."
2. "Thus creation (all things came into being through Him) answers to the Incarnation (the Word became flesh). All the unfolding and infolding of finite being to the last issue lies in the fulfillment of His will who is love."
3. "Hence, as Godet remarks, it 'does not lower the Word to the rank of a simple instrument,' but merely implies a different relation to creation on the part of the Father and the Son."

### John Calvin:
1. "In reference to the Son of God, he makes an assertion which strictly and properly applies to his person."

3. "The Evangelist intended to declare expressly, that of those things which have been made there is no exception whatever."

3. "John excludes two heresies (Bernard) that matter is eternal and that angels or aeons had a share in creation."

### John Gill:
1. "Which is to be understood, not of the new creation; for this would be a restraining 'all' things to a 'few' persons only; nor is it any where said, that all things are new made, but made."
2. "Regeneration is denied to be of man, and is always ascribed to God; nor would Christ's being the author of the new creation, be any contradiction to his being the author of the old creation, which is intended here."
3. "without him there was not one single thing in the whole compass of the creation made; and the limitation of it to things that are made; and so excludes the uncreated being, Father, Son, and Spirit; and sin also, which is not a principle made by God, and which has no efficient, but a deficient cause."

### John Wesley:
