# John 1:31 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
John the Baptist, though not personally acquainted with Jesus, had been acquainted with Him from his youth. John's purpose in baptizing was to spiritually prepare people for the knowledge of Jesus. The descent of the Spirit upon Jesus after His baptism served as a sign to John that Jesus was the Messiah. John's ministry aimed to manifest the presence of the Messiah to Israel, and he baptized those who confessed their sins. John's testimony was not based on personal knowledge but on divine inspiration and the command of God.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Both accounts are entirely consistent with the supposition that John had been from youth upwards acquainted with our Lord."
2. "This testimony does not rest upon my long personal acquaintance with Him, but on that which happened during my work of baptizing."
3. "It is evidently only as a spiritual preparation, through repentance, for the knowledge of Him, that John regarded his baptism."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Arise, anoint Him, for this is He!" (1 Samuel 16:12). 
2. "But the sign which he was told to expect was the visible descent of the Spirit upon Him as He emerged out of the baptismal water."
3. "Then, catching up the voice from heaven, 'he saw and bare record that this is the Son of God.'"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "John was not personally acquainted with Jesus...they had had heretofore no personal acquaintance."
2. "He understood that he was to announce that the Messiah was about to appear...but he did not personally know Jesus, or that he was to be the Messiah."
3. "He came to prepare the way for the Messiah, and it now appeared that the Messiah was Jesus of Nazareth."

### John Calvin:
1. "That his testimony may not be suspected of having been given either from friendship or favor, he anticipates such a doubt, by affirming that he had no other knowledge of Christ than what he had obtained by divine inspiration."
2. "The meaning, therefore, amounts to this, that John does not speak at his own suggestion, nor for the favor of man, but by the inspiration of the Spirit and the command of God."
3. "Now since it was necessary that John, in order that he might lawfully baptize, should be sent by God, let it be inferred from this, that it is not in the power of any man whatever to institute sacraments, but that this right belongs to God alone."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "I baptize that I may declare the necessity of that forsaking of sin without which no true manifestation of Jesus can be made to the heart."
2. "The advance of thought from the unrecognised Jesus of John 1:26 to the 'made manifest' of John 1:31 is obvious."
3. "It corresponds with the 'standeth' of John 1:26, and the 'coming unto' him of John 1:29; with the fact, also, that the one is the first, the other the second, testimony of the Baptist."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "He had predicted the Messiah and described him before he met him and baptized him."
2. "The purpose of John's ministry was to manifest to Israel with their spiritual privileges the presence of the Messiah."
3. "Hence he was baptizing in water those who confessed their sins."

### John Gill:
1. "And I knew him not... personally he had never seen him." 
2. "He was not made manifest to the people of Israel in common; nor did they know that the Messiah was come." 
3. "By administering this new ordinance, the people were naturally put upon inquiry after the Messiah."

### John Wesley:
1. "How surprising is this; considering how nearly they were related, and how remarkable the conception and birth of both had been."
2. "But there was a peculiar providence visible in our Saviour's living, from his infancy to his baptism, at Nazareth."
3. "Hereby that acquaintance was prevented which might have made John's testimony of Christ suspected."
