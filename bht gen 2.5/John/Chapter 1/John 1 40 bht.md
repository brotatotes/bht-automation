## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "They enquire after His place of lodging for the night, intending to visit Him there; or perhaps He was then apparently going thither, as it was late in the day. But He furthers their wish by inviting them to follow, and they will see."
2. "Our Evangelist appears always to reckon according to the Jewish method...even among the Romans, the division of the day into twelve equal hours was, though not the civil, the popular way of computing time."
3. "They remained with Him the rest of that day, which would be four or five hours, and need not strictly be limited by sunset."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "His great sensitiveness is touchingly shown in his representation of this first contact with the Lord; the circumstances are present to him in the minutest details; he still remembers the Very hour."
2. "He reports no particulars of those discourses of the Lord by which he was bound to Him for the whole of His life; he allows everything personal to retire."
3. "Peter's brother‚Äîand the elder of the two."

### John Calvin:
1. "The circumstance of Andrew immediately bringing his brother expresses the nature of faith, which does not conceal or quench the light, but rather spreads it in every direction."
2. "Woe to our indolence, therefore, if we do not, after having been fully enlightened, endeavor to make others partakers of the same grace."
3. "We ought also to observe the purpose of God, which determined that Peter, who was to be far more eminent, was brought to the knowledge of Christ by the agency and ministry of Andrew."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Andrew belonged to Bethsaida (John 1:44), and is again referred to in John 6:8, John 12:22." 
2. "That he is now spoken of as the brother of Peter is an interesting indication of the importance attached by the Evangelist to the latter." 
3. "Simon Peter, who has not yet been mentioned, is introduced to us here as if he were well known to the reader, an illustration of the writer‚Äôs tendency to anticipate what is hereafter to be fully explained."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Andrew (ŒëŒΩŒ¥œÅŒµŒ±œÇ). Explained by John as one of the two disciples of the Baptist and identified as the brother of the famous Simon Peter." 
2. "The more formal call of Andrew and Simon, James and John, comes later."
 
3. "That heard John speak (œÑœâŒΩ Œ±Œ∫ŒøœÖœÉŒ±ŒΩœÑœâŒΩ œÄŒ±œÅŒ± ŒôœâŒ±ŒΩŒøœÖ). 'That heard from John,' a classical idiom (œÄŒ±œÅŒ± with ablative after Œ±Œ∫ŒøœÖœâ) seen also in John 6:45; John 7:51; John 8:26; John 8:40; John 15:15."

### John Gill:
