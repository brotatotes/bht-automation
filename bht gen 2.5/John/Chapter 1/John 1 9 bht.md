# John 1:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The true light mentioned here is the genuine, dependable light that guides to safety and does not deceive. It is the Messiah, Christ himself, who enlightens every person and is the source of all real light. This light is not a false, uncertain guide, but one that is true, real, and worthy of confidence. It is the light that shines from itself and by itself, enlightening the whole world. Through this light, even natural men have some perception of the eternal light and are obligated to Christ.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The word ·ºÄŒªŒ∑Œ∏ŒπŒΩœåŒΩ in this connexion imports original, ‚Äòarchetypal,‚Äô and is used of the true genuine sources and patterns of those things which we find here below only in fragmentary imitations and derivations."
2. "Certainly he does not, in any of the passages commonly cited to defend this rendering, ch. John 18:37 (which is spoken by Christ of Himself and His Mission); John 16:21; John 16:28; John 12:46."
3. "We are driven then to the only legitimate rendering, which is to take ·º¶ŒΩ ·ºêœÅœáœåŒºŒµŒΩŒøŒΩ as equivalent to an imperfect came: this usage being frequent in the N.T., see reff.: i.e. at the time when John bore this witness, the true light which lighteth every man, came was in process of manifesting Himself, into the world."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "which, coming into the world, enlighteneth every man" or, is "the Light of the world"
2. "Coming into the world" is a superfluous and quite unusual description of "every man"
3. it is of all descriptions of Christ amongst the most familiar

### Albert Barnes:
1. "That was the true Light - Not John, but the Messiah. He was not a false, uncertain, dangerous guide, but was one that was true, real, steady, and worthy of confidence."
2. "A true light is one that does not deceive us, as the true beacon may guide us into port or warn us of danger. Christ does not lead astray. All false teachers do."
3. "The true light was he who, coming into the world, enlightened every man."

### John Calvin:
1. "Christ is the light, shining from itself and by itself, and enlightening the whole world by its radiance; so that no other source or cause of splendor is anywhere to be found."
2. "He might have reasoned more ingeniously, that Christ, as the eternal light, has a splendor which is natural, and not brought from any other quarter; but instead of doing so, he sends us back to the experience which we all possess."
3. "There is no man, therefore, whom some perception of the eternal light does not reach."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "In every one of these passages the words relate to the Lord Himself: sometimes they are used by the multitude, or by a disciple, as a designation of the Messiah, ‚ÄòHe that should come;‚Äô sometimes they are the words of Jesus or of the Evangelist, in passages which speak of the purpose of His ‚Äòcoming.‚Äô"
2. "We seem bound to believe that he here speaks of the light as ‚Äòcoming into the world.‚Äô If the words are joined with ‚Äòman,‚Äô they add little or nothing to the thought."
3. "No man belongs to the world that is given up to darkness and impenitence, unless he, through resistance and choice of evil, have made the light that was in him to become darkness."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The light the genuine, not a false light of wreckers of ships, but the dependable light that guides to the harbor of safety."
2. "This true light had been on hand all the time in the darkness before John came."
3. "All the real light that men receive comes from Christ, not necessarily that each one receives a special revelation."

### John Gill:
1. "Christ is that light, that famous and excellent light, the fountain of all light to all creatures..."
2. "He is the true light, in distinction from typical lights...and from all the typical light there was in the institutions and sacrifices of the law..."
3. "He is that light which lighteth all sorts of men; which is true in, a spiritual sense...and shows how much men, even natural men, are obliged to Christ, and how great a person he is, and how deserving of praise, honour, and glory."

### John Wesley:
1. "Who lighteth every man." 
2. "By what is vulgarly termed natural conscience, pointing out at least the general lines of good and evil."
3. "And this light, if man did not hinder, would shine more and more to the perfect day."
