## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "·ºêŒºŒ≤œÅŒπŒºŒ¨ŒøŒºŒ±Œπ can bear but one meaning, that of indignor (‚Äúinfremuit,‚Äù Vulg.), the expression of indignation and rebuke, not of sorrow."
2. "Jesus, with the tears of sympathy already rising and overcoming His speech, checked them, so as to be able to speak the words following."
3. "Indignation over unbelief and sin, and death the fruit of sin, doubtless lay in the background; but to see it in the words (with Olsh., Stier, and Trench), seems unnatural."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The tears of Mary and her friends acting sympathetically upon Jesus, and drawing forth His emotions. What a vivid and beautiful outcoming of His 'real' humanity!" (Commentary)
2. "The word here rendered 'groaned' does not mean 'sighed' or 'grieved,' but rather 'powerfully checked his emotion'‚Äîmade a visible effort to restrain those tears which were ready to gush from His eyes." (Commentary)
3. "Troubled himself" (Margin); referring probably to this visible difficulty of repressing His emotions." (Commentary)

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He saw the sorrow of others, and he was also moved with sympathy and love."
2. "The word 'groan' usually, with us, denotes an expression of internal sorrow by a special sound."
3. "This expression denotes that his countenance was troubled, or gave indications of sorrow."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The interpretation which explains tw pneumati as the sphere of feeling is to be preferred."
2. "The nature of the particular emotion of Jesus must remain largely a matter of conjecture."
3. "Probably of the outward manifestation of His strong feeling."

### John Calvin:
1. "He gives proof that he has sympathy, (œÉœÖŒºœÄ·Ω±Œ∏ŒµŒπŒ±.)... By the groaning of his spirit, by a strong feeling of grief, and by tears, he shows that he is as much affected by our distresses as if he had endured them in his own person."
2. "The Son of God, having clothed himself with our flesh, of his own accord clothed himself also with human feelings, so that he did not differ at all from his brethren, sin only excepted."
3. "Christ took our affections into himself, that by his power we may subdue everything in them that is sinful."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "There is little doubt that the first word describing the emotion of Jesus denotes rather anger than sorrow. Such is its regular meaning; and, though New Testament usage partly gives a different turn to the word, yet in every passage it implies a severity of tone and feeling that is very different from grief."
2. "It is more difficult to answer the question, At what was Jesus angry?... at the misery brought into the world by sin. This explanation appears upon the whole to be the most probable."
3. "As to the words ‚Äòin His spirit,‚Äô without entering into any discussion of a difficult subject, we may say that, as ‚Äòthe spirit‚Äô denotes the highest (and so to speak) innermost part of man‚Äôs nature, the language shows that our Lord‚Äôs nature was stirred to its very depth."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Mary's weeping was genuine, that of the Jews was partly perfunctory and professional and probably actual 'wailing' as the verb Œ∫ŒªŒ±Œπœâ can mean. It was an incongruous combination."
2. "He groaned in the spirit... the grief of Mary, Christ's own concern, the problem of the raising of Lazarus--all greatly agitated the spirit of Jesus. He struggled for self-control."
3. "His sympathy with the weeping sister and the wailing crowd caused this deep emotion. Some indignation at the loud wailing would only add to the agitation of Jesus."

### John Gill:
1. "He groaned in the spirit; in his human soul; and which shows, that he had a real human soul, subject to passions, though sinless ones."
2. "The word signifies an inward motion of the mind, through indignation and anger; and it may be partly at the weakness of Mary's faith, and at her immoderate sorrow; and partly at the hypocrisy of the Jews."
3. "Or else this inward groaning was through grief, sympathizing with Mary, and her friends, his human soul being touched with a fellow feeling of their griefs and sorrows."

### John Wesley:
1. "He groaned ‚Äî So he restrained his tears. So he stopped them soon after." 
2. "He troubled himself ‚Äî An expression amazingly elegant, and full of the highest propriety."
3. "For the affections of Jesus were not properly passions, but voluntary emotions, which were wholly in his own power."
