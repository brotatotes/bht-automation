## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Having then said this, although He loved, He abode." 
2. "In all probability Lazarus was dead when He spoke the words." 
3. "Or at all events before the messenger returned."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Beyond all doubt this was just to let things come to their worst, in order to display His glory."
 
2. "Often they are the reverse. When His people are sick, in body or spirit; when their case is waxing more and more desperate every day; when all hope of recovery is about to expire‚Äîjust then and therefore it is that 'He abides two days still in the same place where He is.'"
3. "We have been well taught it, and should not now have the lesson to learn."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He abode two days - Probably Lazarus died soon after the messengers left him. Jesus knew that (John 11:11), and did not hasten to Judea, but remained two days longer where he was, that there might not be the possibility of doubt that he was dead, so that when he came there he had been dead four days, John 11:39."
2. "This shows, moreover, that he intended to raise him up. If he had not, it could hardly be reconciled with friendship thus to remain, without any reason, away from an afflicted family."
3. "One day would be occupied before the message came to him; two days he remained; one day would be occupied by him in going to Bethany; so that Lazarus had been dead four days John 11:39 when he arrived."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "‚ÄòTherefore‚Äô is explained by the two verses which precede..." (John 11:6) 
2. "He cannot accept the moment suggested by man..." (John 11:6) 
3. "He will go to assuage their grief, but only at the moment appointed by the Father‚Äôs will." (John 11:6)

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "That he was sick (ŒøœÑ Œ±œÉŒ∏ŒµŒΩŒµ). Present active indicative retained in indirect discourse after a secondary tense (Œ∑Œ∫ŒøœÖœÉŒµŒΩ)."
2. "Two days (Œ¥œÖŒø Œ∑ŒºŒµœÅŒ±œÇ). Accusative of extent of time."
3. "In the place where he was (ŒµŒΩ œâ Œ∑ŒΩ œÑŒøœÄœâ). Incorporation of the antecedent œÑŒøœÄœâ into the relative clause, 'in which place he was.' It was long enough for Lazarus to die and seemed unlike Jesus to the sisters."

### John Gill:
1. "He did not go directly to him, and to his assistance."
2. "This he did to try the faith and patience of the sisters of Lazarus."
3. "The miracle of raising him from the dead might be the more manifest, and his own glory might be the more illustrious."
