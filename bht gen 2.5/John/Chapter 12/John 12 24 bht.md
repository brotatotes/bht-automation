# John 12:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The analogy of a grain of wheat falling into the ground and dying is used to illustrate the necessity of Jesus' death and the resulting fruitfulness. His death was not accidental, but a deliberate act determined by God for His glory and the redemption of humanity. This concept of life springing forth from death is a paradox that is central to the Christian ideal of sacrifice. It contrasts with the pagan belief that death is finality, highlighting the unique and transformative power of Jesus' death.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The grain of wheat perishes, and is not apparent (as the seeds of dicotyledonous plants are) in the new plant."
2. "The saying is more than a mere parabolic similitude: the divine Will, which has fixed the law of the springing up of the wheat-corn, has also determined the law of the glorification of the Son of Man, and the one in analogy with the other: i.e. both through Death."
3. "Œ±·ΩêœÑ·Ω∏œÇ ŒºœåŒΩŒøœÇ, by itself alone, with its life uncommunicated, lived only within its own limits, and not passing on."

1. "Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone; but if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit." 
2. "The necessity of His death is here brightly expressed, and its proper operation and fruit‚Äîlife springing forth out of death‚Äîimaged forth by a beautiful and deeply significant law of the vegetable kingdom." 
3. "For a double reason, no doubt, this was uttered‚Äîto explain what he had said of His death, as the hour of His own glorification, and to sustain His own Spirit under the agitation which was mysteriously coming over it in the view of that death."

### Albert Barnes:

2. "By this he still keeps before them the truth that he was to be glorified, but he delicately and beautifully introduces the idea still that he must die."
3. "Jesus intimates that it was only by his death that he would be glorified in the salvation of men, and in the honors and rewards of heaven."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The selection of the corn of wheat as an illustration acquires a peculiar interest from the fact of its being addressed to Greeks, familiar with the Eleusinian mysteries celebrated in their own country."
2. "All this was preparatory to the great Eleusinia, in which the risen Dionysus in the freshness of his second life was conducted from Athens to Eleusis in joyful procession."
3. "These features of the mysteries set forth, and with the same symbol as that employed by Christ here, the crude pagan conception of life rising out of death."

### John Calvin:
1. "Christ compares his death to sowing, which appears to tend to the destruction of the wheat, but yet is the cause of far more abundant increase."
2. "That dreadful appearance of disgrace and cursing, which appears in the death of Christ, not only obscures his glory, but removes it altogether from our view."
3. "When, therefore, the godly are distressed by various afflictions, when they are pressed hard by the difficulties of their situation, let them unceasingly consider that this is a sowing which, in due time, will yield fruit."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Except the corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth itself alone; but if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit." 
2. "Absolute death, destruction of the principle of life, is not implied. The seed does not actually die: its old covering dies that the germ of life within may spring up in higher forms of beauty, and with many grains instead of one."

2. "The death of Christ is volunta

### John Wesley:
