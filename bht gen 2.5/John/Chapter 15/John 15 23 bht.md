# John 15:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
To reject Jesus is to reject God Himself, as Christ is the manifestation of the Father to His creatures. The weight of sin is revealed in those who dishonor Christ, for to dishonor Him is to dishonor God. The union between Jesus and the Father is so inseparable that one cannot hate Jesus without also hating God. The world's hatred towards the followers of Christ is, in essence, hatred towards Christ and His Father. However, the children of God and disciples of Christ can find comfort in knowing that they are conquerors through their suffering.
