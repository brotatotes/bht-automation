# John 16:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Holy Spirit convicts the world of sin, righteousness, and judgment. The righteousness being referred to is not the individual's own righteousness, but the righteousness of Christ. The Spirit convinces people that in Christ, they have perfect relief from the sense of sin. Jesus going to the Father is the evidence of His perfect acceptance on our behalf. Without the Holy Spirit, people are unable to behold Jesus with spiritual vision and lose the sense of righteousness. The Spirit reveals the glory, excellency, and suitableness of Christ's righteousness through the Gospel.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "the conviction being of a sin that is theirs, a righteousness that is (or, in the case of condemnation, might have been) theirs, a judgment which is theirs."
2. "Not their own, but that of the accepted Man Christ Jesus standing at the right hand of God, manifested in the hearts of men by the Spirit to be their only righteousness"
3. "It is the ὑπάγειν πρὸς τὸν πατέρα by which this righteousness is assured to us, and by the effect of which, the Spirit, the conviction respecting it is wrought in our hearts"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Beyond doubt, it is Christ's personal righteousness which the Spirit was to bring home to the sinner's heart."
2. "But if He was the 'Faithful and True Witness,' the Father's 'Righteous Servant,' 'His Elect, in whom His soul delighted,' then was His departure to the Father, and consequent disappearance from the view of men, but the fitting consummation, the august reward, of all that He did here below, the seal of His mission, the glorification of the testimony which He bore on earth."
3. "Thus the Spirit, in this clause, is seen convincing men that there is in Christ perfect relief under the sense of sin of which He had before convinced them; and so far from mourning over His absence from us, as an irreparable loss, we learn to glory in it, as the evidence of His perfect acceptance on our behalf."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He was soon to be arraigned on heavy charges, and condemned by the highest authority of the nation as guilty. Yet, though condemned, he says that the Holy Spirit would descend and convince the world that he was innocent."
2. "God would not raise up an impostor. If he had been truly guilty, as the Jews who condemned him pretended, God would not have set his seal to the imposture by raising him from the dead..."
3. "One of the deepest feelings which an awakened sinner has, is his conviction of the righteousness of Jesus Christ. He sees that he is holy; that his own opposition to him has been unprovoked, unjust, and base; and it is this which so often overwhelms his soul with the conviction of his own unworthiness, and with earnest desires to obtain a better righteousness than his own."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. I go [υπαγω] . Withdraw from their sight and earthly fellowship. See on 8 21, and footnote. 
Ye see [θεωρειτε] . Rev., behold. See on 1 18.


### John Calvin:
1. "It is undoubtedly the peculiar office of the Law to summon consciences to the judgment-seat of God, and to strike them with terror; but the Gospel cannot be preached in a proper manner, till it lead men from sin to righteousness, and from death to life."
2. "By righteousness must here be understood that which is imparted to us through the grace of Christ."
3. "Now the Spirit declares, by the Gospel, that this is the only way in which we are accounted righteous."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Without the Holy Spirit they are unable to behold Jesus with the spiritual vision."
2. "Without Christ they lose the sense of righteousness."
3. "New morals" include "immorality, loose views of marriage, etc."

### John Gill:
1. "The effusion of the Spirit in that extraordinary manner upon the disciples, showed that he was gone to the Father, and had received from him the promise of the Holy Ghost, which he then shed abroad." 
2. "The proof of his having wrought out this [mediatorial righteousness], lies in his going to the Father; for as this was the work he came about, the will of his Father he came to do, had he not done it, it is reasonable to think he would never have met with such a welcome from him." 
3. "The Spirit of God proceeds to convince men of the glory, excellency, fulness, and suitableness of the righteousness of Christ; which he does, by revealing it to them in the Gospel, setting it before them, and working faith in them to lay hold upon it."

### John Wesley:
1. "Of righteousness, because I go to my Father — Which the Spirit will testify, though ye do not then see me."
2. "But I could not go to him if I were not righteous."
