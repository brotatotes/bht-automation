## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The Lord does pray distinctly for ·ΩÅ Œ∫œåœÉŒºŒøœÇ, John 17:21; John 17:23, that they may believe and know that the Father hath sent Him. He cannot therefore mean here that He does not pray (absolutely) for the world, but that He is not now asking for the world, does not pray this thing for the world." 
2. "These (Œø·ΩìœÇ Œ¥Œ≠Œ¥œâŒ∫Œ¨œÇ ŒºŒøŒπ) have already believed and known; the prayer for them is therefore a different one, viz. that in John 17:11; John 17:15."
3. "·ΩÖœÑŒπ œÉŒøŒØ Œµ·º∞œÉŒπŒΩ in a fuller sense than œÉŒø·Ω∂ ·º¶œÉŒ±ŒΩ, John 17:6. That was their preparation for Christ; this is their abiding in Him, which is abiding in the Father, see next verse."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "I pray for them‚Äînot as individuals merely, but as representatives of all such in every succeeding age."
2. "not for the world‚Äîfor they had been given Him 'out of the world' (John 17:1- :), and had been already transformed into the very opposite of it."
3. "The things sought for them, indeed, are applicable only to such."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. I pray [ŒµœÅœâœÑœâ] . More strictly, I make request. See on 16 23. The I is emphatic, as throughout the prayer.


### John Calvin:
1. "He openly declares that he does not pray for the world, because he has no solicitude but about his own flock, which he received from the hand of the Father."
2. "We ought to pray that this man, and that man, and every man, may be saved, and thus include the whole human race, because we cannot yet distinguish the elect from the reprobate."
3. "A grievous injury, therefore, is inflicted on believers by those persons who endeavor to blot out the knowledge of election from the hearts of believers, because they deprive them of the pleading and intercession of the Son of God."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "He now proceeds directly to pray for them; and the substance of His prayer is that they, occupying His place, may be so preserved as to be what He had been, true to the word given them, victorious over the devil, consecrated, filled with joy, to His glory and the glory of the Father in Him."
2. "Without denouncing the ‚Äòworld,‚Äô therefore, He simply sets it aside. It may indeed be asked, Why mention it at all? The answer probably is, to bring out that perfect correspondence between the will of the Son and of the Father, which is the ground of the Son‚Äôs confidence in prayer."
3. "Because they are thine. In John 17:6 it had been ‚ÄòThey were thine:‚Äô then they had been looked at only as the possession of the Father. Now ‚Äòthey are thine:‚Äô they have been brought back to Him and united to Him in a closer, dearer bond than ever, the bond of fellowship in the Son."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "I pray...Not for the world." 
2. "God loves the whole world...Christ died for sinners...and intercedes for sinners."
3. "A condensed and common Greek idiom for...the demonstrative antecedent...and the relative attracted..."

### John Gill:
1. "This is to be understood of Christ, not as God; for as such he is the object of prayer; nor need he pray to any other; nor is there any superior to him under that consideration to pray unto; but as man and Mediator."
2. "the persons he is here said to pray for are his apostles; which shows their danger and their wants, his care over them, and concern for them, and his love unto them"
3. "for whom he is the propitiation, he is an advocate; and for whom he died, he makes intercession; and for no other in a spiritual saving way"

### John Wesley:
1. "I pray not for the world ‚Äî Not in these petitions, which are adapted to the state of believers only." 
2. "He prays for the world at John 17:21,23, that they may believe - That they may know God hath sent him."
3. "This no more proves that our Lord did not pray for the world, both before and afterward, than his praying for the apostles alone, John 17:6-19, proves that he did not pray for them also which shall believe through their word, John 17:20."
