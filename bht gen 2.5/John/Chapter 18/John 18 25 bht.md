### John Calvin:
1. "How shocking the stupidity of Peter, who, after having denied his Master, not only has no feeling of repentance, but hardens himself by the very indulgence he takes in sinning!"
2. "If each of them in his turn had asked him, he would not have hesitated to deny his Master a thousand times."
3. "There is nothing better for us, therefore, than to be early on our guard, that he who is tempted by Satan, while he is yet uncorrupted, may not allow himself the smallest indulgence."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "He is no longer only near the door; he is within the court. He is no longer only in the cold; he is warming himself at the charcoal fire. He is no longer only with John; he is along with the servants and officers of the Jews." 
2. "Everything corresponds to that more determined, that double, denial of our Lord now to be described."

1. "Two periphrastic imperfects precisely as in verse John 18:18, vivid renewal of the picture drawn there."

2. "Men are too often more concerned for their bodies than their souls; Satan baits his temptations for the fleshly and sensitive part."
3. "This denial of his being a disciple of Christ, as before, did not arise from a sense of his unworthiness to be one; nor from diffidence and distrust of a right to such a character; but from the fear of men; and being ashamed of Christ, he denies that which was his great mercy, privilege, and glory."
