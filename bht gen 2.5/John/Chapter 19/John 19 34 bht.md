## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The spear perhaps pierced the pericardium or envelope of the heart, in which case a liquid answering the description of ·ΩïŒ¥œâœÅ may have flowed with the blood."
2. "It is more probable that the fact, which is here so strongly testified, was a consequence of the extreme exhaustion of the Body of the Redeemer."
3. "His view after all seems to be the safe and true one that the circumstance is related as a miraculous sign, having deep significance as to the work of the Redeemer, and shewing Him to be more than mortal."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "But one of the soldiers‚Äîto make assurance of the fact doubly sure."
2. "Had life still remained, it must have fled now."
3. "It is now well known that the effect of long-continued and intense agony is frequently to produce a secretion of a colorless lymph within the pericardium."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "There can be no doubt that such a stroke from the strong arm of a Roman soldier would have caused death, if he had not been already dead."
2. "The conclusion is inevitable that death would have been the consequence of such a blow."
3. "This fact it was of importance to prove, that it might not be pretended that he had only suffered a syncope, or had fainted. This John establishes."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The question has been raised whether the Evangelist means to describe a gash or a prick."
2. "It has been suggested that the body was merely pricked with the spear to ascertain if it were yet alive."
3. "I think, however, with Meyer, that John evidently intends to describe the incident as something entirely unexpected and marvelous."

### John Calvin:
1. "The sacraments which Christ has left to his Church have the same design; for the purification and sanctification of the soul, which consists in newness of life, is pointed out to us in Baptism, and the Lord‚Äôs Supper is the pledge of a perfect atonement."
2. "When Baptism and the Lord‚Äôs Supper lead us to Christ‚Äôs side, that by faith we may draw from it, as from a fountain, what they represent, then are we truly washed from our pollutions, and renewed to a holy life, and then do we truly live before God, redeemed from death, and delivered from condemnation."
3. "The fulfillment of both of these graces is in Christ; and here he presents to us a visible token of the same fact."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "With a spear (ŒªŒøŒ≥œáŒ∑). Instrumental case of this old word, here only in the N.T."
2. "Pierced his side (Œ±œÖœÑŒøœÖ œÑŒ∑ŒΩ œÄŒªŒµœÖœÅŒ±ŒΩ ŒµŒΩœÖŒæŒµŒΩ). First aorist active indicative of ŒΩœÖœÉœÉœâ, old word to pierce, here only in N.T."
3. "Blood and water (Œ±ŒπŒºŒ± Œ∫Œ± œÖŒ¥œâœÅ). Dr. W. Stroud (Physical Cause of the Death of Christ) argues that this fact proves that the spear pierced the left side of Jesus near the heart and that Jesus had died literally of a broken heart since blood was mixed with water."

### John Gill:
1. "this the soldier did, partly out of spite to Christ, and partly to know whether he was really dead; and which was so ordered by divine providence, that it might beyond all doubt appear that he really died" 
2. "it seems rather to be something supernatural, from the asseverations the evangelist makes"
3. "they signify the blessings of sanctification and justification, the grace of the one being represented by water, as it frequently is in the Old and New Testament, and the other by blood, and both from Christ."

### John Wesley:
1. "It was strange, seeing he was dead, that blood should come out; more strange, that water also; and most strange of all, that both should come out immediately, at one time, and yet distinctly."
2. "It was pure and true water, as well as pure and true blood."
3. "The asseveration of the beholder and testifier of it, shows both the truth and greatness of the miracle and mystery."
