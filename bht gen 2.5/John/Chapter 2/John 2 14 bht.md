## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "This market appears to have sprung up since the captivity, with a view to the convenience of those Jews who came from a distance, to provide them with the beasts for offering, and to change their foreign money into the sacred shekel, which alone was allowed to be paid in for the temple capitation-tax." 
2. "The very fact of the market being held there would produce an unseemly mixture of sacred and profane transactions, even setting aside the abuses which would be certain to be mingled with the traffic." 
3. "It is to the former of these evils that our Lord makes reference in this first cleansing; in the second , to the latter."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "in the templeâ€”not the temple itself, but the temple-court."
2. "sold oxen, &amp;c.â€”for the convenience of those who had to offer them in sacrifice."
3. "changers of moneyâ€”of Roman into Jewish money, in which the temple dues had to be paid."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "One great design of his coming was to reform the abuses which had crept into that worship, and to bring man to a proper regard for the glory of God."
2. "If it be asked how it was that those engaged in this traffic so readily yielded to Jesus of Nazareth, and that they left their gains and their property, and fled from the temple at the command of one so obscure as he was, it may be replied."
3. "Though Jesus thus purified the temple at the commencement of his ministry, yet in three years the same scene was to be repeated."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The temple inclosure : not the sanctuary." 
2. "Matthew and Mark use lubisthv (see ver. 15), of which the meaning is substantially the same so far as regards the dealing in small coin; but with the difference that kollubov, the noun from which it is derived, and meaning a small coin, is also used to denote the rate of exchange."
3. "John's picture of this incident is more graphic and detailed than those of the Synoptists, who merely state summarily the driving out of the traders and the overthrow of the tables."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "At all times, and especially at the passover, the temple was frequented by numerous worshippers, who required animals that might be offered in sacrifice." 
2. "The law prescribed the nature of each sacrifice, and enjoined that all animals presented to the Lord should be 'without blemish,' a requirement which 'the tradition of the elders' expanded into minute detail."
3. "The annual tribute which every man of Israel was bound to pay to the temple treasury could be paid only in the half-shekel â€˜of the sanctuaryâ€™. All who came from other lands, therefore, or who had not with them the precise coin, must resort to the exchangers, who were permitted to do their business in the temple during the three weeks preceding the passover."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Those that sold (Ï„Î¿Ï…Ï‚ Ï€Ï‰Î»Î¿Ï…Î½Ï„Î±Ï‚). They were in the Court of the Gentiles within the temple precinct, but not in the Î½Î±Î¿Ï‚ or temple proper."
2. "Probably their very presence in his Father's house angered Jesus."
3. "Here it is an obvious protest by Christ at the beginning of his ministry as in the Synoptics it is an indignant outcry against the desecration."

### John Gill:
1. "Into this all strangers might come; and the passover now being at hand, here were those that sold oxen, and sheep, and doves."
2. "The oxen, or bullocks, were for the Chagigah, or feast kept on the second day of the passover; and the sheep, or lambs, as the Persic version reads, for the passover supper; and the doves were for the offerings of the poorer sort of new mothers."
3. "The changers of money sitting: who changed foreign money into the current coin of the Jews, strangers coming, at this feast, from several parts of the world."

### John Wesley:
1. "Oxen, and sheep, and doves â€” Used for sacrifice."
2. "And the changers of money - Those who changed foreign money for that which was current at Jerusalem."
3. "For the convenience of them that came from distant countries."
