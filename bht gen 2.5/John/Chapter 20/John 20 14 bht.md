# John 20:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Mary, consumed by grief, did not recognize Jesus standing before her. Her tears acted as a veil, obscuring His presence. As she looked into the tomb, she saw two angels in white, indicating that they had finished their task and were waiting to deliver a message. Mary, however, was not aware of their presence. It was only when Jesus spoke her name that she turned and recognized Him. This highlights the importance of spiritual fellowship and affinity in recognizing the presence of Christ. Sometimes, even when Christ is with us, we fail to perceive Him due to our expectations and limited understanding.
