The exalted serpent of brass in the wilderness is compared to the exalted Son of Man, Jesus Christ. The serpent represents the devil, who brings death through his poison.

By looking to Jesus in faith, even the weakest and most distant, one can find instant healing for the perishing soul.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The comparison lies between the exalted serpent of brass, and the exalted Son of Man. The brazen serpent sets forth the Redeemer."
2. "The ‚Äòserpent‚Äô is in Scripture symbolism, the devil, from the historical temptation in Genesis 3:0. downwards. But why is the devil set forth by the serpent? How does the bite of the serpent operate? It pervades with its poison the frame of its victim: that frame becomes poisoned: and death ensues."
3. "Now was not the Lord Jesus made ·ºêŒΩ ·ΩÅŒºŒøŒπœéŒºŒ±œÑŒπ œÉŒ±œÅŒ∫·Ω∏œÇ ·ºÅŒºŒ±œÅœÑŒØŒ±œÇ, Rom 8:3? Was not He made ‚ÄòSin for us, who knew no sin‚Äô (2Co 5:21)? Did not He, on His Cross, make an open shew of, and triumph over, the Enemy, so that it was as if the Enemy himself had been nailed to that Cross (Col 2:15)?"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "In both cases the remedy is conspicuously displayed; in the one case on a pole, in the other on the cross, to 'draw all men unto Him'." (John 12:32)
2. "Both methods are stumbling to human reason...As the serpent was God's ordinance for the cure of every bitten Israelite, so is Christ for the salvation of every perishing sinner‚Äîthe one however a purely arbitrary ordinance, the other divinely adapted to man's complicated maladies."
3. "As one simple look at the serpent, however distant and however weak, brought an instantaneous cure, even so, real faith in the Lord Jesus, however tremulous, however distant‚Äîbe it but real faith‚Äîbrings certain and instant healing to the perishing soul."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Men are sinners. There is no cure by human means for the maladies of the soul; and as the people who were bitten might look on the image of the serpent and be healed, so may sinners look to the Saviour and be cured of the moral maladies of our nature."
2. "Lifted up - Erected on a pole. Placed on high, So that it might be seen by the people."
3. "Even so - In a similar manner and with a similar design. He here refers, doubtless, to his own death. Compare John 12:32; John 8:28."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Must signifies the eternal necessity in the divine counsels." 
2. "The reference here is to the crucifixion, but beyond that, to the glorification of Christ."
3. "Hence the believer overcomes the world through faith in Him who came not by water only, but by water and blood."

### John Calvin:
1. "He testifies that he will be openly and publicly manifested to all, that he may diffuse his power over men of every class."
2. "Christ is clearly exhibited to us in the Gospel, in order that no man may complain of obscurity; and that this manifestation is common to all."
3. "As it was only the outward appearance of a serpent, but contained nothing within that was pestilential or venomous, so Christ clothed himself with the form of sinful flesh, which yet was pure and free from all sin."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Jesus draws a vivid parallel between the act of Moses and the Cross on which he himself 'must' be lifted up." 
2. "In John œÖœàŒøœâ always refers to the Cross."
3. "Jesus is complimenting the standing and intelligence of Nicodemus as "the teacher of Israel" by telling him this great truth and fact that lies at the basis of the work of the kingdom of God."

### John Gill:
1. "There is, in many things, an agreement between this serpent, and Jesus Christ."
2. "Christ was sent, in the likeness of sinful flesh, and was found in fashion as a man, as a sinful man, but was without sin, and was perfectly holy."
3. "Just as the Israelites looked to the serpent in the wilderness for healing, so must sinners look to the crucified Christ for salvation."

### John Wesley:
1. And as Moses ‚Äî And even this single witness will soon be taken from you; yea, and in a most ignominious manner. Numbers 21:8,9.

- Attempt 1 BHT: John 3:14 draws a parallel between the exalted serpent of brass in the wilderness and the exalted Son of Man, Jesus Christ. The serpent symbolizes the devil, who brings death through his poison. Similarly, Jesus, who knew no sin, was made sin for us on the cross, triumphing over the enemy. Just as the serpent was displayed on a pole to draw all men to it, so the crucifixion of Christ draws all men to Him for salvation. By looking to Jesus in faith, even the weakest and most distant, one can find instant healing for the perishing soul. The lifting up of Jesus on the cross signifies the eternal necessity in God's divine counsels and points to His glorification. Jesus compliments Nicodemus, the teacher of Israel, by revealing this great truth that forms the foundation of God's kingdom. The act of Moses lifting up the serpent is paralleled with the cross on which Jesus must be lifted up, emphasizing the centrality of the crucifixion in His work. Just as the people in the wilderness could be healed by looking at the serpent, sinners can be cured of their moral maladies by looking to Jesus, the Savior. The lifting up of the serpent on a pole made it visible to the people, and in a similar manner, Jesus' death on the cross is a visible manifestation of His power and love for all.
