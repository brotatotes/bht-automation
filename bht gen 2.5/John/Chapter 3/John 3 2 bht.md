## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "the persecutions and murder of the Prince of Life hence found their greatest aggravation, that they were carried on against the conclusions of their own minds, out of bitter malice, and worldly disappointment at His humble and unobtrusive character, and the spiritual purity and self-sacrifice which He inculcated."
2. "there is involved in this word a recognition by Nicodemus of the Messianic mission of Jesus: that it expresses His being ·ΩÅ ·ºêœÅœáœåŒºŒµŒΩŒøœÇ"
3. "No one can do, &c. unless we expect some strong expression of the truth, such as we had from Nathanael in ch. John 1:50, but the sentence drops to merely 'God be with him' which is a very poor and insufficient exponent of ·ºÄœÄ·Ω∏ Œ∏. ·ºêŒªŒÆŒªœÖŒ∏Œ±œÇ."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "One of those superficial 'believers' mentioned in John 2:23; John 2:24..."
2. "...he avows his conviction that He was come from God‚Äîan expression never applied to a merely human messenger..."
3. "Thus, while unable to repress his convictions, he is afraid of committing himself too far."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Scarcely any man, of any rank, will refuse to converse on this subject when addressed respectfully and tenderly in private."
2. "We should not be disposed to blame men where Jesus did not, and we should desire to find goodness in every man rather than be ever on the search for evil motives."
3. "Miracles show that a prophet or religious teacher comes from God, because God would nor work a miracle in attestation of a falsehood or to give countenance to a false teacher."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "By night, 'when Jewish superstition would keep men at home.' He could reach Jesus' apartment without being observed..."
2. "We may be sure that a member of the sect that carefully scrutinized the Baptist's credentials would not lightly acknowledge Him as teacher."
3. "Assured conviction based on Jesus' miracles. It is from God that thou hast come."

### John Calvin:
1. "He came to Jesus by night. From the circumstance of his coming by night we infer that his timidity was excessive; for his eyes were dazzled, as it were, by the splendor of his own greatness and reputation."
2. "Master, we know that thou art come to be a teacher." 
3. "God may justly permit this to be done, that those who deserve it may be deceived by the enchantments of Satan. But I say that this does not hinder the elect from perceiving in miracles the power of God, which is to them an undoubted confirmation of true and sound doctrine."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Every word here is of importance."
2. "The confession of Nicodemus was made in the name of others besides himself."
3. "The faith indeed which rested on these alone was imperfect, but it was faith; more could be gained; the faith could be educated, raised higher, and made more complete."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Jesus had already provoked the opposition of the ecclesiastics by his assumption of Messianic authority over the temple."
2. "Thou hast come from God as a teacher."
3. "He wanted to know more of the teaching accredited thus by God."

### John Gill:
1. "since Christ would not trust himself with those that believed in him upon seeing his miracles... it was necessary... that he should take this method."
2. "salutations among the Jews, were forbidden in the night... but here was no such danger; nor was this salutation made in the street, and in the dark."
3. "Jesus... came from God, and had his mission and commission from him... supported by the following reason: for no man can do these miracles that thou dost, [except] God be with him."

### John Wesley:
1. The same came ‚Äî Through desire; but by night - Through shame: We know - Even we rulers and Pharisees.
