# John 3:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
After His conversation with Nicodemus, Jesus left Jerusalem and went to the rural parts of Judea. He did not personally administer baptism, but His disciples did so under His direction and authority.

The mention of Jesus baptizing here is unique, as it is not mentioned elsewhere. The baptism performed by Jesus and His disciples likely involved immersion, but the focus should be on the spiritual truth and the Lord's appointment rather than the outward rite.
