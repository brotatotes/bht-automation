# John 4:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Samaritans were deficient in their understanding of God and His worship, as they rejected the prophets and the Psalms. In contrast, the Jews had a fuller revelation of God and were entrusted with the true form of worship. Salvation, even in the Old Testament, was bound up with Christ and came out of the Jewish people. The Samaritans worshiped without knowledge, while the Jews worshiped what they knew. It is important to worship God with knowledge and not to substitute idols or imaginations in place of the true God.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "But he will not leave the temple of Zion and the worship appointed by God without His testimony."
2. "The neuter ὅ is used to shew the want of personality and distinctness in their idea of God: the second ὅ , merely as corresponding to it in the other member of the sentence."
3. "It was in this point especially, expectation of the promised salvation by the great Deliverer (see Gen 49:18 ), that the Samaritan rejection of the prophetic word had made them so deficient in comparison of the Jews."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Without any revealed authority, and so very much in the dark."
2. "Salvation was not a thing left to be reached by any one who might vaguely desire it of a God of mercy, but something that had been revealed, prepared, deposited with a particular people."
3. "Must be sought in connection with, and as issuing from them; and that people, 'the Jews'."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Ye worship ye know not what...They were not obeying the true God, nor offering the worship which he had commanded or would approve."
2. "We know...because God had commanded it; because they worshipped in a place appointed by God, and because they did it in accordance with the direction and teaching of the prophets."
3. "Salvation is of the Jews...Jesus thus affirms that the Jews had the true form of the worship of God."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The neuter expresses the unreal and impersonal character of the Samaritan worship."
2. "Jesus here identifies Himself with the Jewish people. The essence of the true Jewish worship is represented by Him."
3. "Even the Old Testament idea of salvation is bound up with Christ."

### John Calvin:
1. "You worship what you know not, we worship what we know. This is a sentence worthy of being remembered, and teaches us that we ought not to attempt any thing in religion rashly or at random; because, unless there be knowledge, it is not God that we worship, but a phantom or idol."
2. "For Christ, defending the person and cause of his nation, shows that the Jews are widely different from the Samaritans. And why? Because salvation is from the Jews. By these words he means that they have the superiority in this respect, that God had made with them a covenant of eternal salvation."
3. "Hence it follows that all who forsake the word fall into idolatry; for Christ plainly testifies that an idol, or an imagination of their own brain, is substituted for God, when men are ignorant of the true God."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The Samaritans did really worship God, there is no slur cast on the intention and aim of their worship; their error consisted in clinging to an imperfect revelation of Him, receiving Moses but rejecting the prophets."
2. "He who knew not God as thus revealing and giving salvation did not really know Him."
3. "'The Salvation' is that foretold in Scripture, and long waited for."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The Samaritans rejected the prophets and the Psalms and so cut themselves off from the fuller knowledge of God."
2. "The Jews, as the chosen people, had fuller revelations of God. But even so the Jews as a whole failed to recognize God in Christ."
3. "The salvation, the Messianic salvation which had long been the hope and guiding star of the chosen people. It was for the whole world, but it comes 'out of' the Jews. This tremendous fact should never be forgotten, however unworthy the Jews may have proved of their privilege. The Messiah, God's Son, was a Jew."

### John Gill:
1. "Ye worship ye know not what."
2. "The true worshippers among the Jews...knew God, whom they worshipped, spiritually and savingly."
3. "For salvation is of the Jews."

### John Wesley:
1. "Ye worship ye know not what." 
2. "Salvation is from the Jews."
