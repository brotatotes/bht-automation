## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Had the words been spoken at a time when it wanted four months to the harvest, and had our Lord intended to express this, is it conceivable that He should have thus introduced the remark? Would not, must not, the question have been a direct one in that case ‚Äòare there not four months?‚Äô"
2. "To get the meaning of the latter part of the verse, we must endeavour to follow, as far as may be, the train of thought which pervades the discourse. He that soweth the good seed is the Son of Man: our Lord had now been employed in this His work."
3. "Taking this view, I do not believe there was any allusion to the actual state of the fields at that time. The words ·ºêœÄŒ¨œÅŒ±œÑŒµ Œ∫. œÑ. Œª. are of course to be understood literally; they were to lift up their eyes and look on the lands around them; and then came the assurance; ‚Äòthey are whitening already towards the harvest.'"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "In that sense, they are even now white to harvest, ready for the sickle."
2. "The simple beauty of this language is only surpassed by the glow of holy emotion in the Redeemer's own soul which it expresses."
3. "Oh, could we but so, 'lift up our eyes and look' upon many fields abroad and at home, which to dull sense appear unpromising... what movements, as yet scarce in embryo, and accessions to Christ, as yet seemingly far distant, might we not discern as quite near at hand."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The husbandman, when he sows his seed, is compelled to wait a considerable period before it produces a crop. He is encouraged in sowing it; he expects fruit; his labor is lightened by that expectation; but it is not 'immediate' - it is remote. But it is not so with my preaching."
2. "There is as much encouragement to attempt to save souls as the farmer has to raise a crop."
3. "We are to expect revivals of religion. Here was one instance of it under the Saviour‚Äôs own preaching. Multitudes were excited, moved, and came to learn the way of life."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Ye say, it is yet four months to harvest. There are four months. Properly, it is a space of four months." 
2. "The crowd of Samaritans now pouring out toward the well was to Jesus as a ripe harvest - field, prefiguring the larger harvest of mankind which would be reaped by His disciples."
3. "Together signifies not in common, but simultaneously. So quickly does the harvest follow the gospel - seed sown among the Samaritans, that the sower and the reaper rejoice together."

### John Calvin:
1. "When the corn is ripe, the harvest cannot bear delay, for otherwise the grain would fall to the ground and be lost; and, in like manner, the spiritual corn being now ripe, he declares that there must be no delay, because delay is injurious." 
2. "By this expression,Do you not say? he intended indirectly to point out how much more attentive the minds of men are to earthly than to heavenly things; for they burn with so intense a desire of harvest that they carefully reckon up months and days, but it is astonishing how drowsy and indolent they are in gathering the heavenly wheat."
3. "And daily experience proves that this wickedness not only is natural to us, but can scarcely be torn from our hearts; for while all provide for the earthly life to a distant period, how indolent are we in thinking about heavenly things?"

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Lo! I say unto you, Lift up your eyes, and behold the fields, that they are white for harvesting."
2. "Yet, distant as must have seemed the harvest to the disciples when they looked upon the fields, far more distant would seem the day when Samaritans could be gathered in to the garner of the Lord."
3. "He saw the preparation of their hearts, the impression made by the woman‚Äôs message, the faith which His own words would immediately bring forth; nay, He saw a harvest far more glorious than that of this day‚Äôs labours, even that of the salvation of the world."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "It is not possible to tell whether Jesus is alluding to a rural proverb of which nothing is known about there being four months from seedtime to harvest or whether he means that it was then actually four months to harvest." 
2. "The use of ŒµœÑ (yet) and the fact that the space between seedtime and harvest is longer than four months argue against the proverb idea."
3. "The Samaritans could already be seen approaching and they were the field 'white for harvest.'"

### John Gill:
1. "Behold, I say unto you, lift up your eyes, and look on the fields: for they are white already to harvest." 
2. "Christ here speaks... of a harvest of souls."
3. "He suggests to them, that it was not a time for eating and drinking, but for working, since here was such a number of souls to be gathered in."

### John Wesley:
1. The fields are white already ‚Äî As if he had said, The spiritual harvest is ripe already. The Samaritans, ripe for the Gospel, covered the ground round about them.
