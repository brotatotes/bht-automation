## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "But it is hardly safe in this Gospel to mark the inference in Œø·ΩñŒΩ so strongly: it is St. John‚Äôs habitual particle of sequence, even where that sequence is not strictly logical, only temporal, and thus in God‚Äôs purposes, no doubt, consequential."
2. "Origen thinks he may have been one of the household of C√¶sar, having some business in Jud√¶a at that time. But the usage of Josephus is perhaps our surest guide."
3. "He uses Œ≤Œ±œÉ . to distinguish the soldiers, or courtiers, or officers of the kings (Herods or others), from those of Rome , but never to designate the royal family."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "nobleman‚Äîcourtier, king's servant, or one connected with a royal household"
2. "heard that Jesus was come out of Judea"
3. "come down‚Äîfor Capernaum was down on the northwest shore of the Sea of Galilee"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "One who was of the royal family, connected by birth with Herod Antipas; or one of the officers of the court, whether by birth allied to him or not."
2. "It seems that his ordinary residence was at Capernaum."
3. "Capernaum was about a day‚Äôs journey from Cana, where Jesus then was."

### John Calvin:
1. "This is expressly mentioned by the Evangelist, because the rank of this personage made the miracle the more illustrious."
2. "I acknowledge indeed that, at that time, they gave the name of Reguli (or, little kings) to those who are now called Dukes, or Barons, or Earls."
3. "I think that he was some nobleman of the court of Herod; for there is some plausibility in the opinion of those who think that he was sent by Caesar."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "His coming revives the fame of that first miracle, and the report of His arrival quickly spreads."
2. "This officer was probably in the (civil or military) service of Herod Antipas, a Tetrarch, but often styled a king."
3. "The officer himself may have been in attendance on the court in Tiberias, but his son (probably an only son, as the Greek literally means ‚Äòof whom the son . . .‚Äô) was lying ill at Capernaum."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "That outstanding first miracle would still be remembered in Cana and would indicate that Jesus had some friends there."
2. "Nobleman (Œ≤Œ±œÉŒπŒªŒπŒ∫ŒøœÇ). One connected with the king (Œ≤Œ±œÉŒπŒªŒµœÖœÇ), whether by blood or by office."
3. "At Capernaum (ŒµŒΩ ŒöŒ±œÜŒ±œÅŒΩŒ±ŒøœÖŒº). Some miles from Cana near where the Jordan enters the Sea of Galilee."

### John Gill:
1. "where he made the water wine"
2. "from the whole he seems to be one that belonged to the palace of Herod Antipas"
3. "Some think this nobleman was either Chuza, Herod's steward, Luke 8:3, or Manaen, who had been brought up with Herod, Acts 13:1"
