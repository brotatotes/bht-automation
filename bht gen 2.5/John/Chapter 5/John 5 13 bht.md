# John 5:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus healed a man at the pool of Bethesda, but the man did not know who had healed him because Jesus had slipped away into the crowd. The man was so overjoyed at his cure that he did not even ask for the name of his benefactor. Jesus intentionally withdrew to avoid hasty popularity and precipitate hatred from the Jews. The man's lack of knowledge about Jesus shows that his healing cannot be attributed to his faith, but rather to the power and generosity of Jesus.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "His fame had not been so spread yet, but that He might during the crowd of strangers at the feast pass unnoticed."
2. "·ºêŒæŒ≠ŒΩŒµœÖœÉŒµŒΩ, passed on unobserved: just spoke the healing words, and then went on among the crowd; so that no particular attention was attracted to Himself, either by the sick man or others."
3. "Observe, ·ºêŒæŒ≠ŒΩŒµœÖœÉŒµŒΩ has for its understood object, the man subjectively; escaped his notice, a crowd being in the place: not referring to any thing which Jesus had done himself."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "That some one, with unparalleled generosity, tenderness and power, had done it, the man knew well enough."
2. "He disappeared too quickly for any inquiries."
3. "Slipped out of the crowd that had gathered, to avoid both hasty popularity and precipitate hatred."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Wist not - Knew not."
2. "Had conveyed himself away - Was lost in the crowd."
3. "He had silently mingled with the multitude, or had passed on with the crowd unobserved, and the man had been so rejoiced at his cure that he had not even asked for the name of his benefactor."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "He that was healed."
2. "Who it was."
3. "Had conveyed Himself away."

### John Calvin:
1. "He therefore withdrew for a little, that the Jews might have it in their power to judge of the fact itself, without reference to any person."
2. "And hence we learn that the cure of this man cannot be ascribed to his faith since, even after having been cured, he does not acknowledge his Physician."
3. "For my own part, as I do not deny that there was in him some secret movement of faith, so I say that it is clear from what follows, that he had no solid doctrine or clear light on which he could rely."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "We need not wonder that this man, unable to move from place to place, perhaps only recently come to Jerusalem, had no previous knowledge of Jesus."
2. "Jesus withdrew, literally 'slipped aside,' became suddenly lost to sight."
3. "The conflict between Jesus and the Jews has begun: all His actions deepen their hatred against Him."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "He that was healed (Œø ŒπŒ±Œ∏ŒµŒπœÇ). First aorist passive articular participle of ŒπŒ±ŒøŒºŒ± (John's usual word)."
2. "Who it was (œÑŒπœÇ ŒµœÉœÑŒπŒΩ). Present tense preserved in indirect question."
3. "Had conveyed himself away (ŒµŒæŒµŒΩŒµœÖœÉŒµŒΩ). First aorist active indicative of ŒµŒ∫ŒΩŒµœâ, old verb to swim out, to slip out, or from ŒµŒ∫ŒΩŒµœÖœâ, to turn out, to turn the head to one side (to one side with which compare ŒµŒΩŒµŒΩŒµœÖŒøŒΩ, they nodded, Luke 1:62). Either of these verbs can explain the form here. The aorist tense simply states an antecedent action without being a pastperfect."

### John Gill:
1. "He had never seen, and perhaps had never heard of Christ before, and so knew him not."
2. "Christ gave him no opportunity of conversing with him, or so much as to ask him who he was."
3. "He passed through them, and went his way to the temple, where he found the man he had healed."
