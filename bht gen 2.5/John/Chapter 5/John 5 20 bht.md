# John 5:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Father's love for the Son is the basis for the intimate fellowship and mutual endearment between them. This love is characterized by both an affectional and intelligent element. The Father shows the Son all things that He Himself does, indicating the Son's omniscience. The greater works that the Son will do, such as raising the dead and judging the world, are meant to inspire wonder and admiration. These works are a result of the perfect unity and nature shared by the Father and the Son.
