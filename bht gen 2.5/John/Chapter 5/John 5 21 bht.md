# John 5:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus claims the power to give life and raise the dead, just as the Father does. This power distinguishes His miracles from those of prophets and apostles. The quickening and raising of the dead are coextensive, with the making alive being the controlling fact of the raising. Jesus exercises this power according to His own will, quickening both body and soul. This power demonstrates Jesus' absolute prerogative as God and His full equality with the Father.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "It is very important to observe the distinction here between the working of the Eternal Son (in creation, e.g.) as He is ·ºêŒΩ Œø·ΩêœÅŒ±ŒΩ·ø∑, with God, and His working in the state of His humiliation in which the Father should by degrees advance Him to exaltation and put His enemies under His feet."
2. "And the unfolding of these latter shall all be in the direction of, and in accordance with, the eternal attributes of the Son."
3. "Observe, this Œ∂œâŒøœÄŒøŒπŒµ·øñ lays hold of life in its innermost and deepest sense, and thus finds its illustration in the waking both of the outwardly and the spiritually dead."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "This is His absolute prerogative as God."
2. "This statement is of immense importance in relation to the miracles of Christ, distinguishing them from similar miracles of prophets and apostles."
3. "Christ did all as the Father's commissioned Servant indeed, but in the exercise of His own absolute right of action."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Jesus here expressly affirms it, and says he has the same power."
2. "The power of raising the dead must be one of the highest attributes of the divinity."
3. "So it depends on his will whether sinners shall live. He has power to renew them."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The quickening, however (zwopoiei, maketh alive), includes the raising, so that the two clauses are coextensive." 
2. "In popular conception the raising precedes the quickening; but, in fact, the making alive is the controlling fact of the raising."
3. "Egeirei, raiseth, means primarily awaketh."

### John Calvin:
1. "Now life contains within itself not only righteousness, but all the gifts of the Holy Spirit, and every part of our salvation."
2. "We ought also to observe in what manner Christ bestows life upon us; for he found us all dead, and therefore it was necessary to begin with a resurrection."
3. "He specially confers this grace on none but certain men, that is, on the elect."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "In speaking of these, however, the present not the future tense is used, for some of them are even now present in their beginnings, though future in their complete manifestation."

2. "The acquittal of believers, which presupposes judgment, is treated of."
3. "The quickening some of the dead."
