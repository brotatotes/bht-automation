# John 5:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus declares that he should be honored with the same honor as the Father, for he is the Lord of life and the Judge of the world. Those who do not honor the Son do not honor the Father who sent him. Honoring the Son denotes religious homage and worship, and those who refuse to honor Jesus resist the Father's purpose. By honoring the Son, we honor the Father and demonstrate the equality of the Son with the Father.

### Archibald T. Robertson:

2. "Dishonouring Jesus is dishonouring the Father who sent him."
3. "There is small comfort here for those who praise Jesus as teacher and yet deny his claims to worship."

### John Gill:
1. "This is the end of all judgment, and the exercise of all authority, and power being committed to him; namely, that he might have the honour given him by men that is due unto him."
2. "Though the Son is in the form of God, and equal with him, yet by taking upon him the form of a servant, by becoming man, he has veiled the glory of his divine person, and made himself of no reputation; and by reason of this was reckoned by many, or most, as a mere man."
3. "They are so the same in nature and perfections, in power, will, affections, and operations; and their interests and honours are so involved together, that whatever dishonour is done to one, reflects on the other."

3. "He that honoureth not the Son â€” With the same equal honour, greatly dishonoureth the Father that sent him."
