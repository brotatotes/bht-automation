# John 5:27 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus, as the Son of Man, has been given the authority to execute judgment. This authority implies the power to raise the dead and investigate actions and thoughts, as well as the moral right to judge. The absence of the article before son suggests that Jesus is a man and, therefore, fitting to judge humanity. He is the one who imparts life and judges, drawing acknowledgment of the righteousness of their doom from the guilty. Jesus, adorned with power, imparts what he has received from the Father to humanity.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "What Christ had properly in view was the indwelling of the Son's essential life in humanity as the great theater and medium of divine display." 
2. "The appointment of a Judge in our own nature is one of the most beautiful arrangements of divine wisdom in redemption."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The word 'authority' here implies all that is necessary to execute judgment - all the physical power to raise the dead, and to investigate the actions and thoughts of life; and all the 'moral right' or authority to sit in judgment on the creatures of God, and to pronounce their doom."
2. "He has appointment to 'do justice;' to see that the universe suffers no wrong, either by the escape of the guilty or by the punishment of the innocent."
3. "It is to be remarked here that the word 'son' does not have the article before it in the original: Because he is A son of man - that is, because he is a man. It would seem from this that there is a propriety that one in our nature should judge us."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The authority is assigned to Him as being very man."
2. "The article is wanting."
3. "John uses the article everywhere with this phrase, except here and Revelation 1:13; Revelation 14:14."

### John Calvin:
1. "The Father hath given him dominion, that he may have full power over all things in heaven and in the earth."
2. "He comes forth to men, adorned with such magnificence of power, that he may impart to them what he has received from the Father."
3. "Christ, so far as he is man, was appointed by the Father to be the Author of life, that it may not be necessary for us to go far to seek it."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The Son ‚Äòmaketh to live,‚Äô but He maketh to live ‚Äòwhom He will... He giveth life to those who have heard His voice, and not to all."
2. "The former verses that speak of giving life and of judging may have an extent of application of which we know nothing; this verse relates to the judgment of men by One who is very man."
3. "Because He has done so, He is fitted to be a Judge of men, and to draw from the consciences of the guilty an acknowledgment of the righteousness of their doom."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Because he is a son of man, because the judge of men must partake of human nature himself."
2. "John is here giving his own reflections rather than the words of Jesus and uses 'œÖŒπŒøœÇ Œ±ŒΩŒ∏œÅœâœÄŒøœÖ' in the same sense as 'Œø œÖŒπŒøœÇ œÑŒøœÖ Œ±ŒΩŒ∏œÅœâœÄŒøœÖ.'"
3. "So in Revelation 1:13; Revelation 4:14 œÖŒπŒøŒΩ Œ±ŒΩŒ∏œÅœâœÄŒøœÖ means 'a son of man.'"

### John Gill:
1. "And hath given him authority to execute judgment also,.... Both in his church and kingdom, in the present state of things, and at the last day, when all shall stand before his judgment seat." 
2. "Agreeably the Persic version renders it, 'because the Son himself is he who judges the sons of men'; or rather because he is that son of man spoken of in prophecy, especially in Daniel 7:13; by whom is meant the Messiah, as the Jews themselves allow." 
3. "Let this be no obstruction to your faith of his quickening the dead, and having authority to execute judgment on all; since, though the son of man, he is not a mere man, but God over all, as what is next ascribed to him manifestly shows."

### John Wesley:
1. Because he is the Son of man ‚Äî He is appointed to judge mankind because he was made man.
