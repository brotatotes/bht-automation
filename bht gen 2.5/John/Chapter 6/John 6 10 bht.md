# John 6:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The disciples are directed to have the people sit down in order to prepare for the feast that the Lord is about to provide. The mention of much grass indicates that it is the season of early spring, and the grass is flourishing and abundant. The men are specifically mentioned, possibly because they sat down first according to Eastern custom, and the number of women and children is not likely to be very large.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "χόρτος πολύς, in accordance with the time of year, the latter end of spring, after the rainy season."
2. "οἱ ἄμδρες] This is a particular touch of accuracy in the account of an eye-witness which has not I think been noticed."
3. "But here we see how it came to be so the men alone were arranged in companies, or alone arranged so that any account was taken of them: the women and children being served promiscuously; who indeed, if the multitude were a paschal caravan (?), or parts of many such, would not be likely to be very numerous; and here again we have a point of minute truthfulness brought out."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Sit down [αναπεσειν]. Literally, recline."
2. "Grass [χορτος]. Originally an enclosure. Thus Homer speaks of Peleus offering a sacrifice, aujlhv ejn cortw, in the enclosure of the court ("Iliad," 11, 774). Hence a feeding-place, and so grass, provender."
3. "The sense is merely that of our abstract pasture. Matthew and Mark mention the grass, Mark with the epithet green. Wyc., hay."

### John Calvin:
1. "No small praise is due to their cheerful obedience in now complying with his injunction, though they know not what is his intention, or what advantage they will derive from what they are doing."
2. "The same readiness to obey is manifested by the people; for, while they are uncertain about the result, they all sit down as soon as a single word of command has been pronounced."
3. "And this is the trial of true faith, when God commands men to walk, as it were, in darkness. For this purpose let us learn not to be wise in ourselves, but, amidst great confusion, still to hope for a prosperous issue, when we follow the guidance of God, who never disappoints his own people."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "They are directed to sit down, partly for the sake of order and ease in the distribution of the food, but also because the Lord is preparing to set a feast before them, and they sit down with Him as His guests."
2. "Now there was much grass in the place...on this day of early spring the grass would be flourishing and abundant."
3. "The ‘men’ are now singled out for special mention, probably because they, according to the custom of the East, sat down first. We may also suppose that the number of women and children would not be very large."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Sit down (αναπεσειν). Literally, 'fall back,' lie down, recline." 
2. "Much grass (χορτος πολυς). Old word for pasture, green grass (Mark 6:39) or hay (1 Corinthians 3:12)."
3. "In number (τον αριθμον). Adverbial accusative (of general reference)."

### John Gill:
1. "Christ, without reproving his disciples for their unbelief, ordered them directly to place the people upon the ground, and seat them in rows by hundreds and by fifties, in a rank and company, as persons about to take a meal."
2. "now there was much grass in the place; at the bottom of the mountain; and it was green, as one of the evangelists observes, it being the spring of the year, and was very commodious to sit down upon."
3. "so the men sat down, in number about five thousand; besides women and children, Matthew 14:21, so that there was but one loaf for more than a thousand persons."
