# John 6:36 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The people had seen Jesus and had full proof of His divine mission, yet they did not believe. The charge against them is grave, but it is not made in anger or hopelessness. Instead, Jesus encourages them, stating that their state of unbelief does not have to last. Even now, they have the opportunity to turn to Him and find salvation. Their voluntary blindness and rejection of Jesus' teachings and miracles are a result of their own malice and unwillingness to accept Him as the spiritual Savior.
