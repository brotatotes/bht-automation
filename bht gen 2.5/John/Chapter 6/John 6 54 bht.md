# John 6:54 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Whoever partakes of the flesh and blood of Christ has eternal life, which is not the same as the future resurrection life.

This spiritual meaning can only be understood as Jesus unfolds himself as the source of sustenance for the soul. By eating and drinking in this manner, one receives the beginning, pledge, and earnest of everlasting life, with a right and meetness for it, to be fully enjoyed in soul and body at the last day.
