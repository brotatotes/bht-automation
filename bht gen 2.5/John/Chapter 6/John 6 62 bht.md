## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "And that none but the Twelve saw it, is unimportant; for how do we know that our Lord was not here speaking to some among the Twelve?"
2. "To explain it of His death, as part of His going up where He was before, is hardly less disingenuous."
3. "The whole exegesis of the passage in the above-named Commentators is a remarkable instance of the warping of the judgment by unsoundness of belief in the historical truth of the evangelistic testimony."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Jesus does not say that those who were then present would see him ascend, but he implies that he would ascend."
2. "Instead of explaining that away, he proceeds to state another doctrine quite as offensive to them - that he would reascend to heaven."
3. "As Jesus was to ascend to heaven, it was clear that he could not have intended literally that they should eat his flesh."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "What and if ye shall see... if then ye should behold, etc. - would not this still more cause you to stumble?" 
2. "Ascend... properly, renders the participle, ascending."
3. "I speak... But the correct reading is lelalhka, the perfect tense, I have spoken, or I have just spoken."

### John Calvin:
1. "Because I converse among men without honor, I am despised by you, and you recognize in me nothing that is Divine; but ere long God will adorn me with splendid power, and, withdrawing me from the contemptible state of mortal life, will raise me above the heavens."
2. "For, in the resurrection of Christ, so great was the power displayed by the Holy Spirit, that it plainly showed Christ to be the Son of God."
3. "When he says that he was formerly in heaven, this does not apply strictly to his human nature, and yet he speaks of the Son of man; but since the two natures in Christ constitute one person, it is not an unusual way of speaking to transfer to one nature what is peculiar to the other."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The meaning of this ascent is surely clear in itself; but if it were not, the mention of a past descent would remove all doubt."
2. "...if you should see me ascending where I was before, to be no longer upon earth at all!"
3. "Then at last they may come to see that the words can only be spiritually understood."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "If ye then behold."
2. "Ascending, picturing the process."
3. "Clear statement of Christ's pre-existence in his own words."

### John Gill:
1. "Christ was, he existed before his incarnation, and he was in heaven before; not in his human nature, but as the word and Son of God..."
2. "When he had done his work, and the will of his Father, for which he came down from heaven, by the assumption of the human nature, he should ascend up thither again..."
3. "If it was difficult to receive, and hard to be understood, and was surprising and incredible, that he should come down from heaven, as bread, to be eat and fed upon; it would be much more so to them to be told, that he who was in so mean and lowly a form, should ascend up into heaven."

### John Wesley:
1. "What if ye shall see the Son of man ascend where he was before?" 
2. "How much more incredible will it then appear to you, that he should give you his flesh to eat?"
