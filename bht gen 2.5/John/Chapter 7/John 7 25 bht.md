# John 7:25 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The people of Jerusalem were surprised that Jesus was teaching openly, considering the rulers' long-formed purpose to put Him to death. These Jerusalemites were aware of the threats against Jesus and knew better than the Galilean multitude about the designs of the priesthood. They wondered why the rulers were not taking action against Jesus, given their previous attempts to kill Him. This group had more knowledge of the plans of the Jews than the general population. Despite the efforts of the wicked to hinder the Gospel, God's word prevailed and their plots were rendered fruitless.
