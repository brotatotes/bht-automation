# John 8:47 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Those who do not believe in Jesus do not listen to his words because they are not of God. Their rejection of the truth reveals their lack of connection to God. On the other hand, those who are of God, who love and fear him, listen to his words and receive them with joy and reverence. Embracing the teachings of God is a visible sign of one's election and a proof of being in a right relationship with God. Rejecting the words of God is a clear sign of a reprobate mind and a lack of connection to God.
