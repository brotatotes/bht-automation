## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The oldest manuscript prefixes the article emphatically, 'THE rocks.' The reference to 'clouds... winds... waves of the sea,' accords with this image of rocks."
2. "The love-feast accompanied the Lord‚Äôs Supper... so ministers in the Lord‚Äôs Supper have sought to make it a sacrifice, and themselves the sacrificing priests, usurping the function of our only Christian sacerdotal Priest, Christ Jesus. Let them beware of Korah‚Äôs doom!"
3. "Feasting is not faulty in itself, but it needs to be accompanied with fear of forgetting God... Sacred feasts especially ought to be celebrated with fear."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "They were as dangerous in the church as hidden rocks are in the ocean."
2. "The Lord‚Äôs Supper, called a feast or festival of love, because... It was the means of strengthening the mutual love of the disciples: a festival which love originated, and where love reigned."
3. "There can be no doubt that such a custom early existed in the Christian church, and extensively prevailed; but it can readily be accounted for without supposing that it had the sanction of the apostles, or that it existed in their time."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Spots... rightly, as Rev., hidden rocks... elements of danger and wreck." 
2. "Feeding... shepherding themselves... further their own schemes and lusts instead of tending the flock of God."
3. "Clouds without water... seem to be charged with refreshing showers, but... yield no rain."

### John Calvin:
1. "Such feasts, he says, were disgraced by impure men, who afterwards fed themselves to an excess; for in these there was the greatest frugality and moderation." 
2. "These unprincipled men, though promising much, were yet barren within and empty, like clouds driven by stormy winds, which give hope of rain, but soon vanish into nothing." 
3. "He then calls them trees unfruitful, rooted up, and twice dead; as though he had said, that there was no sap within, though leaves might appear."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "These are they who are sunken rocks, seen indeed, but their true nature concealed, in your feasts of charity."
2. "Clouds without water, empty, useless, easily carried along therefore by the wind, ostentatious and deceptive wherever they go."
3. "Trees as they are in autumn, in ‚Äòthe sear and yellow leaf,‚Äô with all their vigour gone, not because they have borne fruit, for they are fruitless, and have ever been so."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Hidden rocks (œÉœÄŒπŒªŒ±Œ¥ŒµœÇ). Old word for rocks in the sea (covered by the water), as in Homer, here only in N.T."
2. "Shepherds that feed themselves (ŒµŒ±œÖœÑŒøœÖœÇ œÄŒøŒπŒºŒ±ŒπŒΩŒøŒΩœÑŒµœÇ). 'Shepherding themselves.'"
3. "Autumn trees (Œ¥ŒµŒΩŒ¥œÅŒ± œÜŒ∏ŒπŒΩŒøœÄœâœÅŒπŒΩŒ±). Late adjective from œÜŒ∏ŒπŒΩœâ, to waste away, and ŒøœÄœâœÅŒ±, autumn, here only in N.T."

### John Gill:
1. "The design of which was to maintain and promote brotherly love, from whence they took their name; and to refresh the poor saints, that they might have a full and comfortable meal now and then."
2. "These were like the shepherds of Israel, who fed themselves, and not the flock, and were very impious and impudent, open and bare faced in their iniquities, neither fearing God nor regarding man."
3. "And to clouds 'without water', because destitute of the true grace of God, and of true evangelical doctrine; which, like rain, is from above, from heaven; and which, like that, refreshes, softens, and fructifies."

### John Wesley:
1. "Feeding themselves without fear ‚Äî Without any fear of God, or jealousy over themselves." (Jude 1:12) 
2. "Twice dead ‚Äî In sin, first by nature, and afterwards by apostasy." (Jude 1:12)
3. "Plucked up by the roots ‚Äî And so incapable of ever reviving." (Jude 1:12)
