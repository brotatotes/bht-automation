### Henry Alford:
1. "wild waves of the sea, foaming up their own shames"
2. "wandering stars, for whom the blackness of darkness is reserved for ever"
3. "these professing Christians, by their profession lights in the world, instead of letting that light shine on more and more into the perfect day, are drifting about in strange errors of doctrine and practice till it will be utterly extinguished in eternal darkness"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The image here seems to be, that they were noisy and bold in their professions, and were as wild and ungovernable in their passions as the billows of the sea."
2. "What they impart is as unsubstantial and valueless as the foam of the ocean waves, and the result is in fact a proclamation of their own shame. Men with so loud professions should produce much more."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Raging [Œ±Œ≥œÅŒπŒ±]. Rev., wild, which is better, as implying quality rather than act. Waves, by nature untamed."
2. "Foaming out [ŒµœÄŒ±œÜœÅŒπŒ∂ŒøŒΩœÑŒ±]. Only here in New Testament. Compare Isaiah 57:20."
3. "Wandering stars. Compare 2 Peter 2:17. Possibly referring to comets, which shine a while and then pass into darkness."

### John Calvin:

2. "You may justly say that they make only rumbling sounds; for, despising common language, they form for themselves an exotic idiom, I know not what."
3. "With the more care and reverence ought the simplicity of Scripture to be studied, lest, by reasoning more refinedly than is right, we should not draw men to heaven, but on the contrary be involved in manifold labyrinths."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "They are at once rocks and waves, wild waves of the sea, which ‚Äòcannot rest,‚Äô and throw up only ‚Äòmire and dirt‚Äô (Isaiah 57:20)."
2. "foaming out their own shame their lusts ‚Äòdisgraceful.‚Äô"
3. "wandering stars (comets or meteors, not planets), which neither light the world nor guide the mariner, but after blazing awhile drift into ‚Äòthe blackness and darkness which is kept (‚Äòin reserve‚Äô) for them, and into which they sink and sink ‚Äòfor ever.‚Äô"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Wild waves... like untamed animals of the forest or the sea." 
2. "Foaming out... for the foaming waves as here." 
3. "Wandering stars... Babylon as the day-star who fell through pride."

### John Gill:
1. "False teachers are so called, for their swelling pride and vanity; which, as it is what prevails in human nature, is a governing vice in such persons for knowledge without grace puffs up."
2. "They are called 'stars' because they have the appearance of such, and blaze for a while, in seeming light, zeal, and warmth, and in fame and reputation."
3. "This phrase not only expresses the dreadful nature of their punishment, their most miserable and uncomfortable condition; but also the certainty of it, it is 'reserved' for them among the treasures of divine wrath and vengeance."

### John Wesley:
1. "Wandering stars - Literally, planets, which shine for a time, but have no light in themselves, and will be soon cast into utter darkness."
2. "Thus the apostle illustrates their desperate wickedness by comparisons drawn from the air, earth, sea, and heavens."
