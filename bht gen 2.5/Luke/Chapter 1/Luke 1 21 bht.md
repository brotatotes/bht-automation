# Luke 1:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The people were waiting for the priest to come out of the temple, as it was customary for him not to remain long in the holy place. They marveled and wondered at his unusual stay, as it was not usual for the priest to tarry for a long time. The people were waiting to receive the usual benediction from him, and they were concerned that his prolonged stay might be seen as a sign of God's judgment. The priest's extended time in the temple caused the people to draw the conclusion that God had appeared to him.
