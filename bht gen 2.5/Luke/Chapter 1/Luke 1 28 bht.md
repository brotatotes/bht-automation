## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "κεχαριτωμ ., not ‘ gratiâ plena ,’ as the Vulg.; for, though χαριτόω is not found in classical writers, the analogy of all verbs in - όω must rule it to mean, the passing on of the action implied in the radical substantive to the object of the verb the ‘ conferring of grace or favour, upon .’"
2. "And this is its meaning in the only other place (see reff.) where it occurs in the N.T. Thl. explains it as corresponding to εὗρες χάριν παρὰ τῷ θεῷ, Luke 1:30: τοῦτο γάρ ἐστιν τὸ κεχαριτῶσθαι, τὸ εὑρεῖν χάριν παρὰ τῷ θεῷ."
3. "ὁ κύρ . μετὰ σοῦ] i.e. ἐστίν: see ref."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "highly favoured—a word only once used elsewhere (Ephesians 1:6, "made accepted"): compare Ephesians 1:6- :, 'Thou hast found favour with God.'"
2. "The mistake of the Vulgate's rendering, 'full of grace,' has been taken abundant advantage of by the Romish Church."
3. "As the mother of our Lord, she was the most 'blessed among women' in external distinction; but let them listen to the Lord's own words. 'Nay, rather blessed are they that hear the word of God and keep it.'"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Hail - This word of salutation is equivalent to 'Peace be with thee,' or 'Joy be with thee;' a form of speech implying that she was signally favored, and expressing joy at meeting her."
2. "Highly favoured - By being the mother of the long-expected Messiah - the mother of the Redeemer of mankind."
3. "Blessed art thou among women - This passage is equivalent to saying 'thou art the most happy of women.'"

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "endued with grace."
2. "All the best texts omit blessed art thou among women."
3. "began to reason."

### John Calvin:
1. "A conviction of the Divine goodness is the entrance of faith... after preparing the heart of the virgin by meditation on the grace of God, he may enlarge it to receive an incomprehensible mystery."
2. "Blessing is here put down as the result and proof of the Divine kindness... we shall then be truly happy and rich, when we are beloved by God, from whom all blessings proceed."
3. "With extraordinary ignorance have the Papists, by an enchanter’s trick, changed this salutation into a prayer... Their silly ambition leads them into a second blunder, for they salute a person who is absent."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "To refer it to any human being, makes sheer non-sense of the account." 
2. "This was not a dream, ‘but a visit in open day."
3. "She is here presented ‘not as the mother of grace, but as the daughter of grace.’"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Endowed with grace (χαρις), enriched with grace."
2. "Wrong, if it means 'full of grace which thou hast to bestow.'"
3. "The oldest MSS. do not have 'Blessed art thou among women' here, but in verse Luke 1:42."

### John Gill:
1. "Hail; all health, happiness, and prosperity attend thee." 
2. "Thou art highly favoured; or graciously accepted, or hast obtained grace."
3. "Thou art blessed among women."

### John Wesley:
1. "Hail, thou highly favoured; the Lord is with thee; blessed art thou among women" - Hail is the salutation used by our Lord to the women after his resurrection: thou art highly favoured, or hast found favour with God, Luke 1:30, is no more than was said of Noah, Moses, and David.
2. "The Lord is with thee" - was said to Gideon, Judges 6:12; 
3. "Blessed shall she be above women" - of Jael, Judges 5:24.
