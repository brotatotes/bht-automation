## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Is it unnatural to suppose that the spirit of the blessed Virgin had been drawn beforehand into mysterious sympathy with the ideas and the tone of this hymn?"
2. "In both songs, those holy women, filled with wonder to behold 'the proud, the mighty, the rich,' passed by, and, in their persons the lowliest chosen to usher in the greatest events, sing of this as no capricious movement, but a great law of the kingdom of God."
3. "In both songs the strain dies away on CHRIST; in Hannah's under the name of 'Jehovah's King'"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "My soul doth magnify the Lord - To 'magnify' means to 'make great,' and then to 'extol,' to 'praise,' to 'celebrate.'" 
2. "It does not mean here strictly to 'make great,' but to increase 'in our estimation' - that is, to praise or extol." 
3. "See Psalms 34:3; 2 Samuel 7:26."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Elizabeth's salutation was full of excitement, but Mary's hymn breathes a sentiment of deep inward repose" (Godet).
2. "Hannah's song differs from Mary's in its sense of indignation and personal triumph compared with Mary's humility and calmness."
3. "Spirit is the highest, deepest, noblest part of our humanity, the point of contact between God and man."

### John Calvin:
1. "But as hypocrites, for the most part, sing the praises of God with open mouth, unaccompanied by any affection of the heart, Mary says that she praises God from an inward feeling of the mind."
2. "When the soul of Mary exults with joy, the heart breaks out in praising God."
3. "The first thing necessary for believers is, to be able to rejoice that they have their salvation in God."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The angelâ€™s visit was vouchsafed to Mary later than to Zacharias, yet her song of thanksgiving is uttered long before his: faith is already singing for joy, while unbelief is compelled to be silent."
2. "This song of Mary, called the MAGNIFICAT, from the first word of the old Latin version, is the unpremeditated outpouring of deep emotion, and may be divided into regular stanzas and lines. It is the last Psalm of the Old Testamentâ€™ and the first of the New."
3. "The hymns could not have been composed after the death of our Lord. They are Messianic rather than Christian; pointing to the period assigned them by Luke as the true date of their composition."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Doth magnify (Î¼ÎµÎ³Î±Î»Ï…Î½Îµ). Latin, magnificat."
2. "Harnack argues that this is also the song of Elisabeth because a few Latin MSS. have it so, but Mary is correct."
3. "She draws her material from the O.T. and sings in the noblest strain."

### John Gill:
1. "And by 'magnifying' him is meant, not making him great, for he cannot be made greater than he is; but ascribing greatness to him, even all the perfections of the Deity, and praising him on account of them." 
2. "This Mary did, not in lip and word only, but with her whole heart and soul, and with all the powers and faculties of it."
3. "She all along speaks in the prophetic style, of things, as if they were done, which were doing, or would shortly be done."

### John Wesley:
1. And Mary said â€” Under a prophetic impulse, several things, which perhaps she herself did not then fully understand.
