## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "In the first French Revolution the same awful principle was exemplified, and Christendom has not done with it yet."
2. "the iniquity of Israel was allowed to accumulate from age to age till in that generation it came to the full, and the whole collected vengeance of Heaven broke at once over its devoted head."
3. "prophetsâ€”in the New Testament sense"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Divinely ordered sequence, first aorist passive subjunctive of ÎµÎºÎ¶Î·Ï„ÎµÏ‰, a late and rare verb outside of LXX and N.T., requiring as a debt the blood of the prophets."
2. "Which was shed (Ï„Î¿ ÎµÎºÎºÎµÏ‡Ï…Î¼ÎµÎ½Î¿Î½). Perfect passive participle of ÎµÎºÏ‡ÎµÏ‰ and ÎµÎºÏ‡Ï…Î½Î½Ï‰ (an Aeolic form appearing in the margin of Westcott and Hort here, ÎµÎºÏ‡Ï…Î½Î½Î¿Î¼ÎµÎ½Î¿Î½, present passive participle). If the present passive is accepted, it means the blood which is perpetually shed from time to time."
3. "From the foundation of the world (Î±Ï€Î¿ ÎºÎ±Ï„Î±Î²Î¿Î»Î·Ï‚ ÎºÎ¿ÏƒÎ¼Î¿Ï…). See also Matthew 25:34; John 17:24; Ephesians 1:4, etc. It is a bold metaphor for the purpose of God."

### John Gill:
1. "For there were prophets from the beginning, which prophesied of Christ, Luke 1:70 and whose blood was shed very early; for Abel, the son of the first man, and who was the first whose blood was shed, was not only a righteous man, but a prophet."
2. "By the sacrifice which he offered up, he gave a prophetical hint of the sacrifice of Christ, in that he spoke beforehand of it, as being dead he yet speaks."
3. "Just as in Babylon will be found, when God makes inquisition for blood, as he sooner or later always does, the blood of the prophets and saints, and of all that are slain upon earth, ever since Rome papal has been in power, Revelation 18:24."

### John Wesley:
1. The blood of all shall be required of this generation â€” That is, shall be visibly and terribly punished upon it.
