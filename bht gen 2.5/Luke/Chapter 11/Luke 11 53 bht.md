# Luke 11:53 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The scribes and Pharisees were enraged and pressed vehemently upon Jesus, seeking to entrap him with ensnaring questions. They were stung by his words and wanted to provoke him to say something that they could use against him. Their rage and malice knew no bounds as they harassed him with their relentless questioning. Their intent was to put words into his mouth and make him say what they wanted him to say. Their cunning, unfairness, and spitefulness were evident in their attempts to accuse him.
