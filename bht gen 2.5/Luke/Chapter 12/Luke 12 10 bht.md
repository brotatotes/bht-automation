# Luke 12:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Rejecting and resisting the power of the Holy Spirit is the unpardonable sin. This sin is separate from the charge made in Judea and is given immediately after the accusation that Jesus was in league with Beelzebub. The use of against in this emphasizes the severity of the sin. While speaking against the Son of Man may be forgiven upon true repentance, blaspheming against the Holy Spirit will never be forgiven, neither in this world nor in the world to come.
