## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "In the confidence that his Lord's return will not be speedy..."
2. "...he throws off the role of servant and plays the master, maltreating those faithful servants who refuse to join him..."
3. "...seizing on and revelling in the fullness of his master's board intending, when he has got his fill, to resume the mask of fidelity ere his master appear."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Delayeth. The emphatic word, since the thought of the lord 's delay and of the postponement of the reckoning is uppermost in the servant 's thought.


### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Shall say... undetermined, but with prospect of being determined."

### John Gill:
1. "Though a wicked servant, he calls Christ his Lord; but it is not saying Lord, Lord, that will be of any avail, but doing the will of God, by believing in Christ, and obeying his commands."
2. "He had a notion of the coming of Christ, though he did not desire it; and because he tarried longer than was expected, supposed him to be slack concerning his promise."
3. "Generally speaking, as professors of religion, when they turn apostates, are the most violent persecutors of the saints; so such persecutors of Christ's faithful followers are commonly drunkards and debauchees."
