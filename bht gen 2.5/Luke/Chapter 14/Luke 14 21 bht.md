## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The broad and narrow streets: perhaps the πόλεις κ . κῶμαι through which the Lord and his Apostles journeyed preaching."
2. "Here appear again the very persons of Luke 14:13; the representatives of the wretched and despised."
3. "Only those who knew themselves to be spiritually poor and maimed and halt and blind would come to the gospel feast."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "It is the part of ministers to report to the Lord in their prayers the compliance or refusal of their hearers."
2. "Angry—in one sense a gracious word, showing how sincere he was in issuing his invitations."
3. "Streets and lanes—historically, those within the same pale of 'the city' of God as the former class, but the despised and outcasts of the nation, the 'publicans and sinners' [TRENCH] generally, all similar classes, usually overlooked in the first provision for supplying the means of grace to a community."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "So it is no wonder that God is angry with the wicked every day. So foolish as well as wicked is the conduct of the sinner, so trifling is his excuse for not repenting and turning to God, that it is no wonder if God cannot look upon their conduct but with abhorrence."
2. "The feast is ready. There is no time to lose. They who partake of it must do it soon. So the gospel is ready; time flies; and they who partake of the gospel must do it soon, and they who preach it must give diligence to proclaim it to their fellow-men."
3. "By these the Jews were intended; by those who were in the streets, the Gentiles. Our Lord delivered this parable to show the Jews that the Gentiles would be called into the kingdom of God. They despised the Gentiles, and considered them cast out and worthless, as they did those who were in the lanes of the city."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Streets [πλατειας] - lanes [ρυμας] . The former word from platuv, broad; the broad streets contrasted with the narrow lanes. Wyc., great streets and small streets.


### Philip Schaff:
1. "God has 'wrath' in such circumstances."
2. "This substitution of guests took place at once, both in the parable and in fact."
3. "They represent the wretched and despised, 'publicans and sinners,' whom the 'servant' quickly brought in; since already they listened eagerly to the Saviour."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Being angry (οργισθεις). First aorist (ingressive) passive, becoming angry."
2. "Quickly (ταχεως). The dinner is ready and no time is to be lost. The invitation goes still to those in the city."
3. "Maimed (αναπειρους). So Westcott and Hort for the old word αναπηρους, due to itacism (ει=η in pronunciation). The word is compounded of ανα and πηρος, lame all the way up."

### John Gill:
1. "Christ resented the impenitence and unbelief of the Jews, who were favored with his ministry and miracles; and looked upon them with anger, and was grieved because of the hardness of their hearts; and threatened them with a sorer punishment, more aggravated condemnation, and more intolerable torments, than other men."
2. "And bring in hither the poor; not in a literal, but in a mystical and spiritual sense; such as have no spiritual food to eat, but ashes, gravel, wind, and husks of carnal lusts and sins; nor any spiritual clothing, no righteousness, but what may be justly called filthy rags; nor money to buy either, but are in debt, owe ten thousand talents, and have nothing to pay; of which spiritual poverty some are sensible, and others are not."
3. "In short, under these characters are represented natural and unconverted men, and the most vile, profligate, and abandoned of them; which are sometimes under the power of divine grace accompanying the ministration of the Gospel brought to Christ, and into his church."

### John Wesley:
1. The servant came and showed his lord these things — So ministers ought to lay before the Lord in prayer the obedience or disobedience of their hearers.
