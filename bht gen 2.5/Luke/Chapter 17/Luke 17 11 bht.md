Jesus traveled through the midst of Samaria and Galilee, possibly on the borders of both. The Samaritans did not like people going south towards Jerusalem, but Jesus was heading there for his last Passover. He passed along the borders of each region, with Samaria on his right hand and Galilee on his left. Jesus had previously cured nine Jews, but none of them returned thanks except for one Samaritan, highlighting the ingratitude of the Jewish nation.
