# Luke 17:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Pharisees asked Jesus when the kingdom of God would come, but their intentions were not sincere. Jesus responded by saying that the kingdom of God does not come with outward observation or visible signs. It is not a kingdom that can be seen with the eyes, but rather it is within people, working silently and invisibly. Jesus wanted to correct the mistaken views of both the Pharisees and his disciples, who were expecting the kingdom to come in a visible and grand manner. The kingdom of God is not about external displays of power or worldly success, but rather it is about the inward and spiritual renewal of the soul.
