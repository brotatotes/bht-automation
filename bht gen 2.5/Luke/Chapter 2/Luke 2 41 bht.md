# Luke 2:41 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
During the time of the Passover feast, it was customary for women to go up to Jerusalem, although it was not required by law. Mary and Joseph, being pious individuals, made the journey to the feast. While men were obligated to appear at the three yearly feasts, women were bound to attend the Passover according to the teachings of Rabbi Hillel. Mary's attendance at the feast was voluntary, demonstrating her piety and devotion to God's ordinances. Despite the corruptions and errors within the temple worship, believers were still expected to participate in the outward rites as a testimony of their faith.
