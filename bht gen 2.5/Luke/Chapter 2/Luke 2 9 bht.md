# Luke 2:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The shepherds were visited by an angel surrounded by the brightness of God's presence, causing them to be filled with fear. The glory of the Lord that shone around them was a luminous appearance, similar to what Paul saw on the road to Damascus. The angel stood over the shepherds, easily seen by them, and the extraordinary light that surrounded them allowed them to discern the angel's illustrious form. This divine manifestation humbled the shepherds and made them aware of their own sinfulness and frailty.
