## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:

2. "Henceforward, He who fulfilled the Law for man will no more eat and drink of it."
3. "That was the institution of a new rite; this the abrogation of an old one, now fulfilled, or about to be so, in the person of the true Lamb of God."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "It is to be your last as well as Mine, 'until the Kingdom of God come.'"
2. "It was the point of transition between two economies and their two great festivals."
3. "The one about to close for ever, the other immediately to open and run its majestic career until from earth it be transferred to heaven."

### Albert Barnes:

2. "After he had kept this in the usual manner, he instituted the supper which bears his name."
3. "Thus ingrafted the Lord's Supper on the Passover, or superseded the Passover by another ordinance, which was intended to be perpetual."

### John Calvin:
1. "For at the commencement of the supper, I have no doubt, he prayed, as he was accustomed never to sit down at table without calling on God; but now he wished to discharge once more the same duty, that he might not leave out a ceremony which, I have just now shown, was connected with the sacred act of taking the cup and tasting it."
 
2. "As Luke mentions that the cup was twice presented by Christ, we must inquire, in the first place, if it be a repetition, (as the Evangelists are wont frequently to say the same thing twice,) or if Christ, after having tasted the cup, repeated the same thing a second time."
3. "I have no doubt, therefore, that Christ, according to the ancient custom, tasted the cup in the holy feast, which otherwise could not have been correctly observed."

1. "Took, or ‚Äòreceived,‚Äô as the leader in the Passover feast."
2. "A cup. The first cup, of the Passover."
3. "Take this and divide it among yourselves. Our Lord Himself seems to have partaken of this cup. As He had eaten before He uttered the words of Luke 22:15-16, so He had drunk before saying this. This was a part of the regular Passover celebration; the institution of the Lord‚Äôs Supper was distinct from the act here mentioned."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "This cup is a diminutive of œÄŒøœÑŒ∑œÅ. It seems that this is still one of the four cups passed during the passover meal, though which one is uncertain."

3. "Blessed art thou, O Lord our God, who hath kept us alive, and preserved us, and hast brought us to this time."

### John Wesley:
1. "Take this and divide it among yourselves; for I will not drink."
