## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Our narrative leaves it undecided who this high-priest was, inasmuch as... Annas and Caiaphas are mentioned as high-priests." 
2. "From John we find that it was Annas; who having questioned Jesus, sent Him bound to Caiaphas, before whom His trial took place." 
3. "Luke omits this trial altogether or perhaps gives the substance of it in the account of the morning assembly of the Sanhedrim."

### Philip Schaff:
1. Luke 22:54. The high-priestâ€™s home. Undoubtedly Caiaphas is meant, since the other Evangelists agree in making his house the scene of Peterâ€™s denial.
	


### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Luke alone mentions 'the house.'"
2. "Imperfect, was following, as Matthew 26:58; John 18:15."
3. "Curiously Mark 14:54 has the aorist."

### John Gill:
1. "This was a confirmation of his last words; for by this it appeared, that now was their time, and power was given to them, as the emissaries of Satan, to act against him."
2. "But here the high priest did not usually dwell, and it is manifestly distinguished from his own house."
3. "And Peter followed afar off."

### John Wesley:
1.  Matthew 26:57; Mark 14:53; John 18:12.
