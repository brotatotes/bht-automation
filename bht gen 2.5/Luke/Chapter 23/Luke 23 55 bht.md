# Luke 23:55 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The women who had followed Jesus from Galilee, including Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses, witnessed the silent burial of Jesus from a distance. They went to the sepulchre and saw how the body of Jesus was laid in the new tomb of Joseph in the rocks. It is likely that others were with them, but only these two remained at the sepulchre. None of them, not even Nicodemus, were present when the body was taken down.
