# Luke 4:29 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The people in the synagogue in Nazareth rose up and thrust Jesus out with violence, intending to cast him down headlong from the brow of the hill. This act was a movement towards lynching Jesus, as murder was in the hearts of the people. The region of Nazareth was hilly, and the place where they led Jesus is still called the Mount of Precipitation. However, they had no legal right to take life in this manner, and their actions were furious, irregular, and without any regard for justice or the sanctity of the Sabbath.
