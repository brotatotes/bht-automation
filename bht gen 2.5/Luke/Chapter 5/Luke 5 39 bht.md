# Luke 5:39 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Jews, accustomed to the old system, would not desire the new wine of the grace and freedom of the Gospel.

This serves as a lesson for enthusiastic converts not to be disappointed if they cannot immediately instill their spirit into others. It also portrays the attitude of the Pharisees, who were content with the old and resistant to change.
