## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### John Calvin:
1. "Wisdom, however wickedly she may be slandered by her own sons, loses nothing of her worth or rank, but remains unimpaired."
2. "Let those who haughtily boast of being the children of Wisdom proceed in their obstinacy: she will, notwithstanding, retain the praise and support of her own children."
3. "Although many apostates may revolt from the Church of God, yet, among all the elect, who truly belong to the flock, the faith of the Gospel will always remain uninjured."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1.  Of all her children (απο παντων των τεκνων αυτης). Here Matthew 11:19 has "by her works" (απο των εργων αυτης). Aleph has εργων here. The use of "children" personifies wisdom as in Luke 7:8; Luke 7:9. 


### John Gill:
1. "Christ, who is the wisdom of God, [...] became useful to their souls, called them to repentance, converted and saved them: and these are his children."
2. "these are his children, which were given him by the Father; for whose sake he partook of flesh and blood, and whom he redeemed, that they might receive the adoption of children."
3. "[...] by their lives and conversations show, that the doctrine of Christ is not a licentious one, or leads to libertinism, and indulges men in their carnal sensual lusts and pleasures; but, on the contrary, teaches them to deny ungodliness and worldly lusts, and to live soberly, righteously, and godly."
