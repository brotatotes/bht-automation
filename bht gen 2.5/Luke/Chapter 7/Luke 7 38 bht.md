# Luke 7:38 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
A woman's tears become an offering of love, humility, and penitence as she washes Jesus' feet and wipes them with her hair. Her unbidden tears are seen as a genuine expression of emotion and a precious offering. The act of washing feet was a mark of deep reverence, and her use of her hair as a towel was a sacrificial gesture. Her tears, like a shower of rain, symbolize the cleansing of her sins. Her tears, once her ornament and pride, become a humble tool to serve her Lord.
