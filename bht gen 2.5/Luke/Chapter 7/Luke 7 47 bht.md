# Luke 7:47 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The woman is no longer unclean because her many sins are forgiven, which is evident through her great love for Jesus. This love is not the cause of her forgiveness, but rather a proof of it. In contrast, the Pharisee showed little evidence of feeling his sins were great and had little love for Jesus. The forgiveness of the woman's sins is already accomplished, and her love is the effect and evidence of this forgiveness.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "she is no longer unclean her many sins are forgiven: for (thou seest that) she loved much: her conduct towards Me shews that love, which is a token that her sins are forgiven."
2. "The sense of forgiveness of sin is not altogether correspondent to the sense of forgiveness of a debt."
3. "The expectation, the desire, and hope of forgiveness, the Ï€Î¯ÏƒÏ„Î¹Ï‚ of Luke 7:50, awoke this love; just as in our Christian life, the love daily awakened by a sense of forgiveness, yet is gathered under and summed up in a general faith and expectation, that â€˜in that dayâ€™ all will be found to have been forgiven."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Those many sins of hers, our Lord, who admitted how much more she owed than the Pharisee, now proclaims in naked terms the forgiveness of her guilt." 
2. "Not because, as if love were the cause of forgiveness, but 'inasmuch as,' or 'in proof of which.' The latter clause of the verse, and the whole structure of the parable, plainly show this to be the meaning." 
3. "Delicately ironical intimation of no love and no forgiveness in the present case."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "She has evinced so much love for me as to show that she is no longer 'such a sinner' as you suppose, and it is not, therefore, 'improper' that she should be suffered to come near me."
2. "While you have shown comparatively little evidence that you felt that 'your sins' were great, and comparatively little love at their being forgiven, 'she' has shown that she 'felt' hers to be great, and has loved much."
3. "They who feel - as Christians do - that they are the 'chief of sinners,' will feel under infinite obligation to love God and their Redeemer, and that no 'expression' of attachment to him can be 'beyond' what is due."

### John Calvin:
1. "As this woman evinces by remarkable actions, that she is full of ardent love to Christ, it would be improper for the Church to act harshly and severely towards her; but, on the contrary, she ought to be treated with gentleness, whatever may have been the aggravations of her offenses."
2. "Christ infers that, although this woman might have been guilty of many sins, the mercy of God was so abundant towards her, that she ought no longer to be regarded as a sinner."
3. "They who perceive the display of deep piety in the woman form an erroneous judgment, if they do not conclude that God is already reconciled to her; so that the free pardon of sins comes first in order."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Her sins, which are many, are forgiven, 'have been and are forgiven.'"
2. "Her sins which are many are forgiven...since she loved much...as these manifestations indicate."
3. "Little is forgiven...One who feels little need of forgiveness is meant."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Are forgiven (Î±Ï†ÎµÏ‰Î½Ï„Î±). Doric perfect passive form."
2. "Her sins had been already forgiven and remained forgiven."
3. "This explanation proves that the meaning of Î¿Ï„ preceding is proof, not cause."

### John Gill:
1. "Though she had been a great sinner, yet she was now not such an one as he took her to be; she was a pardoned sinner, and not that guilty and filthy creature he imagined."
2. "Her great love was not the cause of the remission of her sins, but the full and free remission of her many sins, which had been manifested to her, was the cause of her great love."
3. "according to our Lord's sense, and even Simon's opinion of the case, that forgiveness is the cause, and love the effect; and that according as the forgiveness is of more or less, love is proportionate."

### John Wesley:
1. "Those many sins of hers are forgiven; therefore she loveth much." 
2. "The fruit of her having had much forgiven."
3. "Her love is mentioned as the effect and evidence, not the cause of her pardon."
