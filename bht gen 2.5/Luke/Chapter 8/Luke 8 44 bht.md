# Luke 8:44 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
A woman with a flow of blood for twelve years reached out to touch the border of Jesus' garment, believing that she would be healed. Her faith, though mixed with error and weakness, was strong enough to receive the healing virtue that went forth from Jesus. The border of Jesus' garment referred to the tassel of his overgarment, which had four corners. This miracle serves as a reminder that Jesus accepts those who come to him in faith, regardless of their misconceptions or weaknesses. The fringe on the garment was a symbol of religious devotion and set the religious Jews apart from the common people.
