# Luke 8:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The parable of the sower illustrates the different conditions of the ground where the seed falls. Some ground is rocky, while others have depth. The seed that falls on rocky ground quickly grows but withers away due to lack of moisture. This represents those who have a superficial knowledge of the word and quickly make a profession of faith, but it does not last. Tribulation and persecution can also cause the faith to wither if the grace of God is lacking.
