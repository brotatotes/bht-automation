# Luke 9:46 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The disciples were engaged in a debate or discussion about greatness, which was not an abstract problem but a personal issue within their own group. Rivalries and jealousies had already arisen among them, leading to sharp words. The dispute was not about degrees in glory or grace, but about who would be the prime minister to the king Messiah in the expected temporal kingdom. This kind of reasoning always seemed to arise at the most inappropriate times.
