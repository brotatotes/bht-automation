## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "No man, c.â€”As ploughing requires an eye intent on the furrow to be made, and is marred the instant one turns about, so will they come short of salvation who prosecute the work of God with a distracted attention, a divided heart." (Quote 1)
2. "Though the reference seems chiefly to ministers, the application is general." (Quote 2)
3. "It is not actual return to the world, but a reluctance to break with it." (Quote 3)

### Albert Barnes:
1. "In order that a plowman may accomplish his work, it is necessary to look onward - to be intent on his employment - not to be looking back with regret that he undertook it."
2. "He that comes still loving the world - still looking with regret on its pleasures, its wealth, and its honors - that has not 'wholly' forsaken them as his portion, cannot be a Christian, and is not fit for the kingdom of God."
3. "He that would enter heaven must come with a heart full of love to God; giving 'all' into his hands, and prepared always to give up all his property, his health, his friends, his body, his soul to God, when he demands them, or he cannot be a Christian."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The figure is that of a man who, while engaged in labor, instead of keeping his eye on the furrow which he is drawing, looks behind at some object which attracts his interest." 
2. "He is only half at work, and half - work only will be the result." 
3. "Fit [ÎµÏ…Î¸ÎµÏ„Î¿Ï‚] . Lit., well - placed : adjusted."

### John Calvin:
1. "He who, after having put his hand to the plough, shall look back, is unfit for the kingdom of God." 
2. "They are said to look back, who become involved in the cares of the world, so as to allow themselves to be withdrawn from the right path."
3. "particularly, when they plunge themselves into those employments which disqualify them to follow Christ."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Such labor, with divided service and longing looks backward will be profitless and doubly toilsome."
2. "While the primary application is to the ministry, the verse has an important lesson for all."
3. "These conversations have one common lesson: conditional following of Christ is impossible."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The call to turn back is often urgent."
2. "The ploughman who does not bend attentively to his work goes crooked."
3. "The first case is that of inconsiderate impulse, the second that of conflicting duties, the third that of a divided mind."

### John Gill:
1. "The ploughman ought to look before him, on his plough, and the ground he is ploughing, or he is not fit to be a ploughman."
2. "He that enters upon the ministerial work, and looks back, and engages himself in the affairs of the world, sets his heart on them, and spends his time in them."
3. "He cannot serve God and mammon, his own interest, and the interest of Christ; he cannot rightly perform the work of the ministry, whilst his thoughts and time are taken up in the affairs of the world."

### John Wesley:
1. Is fit for the kingdom of God â€” Either to propagate or to receive it.
