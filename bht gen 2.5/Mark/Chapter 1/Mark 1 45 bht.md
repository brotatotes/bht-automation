# Mark 1:45 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus lost no time in spreading the news of the healing, but he did not want to be overwhelmed by crowds seeking him in the cities. Despite this, people continued to seek him for teaching and healing from all parts. The leper's disobedience in spreading the news hindered Jesus' ability to enter openly into cities. Jesus retreated to desert places not to avoid the people, but to avoid exciting the multitudes with their carnal expectations and prematurely increasing the hostility already awakened.
