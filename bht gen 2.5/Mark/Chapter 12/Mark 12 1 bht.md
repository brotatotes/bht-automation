## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The wine-press was constructed in the side of a sloping rock, in which a trough was excavated, which was the wine press proper."
2. "The word here used for the whole structure strictly means this trough underneath the press."
3. "The word means simply went abroad."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The circumstances called forth the parabolic mood, that of one whose heart is chilled, and whose spirit is saddened by a sense of loneliness, and who, retiring within himself, by a process of reflection, frames for his thoughts forms which half conceal, half reveal them." 
2. "A pit for the winepress... this is the vessel or trough under the winepress on the hillside to catch the juice when the grapes were trodden." 
3. "Husbandmen... workers in the ground, tillers of the soil."

### John Gill:
1. "A certain man planted a vineyard. The Persic version adds, 'with many trees': that is, with vines, though sometimes other trees, as fig trees, were planted in vineyards..." 
2. "And digged a place for the winefat. The Syriac and Arabic versions add, 'in it'; and the Persic version, 'in the vineyard'; for this was made in the vineyard, where they, trod and squeezed the grapes when gathered..."
3. "And built a tower. The Syriac, Arabic, and Ethiopic versions add, 'in it'; for this also was built in the vineyard, and may intend either the city of Jerusalem; or the temple in it, the watch house where the priests watched, and did their service, day and night."
