## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "ἀββᾶ = אַבָּא , an Aramaic form, and after Mark’s manner inserted, as ‘Ephphatha,’ ch. Mark 7:34 , ‘Talitha cum,’ ch. Mark 5:41." 
2. "ὁ πατήρ is not the interpretation of ἀββᾶ, but came to be attached to it in one phrase, as a form of address." 
3. "Meyer rightly supplies the ellipsis after ἀλλ ʼ: nevertheless, the question is not …: not οὐ γινέσθω , which would not come into construction with τί … τί."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Abba, Father. Mark gives, not only the substance of the prayer (Mark 14:35), but some of the words of our Lora." (Commentary)
2. "All things are possible unto thee. Peculiar to Mark, and doubtless a part of the very form used." (Commentary)
3. "Howbeit, not what I will. The form differs from that of Matthew, and might be paraphrased: ‘But, the great question is, not what I will, but what thou wilt.’" (Commentary)

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Abba, Father (Αββα ο πατηρ). Both Aramaic and Greek and the article with each. This is not a case of translation, but the use of both terms as is Galatians 4:6, a probable memory of Paul's childhood prayers." 
2. "Not what I will (ου τ εγω θελω). Matthew has 'as' (ως). We see the humanity of Jesus in its fulness both in the Temptations and in Gethsemane, but without sin each time."
3. "The victory over self brought surrender to the Father's will."

### John Gill:
1. "Abba, Father...to express the vehemency of his affection, and his strong confidence in God, as his Father, amidst his distress." 
2. "all things are possible unto thee...everything consistent with his perfections, counsels, and covenant, were possible to be done by him." 
3. "take away this cup from me; nevertheless, not what I will, but what thou wilt."

### John Wesley:
1. Abba, Father — St. Mark seems to add the word Father, by way of explication.
