## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The words are quite as likely to have been uttered by the Lord as they here stand."
2. "Some have imagined... traces of later Christian tradition, and an allusion to Hebrews 9:11; Acts 7:48."
3. "The allusion is probably to Daniel 2:34."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "In all that He said and did after that, though ever increasing in boldness, they could find nothing."
2. "When our Lord said on that occasion, 'Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up,' they might, for a moment, have understood Him to refer to the temple out of whose courts He had swept the buyers and sellers."
3. "And if so, it puts it beyond a doubt that by this time, at least, they were perfectly aware that our Lord's words referred to His death by their hands and His resurrection by His own."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Made with hands. Mark adds this detail; also made without hands, and the following sentence.


### Philip Schaff:
1. "We.... I. These words are emphatic."
2. "Made with hands. ... made without hands. Probably our Lord had used these expressions, since, as we now understand them, they express so plainly the correct meaning of the saying mentioned in John 2:19, etc."
3. "An allusion to Daniel 2:34, is possible."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "He said what the event has proved to be true; His death destroyed the old order, and His resurrection created the new."
2. "The only saying of Jesus at all like this preserved to us is that in John 2:19, when he referred not to the temple in Jerusalem, but to the temple of his body, though no one understood it at the time."
3. "Perhaps they quoted Jesus differently and therein is shown part of the disagreement, for Mark adds verse Mark 14:59 (not in Matthew). 'And not even so did their witness agree together,' repeating the point of verse Mark 14:57."

### John Gill:
1. "Christ did not say he would destroy any temple at all, only put the Jews on doing it."
2. "Nor did he use the distinction of a temple, made with and without hands; nor did he affirm that he would build another."
3. "By this testimony these witnesses would suggest, that Christ had a design upon their temple to demolish it, and that he must be a sorcerer, or a magician."

### John Wesley:
1. "Their going back so far to find matter for the charge, was a glorious, though silent attestation of the unexceptionable manner wherein he had behaved, through the whole course of his public ministry."
