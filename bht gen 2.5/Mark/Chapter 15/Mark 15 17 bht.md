# Mark 15:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The soldiers placed a crown of thorns on Jesus' head, in a mocking imitation of a royal diadem. The crown was not a real crown, just as the scarlet military cloak was not a true purple. The entire scene was a dramatic irony, with the staff symbolizing impotence and the purple robe representing a false sense of greatness. The color of the robe was described as both purple and scarlet, with the Tyrian purple being similar to scarlet.

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Purple. See on Matthew 27:28. Matthew adds the word for soldier 's cloak. Mark has simply purple.


### Philip Schaff:
1. "The scarlet military cloak no more required to be a real purple, than the crown of thorns required to be a real crown, or the reed a real sceptre; for the whole transaction was an ironical drama." 
2. "The staff must be a reed, the symbol of impotence; the crown must injure and pierce the brow; and so, too, must the purple present the symbol of miserable pretended greatness."
3. "This was done by its being an old camp-mantle."

2. "In derision of him, as a king, clothed him with this mock purple robe."
