### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "In Matthew he is represented as sitting on the stone outside the sepulchre; but since even there he says, 'Come, see the place where the Lord lay,' he seems...to have gone in with them from without; only awaiting their arrival to accompany them into the hallowed spot, and instruct them about it."
2. "Sitting on the right side - having respect to the position in which His Lord had lain there. This trait is peculiar to Mark."
3. "Clothed in a long white garment - On its length...and on its whiteness..."

### John Gill:
1. "Now it was in the court that the women entered, where the bier was to be put down by the bearers; and where they could look into the sepulchre, and the several caves and graves in it, and what were in them."

3. "They saw a young man; an angel; as angels used to appear in the form of men: nor is this any contradiction to John's account."
