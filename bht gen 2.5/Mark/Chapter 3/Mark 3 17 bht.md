## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Sheva being expressed by ŒøŒ± in Aramaic (Meyer, from Lightf.), perhaps on account of their vehement and zealous disposition, of which we see marks Luke 9:54; Mark 9:38; Mark 10:37; see also 2 John 1:10; but this is uncertain."
2. "·ΩÄŒΩœåŒºŒ±œÑŒ±, since both bore the name, and the Hebrew word is plural."
3. "There is an interesting notice of the catalogues of the Apostles, and the questions arising out of them, in the Lectures of Bleek on the three Gospels, published since his death by Holzmann, Leipzig, 1862."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "He surnamed them Boanerges [ŒµœÄŒµŒ∏Œ∑Œ∫ŒµŒΩ Œ±œÖœÑŒøŒπœÇ ŒøŒΩŒøŒºŒ± Œ≤ŒøŒ±ŒΩŒ∑œÅŒ≥ŒµœÇ] . Lit., he put upon them the name... Most of the best texts read ojnomata, names, instead of name. This would indicate that each of the two was surnamed a 'son of thunder.'"
2. "It is justified by the impetuosity and zeal which characterized both the brothers, which prompted them to suggest the calling of fire from heaven to consume the inhospitable Samaritan village (Luke 9:54); which marked James as the victim of an early martyrdom (Acts 12:2); and which sounds in the thunders of John's Revelation."
3. "The phrase, sons of, is a familiar Hebrew idiom, in which the distinguishing characteristic of the individual or thing named is regarded as his parent."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Sons of thunder. This does not imply censure; for these traits, when sanctified, would be praiseworthy."
2. "John was not, as he is often portrayed, of a soft and almost effeminate disposition. Such neutral characters are rarely heroes of faith."
3. "With the ancients, thunder was the symbol for profound and solemn utterances. The name would be prophetic in this application."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Boanerges, which is Sons of thunder...may refer to the fiery temperament revealed in Luke 9:34 when James and John wanted to call down fire on the Samaritan villages." 
2. "The word literally means sons of tumult, sons of thunder in Syriac." 
3. "Matthew is a Hebrew name meaning gift of God (ŒúŒ±Œ∏Œ∏Œ±ŒπŒøœÇ)."

### John Gill:
1. "he surnamed them Boanerges, which is, the sons of thunder: either because of their loud and sonorous voice; or their warm zeal for Christ, and fervency in their ministry."
2. "or for their courage in opposing the enemies of Christ, and the power that went along with their words; which either put to confusion and silence, or issued in conviction and conversion."
3. "The Jews, as our learned countryman Mr. Broughton has observed, sometimes pronounce 'Scheva' by 'on', as 'Noabyim', for 'Nebyim'; so here, 'Boanerges' for 'Benereges', or 'Benerges'."
