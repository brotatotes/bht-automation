# Mark 4:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The disciples' lack of understanding of the parable of the sower is a cause for concern, as it serves as the basis for comprehending all future parables. Jesus's question implies surprise at their dulness and raises doubt about their ability to understand the numerous parables to come. The disciples need assistance and divine help to grasp the meaning of these parables, as they are meant to be easily understood but can become increasingly difficult. This parable is the foundation upon which all other parables are built.
