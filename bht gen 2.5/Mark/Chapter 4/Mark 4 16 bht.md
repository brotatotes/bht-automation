# Mark 4:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Hearts superficially impressed are prone to receive the truth with readiness and joy, but the heat of tribulation or persecution quickly dries up their relish for the truth. This can lead to disappointing outcomes for those who faithfully preach the word. Such hearers are like the stony ground, having some understanding and affection for the word but lacking a true brokenness of heart and a recognition of their need for Christ. They may appear pleased and delighted with the message, desiring the rewards of heaven, but their hearts remain unchanged.
