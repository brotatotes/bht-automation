# Mark 4:27 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The growth of the seed sown in the heart is dependent on factors beyond human control, as it is a mysterious process implanted by God. The farmer does not know how the seed grows, but it does so naturally and powerfully. Similarly, in the realm of religion, the development and strengthening of piety in the heart cannot be fully understood or explained. It is a hidden process that occurs through the use of proper means and under the influence of divine grace. Ultimately, the actual process of growth is beyond human comprehension and control.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The seed sown in the heart is in its growth dependent on other causes than mere human anxiety and watchfulness."
2. "On a mysterious power implanted by God in the seed and the soil combined, the working of which is hidden from human eye."
3. "Beware of the mistake of Erasmus, who takes ·ΩÅ œÉœÄœåœÅŒøœÇ as the subject of all the verbs in this verse."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "By this we are not to infer that men are to use no diligence in the obtaining and in the growth of piety; but the illustration shows only that as we cannot tell how grain grows, so we cannot tell the mode in which piety increases in the heart."
2. "After all the researches of philosophers, no one has been able to tell the way in which grain grows... So in religion. We can mark the change; we can see the need of prayer, and self-examination, and searching the Scriptures, and the ordinances of religion, but we cannot tell in what way the religious principle is developed and strengthened."
3. "As God unseen, yet by the use of proper means, makes the grass to flourish, so God unseen, but by proper means, nourishes the soul, and the plants of piety spring up, and bloom, and bear fruit."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Grow [ŒºŒ∑Œ∫œÖŒΩŒ∑œÑŒ±Œπ] . Lit., lengthen; be extended by the seed lengthening out into blade and stalk."
2. "He knoweth not how (wJv oujk oiden aujtov). The Greek order is very lively: how knoweth not he."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "And should sleep, etc., i.e., live as usual without further care of the seed sown."
2. "He knoweth not how. The emphasis rests on the word ‚Äòhe; ‚Äòhe who sows does not know how that takes place which he expects to occur, and to occur for his benefit."
3. "A true picture, since such knowledge is not permitted to the wisest of men, and what is known helps the growth very little."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The mystery of growth still puzzles farmers and scientists of today with all our modern knowledge."
2. "But nature's secret processes do not fail to operate because we are ignorant."
3. "When man has done his part, the actual process of growth is beyond his reach or comprehension."

### John Gill:
1. "And, as applied to them, is not to be understood of natural sleep, and indulging themselves in that; much less of spiritual sloth and indolence."
2. "Nor can they be easy unless they have some seals of their ministry."
3. "This work is done secretly, and powerfully, under the influence of divine grace, without their knowledge, though by them as instruments."
