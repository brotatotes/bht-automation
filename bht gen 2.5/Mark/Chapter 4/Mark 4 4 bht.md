## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Some fell by the waysideâ€”by the side of the hard path through the field, where the soil was not broken up." 
2. "Not only could the seed not get beneath the surface, but 'it was trodden down' and afterwards picked up and devoured by the fowls."
3. "Second Case: THE STONY or rather, ROCKY GROUND."

### John Gill:
1. "the word was dispensed among some men comparable to it, on whom it lighted, but made no impression; there it lay, though not long, and was not inwardly received, and took no root, and consequently was of no effect"
2. "the devils, who have their abode in the air, especially the prince of the posse of them; and the Syriac version reads it in the singular number, 'and the fowl came'; that ravenous bird of prey, Satan, who goes about seeking what he may devour"
3. "attends where the word is preached, to hinder its usefulness as much as in him lies"
