## BHT:
The people in this context were not physically sick, but spiritually weak. Jesus could have performed miracles, but their lack of faith prevented Him.

It was not a lack of power, but rather wisdom and goodness that prevented miracles. Giving them more evidence would have increased their condemnation.
