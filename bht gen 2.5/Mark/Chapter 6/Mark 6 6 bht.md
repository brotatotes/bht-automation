## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "in the mystery of his humanity... so He might wonder at the unbelief of His countrymen."
2. "their unbelief is not here said to be the object, but the cause, of the Lord's wonder."
3. "Œ∫Œ±·Ω∂ œÄŒµœÅŒπ·øÜŒ≥ŒµŒΩ. See Matthew 9:35."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "He marvelled because of their unbelief. To be taken literally. On another occasion our Lord ‚Äòmarvelled‚Äô (Matthew 8:10; Luke 7:9) at the great faith of a heathen centurion. Both instances indicate the great importance of faith."
2. "The unbelief of Nazareth did not stop our Lord‚Äôs activity. This circuit was closely connected with the sending forth of the Twelve (Mark 6:7); hence it seems to be identical with that mentioned in Matthew 9:35, if we refer the latter to a distinct journey."
3. "It would be the third circuit through Galilee, which began with this rejection at Nazareth and continued until the return of the Apostles, when they all withdrew (Mark 6:30)."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Jesus had divine knowledge and accurate insight into the human heart, but he had human limitations in certain things that are not clear to us." 
2. "He marvelled at the lack of faith where he had a right to expect it, not merely among the Jews, but in his own home town, among his kinspeople, even in his own home." 
3. "An entirely new paragraph begins with these words, the third tour of Galilee. They should certainly be placed with verse Mark 6:7."

### John Gill:
1. "It was a surprise to Christ, as man, that his countrymen should not believe in him, but reject him as the Messiah."
2. "The proofs of Christ's deity and Messiahship are so plain and incontestable, that it is amazing that there should be any, who have read them or heard of them, that should be deists, or continue unbelievers."
3. "Such unbelief must be owing to a wretched stupidity, and judicial blindness of mind."

### John Wesley:
1. He marvelled ‚Äî As man. As he was God, nothing was strange to him.
