# Mark 7:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
All evil thoughts, words, and actions originate from the corrupted heart of man, which serves as the source of impurity. These internal evils are not a result of external influences or imitation, but rather a reflection of the sinful nature within. The defilement caused by these evils extends to both the soul and body, making a person common and sinful in nature.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### John Gill:
1. "All evil thoughts, words, and actions, take their rise from the inward parts of man; from his heart; which is sadly corrupted, and is the fountain from whence all these impure streams flow."
2. "And if these come from within, then not from without; they are not by imitation or are the mere effects of example in others: example may indeed, and often does, draw out the evil that is within; but it does not produce it there."
3. "And defile the man; both soul and body; all the powers and faculties of the soul, and all the members of the body; or 'make a man common': these show him to be one of the common people, a very sinful man."
