# Mark 8:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
After Jesus had dismissed the multitude, he and his disciples embarked on a ship to Dalmanutha, a village in the region of Galilee on the western side of the lake. The exact location of Dalmanutha is uncertain, but it was likely near Magdala. Mark's use of parts and Matthew's use of borders in their respective accounts may refer to the same region. It is suggested that Jesus landed at a secluded spot between Magdala and Dalmanutha. The theory that these places were on the southeastern shore of the lake is unsupported.

2. "Mark here uses 'parts' (ŒºŒµœÅŒ∑) in the same sense as 'borders' (ŒøœÅŒπŒ±) in Mark 7:24 just as Matthew reverses it with 'parts' in Matthew 15:21 and 'borders' here in Matthew 15:39."
3. "Mark has here 'with his disciples' (ŒºŒµœÑŒ± œÑœâŒΩ ŒºŒ±Œ∏Œ∑œÑœâŒΩ Œ±œÖœÑŒøœÖ) only implied in Matthew 15:39."

### John Gill:
1. "As soon as ever he had, dismissed the multitude, he took shipping with his disciples."
