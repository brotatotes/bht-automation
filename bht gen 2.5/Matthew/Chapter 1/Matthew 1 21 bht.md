# Matthew 1:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus, the name given to the unborn Messiah, means Jehovah is helper or Help of Jehovah. He is the Savior who saves His people from their sins, leading them in the fight against sin and temptation. He accomplishes salvation by dying to redeem, giving the Holy Spirit for renewal, and enabling believers to overcome spiritual enemies. Jesus saves us from the power and dominion of sin, making us righteous before God. This promise of salvation extends to all who are incorporated by faith in the Church, both Jews and Gentiles.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "He, emphatically: He alone: best rendered, perhaps, ‘ it is He that .’"
2. "In the primary sense, the Jews, of whom alone Joseph could have understood the words: but in the larger sense, all who believe on Him."
3. "One circumstance of this kind outweighs a thousand cavils against the historical reality of the narration. If I mistake not, this announcement reaches further into the deliverance to be wrought by Jesus, than any thing mentioned by the Evangelist subsequently."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "JESUS—to the awakened and anxious sinner sweetest and most fragrant of all names, expressing so melodiously and briefly His whole saving office and work!"
2. "The 'He' is here emphatic—He it is that shall save; He personally, and by personal acts."
3. "But, on the breaking down of the middle wall of partition, the saved people embraced the 'redeemed unto God by His blood out of every kindred and people and tongue and nation.'"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He saves people by dying to redeem them; by giving the Holy Spirit to renew them; by His power in enabling them to overcome their spiritual enemies, in defending them from danger, in guiding them in the path of duty, in sustaining them in trials and in death; and He will raise them up at the last day, and exalt them to a world of purity and love."
2. "Sinners could not be happy in heaven. It would be a place of wretchedness to the guilty. The design of Jesus was, therefore, to save them from sin."
3. "We have no evidence that we are his people unless we are saved from the power and dominion of sin. A mere profession of being His people will not answer."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The naming of the unborn Messiah would accord with popular notions."
2. "Jesus leads his people in the fight with sin and temptation."
3. "He who 'knew no sin' is 'made to be sin on our behalf, that we might become the righteousness of God in him'."

### John Calvin:
1. "The first truth taught us by these words is, that those whom Christ is sent to save are in themselves lost."
2. "Christ is not truly acknowledged as a Savior, till, on the one hand, we learn to receive a free pardon of our sins, and know that we are accounted righteous before God, because we are free from guilt; and till, on the other hand, we ask from him the Spirit of righteousness and holiness, having no confidence whatever in our own works or power."
3. "By Christ’s people the angel unquestionably means the Jews, to whom he was appointed as Head and King; but as the Gentiles were shortly afterwards to be ingrafted into the stock of Abraham, (Romans 11:17,) this promise of salvation is extended indiscriminately to all who are incorporated by faith in the 'one body' (1 Corinthians 12:20) of the Church."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Jesus is the same as Joshua, a contraction of Jehoshuah (Numbers 13:16; 1 Chronicles 7:27), signifying in Hebrew, 'Jehovah is helper,' or 'Help of Jehovah'" (Broadus).
2. "Jehovah is Salvation as seen in Joshua for the Hebrews and in Jesus for all believers." (Vincent)
3. "He will save (σωσε) his people from their sins and so be their Saviour (Σωτηρ). He will be prophet, priest, and king, but 'Saviour' sums it all up in one word."

### John Gill:
1. "For though she was with child, it could not be known any otherwise than by prediction or divine revelation, that she should have a son, whose name should be called Jesus; a name of the same signification with Joshua and Hosea, and may be interpreted a 'Saviour', Acts 13:23 for the word ישוע Jesus, comes from ישע which signifies 'to save.'" 
2. "The salvation here ascribed to him, and for which he is every way fit, being God as well as man, and which he is the sole author of, is to be understood, not of a temporal, but of a spiritual and everlasting salvation."
3. "By 'his people' whom he is said to save are meant, not all mankind, though they are his by creation and preservation, yet they are not, nor will they be all saved by him spiritually and eternally; nor also the people of the Jews, for though they were his nation, his kinsmen, and so his own people according to the flesh, yet they were not all saved by him."

### John Wesley:
1. "Jesus - That is, a Saviour. It is the same name with Joshua (who was a type of him) which properly signifies, The Lord, Salvation."
2. "His people - Israel."
3. "And all the Israel of God."
