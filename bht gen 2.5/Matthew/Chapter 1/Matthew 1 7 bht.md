# Matthew 1:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Three kings are omitted from the genealogy, possibly to maintain the structure of three sets of fourteen generations. The reason for these omissions may be due to religious considerations, such as their connection to the house of Ahab or their limited right to be considered true links in the theocratic chain. One of the kings mentioned is noted for being a good king. However, there is a discrepancy in the Persic and Ethiopic versions, where he is wrongly called Asaph.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Three kings are here omittedâ€”Ahaziah, Joash, and Amaziah (1 Chronicles 3:11; 1 Chronicles 3:12)."
2. "Some omissions behooved to be made, to compress the whole into three fourteens (Matthew 1:17)."
3. "The reason why these, rather than other names, are omitted, must be sought in religious considerationsâ€”either in the connection of those kings with the house of Ahab (as LIGHTFOOT, EBRARD, and ALFORD view it); in their slender right to be regarded as true links in the theocratic chain (as LANGE takes it); or in some similar disqualification."

### John Gill:
1. "And Abia begat Asa, who was a good king."
2. "His mother's name is the same with the name of his father's mother."
3. "He is wrongly called Asaph in the Persic and Ethiopic versions."
