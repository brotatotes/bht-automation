# Matthew 10:25 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The disciples are reminded that they should consider it enough to be like their master and not expect to fare better than Him. They should be prepared to face similar accusations and mistreatment as Jesus, who was accused of being in league with Satan under the name Beelzebub. The term Beelzebub was used by the Jews as a reproach, equating Jesus with the Devil. This serves as a reminder to the disciples that they should not be surprised or discouraged by the opposition they may face for following Jesus.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "A name by which the prince of the devils was called by the Jews, [referring to] our Lord."
2. "In those places they had not literally called Him Beelzebub, but He speaks of their mind and intention in those charges."
3. "They may however have literally done so on other unrecorded occasions."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "It is enough for the disciple that he be as his master, and the servant as his lord." 
2. "Though we nowhere read that our Lord was actually called 'Beelzebul,' He was charged with being in league with Satan under that hateful name."
3. "In all these relations, He says here, He and they are so bound up together that they cannot look to fare better than He, and should think it enough if they fare no worse."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Jesus calls himself 'the Master of the house,' and the Jews apply to him the corresponding title of the Devil." 
2. "The Lord of the temple was to them the chief of idolatrous worship; the representative of God, that of the worst of demons."
3. "Beelzebul was Beelzibbul. What, then, might his household expect at their hands?"

### John Calvin:
1. "Nothing, therefore, can be more unreasonable than to wish to be accounted believers, and yet to murmur against God when he conforms us to the image of his Son." 
2. "To what sort of delicacy do we pretend, if we wish to hold a place in his house, and to be above the Lord himself?"
3. "The general meaning is, that we carry our delicacy and tenderness to excess, if we account it a hardship to endure reproaches to which our Prince willingly submitted."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Beelzebub, more correctly â€˜Beelzebul.â€™ The former (â€˜lord of fliesâ€™) was the name of a Philistine idol. â€˜Beelzebulâ€™ means either, (1) â€˜lord of dung,â€™ the word being changed from Beelzebub to Beelzebul to admit of this contemptuous sense; or (2) â€˜lord of the habitation.â€™"
2. "Satan is referred to, but with a special reference to the indwelling of evil spirits in man; Satan being their lord."
3. "This view agrees with the allusions to a â€˜houseâ€™ in connection with the casting out of devils."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Beelzebub...It is evidently a term of reproach." 
2. "An opprobrious epithet; exact form of the word and meaning of the name have given more trouble to commentators than it is all worth." 
3. "The etymology of the word is also unknown, whether 'lord of a dwelling' with a pun on 'the master of the house' or 'lord of flies' or 'lord of dung' or 'lord of idolatrous sacrifices.'"

### John Gill:
1. "A disciple should think himself very well off, be entirely satisfied, yea, abundantly thankful, if he meets with no worse treatment than his master."
2. "If they have called the master of the house Beelzebub, how much more shall they call them of the household?"
3. "If Christians are called by ever such hard names, even devils, they should not be disturbed at it; since their lord and master was called the prince of them."

### John Wesley:
1. "This cannot refer to the quantity of reproach and persecution."
2. "In this the servant cannot be above his lord."
3. "Only to the certainty of it."
