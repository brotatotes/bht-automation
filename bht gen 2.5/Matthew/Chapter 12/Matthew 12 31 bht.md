# Matthew 12:31 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
All sins, including blasphemy, can find forgiveness with God. Blasphemy against the Holy Spirit refers to attributing the works of the Holy Spirit to the devil, as the Pharisees did. This sin is without excuse and will not be forgiven. Those who ridicule the work of the Spirit and attribute it to the devil may be committing the unpardonable sin. Blasphemy is the worst form of sin, maliciously speaking against God, but even this can be forgiven if repented of. It is a direct attack on the Spirit and a desperate turning of salvation into venom.

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "What is the blasphemy against the Holy Spirit? These Pharisees had already committed it. They had attributed the works of the Holy Spirit by whose power Jesus wrought his miracles (Matthew 12:28) to the devil." 
2. "That sin was without excuse and would not be forgiven in their age or in the coming one (Matthew 12:32)."
3. "People often ask if they can commit the unpardonable sin. Probably some do who ridicule the manifest work of God's Spirit in men's lives and attribute the Spirit's work to the devil."

### John Gill:
1. "All kind of sin, whether committed more immediately against God, or man, the first or second table of the law, or against any of the divine precepts... there is forgiveness of in the grace of God, through the blood of Christ, even for all sorts of men and sinners whatever."
2. "But the blasphemy against the Holy Ghost... is a despiteful usage of the Spirit of grace, an opposing, contradicting, and denying the operations wrought, or doctrines revealed by him, against a man's own light and conscience, out of wilful and obstinate malice, on purpose to lessen the glory of God, and gratify his own lusts."
3. "Such was the sin of the Scribes and Pharisees; who, though they knew the miracles of Christ were wrought by the Spirit of God, yet maliciously and obstinately imputed them to the devil, with a view to obscure the glory of Christ, and indulge their own wicked passions and resentments against him; which sin was unpardonable at that present time, as well as under that dispensation then to come."

### John Wesley:
1. "The blasphemy against the Spirit...is neither more nor less than the ascribing those miracles to the power of the devil, which Christ wrought by the power of the Holy Ghost." 
2. "How much stir has been made about this? How many sermons, yea, volumes, have been written concerning it? And yet there is nothing plainer in all the Bible." 
3. "It is neither more nor less than the ascribing those miracles to the power of the devil, which Christ wrought by the power of the Holy Ghost."
