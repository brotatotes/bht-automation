## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### John Calvin:
1. "By these words Christ shows that if we fall from his grace, our subjection to Satan is doubled, so that he treats us with greater cruelty than before." (Commentary)
2. "Let us not then suppose that the devil has been vanquished by a single combat, because he has once gone out of us." (Commentary)
3. "We must, therefore, endeavor that Christ, holding his reign within us, may block up all the entrances of his adversary." (Commentary)

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The first possession, the early idolatrous tendency of the Jews; the going out, the result of the captivity in Babylon; the emptying, sweeping, and garnishing at their return... the last state, the terrible and infatuated condition of the Jews after they had rejected Christ." 
2. "A process of deterioration, with occasional vicissitudes and fluctuations, but resulting in a state far worse than any that had gone before it." 
3. "The Reformation, the casting out of the first evil spirit of idolatry, permitted by Rome, the house â€˜empty, swept, and garnished: swept and garnished by the decencies of civilization and discoveries of secular knowledge, but empty of living and earnest faith."

### John Gill:
1. "This parable fitly suited them, the Scribes and Pharisees, and the men of that generation, from whom in some measure the unclean spirit might be said to depart through the doctrine, and miracles of Christ, to go into the Gentile world; but being followed there with the preaching of the Gospel by the apostles, returns to the Jews, and fills them with more malice, blasphemy, and blindness, than ever, which issued in their utter ruin and destruction."
2. "And the last state of that man is worse than the first: he becomes more wicked than ever he was, before he made pretensions to religion; as such apostates generally are more extravagant in sinning, and are seldom or ever recovered by repentance, and their last end is eternal damnation."
3. "This is said in allusion to, and in imitation of the seven spirits before the throne; or may denote a large number of devils, seven being a number of perfection; or else the various corruptions of a man's heart, the swarms of internal lusts which are there stirred up by Satan."

### John Wesley:
1. "More wicked than himself - Whence it appears, that there are degrees of wickedness among the devils themselves."
2. "They enter in and dwell - For ever in him who is forsaken of God."
3. "So shall it be to this wicked generation â€” Yea, and to apostates in all ages."
