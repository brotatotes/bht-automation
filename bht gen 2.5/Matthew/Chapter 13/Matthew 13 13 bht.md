## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Taking the saying of Mat 13:12 for our guide we have ·ΩÖœÉœÑŒπœÇ Œø·ΩêŒ∫ ·ºîœáŒµŒπ = ·ΩÖœÑŒπ Œ≤ŒªŒ≠œÄ . Œø·Ωê Œ≤ŒªŒ≠œÄŒøœÖœÉŒπŒΩ." 
2. "In the deeper view of the purpose of the parable, both of these run into one."
3. "The difficulties raised on these variations, and on the prophecy quoted in Matthew 13:14-15 , have arisen entirely from not keeping this in view."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "They 'saw,' for the light shone on them as never light shone before; but they 'saw not,' for they closed their eyes."
2. "They 'heard,' for He taught them who 'spake as never man spake'; but they 'heard not,' for they took nothing in, apprehending not the soul-penetrating, life-giving words addressed to them."
3. "The duty men voluntarily refuse to do, and in point of fact do not do, they at length become morally incapable of doing."

### John Calvin:
1. "He says that he speaks to the multitude in an obscure manner, because they are not partakers of the true light."
2. "He assigns no cause for it, except the secret purpose of God; for which, as we shall afterwards see more fully, there is a good reason, though it has been concealed from us."
3. "It is not the only design of a parable to state, in an obscure manner, what God is not pleased to reveal clearly; but we have said that the parable now under our consideration was delivered by Christ, in order that the form of an allegory might present a doubtful riddle."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Because seeing they see not, etc. Here the reason is based on the character of the persons concerned."
2. "Mark and Luke emphasize the purpose, namely, that this state of ignorance should go on unchecked to work out its own results."
3. "The two thoughts can be distinguished, but not divided. The paradoxical form points to merely external perception without consequent mental or moral results."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Though they see, they do not (really) see."
2. "The idiom here in Matthew gives no trouble save in comparison with Mark and Luke which will be discussed in due turn."
3. "The form œÉœÖŒΩŒπŒøœÖœÉŒπŒΩ is an omega verb form (œÉœÖŒΩŒπœâ) rather than the Œº verb (œÉœÖŒΩŒπŒ∑Œº) as is common in the Koine."

### John Gill:
1. "Because it was the will and pleasure of his Father to give the knowledge of divine mysteries to some, and not to others..."
2. "...they saw Christ with their bodily eyes, but not with an eye of faith."
3. "...he spoke to them in this abstruse and parabolical way, that they might be what they really were, seers and not seers, hearers and not hearers, at least not understanding ones."

### John Wesley:
1. "Therefore I speak to them in parables, because seeing, they see not...they do not effectually see, or hear, or understand anything."
2. "In pursuance of this general rule, I do not give more knowledge to this people because they use not that which they have already."
3. "Having all the means of seeing, hearing, and understanding, they use none of them."
