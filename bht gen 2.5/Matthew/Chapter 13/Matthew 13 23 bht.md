## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The sowing is not necessarily the first that has ever taken place: the field has been and is continually resown, so that the care of the husbandman is presupposed."
2. "Again, no irresistible grace or absolute decree of God must be dreamt of here. God working not barely upon, but with man, is, as we said above, the mystery of the kingdom here declared."
3. "The different degrees of faithfulness and devotedness of life with which fruit is brought forth by different classes of persons."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Understandeth [ÏƒÎ¿Î½Î¹ÎµÎ¹Ï‚] . See on 11 25, prudent. The three evangelists give three characteristics of the good hearer. Matthew, he understandeth the word; Mark, he receiveth it; Luke, he keepeth it.


### John Calvin:
1. "None are compared by Christ to a good and fertile soil, but those in whom the word of God not only strikes its roots deep and solid, but overcomes every obstacle that would prevent it from yielding fruit."
2. "Though the fertility of that soil, which yields a thirty-fold produce, is small, compared with that which yields a hundred-fold, yet we perceive that our Lord classes together all kinds of soil which do not entirely disappoint the labors and expectation of the husbandman."
3. "Hence too we learn, that we have no right to despise those who occupy a lower degree of excellence; for the master of the house himself, though he gives to one the preference above another on account of more abundant produce, yet bestows the general designation, good, even on inferior soils."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "All is of divine grace, yet the verse plainly teaches that the persons referred to actively and willingly accept and understand the truth." 
2. "The result being continued fruitfulness." 
3. "This class alone fulfills the purpose of the sower."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The fruit reveals the character of the tree and the value of the straw for wheat."
2. "There is variety in those who do bear fruit, but they have some fruit."
3. "The soil determines the outcome."

### John Gill:
1. "The hearer compared to good ground into which the seed fell, is he that heareth the word and understandeth it; has a new and spiritual understanding given him, feels the power of it on his heart, enlightening and quickening him."
2. "But abides by it, stands fast in it, and is valiant for it: and this he does in and with 'an honest and good heart'; which no man naturally has; nor can any man make his heart so: this is the work of God, and is owing to his efficacious grace."
3. "The fruit bore, and brought forth by such an hearer, is the true fruit of grace and righteousness, and is all from Christ, under the influences of the Spirit, through the word and ordinances...and is brought forth with patience: constantly, and continually, in all seasons, in old age, and even unto death; and is at last brought 'to perfection', holds, and remains unto the end."

### John Wesley:
1. Some a hundred fold, some sixty, some thirty â€” That is, in various proportions; some abundantly more than others.
