# Matthew 13:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The seed falling on stony places refers to a hard, rocky surface with a thin layer of soil. The heat from the sun causes the shallow earth to warm up quickly, resulting in rapid growth upwards. This growth is described as shooting up at once, breaking through the thin surface of the earth. However, the rocky places represent hearts that remain unbroken and hardened, despite hearing the word. These hearts may not outwardly reject the word, but their internal hardness prevents true growth and transformation.

1. "œÑ·Ω∞ œÄŒµœÑœÅœéŒ¥Œ∑... where therefore the radiation from the face of the rock would cause the seed to spring up quickly." 
2. "...the shallow earth being heated by the sun of the day before."
3. "...abound in Palestine."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Stony places. Not ground covered with loose stones, but a hard, rocky surface, covered with a thin layer of soil.


### Philip Schaff:
1. "Upon the rocky places. Not full of stones, but thin soil over rocks."
2. "Forthwith they sprung up, because, etc. The greater heat of the shallow soil would cause a rapid growth upwards."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The rocky places (œÑŒ± œÄŒµœÑœÅœâŒ¥Œ∑). In that limestone country ledges of rock often jut out with thin layers of soil upon the layers of rock."
2. "Straightway they sprang up (ŒµœÖŒ∏ŒµœâœÇ ŒµŒæŒ±ŒΩŒµœÑŒµŒπŒªŒµŒΩ). "Shot up at once" (Moffatt). Double compound (ŒµŒæ, out of the ground, Œ±ŒΩŒ±, up)."
3. "Ingressive aorist of ŒµŒæŒ±ŒΩŒ±œÑŒµŒªŒªœâ."

### John Gill:
1. "Some fell upon stony places...in whom the natural hardness of their hearts continues, and who remain unbroken by the word."
2. "They quickly broke through the thin surface of the earth over them, and appeared above ground before the usual time of the springing up of seed."
3. "Though they did not refuse to hearken to the word externally, did not put away the shoulder, or stop their ears, yet their hearts were still like an adamant stone."

- Attempt 1 BHT: The seed falling on stony places refers to a hard, rocky surface with a thin layer of soil. The heat from the sun causes the shallow earth to warm up quickly, resulting in rapid growth upwards. This growth is described as shooting up at once, breaking through the thin surface of the earth. However, the rocky places represent hearts that remain unbroken and hardened, despite hearing the word. These hearts may not outwardly reject the word, but their internal hardness prevents true growth and transformation.
