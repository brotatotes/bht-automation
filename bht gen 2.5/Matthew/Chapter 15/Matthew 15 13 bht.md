## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The plant is the teaching of the Pharisees, altogether of human, and not of divine planting."
2. "Seed, plant, &c., are compared to doctrine, which however in its growth becomes identified with, and impersonated by, its recipients and disseminators."
3. "Ï†Ï…Ï„ÏŒÎ½, naturÃ¢: Ï†Ï…Ï„ÎµÎ¯Î±, curÃ¢."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Every plant, which my heavenly Father hath not planted, shall be rooted upâ€”They are offended, are they? Heed it not: their corrupt teaching is already doomed..."
2. "The garden of the Lord upon earth, too long cumbered with their presence, shall yet be purged of them and their accursed system..."
3. "Whatsoever is not of the planting of My heavenly Father, the great Husbandman, shall share the same fate."

### John Calvin:
1. "There is no reason to wonder if the doctrine of salvation shall prove deadly to the reprobate, because they are always carried headlong to the destruction to which they are doomed."
2. "To those who willingly perish the Gospel thus becomes... the savor of death unto death."
3. "He [Jesus] expressly declares, that the first origin of our salvation flows from that grace by which God elected us to be his children before we were created."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Every plant. This refers to the teaching and traditions of the Pharisees, although the persons became identified with their false doctrine."
2. "Which my heavenly father planted not. The Pharisees claimed Divine authority for their teaching; our Lord declares by implication that it was wholly human and as such should be rooted up, taken away and destroyed, to make room for a plant of His planting, the purer doctrine of the kingdom."
3. "It was a declaration of a purpose to oppose the Pharisees. To us it is a promise, with a terrible side indeed, but bidding us take courage when we see false and corrupt religion flourishing; it â€˜shall be rooted up.â€™"

### John Gill:
1. "Whatever is not of heaven, but of man, of man's devising, and of human imposition, must be opposed and rejected."
2. "There are some plants, which are planted by Christ's Father, which is in heaven; these are the elect of God."
3. "These get into churches, and are outwardly and ministerially planted there; but being never rooted in Christ, nor partake of his grace, in time they wither, and die away."

### John Wesley:
1. Every plant â€” That is, every doctrine.
