# Matthew 15:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The tradition of saying Corban or Gift allowed individuals to evade their duty to care for their parents. By uttering this word, they were released from the obligation to support their parents, even though the vow did not require them to give their possessions to religious purposes. This tradition contradicted God's commandment and rendered it ineffective. It allowed individuals to keep their possessions for themselves or for the benefit of others, but not for their parents.

3. "So that a man so vowing might give nothing to the service of God, but keep his whole substance to himself; which he might make use of for his own benefit, and for the benefit of others, but not for his father and mother; who, after such a vow made, were to receive no benefit by it, unless rescinded by a wise man."
