# Matthew 17:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, commanding it to come out of the boy and never enter him again. The spirit cried out and left the child seemingly lifeless. However, the demon obeyed Jesus' command and the boy was cured. The crowd was amazed but likely skeptical. The focus of Jesus' rebuke was not the father's unbelief or the boy himself, but the foul spirit. The disease and the demon were seen as one and the same, with the former being caused by the latter.
