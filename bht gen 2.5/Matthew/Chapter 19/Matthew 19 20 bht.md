# Matthew 19:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The young man in this account was sincere and self-righteous, striving to keep all of God's commandments. Jesus looked upon him with love, recognizing his earnestness. However, the young man's question revealed a lack of understanding about the nature of goodness and the spirituality of the law. Despite his external morality, he felt a sense of lacking and had not attained peace of conscience. He believed he had kept all the commandments, but Jesus called him to something more, something he did not yet possess.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "This young man, though self-righteous, was no hypocrite, no Pharisee: he spoke earnestly, and really strove to keep, as he really believed he had kept, all God's commandments."
2. "In spite of his error there was a nobleness and openness about him, contrasted with the hypocritical bearing of the Pharisees and Scribes."
3. "Jesus looking upon him loved him."

### John Gill:
1. "Though he was so very rich and in such an exalted station in life, as to be a ruler, it seems he was but a young man; and to be so early serious and religious, amidst so much riches and grandeur, though it was but externally, was both remarkable and commendable."
2. "In what am I deficient hitherto? in what have I come short of doing these things? what remains at last to be performed? what other precepts are to be obeyed?"
3. "If there are any other commands, I am ready to observe them, which may be thought necessary to obtain eternal life."
