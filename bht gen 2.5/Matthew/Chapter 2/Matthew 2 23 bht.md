## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "These words refer to the divine purpose in the event, not to that of Joseph in bringing it about."
2. "The general sense of the prophets is, that Christ should be a despised person, as the inhabitants of Nazareth were."
3. "There may be an allusion to נֵצֶר, a branch, by which name our Lord is called in Isaiah 11:1, and from which word it appears that the name Nazareth is probably derived."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The little town of Nazareth, mentioned neither in the Old Testament nor in JOSEPHUS, was probably so called from its insignificance: a weak twig in contrast to a stately tree; and a special contempt seemed to rest upon it."
2. "Thus, in the providential arrangement by which our Lord was brought up at the insignificant and opprobrious town called Nazareth, there was involved, first, a local humiliation; next, an allusion to Isaiah's prediction of His lowly, twig-like upspringing from the branchless, dried-up stump of Jesse; and yet further, a standing memorial of that humiliation which 'the prophets,' in a number of the most striking predictions, had attached to the Messiah."
3. "At the same time it is difficult, with these facts before us, to conceive that either of these two Evangelists wrote his Gospel with that of the other before him—though many think this a precarious inference."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The Lord Jesus, in fact, resided there until he entered on the work of his ministry until he was about 30 years of age."
2. "The character of the people of Nazareth was such that they were proverbially despised and contemned... To come from Nazareth, therefore, or to be a Nazarene, was the same as to be despised, or to be esteemed of low birth; to be a root out of dry ground, having no form or comeliness. This was what had been predicted by all the prophets."
3. "When Matthew says, therefore, that the prophecies were “fulfilled,” his meaning is, that the predictions of the prophets that he would be of a low and despised condition, and would be rejected, were fully accomplished in his being an inhabitant of Nazareth, and despised as such."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The prophets. Note the plural, as indicating not any one prediction in particular, but a summary of the import of several prophetic statements..."
2. "A Nazarene. A term of contempt... The very name of Nazareth suggested insignificance."
3. "He was not a lofty branch on the summit of a stately tree; not a recognized and honored son of the royal house of David, now fallen, but an insignificant sprout from the roots of Jesse; a Nazarene, of an upstart sprout - town."

### John Calvin:
1. "The word נזיר, or Nazarite, signifies holy and devoted to God, and is derived from נזר, to separate."
2. "For Matthew, as we perceive, makes an express reference to the very word, and to the ancient Nazarites, whose holiness was of a peculiar character."
3. "All that Scripture predicts, in a favorable manner, about Samson, may justly be applied to Christ. To express it more clearly, Christ is the original model: Samson is the inferior antitype."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Nor was it strange that Joseph, though previously a resident of Galilee, should at first seek to return to Judea. The revelations made to him would suggest Bethlehem as the proper place to train this 'child.'"
2. "'He naturally supposed that He who was of the tribe of Judah should dwell in the land of Judah, the most religious, most sacred part of Palestine; and, as the promised Messiah, should be brought as near as possible to the theocratic centre, where He might have frequent intercourse with the priests and rabbis, and be educated under the very shadow of the temple.'"
3. "'It is situated on the northern edge of the great central plain of Jezreel or Esdraelon, into which it opens through a narrow pass in the wall of hills by which it is surrounded. The name Nazareth, seems to be an Aramaic form of a Hebrew word, meaning a shoot or twig, and applied by Isaiah (Isaiah 11:1) to the Messiah as a shoot from the prostrate trunk or stem of Jesse.'"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "It may be that this term of contempt is what is meant, and that several prophecies are to be combined."
2. "The lowly Nazarene he was at first, but it is our glory to be the followers of the Nazarene."
3. "Surely Matthew is not beyond the bounds of reason or of fact in illustrating in his own way the birth and infancy of Jesus by the Providence of God in the history of Israel."

### John Gill:
1. "And it designs the prophet Isaiah, and respects that prophecy of his in Isaiah 11:1 'and there shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse, and נצר, 'a branch shall grow out of his roots'; a prophecy owned by the Jews e themselves to belong to the Messiah, and which was now fulfilled in Jesus."
2. "Now though Christ was not born, yet because he dwelt at Nazareth, and was educated there; hence the Jews frequently call him ישוע הנוצרי, 'Jesus, the Nazarene'; and sometimes only הנוצרי, 'the Nazarene.'"
3. "Surenhusius observes l, that the form לקיום מה שנאמר 'to fulfill what is said', used by the Talmudists, and which he takes to be the same with this here, is used by them when they allege not the very words of Moses, or the prophets, but their sense, which is deduced as a certain axiom from them; and thinks it is applicable to the present case."

### John Wesley:
1. "He came and dwelt in Nazareth... a place contemptible to a proverb." 
2. "So that hereby was fulfilled what has been spoken in effect by several of the prophets... He shall be called a Nazarene." 
3. "He shall be despised and rejected, shall be a mark of public contempt and reproach."
