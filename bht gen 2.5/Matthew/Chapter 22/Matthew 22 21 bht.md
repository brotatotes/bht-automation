### John Calvin:
1. "If you think it strange to pay tribute, be not subjects of the Roman Empire. But the money (which men employ as the pledge of mutual exchanges) attests that Caesar rules over you."
2. "Christâ€™s reply does not leave the matter open, but contains full instruction on the question which had been proposed. It lays down a clear distinction between spiritual and civil government, in order to inform us that outward subjection does not prevent us from having within us a conscience free in the sight of God."
3. "Every man, according to his calling, ought to perform the duty which he owes to men; that children ought willingly to submit to their parents, and servants to their masters; that they ought to be courteous and obliging towards each other, according to the law of charity, provided that God always retain the highest authority."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Wherever any kingâ€™s money is current, there that king is lord."
2. "Render to â€˜the powers that be,â€™ the service due them."
3. "Real religion makes men better citizens, since it enjoins a religious fulfilment of political obligations."

### Archibald T. Robertson:

### John Gill:

2. "This being the case now with the Jews, Christ's advice is, render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's, and unto God, the things that are God's."
3. "Subjection to civil magistrates is not inconsistent with the reverence and fear of God; all are to have their dues rendered unto them, without entrenching upon one another."
