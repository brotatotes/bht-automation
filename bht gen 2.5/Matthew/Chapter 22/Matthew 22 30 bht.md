# Matthew 22:30 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
After the resurrection, the relationship between people will not be the same as it is now. Those who are raised up will be like angels in heaven, free from the limitations of the present life. While they will be equal to angels in mode of existence, they will still be distinguished from them. In the world to come, there will be no marriage, eating, drinking, fructification, increase, commerce, envy, hatred, or contention. The redeemed will be incorruptible and immortal, just like the angels.
