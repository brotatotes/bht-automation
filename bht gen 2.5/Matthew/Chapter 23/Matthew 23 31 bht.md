# Matthew 23:31 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Pharisees acknowledged their connection to the prophets' murderers, not just in terms of lineage, but also in spirit and conduct. Their building of tombs was a hypocritical display of piety, as they knew in their consciences that they were merely continuing the legacy of their forefathers. By admitting their connection to the past, they were essentially condemning themselves and demonstrating their lack of understanding of their own condition and the gravity of their ancestors' crimes.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Albert Barnes:
1. "It was not by their building the tombs that they were witnesses that they were the children of those who killed the prophets; but that, in spite of all this pretence of piety, under all this cloak of profession, they knew in their consciences, and were witnesses to themselves, that it was mere hypocrisy..."
2. "Children of them ... - Resembling them; approving their conduct; inheriting their feelings."
3. "They not only showed that they were descended from them, but that they possessed their spirit, and that, in similar circumstances, they would have done as they did."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "You acknowledge the sins of your fathers, but hypocritically deny your own, adding hypocrisy to impiety."
2. "Ye witness to yourselves, your own consciences condemning you, that ye are the sons (morally as well as naturally) of them that slew the prophets."
3. "Doing this in appearance only, the Pharisees showed that they had no true conception of either their own condition, or the crime of their fathers."

### John Gill:
1. "For what they said was a plain acknowledgment, and a full confession, what their fathers had done, and whose offspring they were." 
2. "They plainly owned, that their fathers killed the prophets, and that they descended from them; though they meant not so much to reproach, their ancestors, as to give themselves a greater character."
3. "Their practices showed them to be of the same spirit and principles with their progenitors."
