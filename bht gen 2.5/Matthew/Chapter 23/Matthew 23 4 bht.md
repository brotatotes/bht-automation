## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Imitate them not for they do not themselves what they enjoin on others."
2. "The irksomeness and unbearableness of these rites did not belong to the Law in itself, but were created by the rigour and ritualism of these men."
3. "The emphasis is not on the pronoun, but on the Œ¥Œ±Œ∫œÑœçŒª·ø≥."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "For they bind heavy burdens and grievous to be borne, and lay them on men's shoulders; but they themselves will not move them." 
2. "Referring not so much to the irksomeness of the legal rites, though they were irksome enough, as to the heartless rigor with which they were enforced."
3. "Men of shameless inconsistency."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The 'heavy burdens' refer not here to the traditions and foolish customs of the Pharisees, for Jesus would not command the people to observe them; but they clearly mean the ceremonies and rights appointed by Moses."
2. "The Pharisees were rigid in requiring that all the people should pay the taxes, give of their property, comply with every part of the law with the utmost rigor, yet they indulged themselves, and bore as little of the expense and trouble as possible."
3. "With one of their fingers - In the least degree. They will not render the least aid."

### John Calvin:
1. "That the Law of God should be called a heavy and intolerable burden is not wonderful, and more especially in reference to our weakness."
2. "Christ reproves the stern and rigid manner of teaching which was usually followed by those proud hypocrites, who authoritatively demand from others what they owe to God, and are rigorous in enforcing duties, and yet indolently dispense with the performance of what they so strictly enjoin on others, and allow themselves to do whatever they please."
3. "No man will exercise moderation in commanding others unless he shall first become his own teacher."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "They so presented the correct law as to make its precepts heavy burdens, like loads, packs on beasts of burden."
2. "Imposing such burdens, they did not in the least lighten them by spiritual precept or example."
3. "A fourfold rebuke: 1 . they make religion a burden; 2 . an intolerable burden; 3 . they lay it upon the shoulders of others; 4 . they leave it untouched themselves, i.e., they have no idea of fulfilling these precepts in spirit and in truth."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1.  With their finger (œÑœâ Œ¥Œ±Œ∫œÑœÖŒªœâ Œ±œÖœÑœâŒΩ). A picturesque proverb. They are taskmasters, not burden-bearers, not sympathetic helpers. 


### John Gill:
1. "Frequent mention is made of 'the light things of the school of Shammai, and of the heavy things of the school of Hillel.'"
2. "The binding of these heavy things, means the imposing them on men, obliging them to observe them very strictly, under great penalties, should they omit them."
3. "They were so slothful and indolent themselves, that though they strictly enjoined the observance of their numerous and unwritten traditions on the people, yet in many cases, where they could without public notice, they neglected them themselves, or at least, made them lighter and easier to them."

### John Wesley:
1. Luke 11:46.
