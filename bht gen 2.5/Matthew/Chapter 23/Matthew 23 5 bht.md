### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: The Pharisees and scribes in Matthew 23:5 were motivated by the desire for human applause, as they sought to be seen and admired by others. They wore phylacteries, which were strips of parchment with Scripture texts, on their foreheads and arms during prayer, as well as fringes on their garments. These external displays were meant to showcase their supposed zeal for the law, but they were ultimately empty and hypocritical. The size and prominence of their phylacteries were seen as indicators of their supposed righteousness, but Jesus condemned such outward displays as mere ostentation. These external badges of religious feeling were not only used by the Pharisees but have been employed throughout history for similar reasons. However, Jesus saw through their ritualism and recognized that it ultimately led to His own crucifixion.
