# Matthew 24:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The beginning of travail refers to the sufferings that will precede the coming of the Messiah. However, it can also be understood as the pains of death. These woes are not a proof of the end, but rather the beginning. Far heavier calamities are yet to come before the end, and these physical woes are the basis for the greater moral woes. The death-throes of the Jewish state will precede the regeneration of the universal Christian Church and the new heavens and new earth. Believers should prepare themselves for a long exercise of patience in the midst of these sorrows.
