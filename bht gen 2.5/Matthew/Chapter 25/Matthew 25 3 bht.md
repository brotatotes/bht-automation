# Matthew 25:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The foolish virgins are described as not taking any oil with them for their lamps. This lack of oil signifies their ignorance and neglect of true grace, as they did not understand its value or necessity. They were foolish in not realizing their need for oil until it was too late. The oil represents the grace of the Spirit, which is holy, sanctifying, and purifying. Without this grace, their lamps of faith would not burn for long, as they did not have a future supply to sustain them.
