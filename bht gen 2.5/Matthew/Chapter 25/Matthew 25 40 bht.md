# Matthew 25:40 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When we show love and kindness to the least of Christ's brethren, we are actually doing it to Him. This reveals Christ's identification with the needy and suffering, and our actions towards them are proof of our love for Him. The least refers to the obscurest, poorest, and most despised individuals. This principle forms the basis of Christian charity and morality, as we are called to treat all men as possible brethren of Christ. Our acts of kindness towards them are seen and rewarded by the Son of God Himself.
