# Matthew 25:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The delay of the bridegroom in this parable tests the faith and patience of believers. The slumbering and sleeping represent a spiritual decline and a gradual forgetfulness of Christ's coming. However, this does not imply that all Christians will be spiritually asleep when Christ returns. Instead, it emphasizes the importance of being ready and not being distracted by worldly occupations. The delay also signifies the need for the spread of the Gospel and the gathering of all the elect before Christ's return.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Christ 'tarries,' among other reasons, to try the faith and patience of His people." 
2. "The world 'slumbered' signifies, simply, 'nodded,' or, 'became drowsy'; while the word 'slept' is the usual word for lying down to sleep, denoting two stages of spiritual declension." 
3. "Such was the state alike of the wise and the foolish virgins, even till the cry of the Bridegroom's approach awoke them."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The bridegroom tarried - That is, while they waited for him. It was uncertain at what time he would come. He delayed longer than they expected."
2. "All slumbered and slept - Waiting until near midnight, they fell into repose. This circumstance is not to be pressed to prove that all Christians will be asleep, or cold and careless when the Lord Jesus shall come."
3. "This circumstance is designed simply to show more clearly the 'duty of being ready.'"

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Slumbered is, literally, nodded... They dropped their heads." 
2. "Slept is imperfect, of continuous slumber."

### John Calvin:
1. "Some interpret this slumbering in a bad sense, as if believers, along with others, abandoned themselves to sloth, and were asleep amidst the vanities of the world; but this is altogether inconsistent with the intention of Christ and with the structure of the parable."
2. "There would be greater probability in explaining it to denote death, which overtakes believers before the coming of Christ; for it is not at that time only that we must look for salvation, but also when we have left the world and are sleeping in Christ."
3. "But I take it more simply as denoting earthly occupations, in which believers must be engaged, so long as they dwell in the body; and, though forgetfulness of the kingdom of God ought never to steal upon them, yet the distracting influence of the occupations of this world is not inappropriately compared to sleep."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Now while the bridegroom tarried; as they were waiting for him; an allusion to the delay of the Lord."
2. "All slumbered and slept. Sleep overcame them, even while trying to keep awake. This probably refers to a gradual forgetfulness of, or ceasing to expect at once, the coming of Christ. It indicates an unconscious giving way to the influence of the world."
3. "Christ‚Äôs coming will be unexpected by all, even by those who make calculations about it."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "They all slumbered and slept... a vivid picture drawn by the difference in the two tenses."
2. "Many a preacher has seen this happen while he is preaching."

### John Gill:
1. "The reason why he tarries is, because his time is not come, and there are many things to be done first; there is to be a glorious spread of the Gospel all over the world; all the elect must be gathered in, both among Jews and Gentiles; and the man of sin must be destroyed; and the ungodly must fill up the measure of their iniquities; and Christ tarries to try the graces of his people, who should exercise faith in his coming, by looking, watching, and waiting for it, desirous of it, and hastening unto it; being ready for him, prepared to receive him, and to go with him to the nuptial-chamber." 
2. "The wise virgins are children of the day, and not of the night; though they sleep, their hearts wake, and they sleep with grace in their hearts; neither of which can be said of the foolish virgins, or formal professors."
3. "The phrase ◊†◊ô◊ô◊ù ◊ï◊©◊õ◊ô◊ë, which I should choose to render, 'he slumbered and slept', is often said of the same person, without any distinction, as here."

### John Wesley:
1. "Before they were called to attend him, they all slumbered and slept - were easy and quiet..." (Quote 1)
2. "The wise enjoying a true, the foolish a false peace." (Quote 2)
