## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### John Calvin:
1. "Christâ€™s admonition was so far from being of any avail for softening the heart of Judas, or producing any change in it for the better, that he immediately went away, without any concern, to transact an infamous bargain with his enemies."
2. "It was amazing and prodigious stupidity, that he considered himself to have found, in the expense of the ointment, a fair excuse for so heinous a crime; and next, that, after having been warned by the words of Christ, he did not perceive what he was doing."
3. "We see in this mirror how great is the blindness of wicked desires, and how powerfully they fascinate the mind. Judas was inflamed with the desire to steal; long practice had hardened him in wickedness; and now when he meets with no other prey, he does not scruple to betray basely to death the Son of God."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The principal motive, as is inferred from the strong expression of John (John 12:6), was avarice."
2. "His practical talent must have been marked, to secure this position for him, and the scene at Bethany shows that he had influence among his associates."
3. "The hour had come when his sordid soul was ready to listen to the suggestions of Satan; â€˜then entered Satan into Judas, surnamed Iscariot.â€™"

### John Gill:
1. "He was not an open enemy, nor one of Christ's common hearers, nor one of the seventy disciples, but one of his twelve apostles, whom he made his intimates and associates; whom he selected from all others, and called, qualified, and sent forth to preach his Gospel, and perform miracles."
2. "It was one of these that meditated the delivery of him into the hands of his enemies, and never left pursuing his scheme till he had effected it."
3. "Judas set out from thence to Jerusalem; see John 13:30, so that it must be the next day before he could meet the high priests, and on the morrow, at night, he delivered him into their hands; on the proposal of which, they say, that Simeon ben Shetach, whom they make to be present at this time, and all the wise men and elders, 'rejoiced exceedingly'."

### John Wesley:
1. Mark 14:10; Luke 22:3.
