# Matthew 26:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The disciples, one after the other, began to ask Jesus, Is it I, Lord? This question, in the Greek form, implies a denial, which highlights the hypocrisy of Judas in asking it privately. However, every Christian may ask this question at the Lord's table. The disciples' inquiry was not out of fear or guilt, but rather a mark of reverence and a declaration of their innocence. They were conscious of their own hearts' treachery and deceitfulness, and they abhorred the thought of betraying Jesus.
