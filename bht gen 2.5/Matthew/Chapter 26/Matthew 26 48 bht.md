## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The common rendering of ·ºîŒ¥œâŒ∫ŒµŒΩ as a plusq. perf. is unnecessary and unwarranted: the aorist is simply historical, gave them a sign; when is not stated."
2. "On Mark's addition, Œ∫Œ±·Ω∂ ·ºÄœÄŒ±Œ≥Œ¨Œ≥ŒµœÑŒµ ·ºÄœÉœÜŒ±Œª·ø∂œÇ, see notes there."

### John Calvin:
1. "I have no doubt that Judas was restrained, either by reverence for our Lord, or by shame for his crime, from venturing openly to avow himself as one of the enemies."
2. "It was, at the same time, astonishing madness, either to attempt to conceal himself by frivolous hypocrisy, when he came into the presence of the Son of God, or to oppose the tricks and dexterity of men to his boundless power."
3. "Judas...recollected the numerous proofs by which Christ had formerly attested his divine power."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The kiss among the ancients was a sign of affectionate and cordial intimacy, and particularly a token of fidelity."
2. "Judas may have feared He might still elude them, either by some exercise of His acknowledged power, or, more probably, with the help of His disciples."
3. "The signal agreed upon would be necessary to point Him out to the Roman soldiers, who might not have understood the conversation or had orders to act upon this sign."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "At any rate Judas had given the leaders to understand that he would kiss Jesus in order to identify him for certain."
2. "This revolting ostentatious kiss is 'the most terrible instance of the ŒµŒ∫ŒøœÖœÉŒπŒ± œÜŒπŒªŒ∑ŒºŒ±œÑŒ± ŒµœáŒ∏œÅŒøœÖ (Proverbs 27:6),' the profuse kisses of an enemy."
3. "This same compound verb occurs in Luke 7:38 of the sinful woman, in Luke 15:20 of the Father's embrace of the Prodigal Son, and in Acts 20:37 of the Ephesian elders and Paul."

### John Gill:
1. "Judas himself might not be able to discern him, so as to point him out, until he came very near him."
2. "Judas might think this would best cover his treacherous designs, who, with all his wickedness, had not effrontery enough to come sword in hand and seize him in a violent manner."
3. "The reason of his advice, 'hold him fast,' was, because he knew that once and again, when attempts were made to seize him, he easily disengaged himself, passed through the midst, and went his way."
