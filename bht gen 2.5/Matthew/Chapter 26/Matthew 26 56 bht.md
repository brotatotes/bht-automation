### John Calvin:

2. "Every thing in this account is an aggravation of their pusillanimity, and ingratitude; as that they were the 'disciples' of Christ that forsook him, whom he had called, and sent forth as his apostles to preach his Gospel; and to whom he had given extraordinary gifts and powers."
3. "To leave him 'then', in the midst of his enemies, in his great distress and trouble, was very unkind and ungrateful."
