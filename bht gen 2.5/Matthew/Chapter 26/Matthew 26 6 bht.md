## BHT:
The identity of Simon, the leper, remains uncertain. Some speculate that he may have been Martha's father or husband, but this is not confirmed.

The anointing of Jesus' feet with oil by a woman, possibly Mary of Bethany, is also mentioned. The act of anointing was not typically done on the feet, but John emphasizes that the oil was poured on Christ's feet.
