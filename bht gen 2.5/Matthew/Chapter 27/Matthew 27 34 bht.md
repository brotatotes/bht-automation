# Matthew 27:34 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus was offered a stupefying drink on his way to execution, but he refused to partake in it, showing his awareness of its purpose. The drink was a mixture of wine and gall or myrrh, which had a narcotic and stupefying effect. Jesus chose not to drink it because he wanted to fully experience the cup of suffering that his Father had given him. The drink was intended to dull the pain of crucifixion, but Jesus willingly embraced the unmitigated sufferings of the cross.

Matthew 26:15, and compare with this verse, Psalms 69:21."

### Albert Barnes:

3. "For the two accounts perfectly agree with each other; that a remedy was given to him in order to put an end to the torments of a lingering death, and yet that Christ was in every respect treated with harshness, so that the very alleviation was a part, or rather was an augmentation, of his pain."
