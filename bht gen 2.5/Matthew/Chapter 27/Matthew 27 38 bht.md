# Matthew 27:38 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus was crucified between two robbers, possibly members of the band of Barabbas. This placement was meant to show contempt for Jesus and mock his title as the King of the Jews. It was a finishing stroke of disgrace, as Jesus was executed alongside criminals. However, this act of crucifixion was necessary for Christ to take our place and free us from condemnation. It demonstrated his inestimable love for us, as he allowed himself to be numbered with the wicked in order to bring us into the company of the holy angels.
