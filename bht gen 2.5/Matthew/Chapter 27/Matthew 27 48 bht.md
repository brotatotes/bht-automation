# Matthew 27:48 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The soldiers offered vinegar to Jesus on a sponge, which was a common drink of Roman soldiers. Some suggest that it was repeatedly offered to annoy Jesus, while others propose that it was held out to him in a cup before he was raised on the cross. Jesus tasted the vinegar, fulfilling his thirst, and this act of receiving refreshment from one who still mocked him is seen as a sign of his love conquering the world's hate. The use of a sponge was practical for reaching Jesus, as his head was about two feet above the ground.
