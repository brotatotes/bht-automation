# Matthew 3:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus, being sinless, voluntarily came to be baptized by John as a part of His obedience to the Divine law and to fulfill all righteousness. His baptism marked the end of His concealed life of legal submission and the beginning of His public life of mediatorial satisfaction. Though baptism was a rite for sinners, Jesus underwent it to consecrate it in His own body and assure believers that they are united with Him. His baptism also served as an example for His followers and testified to the heavenly origin of John's baptism.

### Albert Barnes:
