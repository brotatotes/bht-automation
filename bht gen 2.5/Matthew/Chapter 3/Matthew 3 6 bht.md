# Matthew 3:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
John the Baptist administered baptism during the day, resembling the baptism of proselytes. Baptism was a public seal of their need for deliverance from sin and their readiness to welcome the coming Deliverer. The movement grew gradually, with people coming from all over Judea and even Jerusalem. Baptism symbolized a putting away of impurity and a commitment to purity in heart and life. It was a symbolical washing, signifying moral renovation and spiritual purification. Confession of sins was demanded before baptism, signifying repentance. The manner of baptism was immersion or plunging in water, and it was a tacit acknowledgment of sin.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:

2. "It is most probable that John‚Äôs baptism in outward form resembled that of proselytes."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "This baptism was at once a public seal of their felt need of deliverance from sin, of their expectation of the coming Deliverer, and of their readiness to welcome Him when He appeared."

3. "They were familiar enough with the baptism of proselytes from heathenism; but this baptism of Jews themselves was quite new and strange to them."

### John Calvin:
