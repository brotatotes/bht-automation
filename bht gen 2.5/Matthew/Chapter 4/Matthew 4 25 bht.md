2. "The country beyond Jordan was not so much esteemed as what was properly the land of Canaan, or Israel; for the Jews say, 'the land of Israel is holier than all lands; because they bring out of it the sheaf, the first fruits, and the showbread, which they do not bring from other lands: the land of Canaan is holier than beyond Jordan; the land of Canaan is fit to be the habitation of the Shekinah; beyond Jordan is not.'"
3. "It is to be observed, that here are three countries distinctly mentioned, Galilee, Judea, and 'beyond Jordan'; which was the division of the land of Israel; of these three lands the Talmudists often speak."
