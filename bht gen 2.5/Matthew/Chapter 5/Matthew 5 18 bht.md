## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "While heaven and earth last, one jot or one tittle shall not pass away from the law without all being fulfilled."
2. "It is important to observe in these days how the Lord here includes the O.T. and all its unfolding of the divine purposes regarding Himself, in His teaching of the citizens of the kingdom of heaven."
3. "That this is the course which unbelief has run in Germany, should be a pregnant warning to the decriers of the O.T. among ourselves. It should be a maxim for every expositor and every student, that Scripture is a whole, and stands or falls together."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "For verily I say unto youâ€”Here, for the first time, does that august expression occur in our Lord's recorded teaching, with which we have grown so familiar as hardly to reflect on its full import."
2. "It is the enduring stability, then, of the great truths and principles, moral and spiritual, of the Old Testament revelation which our Lord thus expresses."
3. "The meaning is that 'not so much as the smallest loss of authority or vitality shall ever come over the law.'"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Till heaven and earth pass - This expression denotes that the law never would be destroyed until it should be all fulfilled. It is the same as saying everything else may change; the very earth and heaven may pass away, but the law of God shall not be destroyed until its whole design has been accomplished."
2. "The moral laws are such as grow out of the nature of things, and which cannot, therefore, be changed - such as the duty of loving God and his creatures. These cannot be abolished, as it can never be made right to hate God, or to hate our fellow-men. Of this kind are the ten commandments, and these our Saviour has neither abolished nor superseded."
3. "The ceremonial laws are such as are appointed to meet certain states of society, or to regulate the religious rites and ceremonies of a people. These can be changed when circumstances are changed, and yet the moral law be untouched. A general in an army may command his soldiers to appear sometimes in a red coat and sometimes in blue or in yellow. This would be a ceremonial law, and might be changed as he pleased. The duty of obeying him, and of being faithful to his country, could not be changed."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The guilt of changing those little hooks which distinguish between certain Hebrew letters is declared to be so great that, if such a thing were done, the world would be destroyed."
2. "Jewish tradition mentions the letter jod as being irremovable; adding that, if all men in the world were gathered to abolish the least letter in the law, they would not succeed."
3. "Jot is for jod, the smallest letter in the Hebrew alphabet. Tittle is the little bend or point which serves to distinguish certain Hebrew letters of similar appearance."

### John Calvin:
1. "The truth of the law and of every part of it, is secure, and that nothing so durable is to be found in the whole frame of the world."
2. "Sooner shall heaven fall to pieces, and the whole frame of the world become a mass of confusion, than the stability of the law shall give way."
3. "There is nothing in the law that is unimportant, nothing that was put there at random; and so it is impossible that a single letter shall perish."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The whole phrase is used by Christ alone, the absolute, personal Truth."
2. "Till heaven, etc. Paraphrase: 'While heaven and earth last, one jot or one tittle shall not pass from the law without all these, declared, promised, or typified, being done.'"
3. "A warning against contempt for the Old Testament, which leads at last to a denial of Christ. He has Himself fulfilled the ceremonial law; He teaches the true, higher, spiritual significance of the whole law."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Not an iota, not a comma" (Moffatt), "not the smallest letter, not a particle" (Weymouth).
2. "Sometimes yod and vav were hardly distinguishable."
3. "The guilt of altering one of them is pronounced so great that if it were done the world would be destroyed."

### John Gill:
1. "Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled."
2. "The design of Christ, in conformity to the language of the Jews, is to declare, that no part of the law, not one of the least commandments in it, as he explains himself in the next verse, should be unaccomplished."
3. "It is a saying of one of the Jewish doctors that 'the whole world is not equal even to one word out of the law,' in which it is said, there is not one letter deficient or superfluous."
