## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "In the spiritual kingdom of Christ, shall the sins even of thought and word be brought into judgment and punished, each according to its degree of guilt, but even the least of them before no less a tribunal than the judgment-seat of Christ."
2. "The most important thing to keep in mind is, that there is no distinction of kind between these punishments, only of degree."
3. "So that the distinction drawn by the Romanists between venial and mortal sins, finds not only no countenance, but direct confutation from this passage."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "But I say unto you that it is broken even by causeless anger, which is but hatred in the bud, as hatred is incipient murder."
2. "If by the feelings, much more by those words in which all ill feeling, from the slightest to the most envenomed, are wont to be cast upon a brother."
3. "Just as there are gradations in human courts of judicature, and in the sentences which they pronounce according to the degrees of criminality, so will the judicial treatment of all the breakers of this commandment at the divine tribunal be according to their real criminality before the heart-searching Judge."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He that has a right to ordain and change laws in the government of God must be himself divine."
2. "To use such words is a violation of the spirit of the sixth commandment, and if indulged, may lead to a more open and dreadful infraction of that law."
3. "Jesus says likewise there shall be grades of condemnation for the different ways of violating the sixth commandment. Not only murder shall be punished by God, but anger and contempt shall be regarded by him as a violation of the law, and punished according to the offence."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The word Gehenna, rendered hell, occurs outside of the Gospels only at James 3:6."
2. "It is the Greek representative of the Hebrew Ge - Hinnom, or Valley of Hinnom, a deep, narrow glen to the south of Jerusalem."
3. "From its depth and narrowness, and its fire and ascending smoke, it became the symbol of the place of the future punishment of the wicked."

### John Calvin:

2. "He who shall say to his brother Christ assigns three degrees of condemnation... are murderers."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The sin is not in the word and act as such, but in the motive and spirit."
2. "There is also a righteous indignation and wrath, an innocent use of terms like those forbidden here."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Jesus thus assumes a tone of superiority over the Mosaic regulations and proves it in each of the six examples. He goes further than the Law into the very heart."
2. "Raca expresses contempt for a man's head=you stupid! More expresses contempt for his heart and character=you scoundrel."
3. "Gehenna 'should be carefully distinguished from Hades (Î±Î¹Î´Î·Ï‚) which is never used for the place of punishment, but for the place of departed spirits, without reference to their moral condition' (Vincent). The place of torment is in Hades, but so is heaven."

### John Gill:
1. "Causeless anger which is here condemned by Christ, as a breach of the law, 'thou shalt not kill.'"

### John Wesley:
1. "Whosoever is angry with his brother... We ought not, for any cause, to be so angry as to call any man Raca, or fool." 
2. "Happy world, were this plain and necessary distinction thoroughly understood, remembered, practiced!"
3. "Hell fire... It must here signify a degree of future punishment, as much more dreadful than those incurred in the two former cases, as burning alive is more dreadful than either strangling or stoning."
