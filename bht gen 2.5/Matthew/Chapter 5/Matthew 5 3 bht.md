# Matthew 5:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The poor in spirit are those who realize their complete need and emptiness before God. This self-emptying conviction is the foundation of spiritual excellence. The word blessed carries a deeper meaning than mere happiness, signifying a state of felicity that comes from recognizing one's spiritual poverty and relying on the mercy of God. The kingdom of heaven mentioned here refers to the reign of God in the heart and life, which is the ultimate goal and the source of true blessedness.

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Accordingly, our translators sometimes render such words 'the humble,' 'the meek,' 'the lowly,' as having no reference to outward circumstances. But here the explanatory words, 'in spirit,' fix the sense to 'those who in their deepest consciousness realize their entire need.'"
2. "This self-emptying conviction, that 'before God we are void of everything,' lies at the foundation of all spiritual excellence, according to the teaching of Scripture."
3. "The very sense of their poverty is begun riches. While others 'walk in a vain show'‚Äî'in a shadow,' 'an image'‚Äîin an unreal world, taking a false view of themselves and all around them‚Äîthe poor in spirit are rich in the knowledge of their real case."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The word 'blessed' means 'happy,' referring to that which produces felicity, from whatever quarter it may come."
2. "To be poor in spirit is to have a humble opinion of ourselves; to be sensible that we are sinners, and have no righteousness of our own; to be willing to be saved only by the rich grace and mercy of God."
3. "Jesus overlooked all those things, and fixed his eye on the poor and the humble, and said that happiness was to be found in the lowly vale of poverty more than in the pomp and splendors of life."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The biblical use of the word lifted it into the region of the spiritual, as distinguished from the merely intellectual, and besides, intrusted to it alone the task of representing this higher conception."
2. "While the pagan word carries the isolation of the virtuous and the contraction of human sympathy, the Gospel pushes these out with an ideal of a world - wide sympathy and of a happiness realized in ministry."
3. "The Christian word blessed is full of the light of heaven. It sternly throws away from itself every hint of the Stoic's asserted right of suicide as a refuge from human ills, and emphasizes something which thrives on trial and persecution, which glories in tribulation, which not only endures but conquers to world, and expects its crown in heaven."

### John Calvin:
1. "Happy are the poor in spirit."
2. "Matthew, by adding an epithet, confines the happiness to those only who, under the discipline of the cross, have learned to be humble."
3. "He only who is reduced to nothing in himself, and relies on the mercy of God, is poor in spirit."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The poor in spirit, not ‚Äòin body,‚Äô nor ‚Äòin mind.‚Äô The humble, those conscious of their spiritual needs, and thus prepared to be filled with the riches of the gospel."
2. "The discourse begins at the beginning; sense of want comes before spiritual blessings; the fruit of the law and the germ of the gospel."
3. "Pride is always the first and great hindrance to obtaining a part in the kingdom."

### Archibald T. Robertson:

2. "If you know these things, happy (ŒºŒ±Œ∫Œ±œÅŒπŒø) are you if you do them" (John 13:17).
3. "The kingdom of heaven" here means the reign of God in the heart and life. This is the summum bonum and is what matters most.

### John Gill:
1. "The kingdom of heaven cannot be said to belong to them all, or only; but such as are poor in a spiritual sense."
2. "They have nothing to eat that is fit and proper; nor any clothes to wear, but rags; nor are they able to purchase either; they have no money to buy with."
3. "Now these are pronounced 'blessed', for this reason, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven."
