## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "œÄŒøœÅŒΩŒµŒØŒ±œÇ must be taken to mean sin, not only before marriage, but after it also, in a wider sense, as including ŒºŒøŒπœáŒµŒØŒ± likewise."
2. "How far the marriage of the innocent party after separation (on account of œÄŒøœÅŒΩŒµŒØŒ±) is forbidden by this or the similar passage ch. Matthew 19:9, is a weighty and difficult question."
3. "We may well leave a matter in doubt, of which Augustine could write thus: 'In ipsis divinis sententiis ita obscurum est utrum et iste, cui quidem sine dubio adulteram licet dimittere, adulter tamen habeatur si alteram duxerit, ut, quantum existimo, venialiter ibi quisque fallatur.'"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Whosoever shall put away his wife, saving for the cause of fornication, causeth her to commit adultery‚Äîthat is, drives her into it in case she marries again." 
2. "Whosoever shall marry her that is divorced‚Äîfor anything short of conjugal infidelity‚Äîcommitteth adultery."
3. "Whether the innocent party, after a just divorce, may lawfully marry again, is not treated of here. The Church of Rome says, No; but the Greek and Protestant Churches allow it."

### John Calvin:
1. "As the bill of divorcement bore, that the woman had been loosed from her former husband, and might enter into a new marriage..."
2. "...the man who, unjustly and unlawfully, abandons the wife whom God had given him, is justly condemned..."
3. "...for having prostituted his wife to others."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Maketh her to commit adultery, not by the fact of her being divorced, but in view of the extremely probable case of another marriage."
2. "The application to the case of a man is not only required by the spirit of Christ‚Äôs teaching in general, but by the fact that He is here speaking of and condemning the sin of the man."
3. "This high ideal of the marriage union is the basis of social morality. To oppose it is not only unchristian, but to demoralize the family, and to make war against the welfare of humanity."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Saving for the cause of fornication (œÄŒ±œÅŒµŒ∫œÑŒøœÇ ŒªŒøŒ≥ŒøœÖ œÄŒøœÅŒΩŒµŒπŒ±œÇ). An unusual phrase that perhaps means 'except for a matter of unchastity.'" 
2. "McNeile denies that Jesus made this exception because Mark and Luke do not give it."
3. "It looks like criticism to meet modern needs."

### John Gill:
1. "Christ does not infringe, or revoke the original grant, or permission of divorce; only frees it from the false interpretations, and ill use, the Pharisees made of it; and restores the ancient sense of it..."
2. "For so it is written, 'The house of Shammai say, a man may not put away his wife, unless he finds some uncleanness in her,' according to Deuteronomy 24:1."
3. "Now our Lord says, without any exception, that a man ought not to put away his wife, whether first or second, for any other reason than uncleanness; and that whoever does, upon any other account, causeth her to commit adultery."

### John Wesley:
1. Causeth her to commit adultery ‚Äî If she marry again.
