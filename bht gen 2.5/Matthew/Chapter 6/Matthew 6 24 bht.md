# Matthew 6:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Man cannot serve both God and Mammon. This division in man's being cannot take place, as he must belong wholly and be entirely under the command of one master. The servant of God cannot at the same time obey Him and be avaricious or seek treasures on earth. Trying to serve both God and Mammon is impossible and implies a distinction in quality rather than numerical distinction. Those who attempt to serve two masters will fail, as the slave of Mammon will obey Mammon while pretending to obey God.
