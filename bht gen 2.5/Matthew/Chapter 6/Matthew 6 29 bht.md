## BHT:
The beauty of a flower, unfolded by the Divine Creator-Spirit from within, surpasses the highest earthly pomp. Vanity about such things is the height of folly. True adornment of man must be unfolded from within by the same Almighty Spirit. The kindness of God, displayed in herbs and flowers, exceeds all that men can accomplish. Believers should be convinced that they will lack nothing necessary for their satisfaction if they continue to enjoy the blessing of God alone. Even Solomon's glory, purely from art, could not match the natural beauty of the lilies or flowers of the field.
