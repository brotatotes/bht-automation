# Matthew 6:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus warns against using vain repetitions in prayer, specifically condemning mindlessly repeating the same words or multiplying them in the belief that it will make prayer more effective. This rebuke is directed at the Jewish error of babbling or prating, as well as the Roman Catholic practice of prescribed repetitions. However, Jesus does not condemn all repetition in prayer, as praying much and using the same words at times is not condemned and has the example of Jesus Himself. The Pagans believed that endless repetitions and many words would inform their gods and wear them down into granting their requests.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "What is forbidden in this verse is not much praying, for our Lord Himself passed whole nights in prayer: not praying in the same words, but the making number and length a point of observance, and imagining that prayer will be heard, not because it is the genuine expression of the desire of faith, but because it is of such a length, has been such a number of times repeated." 
2. "The repetitions of Paternosters and Ave Marias in the Romish Church, as practised by them, are in direct violation of this precept; the number of repetitions being prescribed, and the efficacy of the performance made to depend on it."
3. "Our Lord was also denouncing a Jewish error."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Babble not" would be a better rendering, both for the form of the wordâ€”which in both languages is intended to imitate the soundâ€”and for the sense, which expresses not so much the repetition of the same words as a senseless multiplication of them. (28 words)
2. "Every one who multiplies prayer is heard." In the Church of Rome, not only is it carried to a shameless extent, but the very prayer which our Lord gave as an antidote to vain repetitions is the most abused to this superstitious end. (41 words)
3. But praying much, and using at times the same words, is not here condemned, and has the example of our Lord Himself in its favor. (23 words)

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Use not vain repetitions." 
2. "It means to repeat a thing often; to say the same thing in different words, or to repeat the same words, as though God did not hear at first."
3. "Christ does not fix the length of our prayers. He says that we should not repeat the same thing, as though God did not hear; and it is not improbable that he intended to condemn the practice of long prayers."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Use vain repetitions [Î²Î±Ï„Ï„Î±Î»Î¿Î³Î·ÏƒÎ·Ï„Îµ] . A word formed in imitation of the sound, battalogein : properly, to stammer; then to babble or prate..." 
2. "...to repeat the same formula many times, as the worshippers of Baal and of Diana of Ephesus (1 Kings 18:26; Acts 19:34) and the Romanists with their paternosters and aves." 
3. "...the Romanists with their paternosters and aves."

### John Calvin:
1. "Christ reproves the folly of those who, with the view of persuading and entreating God, pour out a superfluity of words."
2. "This doctrine is not inconsistent with the praises everywhere bestowed in Scripture on earnestness in prayer: for, when prayer is offered with earnest feeling, the tongue does not go before the heart."
3. "The grace of God is not obtained by an unmeaning flow of words; but, on the contrary, a devout heart throws out its affections, like arrows, to pierce heaven."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The correct sense of the Greek word (lit, â€˜to speak stammeringlyâ€™) is given in our English version, although all senseless and irrelevant expressions are included."
2. "What is forbidden here is not much praying, not praying in the same words (the Lord did both); but the making number and length a point of observance."
3. "Prayer, not a magical charm, but a reasonable service. 'Much speaking' not 'much praying'; vain repetition' of heathen origin; merely external worship leads to senseless and sinful worship."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Use not vain repetitions... mere babbling or chattering, empty repetition." 
2. "Certainly Jesus does not mean to condemn all repetition in prayer."
3. "The Pagans thought that by endless repetitions and many words they would inform their gods as to their needs and weary them into granting their requests."

### John Gill:
1. "But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions....saying the same things over and over again." 
2. "They think they shall be heard for their much speaking."
3. "Their prayer books abound in tautologies, and in expressing the same things in different words, and by a multiplicity of them."

### John Wesley:
1. "To repeat any words without meaning them, is certainly a vain repetition."
2. "Therefore we should be extremely careful in all our prayers to mean what we say; and to say only what we mean from the bottom of our hearts."
3. "Indeed all the words in the world are not equivalent to one holy desire. And the very best prayers are but vain repetitions if they are not the language of the heart."
