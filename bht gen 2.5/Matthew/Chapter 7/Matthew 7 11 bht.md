# Matthew 7:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus affirms the fallen nature of humanity but also acknowledges the presence of goodness and parental love within us. This is seen as evidence of original sin. God, as the ultimate Father, has an even greater love for His children. The argument from the lesser to the greater is used to emphasize that if flawed human parents can give good gifts, then how much more will God, who is infinitely good, give good gifts to those who ask Him. This encourages believers to approach God in prayer, trusting in His provision.

2. "He who desires to approach God with the conviction that he will be heard, must learn to restrain his heart from asking any thing that is not agreeable to his will."
