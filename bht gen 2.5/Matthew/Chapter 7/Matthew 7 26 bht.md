# Matthew 7:26 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Those who hear the teachings of Jesus but do not put them into practice are like foolish builders who construct their houses on a weak foundation of sand. This signifies an empty profession and external services without true discipleship. The analogy emphasizes the importance of not just hearing sermons, but also living out their teachings. Life itself is the test, not mere knowledge or profession. The transient teachings and works of man are like shifting sand compared to the solid foundation of Christ.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "And every one that heareth these sayings of mineâ€”in the attitude of discipleship." 
2. "and doeth them not, shall be likened unto a foolish man, which built his house upon the sandâ€”denoting a loose foundationâ€”that of an empty profession and mere external services."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Life is the test, not knowledge, or profession." 
2. "Foolish, i.e., senseless, singularly imprudent." 
3. "The transitory teachings and works of man. For moral results, science itself is shifting sand compared to the Rock, Christ."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The foolish builder put his house on the sands that could not hold in the storm."
2. "Hearing sermons is a dangerous business if one does not put them into practice."
3. "One is reminded of the words of Jesus... about the one 'who does and teaches.'"

### John Gill:
1. "Who only externally hears them, but has no understanding of them; do not believe them, nor like and approve of them, but hates and despises them; or if not, depends upon his external hearing of them, and contents himself with a speculative knowledge, without the practice of them."
2. "Such shall be likened unto a foolish man, which built his house upon the sand; or, as Luke has it, 'without a foundation upon the earth'; upon the surface of the earth, without digging into it for a foundation."
3. "The salvation of the soul is a weighty thing; and that which is like sand, as is everything of a man's own, can never support it: God has therefore laid the salvation of his people on his own Son; and he must be a 'foolish man' that builds on anything short of him."
