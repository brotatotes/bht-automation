3. "ἐγίνωσκε γὰρ ὅτι θάψουσι τοῦτον ἄλλοι... καὶ οὐκ εικὸς τοῦτον ἀπολειφθῆναι τῶν ἀναγκαιοτέρων... οἶμαι δὲ ὅτι καὶ ἄπιστος ἦν ὁ τελευτήσας."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "To be dead to the world; to be dead to the law... means that the world, law, and sin have no influence or control over us." 
2. "Let people, says he, who are uninterested in my work, and who are 'dead in sin,' take care of the dead. Your duty is now to follow me."
3. "A regard to friends, and ease, and comfort, should be 'subordinate to the gospel;' and we should always be ready to sacrifice these when duty to God requires it."

### John Calvin:

2. "Those only live, he tells us, who devote all their thoughts, and every part of their life, to obedience to God."
3. "Those who do not rise above the world, — who devote themselves to pleasing men, and forget God, — are like dead men, who are idly and uselessly employed in taking care of the dead."
