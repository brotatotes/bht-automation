## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Apphia - the Latin, 'Appia'; either the wife or some close relative of Philemon. She and Archippus, if they had not belonged to his family, would not have been included with Philemon in the address of a letter on a domestic matter."
2. "Archippus - a minister of the Colossian Church."
3. "In the absence of a regular church building, the houses of particular saints were used for that purpose. Observe Paul‚Äôs tact in associating with Philemon those associated by kindred or Christian brotherhood with his house, and not going beyond it."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "And to our beloved Apphia - This was a female (Greek Œ±ÃìŒ≥Œ±œÄŒ∑œÑŒ∑ÕÇÕÖ agapeÃÑteÃÑ), and was probably the wife of Philemon."
2. "And Archippus our fellow-soldier - See the notes at Colossians 4:17. It has been supposed that he was a son of Philemon, and this would appear not to be improbable, as he was one of his family."
3. "And to the church in thy house - Either the church that commonly met in his house, or more probably that was composed of his own family; compare the notes at Romans 16:5."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Our beloved Apphia [Œ±œÄœÜŒπŒ± œÑŒ∑ Œ±Œ≥Œ±œÄŒ∑œÑŒ∑]. The word is not the common Roman name Appia, but is a Phrygian name, occurring frequently in Phrygian inscriptions. It is also written Aphphia, and sometimes Aphia."
2. "Archippus. Possibly the son of Philemon and Apphia. From Colossians 4:17, he would appear to have held some important office in the church, either at Colossae or at Laodicaea."
3. "Fellow-soldier. In Christian warfare. Perhaps at Ephesus. Applied also to Epaphroditus, Philippians 2:25."

### John Calvin:
1. "The designation ‚Äî 'fellow-soldier' ‚Äî which he bestows on this latter individual, belongs peculiarly to ministers."
2. "Although the condition of a soldier belongs to all Christians universally, yet because teachers may be regarded as standardbearers in the warfare, they ought to be ready more than all others to fight."
3. "By employing these terms, he bestows the highest praise on the family of Philemon...that he regulates his family in such a manner as to be an image of the Church, and to discharge also the duty of a pastor within the walls of his dwelling."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The word used there to describe his duty is the same that is employed concerning Timothy (2 Timothy 4:5)."
2. "Though he only employs this word once again, St. Paul is extremely fond of the figure of a battle in describing the labours of himself and his fellow-preachers of the Gospel (2 Corinthians 10:4; 1 Timothy 1:18)."
3. "As this duty was discharged towards the church at Coloss√¶ by Philemon, we may conclude that he was a person of some wealth."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Sister" is in the Christian sense.
2. Fellow-soldier (œÉœÖŒΩœÉœÑœÅŒ±œÑŒπœâœÑŒ∑). Old word, only here and Philippians 2:25 in N.T. In metaphorical sense.
3. Before the third century there is no certain evidence of special church buildings for worship.

### John Gill:
1. "and very prudently is she wrote to, and justly commended, in order to engage her to use her interest with her husband to receive his servant again, who otherwise might have stood against it, and been a very great hinderance to a reconciliation."
2. "though this character belongs to private Christians, who are enlisted as volunteers under Christ, the Captain of salvation, and fight under his banners, against sin, Satan, and the world, being accoutred with the whole armour of God, and are more than conquerors through Christ that has loved them; yet it very eminently belongs to the ministers of the Gospel..."
3. "he wisely inscribes his epistle to him, that he might make use of the interest he had in Philemon, and his wife, to bring this matter to bear, the apostle writes about."

### John Wesley:
1. To Apphia ‚Äî His wife, to whom also the business in part belonged.
And the church in thy house ‚Äî The Christians who meet there.
