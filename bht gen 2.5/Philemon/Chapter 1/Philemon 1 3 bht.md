## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Albert Barnes:
1. Grace to you, and peace ... - See if the notes at Romans 1:7.


### Philip Schaff:
1. "Grace to you. The gift of grace is sometimes represented as of Christâ€™s bestowing â€˜the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ;â€™ and at other times, as here, the gift of the Father and the Son. But the same is meant in both phrases."
2. "Peace, an especially fitting blessing to be invoked upon a congregation, for among them spiritual unity was to be preserved, and of this the apostle elsewhere declares that peace is the bond whereby it may be kept."
3. "To those who felt the force of Christâ€™s words, â€˜That they may be one, even as we are one,â€™ there could be no thought of a double source of blessing. Not only in the material creation, but also in the redemption and restoration of all things, does the Son co-operate with the Father."

### John Gill:
1. "Grace to you and peace, from God...."
2. "Which is the same form of salutation used in the other epistles..."
3. "For though this epistle is but a very small one, yet it is introduced in the same form as the larger epistles are..."
