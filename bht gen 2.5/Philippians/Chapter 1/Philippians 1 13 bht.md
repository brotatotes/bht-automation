# Philippians 1:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Paul's imprisonment in Rome became widely known and furthered the cause of Christ. He was under strict custody in the Prætorium, chained to a soldier from the praetorian guard. This contact allowed Paul to have access to the soldiers and officials, spreading the fame of his bonds throughout the palace and all of Rome. The fact that Paul's imprisonment was for his faith in Christ, rather than for any crime, made a favorable impression on people and introduced Christianity to the very palace of the emperor.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:

3. "To Paul, in his bonds, it must have been a subject of great rejoicing, that the government became thus apprised of the true character of the opposition which had been excited against him; and it must have done much to reconcile him to the sorrows and privations of imprisonment, that he was thus the means of introducing religion to the very palace of the emperor."

2. "The apostle was under the charge of these troops, the soldiers relieving each other in mounting guard over the prisoner, who was attached to his guard's hand by a chain."

1. "These his bonds for the sake of Christ, he says, are manifest in all the palace, and in all other [places], or 'my bonds are manifest in Christ', as the words may be read; that is, by the means of Christ, he causing them to be taken notice of by men, and some of the first rank."
2. "By his bonds being manifest may be meant he himself who was bound; who by his bonds became known to persons, to whom in all probability he would otherwise have remained unknown."
3. "The Gospel for the sake of which he was bound; this was made manifest and became known, not barely notionally, but savingly and experimentally; and even Christ himself the substance of it, for whom he was laid in bonds, by this means came to be known, 'in all the palace'."
