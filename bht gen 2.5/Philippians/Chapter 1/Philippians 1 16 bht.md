# Philippians 1:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
These individuals preached out of love for Paul and Christ, but their motives were not pure. They sought to create difficulty and stir up strife rather than sincerely preach the Gospel. Their ambition and lack of regard for the welfare of the church and honor of religion were evident. Despite their impure intentions, they recognized Paul's mission and the work of God through his bondage. While some conjecture about how they made Paul's trial greater, it is ultimately useless.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Not 'purely' - Î±Ì”Î³Î½Ï‰Í‚Ï‚ hagnoÌ„s - not with pure motives or intentions. Their real aim is not to preach Christ, but to produce difficulty, and to stir up strife."
2. "They are ambitious people, and they have no real regard for the welfare of the church and the honor of religion."
3. "To make my trial the greater. How they did this is unknown... conjecture is altogether useless."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Sincerely [Î±Î³Î½Ï‰Ï‚]. Purely, with unmixed motives."
2. "The phrase is striking in the light of the original meaning of qliyiv, namely, pressure. They would make his bonds press more heavily and gall him."
3. "They would make his bonds press more heavily and gall him."

### John Calvin:

3. "If, however, there were envious persons, we ought to acknowledge the wonderful goodness of God, who, notwithstanding, gave such a prosperous issue to their depraved affections."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The one refers to those last mentioned, who were truly stirred by the Christian grace of love, and preached from that cause only."
2. "And while their love was exhibited towards those who heard them, it was also shown towards St. Paul."
3. "These men recognised the apostleâ€™s mission, that he was the appointed champion of the faith of Christ, and that God was working through his bondage for the wider publication of the glad tidings of the Gospel."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1.  Of love (ÎµÎ¾ Î±Î³Î±Ï€Î·Ï‚). Out of love to Paul as well as to Christ. Put Philippians 1:1 here as a flash-light. 


### John Gill:
1. "They did not preach Christ from a principle of love to his person, and from an inward experience of the power of his Gospel, and a zealous affection for it, and firm attachment to it, and with a view to the glory of God, the honour of Christ, and the good of immortal souls; but were influenced by avarice, ambition, and envy."
2. "They had very evil designs upon the apostle, supposing to add affliction to my bonds; imagining that by their free and bold way of preaching Christ openly in the city without control, and with impunity, it might be thought that the apostle did not lie in bonds for preaching Christ, but for some other crime."
3. "He was so far from being made uneasy hereby, that he rejoiced at the preaching of Christ, let their intentions be what they would."
