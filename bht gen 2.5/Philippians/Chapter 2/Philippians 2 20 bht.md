# Philippians 2:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Timothy is the only one who truly cares for the affairs of the Philippians, with no secondary regards for himself. He is like-minded with Paul, sharing the same deep interest and affection for the Philippians. Paul regards Timothy as a son and trusts him to handle important matters. Timothy's soul is equally filled with affection and interest for the Philippians, and he has a genuine and intense anxiety for their well-being. There is no one else with Paul who is equally well-affected and likeminded as Timothy.
