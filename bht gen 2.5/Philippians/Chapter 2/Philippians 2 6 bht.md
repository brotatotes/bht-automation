## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The divine nature had infinite BEAUTY in itself, even without any creature contemplating that beauty: that beauty was 'the form of God';"
2. "The antithesis is not between His being on an equality with God, and His emptying Himself; but between His being 'in the FORM (that is, the outward glorious self-manifestation) of God,' and His 'taking on Him the form of a servant,' whereby He in a great measure emptied Himself of His precedent 'form,' or outward self-manifesting glory as God."
3. "Being on an equality with God is not identical with subsisting in the form of God; the latter expresses the external characteristics, majesty, and beauty of the Deity, which 'He emptied Himself of,' to assume 'the form of a servant'; the former, 'HIS BEING,' or NATURE, His already existing STATE OF EQUALITY with God, both the Father and the Son having the same ESSENCE."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "In Philippians 2:7, it is applied to the appearance of a servant - and took upon him the form of a servant; that is, he was in the condition of a servant - or of the lowest condition."
2. "The phrase 'form of God' is one that naturally conveys the idea that he was God."
3. "The natural and obvious meaning of the language is, that there was an equality of nature and of rank with God, from which he humbled himself when he became a man."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "As applied here to God, the word is intended to describe that mode in which the essential being of God expresses itself. We have no word which can convey this meaning, nor is it possible for us to formulate the reality."
2. "To say, then, that Christ was in the form of God, is to say that He existed as essentially one with God."
3. "Christ held fast His assertion of divine dignity, but relinquished it. The antithesis is thus entirely destroyed. Taking the word aJrpagmon (A. V., robbery) to mean a highly prized possession, we understand Paul to say that Christ, being, before His incarnation, in the form of God, did not regard His divine equality as a prize which was to be grasped at and retained at all hazards, but, on the contrary, laid aside the form of God, and took upon Himself the nature of man."

### John Calvin:
1. "Christâ€™s humility consisted in his abasing himself from the highest pinnacle of glory to the lowest ignominy: our humility consists in refraining from exalting ourselves by a false estimation."
2. "If the Son of God descended from so great a height, how unreasonable that we, who are nothing, should be lifted up with pride!"
3. "Christ, then, before the creation of the world, was in the form of God, because from the beginning he had his glory with the Father."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Christ being in the form of God...relates to the existence of Christ before His manifestation in the flesh, and its fuller force is fairly represented by the addition of the word 'originally'." 
2. "He did not count His equality with God as a prize to be held fast...He possessed this equality, but consented to forego it for a time, that He might work out the salvation of men." 
3. "The words have been taken by some in the sense that Christ did not think of His equality with God as something which He, having seized, must carefully guard, and so could not venture on laying it down at all."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Here is a clear statement by Paul of the deity of Christ."
2. "That is to say Paul means a prize to be held on to rather than something to be won ('robbery')."
3. "Undoubtedly Christ gave up his environment of glory. He took upon himself limitations of place (space) and of knowledge and of power, though still on earth retaining more of these than any mere man."

### John Gill:
1. "This phrase, 'the form of God', is to be understood of the nature and essence of God, and describes Christ as he was from all eternity...he was in being before his incarnation."
2. "Christ being in this glorious form, or having the same divine nature with the Father, with all the infinite and unspeakable glories of it..."
3. "He thought, he accounted, he knew he had it this way; and he held it hereby, and of right, and not by any unlawful means..."

### John Wesley:
1. "Who being in the essential form â€” The incommunicable nature."
2. "Counted it no act of robbery â€” That is the precise meaning of the words,-no invasion of another's prerogative, but his own strict and unquestionable right."
3. "To be equal with God â€” the word here translated equal, occurs in the adjective form five or six times in the New Testament... It here implies both the fulness and the supreme height of the Godhead; to which are opposed, he emptied and he humbled himself."
