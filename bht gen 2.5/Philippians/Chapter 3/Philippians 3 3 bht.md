# Philippians 3:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
True worship is not about external acts or relying on the flesh, but about serving by the Spirit of God. It is a spiritual worship that encompasses the whole life, not just certain rituals. The emphasis is on the renunciation of the flesh and the trust in the Spirit in our union with Christ. Salvation does not depend on external rites or privileges, but on faith in Christ. True circumcision is of the heart, not the flesh, and those who worship in the Spirit and boast in Christ Jesus have no confidence in the flesh.
