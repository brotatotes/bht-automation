## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Six is the number of the world given over to judgment. It is half of twelve, the Church's number, as three and a half is half of seven, the divine number for completeness."
2. "The seventh trumpet, like the seventh seal and seventh vial, being the consummation, is accompanied differently from the preceding six: not the consequences which follow on earth, but those IN HEAVEN, are set before us."
3. "The earth-kingdoms are many: His shall be one. The appellation 'Christ,' the Anointed, is here, where His kingdom is mentioned appropriately for the first time used in Revelation. For it is equivalent to KING."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The sense is not materially different whichever reading is adopted; though the authority is in favor of the latter (Wetstein). According to the common reading, the sense is, that all the kingdoms of the earth, being many in themselves, had been now brought under the one scepter of Christ."
2. "The word 'Lord' here evidently has reference to God as such - represented as the original source of authority, and as giving the kingdom to his Son."
3. "A kingdom is commenced which shall never terminate. It is not said that this would be on the earth; but the essential idea is, that the scepter of the world had now, after so long a time, come into his hands never more to pass away."

### Marvin Vincent:

3. "This dominion is celebrated as given to the Father in the Son and to the Son in the Father; and it shall be theirs for ever and ever, all its enemies being completely overthrown."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Now the climax has come with Christ as Conqueror of the kingdom of this world for his Father. This is the crowning lesson of the Apocalypse."
2. "But Jesus scorned partnership with Satan in the rule of the world, and chose war, war up to the hilt and to the end."
3. "God shall reign, but the rule of God and of Christ is one as the kingdom is one."

### John Gill:
1. "The kingdoms of this world are become the kingdoms of our Lord, and of his Christ."
2. "These kingdoms will become his, not merely by right, for so they are his already, by right of nature, and creation, and preservation; but these have shaken off his government, and have refused to have him to reign over them, and have fallen into the hands of usurpers."
3. "Christ will reign in this spiritual way, more or less, until he comes personally, and then he will reign with his people on earth a thousand years; and when they are ended, he will reign with them in heaven to all eternity."

### John Wesley:
