## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The beast that ascended out of the bottomless pit‚ÄîGreek, 'the wild beast . . . the abyss.' This beast was not mentioned before, yet he is introduced as 'the beast,' because he had already been described by Daniel (Daniel 7:3; Daniel 7:11), and he is fully so in the subsequent part of the Apocalypse."
2. "Thus, John at once appropriates the Old Testament prophecies; and also, viewing his whole subject at a glance, mentions as familiar things (though not yet so to the reader) objects to be described hereafter by himself."
3. "It is a proof of the unity that pervades all Scripture."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The word, then, may here refer not to 'time,' meaning that, these events would occur at the end of the 'thousand two hundred and threescore days,' but to the fact that what is here stated would occur when they had completed their testimony in the sense of having testified all that they were 'appointed' to testify."
2. "The word used here - Œ∏Œ∑œÅŒπÃÅŒøŒΩ theÃÑrion - means properly 'a beast, a wild beast.'...As employed in the Book of Revelation, the characteristics of the 'beast' are strongly marked."
3. "This would properly mean that its origin is the nether world; or that it will have characteristics which will show that it was from beneath. The meaning clearly is, that what was symbolized by the beast would have such characteristics as to show that it was not of divine origin, but had its source in the world of darkness, sin, and death."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. The beast [Œ∏Œ∑œÅŒπŒøŒΩ] . Wild beast See on ch. Revelation 4:6. A different word from that wrongly translated beast, ch. Revelation 4:6, Revelation 4:7; Revelation 5:6, etc. Compare ch. 13 1; Revelation 17:8, and see Daniel 7:0. 
Bottomless pit [Œ±Œ≤œÖœÉœÉŒøœÖ] . See on ch. Revelation 9:1.


### Philip Schaff:
1. "This work they shall accomplish: this witness they shall ‚Äòfinish‚Äô in the spirit of Him who cried upon the cross, ‚ÄòIt is finished:‚Äô"
2. "Their opponents shall seem to have the victory."
3. "This ‚Äòbeast‚Äô is without doubt that of Revelation 13:1 and Revelation 17:8, here mentioned by anticipation; and he shall act as the beast in Daniel 7:21."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Whenever they finish."
2. "Nothing less than antichrist will satisfy the picture here."
3. "His words cover in effect all the martyrdoms and massacres of history in which brute force has seemed to triumph over truth and righteousness."

### John Gill:
1. "their very death will be a prophesying or foretelling that the ruin of antichrist is at hand"
2. "and though it will be attended with the conquest and slaughter of the witnesses, yet it will lead on to, and issue in his own ruin"
3. "they will not be suffered to bear an open testimony any longer; they will be silenced; they will be banished, or removed into corners; and they will not only be under the censures, excommunications, and anathemas of the Romish antichrist, but they will lose all credit and esteem among those, who once pretended to be their friends"

### John Wesley:
1. "Till then they are invincible."
2. "It is at his last ascent, not out of the sea, but the bottomless pit, that the beast makes war upon the two witnesses."
3. "These will be among the last martyrs, though not the last of all."
