## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "His dragging down the stars with his tail implies his persuading to apostatize, like himself, and to become earthy, those angels and also once eminent human teachers who had formerly been heavenly."
2. "The dragon, represented by his agent Pharaoh, was ready to devour Israel's males at the birth of the nation."
3. "Antitypically the true Israel, Jesus, when born, was sought for destruction by Herod, who slew all the males in and around Bethlehem."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "A power that would sweep them all away would be universal; a power that would sweep away one-third only would represent a dominion of that extent only." 
2. "There were times under the emperors when, in a considerable part of the empire, after the establishment of Christianity, the church enjoyed protection, and the Christian religion was tolerated, while in other parts paganism still prevailed, and waged a bitter warfare with the church."
3. "A sufficient fulfillment is found if there was a period when the church, bright, glorious, and prosperous, was apparently about to become greatly enlarged, but when the monstrous pagan power still held its sway over a considerable part of the world, exposing the church to persecution."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "In these words we have the dragon doing what Pharaoh did to Israel (Exodus 1:15-22), and again and again, in the Psalms and the Prophets, Pharaoh is spoken of as the dragon (Psalms 74:13; Isaiah 27:1; Isaiah 51:9; Ezekiel 29:3)." 
2. "Nor is it without interest to remember that Pharaoh's crown was wreathed with a dragon (the asp or serpent of Egypt), and that just as the eagle was the ensign of Rome, so the dragon was that of Egypt."
3. "Hence the significance of Moses' rod being turned into a serpent."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The woman was pregnant with life, the dragon can do nothing but destroy."
2. "Against men who are made to shine as stars in the heavenly firmament the dragon can do nothing. They have rather trampled him beneath their feet and gained over him an everlasting victory."
3. "The dragon is in direct contrast with the woman. She is to bear a living child: he would destroy it as soon as it was born."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Like a great comet is this monster."
2. "Perhaps only the third is meant to soften the picture."
3. "This is what Pharaoh did to Israel...Precisely so the devil tried to destroy the child Jesus on his birth."

### John Gill:
1. "So Solinus speaks of dragons that have power not only in their teeth, but in their tails, and do more hurt by striking than by biting."
2. "This is said in allusion to Antiochus Epiphanes, in Daniel 8:10; and designs either the subduing of the third part of the principalities, states, and kingdoms of the known world, to the Roman empire, through its great power and strength."
3. "The instances Brightman produces are appropriate, and to the purpose; as of Maximinus destroying Alexander the son of Mammea, who he saw was inclined to the Christians; and of Decius taking off the two Philips, father and son, who were favourable to their cause; but especially the watchfulness of the dragon to destroy the man child was very manifest in the Roman emperors towards Constantine."

### John Wesley:
1. "His tail â€” His falsehood and subtilty."
2. "Of the stars of heaven â€” The Christians and their teachers, who before sat in heavenly places with Christ Jesus."
3. "And the dragon stood before the woman, that when she had brought forth, he might devour the child â€” That he might hinder the kingdom of Christ from spreading abroad, as it does under this trumpet."
