2. "That is, the 'mark' referred to was either the name of the beast, or the number of his name. The meaning is, that he had something branded on him that showed that he belonged to the beast - as a slave had the name of his master; in other words, there was something that certainly showed that he was subject to its authority."
3. "The manifest aim of the papacy, in all its history, has been to control the world, and to get dominion over its wealth, in order that it might accomplish its own purposes."

2. "The name and the number are one and the same."
3. "They could write the name in numerals, for numbers were given by letters."

### John Gill:
1. "And that no man might buy or sell... or in a civil sense, as to trade, and exercise merchandise..."
2. "Save he that had the mark... made a public profession of the Popish religion..."
