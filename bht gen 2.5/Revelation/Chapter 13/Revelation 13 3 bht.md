# Revelation 13:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The beast in question is wounded but remains, symbolizing its ability to rise again in a different form. This new form is described as a more devilish heathenism that culminates in the Antichrist. The phrase wounded to death means that the beast received a mortal wound that would have been fatal if it had not been healed. This healing refers to the revival and expansion of Rome's power through the papacy. The death-stroke inflicted on the beast represents the work of Christ, which ideally and really overcame the world.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Though seemingly slain (Greek for 'wounded'), it remains the beast still, to rise again in another form."
2. "A new and worse heathenism breaks in upon the Christianized world, more devilish than the old one of the first heads of the beast."
3. "It culminates in Antichrist, the man of sin, the son of perdition, the very characteristics of old heathenism."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The phrase 'wounded to death' means properly that it received a mortal wound, that is, the wound would have been mortal if it had not been healed."
2. "The reference in this place is, therefore, to Rome considered as a civil or secular power, yet Rome regarded as giving support to the second beast - the papal power."
3. "Every wound that was inflicted on that power by the incursion of barbarians, and by the dividing off of parts of the empire, was healed by the papacy, and under this form its dominion became as wide and as formidable as under its ancient mode of administration."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The word occurs eight times in Revelation, and in seven of these it must be rendered slain or slaughtered."
2. "In both cases there had been actual death, and in both revival. The one is a mocking counterpart of the other."
3. "A pregnant construction for wondered at and followed after."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "In both cases there had been actual death, although in both there had also been a revival, a resurrection, to life." 
2. "The head of the beast spoken of had not simply disappeared from view: it had been actually slain. A death-stroke had been inflicted. It had died as really as the Lamb of God had died on Calvary, and the Seer saw that it had done so." 
3. "That power received a mortal stroke by the work of Christ. The world was then ideally and really overcome. It revived, and resumed its working."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "As though it had been smitten...as though slain."
2. "His death-stroke was healed...pretenders arose claiming to be Nero redivivus."
3. "All the earth wondered at and followed after the beast."

### John Gill:
1. "this is to be understood of the sixth head, or form of government, which obtained in the empire; namely, that of emperors, and of the destruction of Rome itself, the head of the empire"
2. "this seemed to be a deadly wound to Rome, to the empire and emperors."
3. "which expresses the large extent of antichrist's dominion, which reached to all the Roman empire...so that the universality the Papists boast of, as a note of the true church, is manifestly a mark of the beast, or of antichrist."
