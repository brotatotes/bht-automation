## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "who have": not that they had them yet (compare Revelation 15:7), but they are by anticipation described according to their office.
2. "a stone pure ('and' is omitted in A, B, C, and ANDREAS), brilliant" (so the Greek): probably the diamond. With English Version, compare Acts 1:10; Acts 10:30.
3. golden girdles—resembling the Lord in this respect (Revelation 1:13).

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Having the seven plagues - See the notes on Revelation 15:1. Each one entrusted with a single 'plague' to be executed upon the earth."
2. "Clothed in pure and white linen - The emblem of holiness - the common representation in regard to the heavenly inhabitants."
3. "And having their breasts girded with golden girdles - See the notes on Revelation 1:13. The meaning is, that they were attired in a manner befitting their rank and condition."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The idea is that of raiment studded with precious stones."
2. "White. Mostly applied in the New Testament to clothing."
3. "Girt round their breasts."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The seven angels that have the seven plagues now issue from the temple, that is, from the innermost shrine of the heavenly sanctuary."
2. "Their clothing, according to the later and more correct reading of the Greek, has seemed to many to be absurd: they are clothed with a stone pure and lustrous."
3. "The seven angels thus issue from the temple to be priests of destruction instead of salvation."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "There came out (εξηλθαν). Second aorist active indicative of εξερχομα with -αν rather than -ον. Proleptic and prophetic aorist."
2. "With precious stone pure and bright (λιθον καθαρον λαμπρον). Accusative case retained with verb of clothing as so often, literally 'with a stone pure bright.'"
3. "With golden girdles (ζωνας χρυσας). Accusative case after the perfect passive participle περιεζωσμενο as in Revelation 1:13."

### John Gill:
1. "rather saints are meant, who appear in the habit of priests, being all made kings and priests; and denotes their being clothed with the pure and spotless robe of Christ's righteousness"
2. "clothed with a stone, pure and white"; as if they were arrayed in garments of stone, which is not likely; unless reference is had to the stone asbestos"
3. "this is to be understood either of the grace of faith, which is much more precious than of gold that perisheth, which receives the righteousness of Christ, puts it on, and girds it about the believer"

### John Wesley:
1. "They appeared in habits like those the high priest wore when he went into the most holy place to consult the oracle. In this was the visible testimony of God's presence."
2. "Linen is the habit of service and attendance. Pure — unspotted, unsullied. White — Or bright and shining, which implies much more than bare innocence."
3. "Having their breasts girt with golden girdles — In token of their high dignity and glorious rest."
