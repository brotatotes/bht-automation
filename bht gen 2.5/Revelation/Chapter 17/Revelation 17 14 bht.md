## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "These shall . . . war with the Lambâ€”in league with the beast. This is a summary anticipation of Revelation 19:19." 
2. "Lord of lords, &amp;c.â€”anticipating Revelation 19:16."
3. "And they that are with Him, called chosen, and faithful (shall overcome them, namely, the beast and his allied kings)."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It is unnecessary to show how true this has been in history; how entirely they sustained the papacy in all its measures of persecution."
2. "The meaning is, that they would not be able to extinguish the true religion. In spite of all opposition and persecution, that would still live in the world, until it would be said that a complete triumph was gained."
3. "In their steadfast adherence to the truth, they had shown that they were truly chosen by the Saviour, and could be relied on in the warfare against the powers of evil."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The statement of the last half of the verse is not that of the Authorised Version, that the Lamb shall overcome because they that are with Him are called and chosen and faithful, but that they that are with him, called, and chosen, and faithful, shall be partakers of the victory."
2. "The Seer now returns to the woman who sat upon the beast."
3. "It may be noticed that the statement of the last half of the verse is not that of the Authorised Version."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "And the Lamb shall overcome them. This is the glorious outcome, victory by the Lamb over the coalition of kings."
2. "For he is Lord of lords and King of kings. Crowned heads are Christ's subjects."
3. "And those with him shall also overcome. They will share in the triumph of the Lamb, as they shared in the conflict."

### John Gill:
1. "And this war is not to be understood of a war with him personally, or of that last and decisive, battle at Armageddon... but of a war with his members, of their persecuting of the saints, and faithful witnesses of Christ in all ages..."
2. "He [Jesus] is so by nature, as God and Creator, to whom the kingdom of nature and providence belongs; and by office, as Mediator... this is a reason why he overcomes them, and it cannot be thought it should be otherwise."
3. "And they that are with him... are called, and chosen, and faithful... the meaning is, either that they have faith, or are believers in Christ... or else, that they are persons of integrity and uprightness, that are on the side of Christ..."
