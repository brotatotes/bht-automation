## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "That the world should be beastly is natural, but that the faithful bride should become the whore is monstrous, and excites the same amazement in him as the same awful change in Israel excited in Isaiah and Jeremiah."
2. "Horrible thing" in them answers to "abominations" here. "Corruptio optimi pessima"; when the Church falls, she sinks lower than the godless world, in proportion as her right place is higher than the world.
3. The elect are never perverted into apostates, and still remain as the true woman invisibly contained in the harlot; yet Christendom regarded as the woman has apostatized from its first faith.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The meaning here is, that the persecuting power referred to had shed the blood of the saints; and that, in its fury, it had, as it were, drunk the blood of the slain, and had become, by drinking that blood, intoxicated and infuriated."
2. "Especially with their blood. The meaning is, that the warfare, in which so much blood was shed, was directed against the saints as such, and that, in fact, it terminated particularly on those who, amidst cruel sufferings, were faithful witnesses for the Lord Jesus, and deserved to be called, by way of eminence, 'martyrs.'"
3. "I was astonished at her appearance, at her apparel, and at the things which were so significantly symbolized by her."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Saints - martyrs. The saints include the martyrs or witnesses, but the latter word emphasizes the testimony of the saints which has been the cause of their death. For martyr; see on 1 Peter 5:1.


### Philip Schaff:
1. "The description of the ungovernable fierceness of the womanâ€™s spirit is continued. She drinks, and makes herself drunk with the blood of the saints and of the martyrs of Jesus."
2. "Having finished his description the Seer adds, And when I saw her I wondered with a great wonder. He is overwhelmed with astonishment at the spectacle, yet not so much probably at the royal magnificence of the woman, as that, being a woman, she should exhibit such tokens of a cruel and bloodthirsty spirit, denying the nature that properly belonged to her."
3. "At this point it might have been well to inquire into the meaning of â€˜Babylonâ€™ in these verses, but so much has still to be said of that city that it seems better to delay the inquiry until we have finished the exposition of the whole passage."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Drunken with the blood of the saints."
2. "Of the martyrs of Jesus."
3. "Drunk with blood."

### John Gill:
1. "To see a woman drunk is a shameful sight; but to see one drunk, not with wine, but with blood, is monstrous, cruel, and shocking."
2. "The woman being drunk with their blood, denotes the blood thirstiness of the church of Rome, her greedy and insatiable desire after the blood of the saints, and her delight in it."
3. "He wondered at her drunkenness with the blood of the saints; at her inhumanity and cruelty, being as savage as the beast she rode on."

### John Wesley:
1. "So that Rome may well be called, 'The slaughter-house of the martyrs.'"
2. "She hath shed much Christian blood in every age; but at length she is even drunk with it."
3. "I wondered exceedingly â€” At her cruelty and the patience of God."
