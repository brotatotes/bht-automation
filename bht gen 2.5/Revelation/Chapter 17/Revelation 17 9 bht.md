## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

2. "Especially such as are prominent hindrances to the cause of God."
3. "The woman sitting on the seven hills implies the Old and New Testament Church conforming to, and resting on, the world power, that is, on all the seven world kingdoms."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Here is what requires wisdom to interpret it; or, here is a case in which the mind that shows itself able to explain it will evince true sagacity."
2. "It is undoubtedly implied that the symbol might be understood... but it was a matter which could not be determined by ordinary minds, or without an earnest application of the understanding."
3. "The city represented as a woman, in accordance with a common usage in the Scriptures."

### Marvin Vincent:

2. "The reason, regarded as the faculty of perceiving divine things: of recognizing goodness and hating evil."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Here is the intelligence which has wisdom."
2. "Rome was known as the city on seven hills."
3. "In Revelation 13:1 it is the beast that has the seven heads, while here the woman riding the beast has seven heads, a slight change in the symbolism."

### John Gill:
1. "This refers either to what goes before, concerning the beast, his various states, rise, and ruin, and his admirers; or to what follows after, concerning the meaning of his heads and horns, or to both; and the sense is, that notwithstanding the interpretation of these things by the angel, yet it requires a large share of wisdom to understand them."
2. "As the woman is a city, Revelation 17:18 these seven mountains, on which she sits, must be so many mountains on which the city is built; and what city can this be but Rome, which is so famous for being built on seven hills?"
3. "Now there was no imperial city, so built in his time, but Rome: for though Constantinople is built on seven hills, yet this was not in being in John's time, but was built by Constantine many years after, in imitation of Rome; and though the situation is much altered now, being in Campus Martius, it being greatly reduced, and in a less compass, yet this hinders not but that it is the same city here designed."

### John Wesley:
1. Here is the mind that hath wisdom â€” Only those who are wise will understand this. The seven heads are seven hills.
