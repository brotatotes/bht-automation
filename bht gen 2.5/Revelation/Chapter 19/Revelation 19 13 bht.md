## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The blood on His 'vesture,' reminding us of His own blood shed for even the ungodly who trample on it, is a premonition of the shedding of their blood in righteous retribution." 
2. "The Word of God—who made the world, is He also who under the same character and attributes shall make it anew."
3. "The Lamb is the symbol of Christ in His gentleness. Who would be afraid of a lamb? Even a little child, instead of being scared, desires to caress it."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "And he was clothed with a vesture dipped in blood - Red, as if dipped in blood - emblem of slaughter."
2. "This name is Ὁ λόγος τοῦ Θεοῦ Ho logos tou Theou, or 'the Logos of God.' That is, this is his unique name; a name which belongs only to him, and which distinguishes him from all other beings."
3. "No one but he can understand what is implied in it, regarded as the method in which God reveals himself to his creatures on earth."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Compare Isaiah 63:2, Isaiah 63:3."
2. "The Word of God [ο λογος του θεου] . This name for our Lord is found in the New Testament only in the writings of John."
3. "The idea of God which is represented here, underlies the absolute term the Word in John 1:1."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "And he is arrayed in a garment sprinkled with blood, and his name is called The Word of God." 
2. "The idea is taken from Isaiah 63:2-3, and is therefore that of a garment sprinkled not with the Warrior’s own blood, but with the blood of His enemies." 
3. "'Is called,' i.e is, and has been always, called. The resemblance to John 1:1 and 1 John 1:1 need not be enlarged on."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The use of βεβαμμενον (dipped) is a bolder figure and Charles considers it correct. In either case it is the blood of Christ's enemies with which his raiment [...] is sprinkled or dipped as the case may be, not his own blood on Calvary."
2. "The personal use of the Logos applied to Christ occurs only in the Johannine writings unless that is the idea in Hebrews 4:12. In John 1:1; John 1:14 it is merely ο Λογος (the Word), in 1 John 1:1 ο Λογος της ζωης (the Word of Life), while here it is ο Λογος του θεου (the Word of God), one of the strongest arguments for identity of authorship."
3. "Jesus is himself the final and perfect revelation of God to men (Hebrews 1:1)."

### John Gill:
1. "Either in his own, by which he became the Saviour of his church and people; or else in the blood of his saints, he now comes to avenge; or rather in the blood of his enemies, with which he appears as stained, before the battle is fought, the victory being sure, and their slaughter unavoidable."
2. "The metaphor is taken from persons treading in a winepress, whose garments are stained with blood of grapes."
3. "The reason why he is called by it here may be partly to express his greatness, glory, and majesty, this being a name which principally belongs to him, is a person, as the Creator of all things, and as previous to his incarnation; and partly because all the promises of God in his word, and which are all yea, and amen in Christ, will be now shortly fulfilled."

### John Wesley:
1. And he is clothed in a vesture dipped in blood — The blood of the enemies he hath already conquered. Isaiah 63:1, etc.
