## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Sicut Balac tenuit doctrinam pestiferam Balaam, sic apud te sunt aliqui tenentes doctrinam Nicolai erroneam." (Lyra)
2. "We may remark, 1) that it is most according to the sense of the passage to understand these sins in the case of the Nicolaitans, as in that of those whom Balaam tempted, literally, and not mystically."
3. "The mere existence of the etymological relation is extremely doubtful: and even granting it, to suppose the two identical, would be to destroy the historical illustration by which the present existing sect is described."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Literal eating of idol-meats and fornication in Pergamos were accompanied by spiritual idolatry and fornication."
2. "It is sin not to hate what God hates."
3. "The Ephesian Church had this point of superiority to Pergamos."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "There are those among you who hold those doctrines."
2. "The Nicolaitanes taught the same things which Balaam did - to wit, that they led the people into corrupt and licentious practices."
3. "As Balak retained a false prophet who misled the Hebrews, so thou retainest those who teach things like to those which Balaam taught."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. So. Even as Balak had Balaam for a false teacher, so hast thou the Nicolaitan teachers.

2. "The ancient church had its Balaamites, thou hast thy Nicolaitans."
