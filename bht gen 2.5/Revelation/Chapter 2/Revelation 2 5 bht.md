### Albert Barnes:

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Its candlestick has been for centuries removed out of his place; the squalid Mohammedan village which is nearest to its site does not count one Christian in its insignificant population; its temple is a mass of shapeless ruins; its harbor is a reedy pool; the bittern booms amid its pestilent and stagnant marshes; and malaria and oblivion reign supreme over the place where the wealth of ancient civilization gathered around the scenes of its grossest superstitions and its most degraded sins."
2. "The Nicolaitans taught that, in order to master sensuality, one must know the whole range of it by experience; and that he should therefore abandon himself without reserve to the lusts of the body, since they concerned only the body and did not touch the spirit."
3. "no sect bearing the one name or the other; but those who, in the new dispensation, repeated the sin of Balaam in the old, and sought to overcome or destroy the people of God by the same temptations whereby Balaam had sought to overcome them before."

3. "The removal of the churchâ€™s candlestick denotes removal from her high standing and privileges in the sanctuary of God."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Down in the valley, look up to the cliff where pure love is and whence thou hast fallen down."
2. "Urgent appeal for instant change of attitude and conduct before it is too late."
3. "The first love which has now grown cold."

### John Gill:
1. "Believers cannot totally and finally fall away from the grace which they have received; but they may fall into sin, and from a degree of grace, and the exercise of it..."
2. "Remember, mind, and observe from what degree of it they were fallen; in order to bring them under a conviction and acknowledgment of their evil, and a sense of their present state, and to quicken their desires after a restoration to their former one."
3. "Former good works are to be remembered and done, to show the truth of repentance for evil ones."

### John Wesley:
1. "Remember from whence thou art fallen â€” From what degree of faith, love, holiness, though perhaps insensibly."

3. "Do the first works â€” Outwardly and inwardly, or thou canst never regain the first love."
