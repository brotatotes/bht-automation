## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "What Sardis is to 'remember' is, not how joyfully she had received originally the Gospel message, but how the precious deposit was committed to her originally, so that she could not say, she had not 'received and heard' it." 
2. "'Keep' or observe the commandment which thou hast received and didst hear." 
3. "These special judgments being anticipatory earnests of that great last coming."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It is always well for Christians to call to remembrance the 'day of their espousals,' and their views and feelings when they gave their hearts to the Savior, and to compare those views with their present condition, especially if their conversion was marked by anything unusual."
2. "Repent in regard to all that in which you have departed from your views and feelings when you embraced the gospel."
3. "No one can flatter himself with any probable anticipation that he will have time to repent when God comes to take him away. Benevolence has done its appropriate work in warning him - how can the Great Judge of all be to blame, if he comes then, and suddenly cuts the sinner off?"

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Thou hast received the truth as a permanent deposit."
2. "Thief, as distinguished from a robber, a plunderer on a larger scale."
3. "The Greek proverb says that the feet of the avenging deities are shod with wool."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The exhortation to Sardis is to remember, not the simple fact that she had received, but how she had done so, after what manner thou hast received, the earnestness, the faithfulness, and the zeal which had marked the first stages of her spiritual life."
2. "There is always a reason, whether we can discover it or not, for such changes of tense."
3. "It is not the suddenness or unexpectedness of the hour only that is thought of under the image of a 'thief,' for that image has rather its expression in the last clause of the verse. It is the object with which the thief comes that is in view, to break up and to destroy."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Keep in mind," as in Revelation 2:5.
2. "Hold on to what thou hast."
3. "Turn at once."

### John Gill:
1. "Remember, therefore, how thou hast received and heard...." 
2. "and hold fast; the above doctrines..." 
3. "and thou shalt not know what hour I will come upon thee..."

### John Wesley:
1. "Remember how â€” Humbly, zealously, seriously. Thou didst receive the grace of God once, and hear - His word."
2. "And hold fast â€” The grace thou hast received."
3. "And repent â€” According to the word thou hast heard."
