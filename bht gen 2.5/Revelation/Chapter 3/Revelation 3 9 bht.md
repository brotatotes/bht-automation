# Revelation 3:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The promise to the church in Philadelphia is greater than that to Smyrna, as Christ will make those who were enemies of the church come and worship before their feet. This worship can be understood as either spiritual homage or respect shown to superiors. The truth taught here is that Jesus has the power to turn the hearts of enemies of the faith so that they will acknowledge and respect the church. This verse does not imply the conversion of the Jews, but rather the submission of the church's enemies and their acknowledgment of God's love for the church.

### Philip Schaff:

3. "What we read of is simply the bowing down of the Churchâ€™s enemies before her feet... At chap. Revelation 2:9 these enemies of the faith were only not to be feared: now they bow in submission before her whom they had persecuted."

1. "Which may be understood either of the Papists, the followers of the man of sin, whose coming was after the working of Satan, and whose doctrines are the doctrines of devils, many of whom will now be converted, and brought to the true church."
2. "The worship here spoken of is not either a religious or civil worship of the church, for the church is not the object of worship; only before whom, and at whose feet, this worship shall be given to God in the most humble and hearty manner."
3. "The sense is, that the convinced and converted Jews shall come to the church, and in the most lowly and contrite manner acknowledge their former blindness, furious zeal, and violent hatred of the Christians, and shall profess their faith in Christ; shall join themselves to the church, and partake of the ordinances of the Gospel with them; and shall worship God and Jesus Christ, their Lord and King, in their presence, and at their feet."

### John Wesley:
1. "Behold, I â€” who have all power; and they must then comply."
2. "I will make them come and bow down before thy feet â€” Pay thee the lowest homage."
3. "And know â€” At length, that all depends on my love, and that thou hast a place therein. O how often does the judgment of the people turn quite round, when the Lord looketh upon them!"
