## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "But (1) wonderful solemnity is given by dropping the particles, and taking up separately the human and divine nature of Christ, keeping ·ΩÅ œÖ·º±·Ω∏œÇ Œ±·ΩêœÑŒø·ø¶ as the great subject of both clauses, and thus making them, not contrasts to one another, but correlative parts of the same great whole." 
2. "And (2) the Apostle, dwelling here on patent facts, the announcements of prophecy, the history of the Lord‚Äôs Humanity, does not deal with the essential subsistent Godhead of Christ, but with that manifestation of it which the great fact of the Resurrection had made to men."
3. "The other interpretations certainly miss the mark, by overlooking the Œ∫Œ±œÑ·Ω∞ œÉŒ¨œÅŒ∫Œ± and Œ∫Œ±œÑ·Ω∞ œÄŒΩŒµ·ø¶ŒºŒ±, the two sides of the Person of Christ here intended to be brought out."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "He was not made, He was only 'declared [or proved] to BE the Son of God.'"
2. "By His birth in the flesh, that Sonship, which was essential and uncreated, merely effloresced into palpable manifestation."
3. "Declared to be the Son of God in possession of that 'power' which belonged to Him as the only-begotten of the Father, no longer shrouded as in the days of His flesh, but 'by His resurrection from the dead' gloriously displayed and henceforth to be for ever exerted in this nature of ours."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The act of raising him from the dead designated him, or constituted him the Son of God."
2. "The phrase 'Son of God' stands in contrast with the title 'Son of man,' and as the natural and obvious import of that is that he was a man, so the natural and obvious import of the title 'Son of God' is that he was divine; or that he sustained relations to God designated by the name Son of God, corresponding to the relations which he sustained to man designated by the name Son of Man."
3. "This expression implies simply that it was such as to make proper the appellation, the Son of God."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The idea is that of Christ's instatement or establishment in the rank and dignity of His divine sonship with a view to the conviction of men."
2. "He was declared or instated mightily; in a striking, triumphant manner, through His resurrection."
3. "The reference is not to the Holy Spirit, who is nowhere designated by this phrase, but to the spirit of Christ as the seat of the divine nature belonging to His person."

### John Calvin:
1. "Christ was declared the Son of God by openly exercising a real celestial power, that is, the power of the Spirit, when he rose from the dead; but that this power is comprehended when a conviction of it is imprinted on our hearts by the same Spirit."
2. "The Spirit, as far as it sanctifies, confirms and ratifies that evidence of its power which it once exhibited."
3. "He gained victory over death, not by aid sought from another, but by the celestial operation of his own Spirit."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The former seems to be the more natural sense, but the latter is usually accepted. In neither case is there any suggestion that Christ became the Son of God in consequence of the resurrection..."
2. "This should be connected with 'declared'; it thus sets forth the in-stating by the resurrection as an exhibition of the divine power."
3. "This is evidently in contrast with 'according to the flesh,' and must set forth that side of the person of Christ wherein He differs absolutely from those who are only human."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The Resurrection of Christ is the miracle of miracles. 'The resurrection only declared him to be what he truly was'." 
2. "According to the spirit of holiness... 'The œÄŒΩŒµœÖŒºŒ± Œ±Œ≥ŒπœâœÉœÖŒΩŒ∑œÇ, though not the Divine nature, is that in which the Divinity or Divine personality resided'."
3. "Jesus Christ our Lord... These words gather up the total personality of Jesus (his deity and his humanity)."

### John Gill:
1. "Not made as he is said to be before, when his incarnation is spoken of; nor did he begin to be the Son of God, when he was made of the seed of David, but he, the Son of God, who existed as such, from everlasting, was manifested in the flesh, or human nature."
2. "And this his divine sonship, and proper deity, are declared and made evident with, or 'by' his power; which has appeared in the creation of all things out of nothing; in upholding all things in their beings; in the government of the world, and works of Providence; in the miracles he wrought; in his performing the great work of redemption; in the success of his Gospel, to the conversion of sinners; and in the preservation of his churches and people."
3. "And this was done according to the Spirit of holiness; which may be understood of the Holy Spirit, the third person in the Trinity, who is holy in himself, and the author of holiness in the saints; and who is the declarer of Christ's sonship, partly by bearing a testimony to it in the word, and in the hearts of believers, and chiefly by being concerned in the resurrection of the body of Christ from the dead; or else by the Spirit of holiness may be meant the divine nature of Christ, which, as it is holy, so by it Christ offered himself to God, and by it was quickened, or made alive, when he had been put to death in the flesh; and which must be a clear and strong proof of his being truly the Son of God."

### John Wesley:
1. "But powerfully declared to be the Son of God, according to the Spirit of Holiness ‚Äî That is, according to his divine nature."
2. "By the resurrection from the dead ‚Äî For this is both the fountain and the object of our faith."
3. "The preaching of the apostles was the consequence of Christ's resurrection."
