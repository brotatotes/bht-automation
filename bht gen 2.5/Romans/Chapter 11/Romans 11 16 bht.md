2. "It may be truly said, I allow, that the Jews were naturally holy, for their adoption was hereditary; but I now speak of our first nature, according to which we are all, as we know, accursed in Adam. Therefore the dignity of an elect people, to speak correctly, is a supernatural privilege."

2. "Apparently the patriarchs are the first fruit."

### John Gill:
1. "if the firstfruit be holy, the lump is also holy, and if the root be holy, so are the branches."
2. "these were but few in number, as the 'firstfruit' is but small in comparison of 'the lump', and mean, abject, and despicable, as the 'root' under, and in a dry ground is; but yet were pledges and presages of a larger number of souls among that people, to be converted in the latter day."
