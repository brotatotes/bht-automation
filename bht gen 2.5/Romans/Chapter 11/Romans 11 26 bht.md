## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "And thus (when this condition shall have been fulfilled) all Israel shall be saved (Israel as a nation, see above: not individuals, nor is there the slightest ground for the notion of the ·ºÄœÄŒøŒ∫Œ±œÑŒ¨œÉœÑŒ±œÉŒπœÇ)."
2. "Œ∫Œ±Œ∏·ΩºœÇ Œ≥Œ≠Œ≥œÅ.] This quotation appears to have for its object to shew that the Redeemer was to come for the behoof of God‚Äôs own chosen people."
3. "For ·ºêŒ∫ Œ£ŒπœéŒΩ, the LXX have ·ºïŒΩŒµŒ∫ŒµŒΩ Œ£ŒπœéŒΩ (◊ú÷∞◊¶÷¥◊ô÷º◊ï÷π◊ü), the E. V. ‚Äòto Zion.‚Äô The Apostle frequently varies from the LXX, and a sufficient reason can generally be assigned for the variation: here, though this reason is not apparent, we cannot doubt that such existed, for the LXX would surely have suited his purpose even better than ·ºêŒ∫, had there been no objection to it."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "To understand this great statement, as some still do,
	merely of such a gradual inbringing of individual Jews, that
	there shall at length remain none in unbelief, is to do manifest
	violence both to it and to the whole context." 
2. "the apostle, having drawn his illustrations of man's
	sinfulness chiefly from Psalms 14:1-7;
	Isaiah 59:1-21, now seems to
	combine the language of the same two places regarding Israel's
	salvation from it [BENGEL]."
3. "the turn which the apostle gives to the words merely adds to them
	that familiar idea."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "All Israel - All the Jews. It was a maxim among the Jews that 'every Israelite should have part in the future age.' The apostle applies that maxim to his own purpose; and declares the sense in which it would be true."
2. "He does not mean to say that every Jew of every age would be saved; for he had proved that a large portion of them would be, in his time, rejected and lost. But the time would come when, as a people, they would be recovered; when the nation would turn to God; and when it could be said of them that, as a nation, they were restored to the divine favor."
3. "Shall be saved - Shall be recovered from their rejection; be restored to the divine favor; become followers of the Messiah, and thus be saved as all other Christians are."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The deliverer [Œø œÅœÖŒøŒºŒµŒΩŒøœÇ] . The Hebrew is goel redeemer, avenger." 
2. "The nearest relative of a murdered person, on whom devolved the duty of avenger, was called goel haddam avenger of blood." 
3. "So the goel was the nearest kinsman of a childless widow, and was required to marry her (Deuteronomy 25:5-10)."

### John Calvin:
1. "When the Gentiles shall come in, the Jews also shall return from their defection to the obedience of faith; and thus shall be completed the salvation of the whole Israel of God."
2. "The Israel of God is what he calls the Church, gathered alike from Jews and Gentiles; and he sets the people, thus collected from their dispersion, in opposition to the carnal children of Abraham, who had departed from his faith."
3. "But though in this prophecy deliverance to the spiritual people of God is promised, among whom even Gentiles are included; yet as the Jews are the first-born, what the Prophet declares must be fulfilled, especially in them."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The ancient people of God shall be restored, as a nation, to God's favor."
2. "The attempt to fill out the details of this restoration of the Jews as a body little has been revealed."
3. "The prophecies are introduced to confirm the last statement: 'and thus all Israel shall be saved.'"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The spiritual Israel (both Jews and Gentiles) may be his idea in accord with Romans 9:6 (Galatians 6:16) as the climax of the argument."
2. "At any rate we should strive for and pray for the conversion of Jews as a whole."
3. "Paul interprets it of Jesus as Messiah."

### John Gill:
1. "And so all Israel shall be saved... the people of the Jews, the generality of them, the body of that nation, called 'the fulness' of them... when they as a body, even the far greater part of them that shall be in being, shall return and seek the Lord their God, and David their King; shall acknowledge Jesus to be the true Messiah, and shall look to him, believe on him, and be saved by him from wrath to come."
2. "The apostle is not to be understood with such a latitude; he refers to the last times, and to a very general conversion of them to the Messiah."
3. "The apostle fitly expresses the faith and expectation of the old Jewish church in this citation: and shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob."

### John Wesley:
1. "And so all Israel shall be saved." 
2. "But there will be a still larger harvest among the gentiles."
3. "The deliverer shall come ‚Äî Yea, the deliverer is come; but not the full fruit of his coming."
