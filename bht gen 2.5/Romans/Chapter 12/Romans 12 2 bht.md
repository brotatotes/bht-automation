### Henry Alford:
1. "The dat. ·ºÄŒΩŒ±Œ∫Œ±ŒπŒΩœéœÉŒµŒπ is not the instrument by which, but the manner in which the metamorphosis takes place: that wherein it consists."
2. "·ΩÅ Œ±·º∞·ΩºŒΩ Œø·ΩóœÑŒøœÇ, here, the whole world of the ungodly, as contrasted with the spiritual kingdom of Christ."
3. "œÑ·Ω∏ ·ºÄŒ≥Œ±Œ∏. Œ∫. Œµ·ΩêŒ¨œÅ. Œ∫. œÑŒ≠Œª. are not epithets of œÑ·Ω∏ Œ∏Œ≠ŒªŒ∑ŒºŒ± œÑ. Œ∏ŒµŒø·ø¶ as in E.V., for in that case they would be superfluous, and in part (œÑŒ≠ŒªŒµŒπŒøŒΩ) inapplicable: but abstract neuters, see Romans 12:9, that ye may prove what is the will of God (viz. that which is) good and acceptable (to Him) and perfect."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "But by such an inward spiritual transformation as makes the whole life new‚Äînew in its motives and ends, even where the actions differ in nothing from those of the world‚Äînew, considered as a whole, and in such a sense as to be wholly unattainable save through the constraining power of the love of Christ." 
2. "That ye may prove‚Äîthat is, experimentally." 
3. "God's will is 'good,' as it demands only what is essentially and unchangeably good; it is 'well pleasing,' in contrast with all that is arbitrary, as demanding only what God has eternal complacency in; and it is 'perfect,' as it required nothing else than the perfection of God's reasonable creature, who, in proportion as he attains to it, reflects God's own perfection."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "They are to be governed by the laws of the Bible; to fashion their lives after the example of Christ; and to form themselves by principles different from those which prevail in the world."
2. "Let not this change appertain to the body only, but to the soul. Let it not be a mere external conformity, but let it have its seat in the spirit."
3. "A renewed heart is the best preparation for studying Christianity; as a man who is temperate is the best suited to understand the arguments for temperance; the man who is chaste, has most clearly and forcibly the arguments for chastity, etc."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Conformed - transformed."
2. "Better to render the three adjectives as appositional."
3. "The other rendering compels us to take well - pleasing in the sense of agreeable to men."

### John Calvin:
1. "For since the whole world lies in wickedness, it behooves us to put off whatever we have of the old man, if we would really put on Christ."
2. "But Paul pulls [reason] down from her throne, and so reduces her to nothing by teaching us that we must be renewed in mind."
3. "The world praises itself, and takes delight in its own inventions; but Paul affirms, that nothing pleases God except what he has commanded."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "But to be transformed, or, 'transfigured,' as in Matthew 17:2; Mark 9:2... Here also a continuous process is indicated."
2. "The 'mind'... is naturally under the dominion of the flesh; it needs renewal, which is wrought by the Holy Spirit, faith being the subjective element of its operation."
3. "What God wills is that which is 'good,' in its end, 'well-pleasing' to Him, and 'perfect' as uniting these two."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Stop being fashioned or do not have the habit of being fashioned."
2. "Do not take this age as your fashion plate."
3. "There must be a radical change in the inner man for one to live rightly in this evil age."

### John Gill:
1. "By this world is meant, either the Mosaic dispensation, and Jewish church state, so called in opposition to ◊¢◊ï◊ú◊ù ◊î◊ë◊ê, 'the world to come', the Gospel dispensation."
2. "which regards not the first work of conversion and renovation; for in this sense these persons were transformed, metamorphosed, changed, and renewed already."
3. "that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect will of God; by which is meant not the secret will of God, which cannot be searched into, proved, and known, till time and facts discover it: but the revealed will of God, both in the law, as in the hands of Christ, which contains nothing but what is good."

### John Wesley:
1. "And be not conformed ‚Äî Neither in judgment, spirit, nor behaviour."
2. "That ye may prove ‚Äî Know by sure trial; which is easily done by him who has thus presented himself to God."
3. "What is that good, and acceptable, and perfect will of God ‚Äî The will of God is here to be understood of all the preceptive part of Christianity, which is in itself so excellently good, so acceptable to God, and so perfective of our natures."
