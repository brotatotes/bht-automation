# Romans 14:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
To cause grief to a brother by one's actions is an offense against love, especially if it leads to the destruction of their conscience and potential sin. The worth of even the weakest brother is emphasized by the fact that Christ died for them. Violating someone's conscience can lead to the destruction of their soul, and aiding in this destruction is a grave offense. It is important to be mindful of the pain caused to others, even if their opinions may not be well-founded, and to prioritize love and self-denial over personal liberty.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Destroy not him with thy meat for whom Christ died." 
2. "The worth of even the poorest and weakest brother cannot be more emphatically expressed than by the words, 'for whom Christ died'."
3. "Whatever tends to make anyone violate his conscience tends to the destruction of his soul; and he who helps, whether wittingly or no, to bring about the one is guilty of aiding to accomplish the other."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The 'pain' would be real, though the 'opinion' from which it arose might not be well founded."
2. "He would violate that law which required him to sacrifice his own comfort to promote the happiness of his brother."
3. "For these weak brethren, Christ laid down his precious life. He loved them; and shall we, to gratify our appetites, pursue a course which will tend to defeat the work of Christ, and ruin the souls redeemed by his blood?"

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Be grieved [λυπειται]...It is a hurt to conscience, which, while not necessarily fatal, may lead to violation or hardening of conscience, and finally to fall."

### John Calvin:
1. "And the first thing is, — that love is violated, when our brother is made to grieve by what is so trifling; for it is contrary to love to occasion grief to any one."
2. "The next thing is, — that when the weak conscience is wounded, the price of Christ’s blood is wasted; for the most abject brother has been redeemed by the blood of Christ: it is then a heinous crime to destroy him by gratifying the stomach; and we must be basely given up to our own lusts, if we prefer meat, a worthless thing, to Christ."
3. "The third reason is, — that since the liberty attained for us by Christ is a blessing, we ought to take care, lest it should be evil spoken of by men and justly blamed, which is the case, when we unseasonably use God’s gifts."

2. "this is a breach of the rule of charity or brotherly love; such an one is a brother, and though a weak one, yet he is to be loved as a brother, and to be charitably walked with"
3. "This is to be understood, not of eternal destruction... but it is the peace of a weak brother; which is a matter of importance, and the rather to be attended to, since it is the peace of one that belongs to Christ, whom he has so loved as to die for"
