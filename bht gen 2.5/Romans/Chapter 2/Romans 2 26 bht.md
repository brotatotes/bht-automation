# Romans 2:26 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The hypothetical scenario in Romans 2 highlights the subordinate nature of circumcision to the keeping of the Law. It suggests that an uncircumcised person who fulfills the moral precepts of the Law can be treated as if they were circumcised. This concept is further supported by the idea that God was about to demonstrate the insufficiency of circumcision by calling Gentiles, who had not received the seal of circumcision, to be part of the covenant. The emphasis is on acceptance with God being based on the condition of the heart and life, rather than external privileges.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The case is an impossible one: nor does the Apostle put it as possible, only as shewing manifestly, that circumcision, the sign of the covenant of the Law, was subordinate to the keeping of the Law itself."
2. "The articles shew how completely hypothetical the case is no less than entire fulfilment of all the moral precepts of the law being contemplated."
3. "â€˜In such a case would not he be counted as a circumcised person?â€™"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The case here put is, we think, such as that of Cornelius, who, though outside the external pale of God's covenant, yet having come to the knowledge of the truths contained in it, do manifest the grace of the covenant without the seal of it, and exemplify the character and walk of Abraham's children, though not called by the name of Abraham." 
2. "Thus, this is but another way of announcing that God was about to show the insufficiency of the mere badge of the Abrahamic covenant, by calling from among the Gentiles a seed of Abraham that had never received the seal of circumcision."
3. "This interpretation is confirmed by all that follows."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Acceptance with God does not depend on a manâ€™s external privileges, but on the state of the heart and life."
2. "God judges things as they are; and as the man, though uncircumcised, who keeps the Law, ought to be treated as if he had been circumcised."
3. "He who believes in Christ agreeably to the divine promise, and trusts to his merits alone for salvation, ought to be treated as if he were himself righteous."

### John Calvin:
1. "If the uncircumcised, provided he keeps the law, far excels the Jew with his barren and unprofitable circumcision, if he be a transgressor of the law."
2. "He shall yet be so sanctified by keeping the law, that uncircumcision shall be imputed to him for circumcision."
3. "The Gentile being a keeper of the law, shall judge thee who art a transgressor, though he is uncircumcised, and thou hast the literal circumcision."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The unholy Jew virtually becomes a Gentile (Romans 2:25), does not the obedient Gentile virtually become a Jew?"
2. "The uncircumcision. The Jewish expression for â€˜the uncircumcised;â€™"
3. "At that time the uncircumcised Gentile, who has kept the ordinances of the law, shall be regarded precisely as though he were circumcised, i.e., as a member of Godâ€™s covenant people."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Keep (Ï†Ï…Î»Î±ÏƒÏƒÎ·). Present subjunctive...Paul means." 
2. "Condition of third class, mere supposition like that in verse Romans 2:25."
3. "For (ÎµÎ¹Ï‚). As often in N.T."

### John Gill:
1. "If any such persons could be found among the Gentiles who keep the whole law of God; and can only be absolutely understood of such, who from a principle of grace act in obedience to the law..." (28 words)
2. "an uncircumcised Gentile, who keeps the law as in the hands of Christ, and under the influences of his Spirit and grace, and keeps it in Christ, is reckoned a circumcised person in a spiritual sense..." (40 words)
3. "must be preferable to a circumcised Jew that breaks it." (11 words)

### John Wesley:
1. "If the uncircumcision...Keep the law â€” Walk agreeably to it."
2. "Shall not his uncircumcision be counted for circumcision â€” In the sight of God?"
