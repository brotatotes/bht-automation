## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "ἐριθεία, 'ambitus,' 'self-seeking,' 'greed.' It stands opposed to ὑπομονὴ ἔργου ἀγαθοῦ, which requires self-denial and forbearance."
2. "The mistake of rendering it 'contentiousness,' and imagining a derivation from ἔρις prevailed universally... It appears to have arisen from ἐρεθίζω being somewhat similar in sound."
3. "On the whole, self-seeking seems best to lay hold of the idea of the word: see note on Philippians 1:16-17."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "referring to such keen and determined resistance to the Gospel"
2. "indignation and wrath—in the bosom of a sin-avenging God."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "One striking characteristic of the sinner is, that he contends with God, that is, that he opposes and resists his claims."
2. "To refuse to obey [the truth] is to regard it as false, and to resist its influence."
3. "Iniquity thus may be said to reign over people, as they follow the dictates of evil, make no resistance to it, and implicitly obey all its hard requirements."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Contentious [εξ εριθειας] . Rev., better, factious. Lit., of faction. See on James 3:14. Intriguers; partisan agitators. 
Indignation and wrath [οργη και θυμος] . See on be patient, James 5:7.


### John Calvin:
1. "Contention is mentioned here for rebellion and stubbornness; for Paul was contending with hypocrites who, by their gross and supine self-indulgence, trifled with God."
2. "He enlarges on both subjects — that he might more effectually strike men with the fear of God’s wrath, and sharpen their desire for obtaining grace through Christ."
3. "This repetition is for the sake of producing an impression. The character of the righteous, in the first part, is, that by persevering in doing good they seek glory, honor, and immortality, and their reward is to be eternal life..."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Contentious’ is not exact, since the word is derived from serve, meaning to work for hire."

1. "But unto them that are factious and obey not the truth but obey unrighteousness." 
2. "But the construction changes and the substantives that follow are not the object of αποδωσε like ζωην αινωνιον above."
3. "Anger and wrath, both οργη and θυμος, tribulation and anguish, again a pair θλιψις κα στενοχωρια."

### John Gill:
1. "This is a description of the other sort of persons to whom God will render according to their deeds, 'who are of the contention'; who contend for victory, and not truth; strive about words to no profit; are quarrelsome, and sow discord among men, and in churches."
2. "Neither attend to the light of nature, and to that which may be known of God by it; nor regard and submit to the Gospel revelation..."
3. "To these God renders indignation and wrath; wrathful or fiery indignation, the hottest of his fury."

### John Wesley:
1. "The character of a false Jew is disobedience, stubbornness, impatience."
2. "Indignation and wrath, tribulation and anguish."
3. "The Jews would in the day of vengeance be more severely punished than even the Egyptians were when God made their plagues so wonderful."
