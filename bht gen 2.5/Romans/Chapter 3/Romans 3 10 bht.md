## Choicest Commentary Quotes:

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Yet if we consult Psalms 14:1-7 and Psalms 53:1-6, from which the quotations in Romans 3:10-12 are taken, we shall be constrained to admit that their original application is nothing short of universal... We cannot reasonably decide against him by confining their application to the Jews only."

### John Calvin:
1. "And hence let ecclesiastical teachers learn what their office is; for since Paul asserts here no truth but what he confirms by the sure testimony of Scripture, much less ought such a thing to be attempted by those, who have no other commission but to preach the gospel, which they have received through Paul and others."

### John Gill:
1. "There is none righteous as Adam was, in a state of innocence... none are righteous by their obedience to the law of works... nor are any righteous in the sight of God, upon the foot of their own righteousness... there is none righteous, no, not one, but those who are justified by the righteousness of Christ imputed to them."
2. "He that does not do good, is not righteous; and therefore if there is none on earth that does good and does not sin, there is none righteous upon earth, 'no, not one' single person."
3. "There is none righteous, no, not one... for all have sinned, and are filled with unrighteousness, and are enemies to righteousness."
