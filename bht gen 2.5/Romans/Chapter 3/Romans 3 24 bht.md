# Romans 3:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Believers are justified freely by God's grace through the redemption in Christ Jesus. This justification is a gift, not earned or deserved. It is based on Christ's propitiatory sacrifice, serving as a ransom for sin. All have sinned and fallen short of God's glory, making this justification necessary. It is a result of God's mercy and love, received through faith in Christ. This redemption is a complete deliverance from sin and its consequences, accomplished by Christ as our Redeemer.

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "justified freely—without anything done on our part to deserve."
2. "by his grace—His free love."
3. "through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus—a most important clause; teaching us that though justification is quite gratuitous, it is not a mere fiat of the divine will, but based on a 'Redemption,' that is, 'the payment of a Ransom,' in Christ's death."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Being treated as if righteous; that is, being regarded and treated as if they had kept the Law."
2. "It is a free, undeserved gift, not merited by our obedience to the Law, and not that to which we have any claim."
3. "The word used here denotes that deliverance from sin, and from the evil consequences of sin, which has been effected by the offering of Jesus Christ as a propitiation."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Being justified. The fact that they are justified in this extraordinary way shows that they must have sinned."
2. "Freely [δωρεαν] . Gratuitously."
3. "Redemption [απολυτρωσεως] . From ajpolutrow to redeem by paying the lutron price. Mostly in Paul."

### John Calvin:
1. "That since there remains nothing for men, as to themselves, but to perish, being smitten by the just judgment of God, they are to be justified freely through his mercy." 
2. "God’s mercy is the efficient cause, that Christ with his blood is the meritorious cause, that the formal or the instrumental cause is faith in the word."
3. "There is, perhaps, no passage in the whole Scripture which illustrates in a more striking manner the efficacy of his righteousness; for it shows that God’s mercy is the efficient cause, that Christ with his blood is the meritorious cause, that the formal or the instrumental cause is faith in the word."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Because they are all in this condition (fallen short of the glory of God), if they are justified it is in this way, namely, freely; as a gift, not by their own merit."
2. "God’s grace, i.e., His unmerited favor. His love to the sinner, is the efficient cause of justification; this led to the objective means: through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus."
3. "Freedom from sin is the consequence of the ‘redemption’ here spoken of, but the ‘redemption’ itself is an essential part of the work of Christ."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Being justified (δικαιουμενο). Present passive participle of δικαιοω, to set right, repeated action in each case, each being set right."
2. "God did not set men right out of hand with nothing done about men's sins. We have the words of Jesus that he came to give his life a ransom (λυτρον) for many (Mark 10:45; Matthew 20:28)."
3. "There can be no mistake about this redemption. It is like John 3:16."

### John Gill:
1. "The moving cause of [justification] is the free grace of God; for by 'the grace of God' here, is not meant the Gospel, or what some men call the terms of the Gospel, and the constitution of it; nor the grace of God infused into the heart; but the free love and favour of God, as it is in his heart; which is wonderfully displayed in the business of a sinner's justification before him."
2. "Redemption supposes a former state of captivity to sin, Satan, and the law, in which God's elect were by nature, and is a deliverance from it; it is of a spiritual nature, chiefly respects the soul, and is plenteous, complete, and eternal: this is in and by Christ."
3. "Christ, as a Redeemer, had the sins of his people laid on him, and they were bore by him, and took away; the sentence of the law's condemnation was executed on him, as standing in their legal place and stead; and satisfaction was made by him for all offences committed by them, which was necessary, that God might appear to be just, in justifying all them that believe."

### John Wesley:
1. "And are justified — Pardoned and accepted."
2. "Freely — Without any merit of their own."
3. "It is not possible to find words that should more absolutely exclude all consideration of our own works and obedience, or more emphatically ascribe the whole of our justification to free, unmerited goodness."
