## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Albert Barnes:
1. "If the glory of God is to be promoted by sin, and if a man is not therefore to be condemned, or held guilty for it; if this fact absolves man from crime, 'why not carry the doctrine out, and make it a principle of conduct, and do all the evil we can, in order to promote his glory.'"
2. "This is the common mode in which charges are brought against others. People draw an inference themselves, or suppose that the doctrine leads to such an inference, and then charge it on others as what they actually hold and teach."
3. "Whatever is evil is not to be done under any pretence. Any imaginable good which we may think will result from it; any advantage to ourselves or to our cause; or any glory which we may think may result to God, will not sanction or justify the deed. Strict, uncompromising integrity and honesty is to be the maxim of our lives."

### John Calvin:
1. "Evil cannot of itself produce anything but evil; and that Godâ€™s glory is through our sin illustrated, is not the work of man, but the work of God; who, as a wonderful worker, knows how to overcome our wickedness, and to convert it to another end, so as to turn it contrary to what we intend, to the promotion of his own glory."
2. "It is not then a new thing, that adversaries at this day load with so many false accusations, and render odious our doctrine, which we ourselves know to be the pure gospel of Christ, and all the angels, as well as the faithful, are our witnesses."
3. "And their perverseness was, on two accounts, to be condemned, â€” first, because this impiety had gained the assent of their minds; and secondly, because, in traducing the gospel, they dared to draw from it their calumny."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Slanderously reported; lit, 'blasphemed.' Such slander was in the last instance blasphemy, since thus Godâ€™s character was outraged."
2. "The early Christians were charged with even asserting this false principle, which would have been worse than the previous charge."
3. "The absurdity of the principle, that the end justifies the means, is not proven; the Apostle makes short work of an objection which has this logical issue."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "And why should it not happen?" 
2. "The volitive aorist subjunctive... It sounds almost uncanny to find this maxim of the Jesuits attributed to Paul in the first century by Jews."
3. "It was undoubtedly the accusation of Antinomianism because Paul preached justification by faith and not by works."

### John Gill:
1. "and not rather, as we be slanderously reported,...."
2. "let us do evil that good may come; a slander cast upon the apostle's doctrine"
3. "and all such persons are deserving of damnation, who teach such things, or practise after this sort."

### John Wesley:
1. "The condemnation of all who either speak or act in this manner."
2. "The apostle absolutely denies the lawfulness of 'doing evil,' any evil."
3. "That good may come."
