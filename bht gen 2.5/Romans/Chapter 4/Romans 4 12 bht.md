# Romans 4:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Abraham is not only the father of all believers but also in a special sense the father of the Jewish people. Mere circumcision is not enough; it must be connected with faith like Abraham's. Those who walk in the steps of Abraham's faith imitate his example and have his spirit. The exception is made for those who, in true faith, follow the example of Abraham. Faith alone is sufficient for justification, without the aid of anything else. Abraham is the father of all who go after him in his faith, but to those who do not believe, he is not a father and they are not his seed.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "And (that he might be) father of the circumcision (the circumcised) to those who are not only of the circumcision, but also who walk in the footsteps of the faith of our father Abraham while he was in uncircumcision."
2. "Who are not only of the circumcision, but also who walk in the footsteps of the faith of our father Abraham."
3. "While he was in uncircumcision."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Not only the father of all believers, but in a special sense the father of the Jewish people."
2. "Mere circumcision would not avail; but circumcision connected with faith like his, showed they were especially his descendants."
3. "Who walk in the steps...who imitate his example; who imbibe his spirit; who have his faith."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The awkwardness arises from the article toiv, erroneously repeated with stoicousin walk, which latter word expresses an added characteristic, not another class."
2. "Paul means that Abraham received a seal, etc., that he might be the father of circumcision to those who not only are circumcised, but who add to this outward sign the faith which Abraham exhibited."
3. "Walk (stoicousin)."

### John Calvin:
1. "Let us then beware, lest any of us, by halving things, blend together the two modes of justification."
2. "he expressly makes this exception — provided in true faith they followed the example of Abraham; for why does he mention faith while in uncircumcision, except to show, that it is alone sufficient, without the aid of anything else?"
3. "if Paul reasons correctly, when he argues that circumcision does not justify, because Abraham was justified by faith, the same reason holds good for us, while we deny that men are justified by baptism, inasmuch as they are justified by the same faith with that of Abraham."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "That he might be the father, etc."
2. "But with reference to those Jews who are not merely circumcised, but also believe, as he did."
3. "For Abraham’s righteousness through faith was attained, when as yet there was no distinction between circumcised and uncircumcised; and to this mode of becoming just before God, independently of external conditions, Christianity by its 'righteousness by faith ' leads back again and continues it."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The father of circumcision... a father belonging to circumcision, a less natural interpretation."
2. "To those who are, I do not say of circumcision only, but also to those who walk."
3. "Στοιχεω is military term, to walk in file."

### John Gill:
1. "He is a father to them who are not of the circumcision only."
2. "Walk in the steps of that faith of our father Abraham, which he had, being yet uncircumcised."
3. "Abraham is the father of all, that go after him in his faith."

### John Wesley:
1. And the father of the circumcision — Of those who are circumcised, and believe as Abraham did. To those who believe not, Abraham is not a father, neither are they his seed.
