Abraham's faith in God's promise was simple and unconditional, and it was reckoned to him as righteousness. His faith was so unwavering and implicit that it demonstrated his firm friendship with God. Abraham's confidence in God showed his supreme attachment to Him and his willingness to obey and serve Him. This faith was recognized as a full proof of friendship, and Abraham was treated as righteous. His faith was not based on his own merit, but solely on his belief in God's promise.
