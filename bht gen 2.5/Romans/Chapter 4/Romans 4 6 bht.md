# Romans 4:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The blessedness or congratulation of the man to whom the Lord imputes righteousness without works is pronounced. This righteousness is apart from any good works and consists of the remission and hiding of offenses. God treats this man as righteous, forgiving his sins and admitting him to His favor. The forgiveness of sins is equivalent to the imputation of righteousness, and this reckoning is apart from meritorious works. It is a righteousness that is received by faith alone, without regard to any previous good works.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "pronounces the blessedness, 'the congratulation:'"
2. "It is very clear that this righteousness must be œáœâœÅ·Ω∂œÇ ·ºîœÅŒ≥œâŒΩ, because its imputation consists in the remission and hiding of offences"
3. "none can be legally righteous in whom there is any, even the smallest offence."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The blessedness of the man unto whom the Lord imputeth righteousness without works." 
2. "Whom, though void of all good works, He, nevertheless, regards and treats as righteous."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The blessedness - The happiness; or the desirable state or condition."
2. "Whom God treats as righteous, or as entitled to his favor in a way different from his conformity to the Law."
3. "He regards him as one who is forgiven and admitted to his favor, and who is to be treated henceforward as though he had not sinned."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Makarismov does not mean blessedness, but the declaration of blessedness, the congratulation." 
2. "The man of understanding will not suffer himself to be dazzled by the congratulation [ŒºŒ±Œ∫Œ±œÅŒπœÉŒºŒøœÖ] of the multitude."
3. "Rev., correctly, pronounceth blessing."

### John Calvin:
1. "There is indeed nothing less reasonable than to remove from ceremonies only the power of justifying, since Paul excludes all works indefinitely."
2. "To the same purpose is the negative clause, ‚Äî that God justifies men by not imputing sin: and by these words we are taught that righteousness, according to Paul, is nothing else than the remission of sins."
3. "It is a striking proof of what the Apostle had in view here, that he stop short and does not quote the whole verse from Psalms 32:2. He leaves out, 'and in whose spirit there is no guile:' and why? Evidently because his subject is justification, and not sanctification."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The quotation is of forgiveness, of not being reckoned a sinner; but the Apostle takes this as equivalent to the Lord reckoneth righteousness."
2. "It is implied by Paul, that the remission of sin is equivalent to the imputation of righteousness, that there is no negative state of innocence, none intermediate between acceptance for righteousness, and rejection for sin."
3. "Since the forgiveness of sins is here indicated as a part of the reckoning of righteousness, this reckoning must be apart from meritorious works, for forgiveness and merit are opposed ideas."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1.  Pronounceth blessing (ŒªŒµŒ≥Œµ œÑŒøŒΩ ŒºŒ±Œ∫Œ±œÅŒπœÉŒºŒøŒΩ). old word from ŒºŒ±Œ∫Œ±œÅŒπŒ∂œâ, to pronounce blessed (Luke 1:48), felicitation, congratulation, in N.T. only here, verse Romans 4:9; Acts 4:15. 


### John Gill:
1. "This righteousness cannot be the righteousness of the law, or man's obedience to it; for that is a righteousness with works, is a man's own, and not imputed; and indeed is not a righteousness in the sight of God."
2. "But the righteousness here spoken of is the righteousness of Christ, called the righteousness of God; and is better than that of angels or men; is complete and perfect; by which the law is honoured, and justice is satisfied."
3. "Just in the same way his righteousness becomes ours, as Adam's sin did, which is by imputation; or in the same way that our sins became Christ's, his righteousness becomes ours."

### John Wesley:
1. "A man is justified by faith alone, and not by works."
2. "Without works - That is, without regard to any former good works supposed to have been done by him."
