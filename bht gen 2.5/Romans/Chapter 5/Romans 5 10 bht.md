# Romans 5:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Through the death of Christ, we were reconciled to God and saved from His wrath. This reconciliation was initiated by God Himself, demonstrating His determined purpose to complete it. The death of Christ removed the obstacles to reconciliation and united us with God. Now, as believers, we can have confidence that we will be saved by His life. The living Christ, who intercedes for us, will bring about the final success of His work and kingdom. This reconciliation is a result of God's love and mercy, and it leads to our sanctification and glorification.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "For if, being enemies, we were reconciled to God by means of the death of His Son, much more, having been reconciled, we shall be saved by means of His Life."
2. "This great fact is further explained and insisted on, in the rest of the chapter."
3. "Both these, the objective reception into God’s favour by the death of Christ, and the subjective appropriation, by faith, of that reception, are included."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "If that part of the Saviour's work which cost Him His blood, and which had to be wrought for persons incapable of the least sympathy either with His love or His labors in their behalf... is already completed; how much more will He do all that remains to be done... in untroubled 'life,' and no longer for enemies, but for friends." 
2. "To be 'saved from wrath through Him' denotes here the whole work of Christ towards believers... and that work may all be summed up in 'keeping them from falling, and presenting them faultless before the presence of His glory with exceeding joy'."
3. "Thus are they 'saved from wrath through Him.'"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Thus, it was commenced by God; its foundation was laid while we were still hostile to it; it evinced, therefore, a determined purpose on the part of God to perform it; and he has thus given a pledge that it shall be perfected."
2. "To effect this is the great design of the plan of salvation;... It means that there were obstacles existing on both sides to a reconciliation; and that these have been removed by the death of Christ; and that a union has thus been effected."
3. "If in this state, when humble, despised, dying, dead, he had power to accomplish so great a work as to reconcile us to God, how much more may we expect that he will be able to keep us now that he is a living, exalted, and triumphant Redeemer."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The word may be used either in an active sense, hating God, or passively, hated of God... simply the essential antagonism of the divine nature to sin."
2. "In the Christian sense, the change in the relation of God and man effected through Christ... a corresponding movement on man's part toward God; yielding to the appeal of Christ's self-sacrificing love."
3. "A consequent change of character in man; the covering, forgiving, cleansing of his sin; a thorough revolution in all his dispositions and principles."

### John Calvin:
1. "We were enemies when Christ interposed for the purpose of propitiating the Father: through this reconciliation we are now friends." 
2. "By saying that we were reconciled to God by the death of Christ, he means, that it was the sacrifice of expiation, by which God was pacified towards the world."
3. "And this twofold aspect of things ought to be noticed; for we do not know the gratuitous mercy of God otherwise than as it appears from this — that he spared not his only-begotten Son."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "When the Scriptures say that God has wrath against sinners (which really means that they are ‘enemies’ in the sense we advocate), they do not assert that He has the revengeful, passionate feelings which naturally belong to human enmity."
2. "Every assertion, even in our ordinary use of language, is modified by the character of the person spoken of; much more in this case, for God must be right, if there is any distinction between right and wrong. Nor does this view contradict the love of God: His love shines out conspicuously, becomes effective, by means of the plan which removes His enmity without detriment to His holiness."
3. "The living Christ cannot leave without final success what His death effected. This, however, is accomplished not merely through His intercession (chap. Romans 8:34), but also through His whole working in His kingly office for believers up to the completion of His work and kingdom."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "We were reconciled to God...The condition is the first class. Paul does not conceive it as his or our task to reconcile God to us." 
2. "God has attended to that himself...We become reconciled to God by means of the death of God's Son."
3. "'Much more' again we shall be saved 'by his life'...for he does live, 'ever living to intercede for them'."

### John Gill:
1. "Reconciliation implies a former state of friendship, a breach of that friendship, and a making of it up again."
2. "This expresses the wonderful love of God, since this reconciliation arises purely from himself; the scheme of it is of his own contriving."
3. "We shall be saved by his life; by the life of Christ, and which designs not so much his life as God; or his living in the hearts of his people by faith; though neither of them are to be excluded; but his life, as man, and that not either his private or public life, as man here on earth, though this has an influence upon, and a concern in the business of salvation; but more especially here is meant the interceding life of Christ in heaven."

### John Wesley:
1. "We shalt be saved — Sanctified and glorified."
2. "Through his life — Who 'ever liveth to make intercession for us."
