# Romans 5:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Sin has reigned in death, triumphing and reveling in the destruction of its victims. However, grace, through the righteousness of Christ, reigns in life, making us the righteousness of God. This grace reaches its objects and attains its ends through the righteous medium of Christ's justifying righteousness. The dominion of sin and death ceases when the grace of Christ prevails in someone. The triumphs of the gospel lie in its ability to overcome even the most malignant and aggravated forms of sin. Christianity offers a remedy that is ample to meet all the evils of the world and is destined to raise humanity to life, peace, and heaven.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "That, as sin reigned in death, so also grace may reign by means of righteousness, unto life eternal." 
2. "Grace may reign by means of righteousness." 
3. "Grace... unto life eternal through Jesus Christ our Lord."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "the great general term sin...hath reigned unto death—in death, triumphing and (as it were) revelling in that complete destruction of its victims."
2. "the grace which originated the scheme of salvation...makes us to be the righteousness of God in Him...we who receive the abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness do reign in life by One, Jesus Christ!"
3. "the (justifying) righteousness of Christ...is here represented as the righteous medium through which grace reaches its objects and attains all its ends, the stable throne from which Grace as a Sovereign dispenses its saving benefits to as many as are brought under its benign sway."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The triumphs of the gospel here celebrated cannot refer to the number of the subjects, for it has not actually freed all people from the dominion of sin. But the apostle refers to the fact that the gospel is able to overcome sin of the most malignant form, of the most aggravated character, of the longest duration."
2. "Christianity is not responsible for those evils. It did not introduce them. It finds them in existence, as a matter of sober and melancholy fact, pertaining to all the race. Christianity is no more answerable for the introduction and extent of sin, than the science of medicine is responsible for the introduction and extent of disease."
3. "Christianity proposes a remedy; and it is permitted to the Christian to rejoice that that remedy is ample to meet all the evils; that it is just suited to recover our alienated world; and that it is destined yet to raise the race up to life, and peace, and heaven."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Unto death, as the sphere or dominion of death's tyranny."
2. "How much is lost by the inaccurate rendering of the prepositions."
3. "And now - so this last word seems to say - Adam has passed away; Christ alone remains."

### John Calvin:
1. "But Paul was not content to oppose what is contrary to what is contrary, but adds the word grace, that he might more deeply print this truth on the memory — that the whole is to be ascribed, not to our merit, but to the kindness of God."
2. "Hence as soon as the grace of Christ begins to prevail in any one, the reign of sin and death ceases."
3. "The reign of sin was that of death and misery; the reign of grace through Christ’s righteousness is that of life and happiness, which is never to end."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "That--even so grace might reign."
2. "The purpose of God and the goal for us through Christ."
3. "This full rhetorical close has almost the value of a doxology."

### John Gill:
1. "Sin has such a power over man in a state of nature, as amounts to a dominion; it has not only an enticing, ensnaring power, to draw into a compliance with it, and an obstructive power to hinder that which is good, and an operative one of that which is evil, and a captivating, enslaving one to the same; but it has a kingly, governing, and commanding power." 
2. "Grace reigns or bears sway in man's salvation in all the parts of it, 'through righteousness'; consistent with the justice of God, in a way in which that is glorified, through the redemption of Christ: it reigns 'unto eternal life'; grace has promised, prepared it, and makes meet for it, and will introduce into it, and freely give it."
3. "Grace as it is in the hearts of converted persons, is meant where it reigns, has the dominion, is the governing principle, and that in a way of righteousness and true holiness; and will reign until it is perfected in glory, or is crowned with eternal life; all which are by Jesus Christ, namely, grace, righteousness, and life."

### John Wesley:
1. "That as sin had reigned-so grace also might reign." 
2. "Here is pointed out the source of all our blessings, the rich and free grace of God."
3. "The effect or end of all; not only pardon, but life; divine life, leading to glory."
