# Romans 6:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Believers are called to reckon themselves dead to sin and alive to God through their union with Christ. This recognition is not merely a theoretical concept, but a motivation for holy living. It is through the death and resurrection of Christ that believers are not only forgiven of their sins, but also empowered to live a new life free from the bondage of sin. This truth should prompt believers to examine their faith and strive to live in accordance with their new identity in Christ.
