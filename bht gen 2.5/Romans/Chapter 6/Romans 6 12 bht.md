# Romans 6:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Do not let sin reign in your mortal body, for it is not a matter of comparison between reigning and indwelling, but between reigning and being deposed. The body is viewed as the instrument by which sins of the heart become outward actions and the seat of lower appetites. The unchecked dominion of sin within us is what is meant by its reign. Sin should not be allowed to have such ascendency as to rule over and make us its slaves. It is inconsistent for sin to be so vigorous as to exercise its reigning power.
