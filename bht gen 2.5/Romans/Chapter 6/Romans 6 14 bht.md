## BHT:
Believers who are under grace, not under the law, are assured that sin will not have dominion over them. The law, as a system of legal obedience, cannot subdue sin but rather excites and leads to indulgence in it. However, being under grace means being justified by faith and under the promise of the indwelling Spirit, which enables believers to overcome sin. The future tense used in this statement is a confident assertion and consolation, assuring that sin will not have dominion over believers. Grace, not the law, is what sanctifies and brings victory over sin.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "An assurance, confirming (by the Œ≥Œ¨œÅ) the possibility of the surrender to God commanded in the last verse, that sin shall not be able to assert and maintain its rule in those who are not under the law but under grace."
2. "Your efforts to live a life of freedom from the tyranny of sin shall not be frustrated...for ye are not under that law which is the strength of sin, but under that grace in which is no condemnation."
3. "We (Christians) are not under the law, placed in a covenant of legal obedience, but under grace, placed in a covenant of justification by faith and under the promise of the indwelling Spirit subjects of a higher law."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "For Sin shall not have dominion over you‚Äîas the slaves of a tyrant lord." 
2. "To be 'under the law' is, first, to be under its claim to entire obedience; and so, next under its curse for the breach of these." 
3. "To be 'under grace,' is to be under the glorious canopy and saving effects of that 'grace which reigns through righteousness unto eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord'."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The apostle means to say that Christians are not under the law as legalists, or as attempting to be justified by it."
2. "It is implied here that the effect of an attempt to be justified by the Law was not to subdue sins, but to excite them and to lead to indulgence in them."
3. "The Christian was seeking justification on a plan which contemplated and which accomplished the destruction of sin; and he therefore infers that sin should not have dominion over them."

### John Calvin:
1. "The yoke of the law cannot do otherwise than tear and bruise those who carry it. It hence follows, that the faithful must flee to Christ, and implore him to be the defender of their freedom."
2. "Hence, not to be under the law means, not only that we are not under the letter which prescribes what involves us in guilt, as we are not able to perform it, but also that we are no longer subject to the law, as requiring perfect righteousness, and pronouncing death on all who deviate from it in any part."
3. "For how much soever we may be harassed by the stings of sin, it cannot yet overcome us, for we are enabled to conquer it by the Spirit of God; and then, being under grace, we are freed from the rigorous requirements of the law."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The future tense is that of confident assertion, and hence of consolation."
2. "Freedom from the law gives you so little freedom to sin, that it is only by the exercise of grace upon you that your freedom from sin has begun."
3. "If the reason sin will not lord it over us, is that we are not under the law, but under grace, then grace sanctifies us, not the law."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Shall not have dominion... even if not yet wholly dead." 
2. "Shall not lord it over you." 
3. "Shall not have dominion... even if not yet wholly dead."

### John Gill:
1. "it is an absolute promise, that sin shall not have the dominion over believers; and respects not acts of sin, but the principle of sin; and means not its damning power, though that is took away, but its tyrannical, governing power."

### John Wesley:
1. "Sin shall not have dominion over you ‚Äî It has neither right nor power."
2. "For ye are not under the law ‚Äî A dispensation of terror and bondage, which only shows sin, without enabling you to conquer it."
3. "But under grace ‚Äî Under the merciful dispensation of the gospel, which brings complete victory over it to every one who is under the powerful influences of the Spirit of Christ."
