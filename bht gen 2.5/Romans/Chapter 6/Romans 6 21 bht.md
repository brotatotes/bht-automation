2. "By saying they were 'now ashamed,' he makes it plain that he is not referring to that disgust at themselves, and remorse of conscience by which those who are the most helplessly 'sold under sin' are often stung to the quick; but that ingenuous feeling of self-reproach, which pierces and weighs down the children of God."
3. "It [the past life] did to His name, the ingratitude it displayed, the violence it did to their own conscience, its deadening and degrading effects, and the death‚Äî'the second death'‚Äîto which it was dragging them down."

1. "The godly, as soon as they begin to be illuminated by the Spirit of Christ and the preaching of the gospel, do freely acknowledge their past life, which they have lived without Christ, to have been worthy of condemnation; and so far are they from endeavouring to excuse it, that, on the contrary, they feel ashamed of themselves."
2. "Yea, further, they call to mind the remembrance of their own disgrace, that being thus ashamed, they may more truly and more readily be humbled before God."
3. "He shows at last still more plainly from what was to follow, how much they ought to have been ashamed, that is, when they came to understand that they had been standing on the very precipice of death, and had been nigh destruction; yea, that they would have already entered the gates of death, had they not been reclaimed by God‚Äôs mercy."
