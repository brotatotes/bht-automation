# Romans 6:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
For, as a man that is dead is acquitted and released from guilt and bondage, so a man that has died to sin is acquitted from the guilt of sin and released from its bondage. This great word of being justified is added to the death and life of the Christian. When a man dies, he is exempt from the power and dominion of his master, just as the Christian, being dead to sin, is released from the control of his former master. The Christian is freed from the dominion of sin, from servitude to it, and from the guilt of it, as dead men are freed from the commands of their former masters.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "For, as a man that is dead is acquitted and released from guilt and bondage (among men: no reference to God’s judgment of him): so a man that has died to sin is acquitted from the guilt of sin and released from its bondage."
2. "I express δεδικ . by this periphrasis in both cases, because I believe that all this is implied in it: 'is acquitted,' 'has his quittance,' from sin, so that Sin (personified) has no more claims on him, either as a creditor or as a master."
3. "A larger reference is thus given to δεδικ . than the purposes of the present argument, which is treating of the power, not the guilt of sin, required: but that it is so, lies in the nature of ἁμαρτία , the service of which is guilt, and the deliverance from whose service necessarily brings with it acquittal."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "For he that is dead—rather, 'hath died.'"
2. "is freed—'hath been set free.'"
3. "from sin—literally, 'justified,' 'acquitted,' 'got his discharge from sin.'"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "When a man dies he is exempt from the power and dominion of his master, of him who reigned over him."
2. "The Christian being now dead to sin... is released from the control of his former master, sin."
3. "The design of the apostle is not to say that the Christian is perfect, but that sin has ceased to have dominion over him, as a master ceases to have power over a slave when he is dead."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "As a man that is dead is acquitted and released from bondage among men, so a man that has died to sin is acquitted from the guilt of sin and released from its bondage."


### John Calvin:
1. "If thou art a Christian, there must appear in thee an evidence of a fellowship as to the death of Christ; the fruit of which is, that thy flesh is crucified together with all its lusts; but this fellowship is not to be considered as not existing, because thou findest that the relics of the flesh still live in thee; but its increase ought to be diligently labored for, until thou arrivest at the goal."
2. "It is indeed well with us, if our flesh is continually mortified; nor is it a small attainment, when the reigning power, being taken away from it, is wielded by the Holy Spirit."
3. "This verse has occasioned various explanations. The most obvious meaning of the first clause is, that to 'die' here means to die with or in a similar manner with Christ, for in the next verse, where the idea is resumed, 'with' or like 'Christ,' is expressly stated."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Is acquitted (lit., ‘justified’) from sin. This is the permanent result."
2. "The word ‘justified’ is to be taken here in its strictly legal sense, absolved, acquitted, freed."
3. "‘As natural death cuts off all communication with life, so must sanctification in the soul cut off all communication with sin’ (Henry)."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1.  Is justified  (δεδικαιωτα). Perfect passive indicative of δικαιοω, stands justified, set free from, adding this great word to death and life of verses Romans 6:1; Romans 6:2. 

### John Gill:
1. "But here it is to be understood of a spiritual or mystical death, and of persons who are dead to the law, by the body of Christ; dead to sin by the sacrifice and grace of Christ."
2. "Such are 'freed from sin'; not from the being of it; nor from the burden of it; nor from a continual war with it; nor from slips and falls into it; no, not even freed from it, in the most solemn services and acts of religion..." 
3. "...but they are freed from the dominion of it, from servitude to it, and also from the guilt of it, and from obligation to punishment on account of it."

### John Wesley:
1. For he that is dead — With Christ. Is freed from the guilt of past, and from the power of present, sin, as dead men from the commands of their former masters.
