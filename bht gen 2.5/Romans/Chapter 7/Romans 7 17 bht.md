# Romans 7:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this context, the apostle Paul distinguishes between his higher self, which approves of the law and desires righteousness, and his lower self, which is enslaved to sin. Christians are responsible for their sins, even those committed against their spiritual will. The conflict between the flesh and the spirit within a believer is the key to understanding this. Paul's purpose is to highlight the struggle between two opposing principles and his condemnation of his corrupt nature. He disowns the sin that dwells in him, acknowledging its presence but not identifying with it.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Here the ·ºêŒ≥œé is not the complex responsible self, by which the evil deed is wrought, and which incurs the guilt of working it: but the self of the WILL in its higher sense, the ·ºîœÉœâ ·ºÑŒΩŒ∏œÅœâœÄŒøœÇ of Romans 7:22."
2. "The not bearing this in mind has led to error in interpretation and doctrine: e.g. when it is supposed that the Christian is not responsible for his sins committed against his spiritual will and higher judgment."
3. "We are all responsible for the ·ºîœÅŒ≥Œ± of the sin that dwelleth in us, and it is in this very subjection to and involution with the law of sin in our members, that the misery consists, which leads to the cry in Romans 7:24."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "To explain this and the following statements, as many do (even BENGEL and THOLUCK), of the sins of unrenewed men against their better convictions, is to do painful violence to the apostle's language, and to affirm of the unregenerate what is untrue." 
2. "That coexistence and mutual hostility of 'flesh' and 'spirit' in the same renewed man, which is so clearly taught in Romans 8:4, c., and in Romans 8:4- :, &c., is the true and only key to the language of this and the following verses." 
3. "His sole object in thus expressing himself was to bring more vividly before his readers the conflict of two opposite principles, and how entirely, as a new man‚Äîhonoring from his inmost soul the law of God‚Äîhe condemned and renounced his corrupt nature, with its affections and lusts, its stirrings and its outgoings, root and branch."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He means to say that he does not approve or love it in his present state, but that it is the result of his native propensities and passions."
2. "In his heart, and conscience, and habitual feeling, he did not choose to commit sin, but abhorred it."
3. "This is a strong expression, denoting that sin had taken up its habitation in the mind, and abode there. It had not been yet wholly dislodged."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Now - no more. After this statement you can no more maintain that, etc."
2. "I. My personality proper; my moral self - consciousness which has approved the law (ver. 16) and has developed vague desires for something better."
3. "My moral self-consciousness which has approved the law and has developed vague desires for something better."

### John Calvin:
1. "For the faithful are carried along in their obedience to God with such fervour of spirit that they deny the flesh."
2. "Paul here denies that he is wholly possessed by sin; nay, he declares himself to be exempt from its bondage."
3. "Sin was in him as in a house or dwelling; it was an in-habiting sin, or that which is in-abiding or resident."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "It is no longer I that perform it, i.e., ‚Äòwhat I wish not.‚Äô I am a slave under sin, what ‚ÄòI perform, I know not‚Äô."
2. "The desire is powerless; the ‚ÄòI‚Äô is enslaved."
3. "Whether the experience be that of a regenerate or unregenerate man, the moral responsibility rests on him in whom sin dwells; the description is intended to prove the powerlessness of man under the law, not to define his responsibility."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "But sin that dwelleth in me... Not my true self, my higher personality, but my lower self due to my slavery to indwelling sin." 
2. "Paul does not mean to say that his whole self has no moral responsibility by using this paradox." 
3. "To be saved from sin, a man must at the same time own it and disown it."

### John Gill:
1. "Since he did not approve, but hated what he did, and willed the contrary, it was not he as spiritual, as born again, as a new man, a new creature, that did it." 
2. "The old man, the carnal I, the evil present with him, the law in his members; which not only existed in him, and wrought in him, and that at times very strongly, but dwelt in him, had its abode in him, as it has in all regenerate persons, and will have, as long as they are in the body."

### John Wesley:
1. "It is no more I that can properly be said to do it."
2. "Sin that dwelleth in me ‚Äî That makes, as it were, another person."
3. "Tyrannizes over me."
