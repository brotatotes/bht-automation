# Romans 7:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In Romans 7, Paul explains that death releases a person from legal obligations. He uses the example of a woman who is bound to her husband as long as he is alive. If she remarries while her husband is alive, she would be considered an adulteress. However, if her husband dies, she is free from the law of marriage. This example illustrates the freedom believers have from the Law through their union with Christ.

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: In Romans 7:3, the Apostle Paul emphasizes that death dissolves legal obligation, using the example of a woman who is bound to her husband as long as he is alive. The commentators note that the liberated person in the example is the survivor, while in the application, the liberated person is the dead person. They also suggest that the woman in the example represents believers who were once bound to the Law but are now joined to Christ. If the example is applied further, the woman would be called an adulteress if she remarries while her husband is alive, but if her husband dies, she is free from the law of marriage.
