# Romans 8:27 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Holy Spirit intercedes for believers in accordance with God's will, even when their prayers are inarticulate or imperfectly expressed. God understands the meaning behind the groanings and desires of the Spirit, interpreting them as the Spirit's own intercession on behalf of believers. The Spirit pleads for what God Himself intends to bestow, and these pleadings are heard and answered by God. It is through the Spirit's intercession that believers can have confidence in the effectiveness and success of their prayers.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The assurance which we have that God the Heart-Searcher interprets the inarticulate sighings of the Spirit in us, is, not strictly speaking, His Omniscience, but the fact that the very Spirit who thus pleads, does it κατὰ θεόν, in pursuance of the divine purposes and in conformity with God’s good pleasure."
2. "All these pleadings of the Spirit are heard and answered, even when inarticulately uttered."
3. "We may extend the same comforting assurance to the imperfect and mistaken verbal utterances of our prayers, which are not themselves answered to our hurt, but the answer is given to the voice of the Spirit which speaks through them, which we would express, but cannot."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "He watches the surging emotions of them in prayer, and knows perfectly what the Spirit means by the groanings which He draws forth within us, because that blessed Intercessor pleads by them only for what God Himself designs to bestow." 
2. "It is not when believers, through sinful 'quenching of the Spirit,' have the fewest and faintest glimpses of heaven, that they sigh most fervently to be there; but, on the contrary, when through the unobstructed working of the Spirit in their hearts, 'the first-fruits' of the glory to be revealed are most largely and frequently tasted, then, and just for that reason, is it that they 'groan within themselves' for full redemption." 
3. "These inarticulate groanings are the Spirit's own vehicle for conveying into 'the ears of the Lord of Sabaoth' their whole case; and come up before the Hearer of prayer as the Spirit's own intercession in their behalf, and that they are recognized by Him that sitteth on the Throne, as embodying only what His own 'will' determined before to bestow upon them."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "To search the heart is one of his attributes which cannot be communicated to a creature."
2. "He sees the anxious feelings of the soul, and is ready to aid and to bless."
3. "That man is most safe who yields himself most entirely to the influence of the Holy Spirit."

### John Calvin:
1. "This is a remarkable reason for strengthening our confidence, that we are heard by God when we pray through his Spirit, for he thoroughly knows our desires, even as the thoughts of his own Spirit."
2. "God regards not these emotions of the Spirit as new and strange, or that he rejects them as unreasonable, but that he allows them, and at the same time kindly accepts them, as allowed and approved by him."
3. "If then we would have our prayers to be acceptable to God, we must pray that he may regulate them according to his will."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Though the groanings are unutterable, God understands their meaning."
2. "The mind of the Spirit. This is an object of knowledge to the heart-searching God."
3. "What we cannot utter, because we do not know what to pray for as we ought, what the indwelling Spirit in its pleadings cannot articulately utter through us, is known to God."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The Holy Spirit is the 'other Paraclete' who pleads God's cause with us as Christ is our Paraclete with the Father."
2. "The Holy Spirit interprets our prayers to God."
3. "The Holy Spirit 'makes intercession for us in accord with God's will'."

### John Gill:
1. "This is the prerogative of God: and he knoweth what is the mind of the Spirit." 
2. "The omniscient God understands, and respects such kind of prayer." 
3. "Saints may be confident of the prevalence and success of such intercession."

### John Wesley:
1. "He who searcheth the hearts... Knoweth... What is the mind of the Spirit." 
2. "For he maketh intercession for the saints... According to God."
3. "According to his will, as is worthy of God and acceptable to him."
