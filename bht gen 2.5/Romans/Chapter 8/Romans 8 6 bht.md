# Romans 8:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The mind of the flesh leads to death, while the mind of the Spirit brings life and peace. The carnal mind is characterized by following the desires of the flesh, resulting in condemnation and ruin. On the other hand, being spiritually minded means seeking the feelings and views produced by the Holy Spirit, leading to true life and happiness. The mind of the Spirit is life-giving and leads to peace, which encompasses all kinds of happiness. It is through being spiritually minded that we experience the fullness of life and the peace of God.

### John Gill:
1. "This wisdom of the flesh, or carnal mindedness, 'is death'; not that it is conversant about death; or that such persons are thoughtful of it, endeavour to make it familiar to them; or are desirous of it, and esteem it as a privilege; this only spiritually minded men do: but the sense is, that this issues in death."
2. "Carnal mindedness, so far as it prevails in the saints, brings a death upon them. It is true, indeed, they cannot die a spiritual, or an eternal death; yet sometimes they are very dead and lifeless in their frames, in the exercise of grace and discharge of duty; which is frequently owing to their carnality."
3. "But spiritually minded men are evidently living persons; they have a spiritual discerning of spiritual things; they breathe after them, savour and relish them; they talk of spiritual things, and walk in a spiritual manner; they are not only alive, but lively in the exercise of grace and discharge of duty; and are the means of enlivening others; and their end will be everlasting life."

3. "To be spiritually minded - To mind the things of the Spirit."
