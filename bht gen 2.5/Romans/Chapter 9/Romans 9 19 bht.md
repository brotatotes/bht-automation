### John Calvin:

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Given an infinite free will, how can there be other free wills."
2. "'Resisteth' is better than 'hath resisted'; and the question implies the helplessness of the objector, and acknowledges the Almightiness of God, but at the expense of His rectitude, since it virtually makes Him responsible for men's sins."
3. "The difficulty is an ontological one: Given an infinite free will, how can there be other free wills."

2. "Withstandeth his will (Ï„Ï‰ Î²Î¿Ï…Î»Î·Î¼Î±Ï„ Î±Ï…Ï„Î¿Ï… Î±Î½Î¸ÎµÏƒÏ„Î·ÎºÎµÎ½). Perfect active indicative of Î±Î½Î¸Î¹ÏƒÏ„Î·Î¼, old verb, maintains a stand (the perfect tense)."
3. "Many have attempted to resist God's will (Î²Î¿Ï…Î»Î·Î¼Î±, deliberate purpose, in N.T. only here and Acts 27:43; 1 Peter 4:3)."

### John Gill:
1. "What as if he should say, is he not content with the injustice he has already exercised, in passing by some, when he chose others... this is downright cruelty and tyranny." 
2. "The objector seems to have a particular regard to the case of Pharaoh... all which in this objection, is represented as unparalleled cruelty and unmercifulness."
3. "This the objector takes up, and improves against God;... and therefore it must be unreasonable in him to be angry with, blame, accuse, and condemn persons for being and doing that, which he himself wills them to be and do."

### John Wesley:
1. "The particle still is strongly expressive of the objector's sour, morose murmuring."
2. "The word his likewise expresses his surliness and aversion to God, whom he does not even deign to name."
