# Romans 9:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Being a child of God is not determined by physical descent, but by being a child of the promise. The privileges of the Jews were not solely based on their lineage from Abraham. The children of the promise are those who are chosen by God and partake in His mercy and salvation. This distinction emphasizes that being a child of God is not a result of natural birth, but a spiritual birth through God's grace and power.
