2. "The Passover was celebrated by families, typifying an unbroken fellowship of those who formed one body, with the God who had passed by the blood-sprinkled doors."
3. "The cup is first mentioned, perhaps, because Paul wishes to dwell more at length on the bread; or possibly, because drinking rather than eating characterized the idol-feasts."

### John Calvin:

2. "The consecration, however, which the Papists make use of, is a kind of sorcery derived from heathens, which has nothing in common with the pure rite observed by Christians."
3. "But Papists could not say this, that the cup of blessing is a participation in the blood of Christ, for the Supper that they observe is mutilated and torn: if indeed we can give the name of the Supper to that strange ceremony which is a patchwork of various human contrivances, and scarcely retains the slightest vestige of the institution of our Lord."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The cup of blessing. This was the name given by the Jews to the last and most sacred of those cups of wine which were partaken of at the Paschal feast, and from that the expression was transferred to the Lordâ€™s Supper."
2. "Is it not a communion of (or â€˜participation inâ€™) the blood of Christ? The bread which we break, is it not a communion of (or â€˜participation inâ€™) the body of Christ?"
3. "As all the four accounts mention the 'breaking' of the bread, it is plain that this was meant to be no mere preliminary act, but an essential feature of the ordinance, considered as a teaching rite; proclaiming the fundamental truth that we are reconciled to God, not by the life, but by the death of Christ. 'This is my body, broken for you'."

### Archibald T. Robertson:

2. "if believers, by eating the bread and drinking the wine in the Lord's supper, spiritually partake of Christ, of his body and of his blood, and have communion with him; then such who eat of things sacrificed unto idols, have in so doing communion with them, and partake of the table of devils, and so are guilty of idolatry, which he would have them avoid."
3. "It is...a means of having communion with him, and of enjoying the blessings of grace which come through his blood; such as righteousness, peace, pardon, and atonement; all which true believers are made partakers of."
