# 1 Corinthians 10:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
By partaking of the bread in the Lord's Supper, believers become one body with Christ and with one another. The use of one loaf symbolizes our unity and oneness, as the bread becomes assimilated into our bodies. Through this act, we declare our shared identity and purpose as a society united in Christ. It is through the communion of the bread that we are bound together in one spiritual body, connected to Christ and to each other.

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: When we partake of the bread in the Lord's Supper, we become one bread, not just symbolically but literally, as it becomes a part of us. Through our participation in the bread, we become united as one body, both with Christ and with each other. This union is signified by the use of one loaf, representing the spiritual body of Christ and our oneness with Him. By partaking of the same bread, we show that we are one society, united for the same purpose, and publicly declare our unity and belonging to the family of believers. Just as friends were brought together over a common meal and oneness was expressed, how much more so for Christians who partake of the bread and cup representing the broken body and shed blood of Christ. This shows their oneness with Him and, in turn, their oneness with each other. Thus, by participating in idol feasts, one becomes affiliated with idolatry and idol deities. In summary, the act of partaking in the bread signifies our unity as believers, our communion with Christ, and our fellowship with one another.
