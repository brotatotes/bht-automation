# 1 Corinthians 10:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Israelites entering the Red Sea symbolizes their immersion into a covenant with God under the leadership of Moses. This baptism of initiation bound them to obey Moses and enjoy his protection. The cloud served as a covering and the sea surrounded them, representing their immersion. In a similar way, Christians are baptized into Christ, beginning a new life of faith. Christ acts as our guiding pillar of cloud and fire, protecting and directing us.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "entered by the act of such immersion into a solemn covenant with God"
2. "the outward symbols of their initiation into the church under the government of Moses"
3. "To understand...the sea and cloud, of water and the Spirit respectively, is certainly carrying the allegory too far"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Baptized is here equivalent to initiated: it is used in accommodation to Paul's argument to the Corinthians."
2. "There is a resemblance between the symbols also: for the cloud and sea consist of water, and as these took the Israelites out of sight, and then restored them again to view, so the water does to the baptized."
3. "Christ is the pillar cloud that screens us from the heat of God's wrath. Christ as 'the light of the world' is our 'pillar of fire' to guide us in the darkness of the world."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "And it is evidently in this latter sense that the word is used here, as denoting that they were devoted to Moses as a leader, they were brought under his laws, they became bound to obey him, they were placed under his protection and guidance by the miraculous interposition of God."
2. "And if this interpretation is correct, then it follows that the word 'baptize' does not of necessity mean to 'immerse.'"
3. "This passage is a very important one to prove that the word baptism does not necessarily mean entire immersion in water."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "They were introduced into a spiritual union with Moses, and constituted his disciples." 
2. "The cloud and the sea are in their nature water." 
3. "The cloud was diffused and suspended water."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "and were all baptized into Moses i.e. into the Mosaic economy." 
2. "even as the Christians had the starting-point of their new life when publicly 'baptized into Christ'."
3. "in the cloud and in the sea."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The mystic cloud covered the people while the sea rose in walls on each side of them as they marched across."
2. "The immersion was complete for all of them in the sea around them and the cloud over them."
3. "Moses was their leader then as Christ is now and so Paul uses ÎµÎ¹Ï‚ concerning the relation of the Israelites to Moses as he does of our baptism in relation to Christ."

### John Gill:
1. "The Israelites, when they passed through the Red sea, hid the waters on each side of them, which stood up as a wall higher than they, and the cloud over them, so that they were as persons immersed in and covered with water; and very fitly represented the ordinance of baptism as performed by immersion." 
2. "Their following Moses into the sea, which is meant by their being 'baptized into him', was an acknowledgment of their regard unto him, as their guide and governor, as baptism is a following of Christ, who has left us an example that we should tread in his steps."
3. "The descent of the Israelites into the sea, when they seemed as buried in the waters, and their ascent out of it again on the shore, has a very great agreement with baptism, as administered by immersion, in which the person baptized goes down into the water, is buried with Christ therein, and comes up out of it as out of a grave."

### John Wesley:
1. "And were all, as it were, baptized unto Moses - initiated into the religion which he taught them."
2. "In the cloud and in the sea â€” Perhaps sprinkled here and there with drops of water from the sea or the cloud, by which baptism might be the more evidently signified."

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: The Israelites, when they passed through the Red Sea, were immersed into a covenant with God under the leadership of Moses. Baptism, in this context, denotes initiation and devotion to Moses as a leader, binding them to his laws and protection. The cloud and sea represent the immersion of the Israelites, as they were covered and surrounded by water, symbolizing their new spiritual union with Moses. Similarly, as Christians are baptized into Christ, they experience a new starting point in their faith. The cloud served as a covering, shielding them from God's wrath, while the sea rising on both sides of them represented the act of immersion. In the same way, Christ is our guiding pillar, protecting and illuminating our path in the darkness.
