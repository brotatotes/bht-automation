# 1 Corinthians 11:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When it comes to the matter of head covering, the emphasis is on the woman's visible sign of subjection through wearing a veil while the man is advised to have his head uncovered. This signifies the woman's reverence before God and her submission to man. By wearing a covering, the man dishonors Christ, his spiritual Head, and obscures the glory that should be seen in the order of marriage.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:

2. "The Jews when praying in public put over their heads a veil, called the Tallith, to shew their reverence before God and their unworthiness to look on Him."
3. "Œ∫Œ±œÑŒ±ŒπœÉœá . œÑ . Œ∫ŒµœÜ . Œ±·ΩêœÑŒø·ø¶ ] dishonours his Head, i.e. Christ: not, his own head literally, except in so far as the literal and metaphorical senses are both included, the (literal) head of the man being regarded as the representative of his spiritual Head."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

2. "He dishonoreth his head (the principal part of the body) by wearing a covering or veil, which is a mark of subjection, and which makes him look downwards instead of upwards to his Spiritual Head, Christ, to whom alone he owes subjection."
3. "Why, then, ought not man to wear the covering in token of his subjection to Christ, as the woman wears it in token of her subjection to man? 'Because Christ is not seen: the man is seen; so the covering of him who is under Christ is not seen; of her who is under the man, is seen.'"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Whether these persons who are here said to prophesy were all inspired, or claimed to be inspired, may admit of a question. The simple idea here is, that they spoke in the public assemblies, and professed to be the expounders of the divine will."
2. "To remove the hat, the turban, or the covering of the head, is a mark of respect for a superior when in his presence."
3. "In the presence of a prince or a nobleman, it would be considered as a mark of disrespect should the head be covered. So in the presence of Christ, in whose name he ministers, it is a mark of disrespect if the head is covered."

### John Calvin:
1. "If the man does not keep his own station ‚Äî if he is not subject to Christ in such a way as to preside over his own family with authority, he obscures, to that extent, the glory of Christ, which shines forth in the well regulated order of marriage."
2. "The covering, as we shall see ere long, is an emblem of authority intermediate and interposed."
3. "Paul means nothing more than this ‚Äî that it should appear that the man has authority, and that the woman is under subjection, and this is secured when the man uncovers his head in the view of the Church."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Every man...having his head covered, dishonoureth his head covering what God made to be exposed."
2. "Every man...that is, 'speaking by Divine Inspiration,'...having his head covered, dishonoureth his head covering."
3. "Every man...either to God in public prayer, or from God in preaching, having his head covered, dishonoureth his head covering."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Having his head covered (Œ∫Œ±œÑŒ± Œ∫ŒµœÜŒ±ŒªŒ∑œÇ ŒµœáœâŒΩ). Literally, having a veil (Œ∫Œ±ŒªœÖŒºŒºŒ± understood) down from the head (Œ∫ŒµœÜŒ±ŒªŒ∑œÇ ablative after Œ∫Œ±œÑŒ± as with Œ∫Œ±œÑŒ± in Mark 5:13; Acts 27:14)."
2. "It is not certain whether the Jews at this time used the tallith, "a four-corned shawl having fringes consisting of eight threads, each knotted five times" (Vincent) as they did later."
3. "The Greeks (both men and women) remained bareheaded in public prayer and this usage Paul commends for the men."

### John Gill:
1. "Every man praying or prophesying,.... This is to be understood of praying and prophesying in public, and not in private; and not to be restrained to the person that is the mouth of the congregation to God in prayer, or who preaches to the people in the name of God; but to be applied to every individual person that attends public worship."
2. "But the natural head, taken in a literal sense, is rather meant; and the sense is, that by covering it, it looks as if he was guilty and ashamed, and in subjection; whereas to appear uncovered expresses freedom, boldness, and superiority, like himself, who is the head of the woman."
3. "Rather the reason should be, because Christ, the believer's head, appears for him in heaven, opens a way of access for him, gives him audience and acceptance in his person, and through his blood and righteousness; and therefore should appear with open face and head uncovered, as a token of freedom and boldness; otherwise he dishonours his head as if his blood and sacrifice were not effectual, and his intercession not prevalent."

### John Wesley:
1. "Every man praying or prophesying...With his head covered...Dishonoureth his head."
2. "As in these eastern nations veiling the head is a badge of subjection..."
3. "A man who prays or prophesies with a veil on his head reflects a dishonour on Christ, whose representative he is."

- Attempt 1 BHT: When it comes to 1 Corinthians 11:4, the focus is primarily on the woman and her visible sign of subjection through wearing a veil. The Jewish tradition of wearing a veil or tallith, which signifies reverence and unworthiness before God, is contrasted with the Greek custom of being uncovered during worship. The man, on the other hand, is advised to have his head uncovered, reflecting his position of authority and ultimately honoring his spiritual Head, Christ. By covering his head, the man would dishonor Christ and obscure the glory that should be visible through the well-regulated order of marriage.
