## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "discourse flowing from the revelation and impulse of the Holy Spirit, which, not being attached to any particular office in the church, but improvised, disclosed the depths of the human heart and of the divine counsel, and thus was exceedingly effectual for the enlightening, exhortation, and consolation of believers, and the winning of unbelievers."
2. "the power of distinguishing between the operation of the Spirit of God and the evil spirit, or the unassisted human spirit"
3. "the power of uttering, in ecstasy, as the mouthpiece of the Spirit, prayer and praise in languages unknown to the utterer."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Miracles of special and extraordinary POWER."
2. "The inspired disclosure of the future."
3. "The power of speaking various languages: also a spiritual language unknown to man, uttered in ecstasy."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It is clear from all this that there was a difference even among those who had the power of working miracles, and that this power was conferred in a more eminent degree on some than on others."
2. "Though all people have understanding, memory, imagination, bodily strength, etc., yet one has these in a more eminent degree than others; and one is characterized for the possession of one of those qualities more than for another. Yet all are bestowed by the same God."
3. "It would appear possible that some might have had the power of speaking foreign languages who were not themselves apprized of the meaning, and that interpreters were needful in order to express the sense to the hearers."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Discerning between the different prophetic utterances, whether they proceed from true or false spirits." 
2. "It was an ecstatic utterance, unintelligible to the hearers, and requiring interpretation, or a corresponding ecstatic condition on the part of the hearer in order to understand it." 
3. "Being recognized distinctly as a gift of the Spirit, it must be inferred that it contributed in some way to the edification of the Church; but it led to occasional disorderly outbreaks."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Discernings of spirits (Œ¥ŒπŒ±Œ∫œÅŒπœÉŒµŒπœÇ œÄŒΩŒµœÖŒºŒ±œÑœâŒΩ). A most needed gift to tell whether the gifts were really of the Holy Spirit and supernatural or merely strange though natural or even diabolical."
2. "Divers kinds of tongues (Œ≥ŒµŒΩŒ∑ Œ≥ŒªœâœÉœÉœâŒΩ). The gift was essentially an ecstatic utterance of highly wrought emotion that edified the speaker and was intelligible to God."
3. "The interpretation of tongues (ŒµœÅŒºŒ∑ŒΩŒµŒπŒ± Œ≥ŒªœâœÉœÉœâŒΩ). In case there was no one present who understood the particular tongue it required a special gift of the Spirit to some one to interpret it if anyone was to receive benefit from it."

### John Gill:
1. "mighty deeds, wonderful works, such as are apparently above, and out of the reach of nature, and beyond the compass of human power and skill"
2. "a gift of understanding the prophecies of the Old Testament, and of preaching the Gospel"
3. "such that were possessed of it could, in some measure, discern the hearts of men, their thoughts, purposes, and designs, their secret dissimulation and hypocrisy"

### John Wesley:
1. "The discerning ‚Äî Whether men be of an upright spirit or no; whether they have natural or supernatural gifts for offices in the church; and whether they who profess to speak by inspiration speak from a divine, a natural, or a diabolical spirit."
2. "The working of other miracles. Prophecy ‚Äî Foretelling things to come."
3. "The discerning - ...whether they who profess to speak by inspiration speak from a divine, a natural, or a diabolical spirit."
