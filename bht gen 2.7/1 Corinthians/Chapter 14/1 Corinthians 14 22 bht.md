# 1 Corinthians 14:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Tongues are a sign for unbelievers, evidence of God's power and approval of the Gospel. This miraculous gift is intended to convince non-believers of the truth of Christianity. Prophecy, on the other hand, is for the edification and nourishment of believers. While tongues can condemn those who reject the message, prophesying has the power to convert non-believers and strengthen the faith of those who already believe. These spiritual gifts serve different purposes in sharing God's Word.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Tongues are (a sign) for the unbelieving, not for the believing."
2. "An unbeliever open to conviction."
3. "Prophecy, i.e. inspired and intelligent exposition of the word and doctrine, was eminently for believers, but... would be also profitable to unbelievers, furnishing a token that God was truly among his assembled servants."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Tongues" (unknown and uninterpreted) are not a sign mainly intended for believers, but mainly to be a condemnation to those who reject the sign and the accompanying message.
2. "Sign" is often used for a condemnatory sign.
3. Prophesying has no effect on unbelievers, but on those who are either in receptivity or already believers; it makes believers of those not wilfully unbelievers and spiritually nourishes those who already believe.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Tongues are for a sign, an evidence, or a proof that God has imparted this power, and that he attends the preaching of the gospel with his approbation."
2. "It is a miracle designed to convince them of the truth of the Christian religion."
3. "It is not so striking, so replete with proofs of the divine presence and power as the gift of tongues... It was, therefore, better adapted to edify the church than to convince gainsayers."

### John Calvin:
1. "You see, brethren, that what you so eagerly desire is not a blessing bestowed by God upon believers, but a punishment, by which he inflicts vengeance upon unbelievers."
2. "Tongues, in so far as they are given for a sign â€” that is, for a miracle â€” are appointed not properly for believers, but for unbelievers."
3. "The Corinthians brought forward that gift improperly and out of its right place, allowing prophecy in the meantime to be neglected, which was peculiarly and specially set apart for believers."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Wherefore tongues are for a sign, not to them that believe, but to the unbelieving who, on hearing their own language spoken by those who themselves understood it not, would be filled with awe." 
2. "Prophesying is for a sign, not to the unbelieving, but to them that believe."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1.  For a sign (ÎµÎ¹Ï‚ ÏƒÎ·Î¼ÎµÎ¹Î¿Î½). Like the Hebrew and occasional Koine idiom also. 


### John Gill:
1. "Wherefore tongues are for a sign,.... Of wrath and punishment inflicted on a rebellious and unbelieving people."
2. "But if these words refer to all that is said before on this subject, the word 'sign' may be taken for a miracle."
3. "Prophesying serveth not for them that believe not; that is, not for them only; for prophesying or explaining the prophetic writings, or preaching the word, may be, and often is, the means of converting unbelievers."

### John Wesley:
1. "Tongues are intended for a sign to unbelievers - To engage their attention, and convince them the message is of God."
2. "Whereas prophecy is not so much for unbelievers, as for the confirmation of them that already believe."

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: Tongues are primarily a sign for unbelievers, serving as evidence and proof of God's power and endorsement of the Gospel. This gift is designed to convince non-believers of the truth of the Christian religion, as they witness the miraculous ability to speak and understand unknown languages. However, prophecy is intended for believers, providing inspired and intelligent teaching and nourishment for those who are receptive to the message. While tongues may awe and condemn those who reject the sign, prophesying has the power to make believers out of those who are not willfully unbelieving. Thus, tongues and prophecy each serve distinct purposes in the spread of God's Word.
