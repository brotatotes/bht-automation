### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: The believers in the Corinthian church were reminded by Paul that they were not only individuals called by God, but collectively they formed the temple of God. This building was not a physical structure, but rather the dwelling place of God's Spirit. This concept was not new, as in the Old Testament, God's dwelling place was the temple. However, now, in the New Testament, God's dwelling place is in the congregation of believers, referred to as living stones, where the Holy Spirit resides. Christians are called to be pure and holy, as they are the temple of God and His residence is among them.
