# 2 Corinthians 1:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As believers, we share in Christ's sufferings and are consoled because He is our Head. Though there is no comparison between His sufferings and ours, Christ calls our sufferings His own due to the mystical union between Him and us. We become partners with Christ in suffering, and this partnership brings us into fellowship with His glory. Our sufferings may be many, but the singular consolation we receive through Christ overflows and overwhelms them all.
