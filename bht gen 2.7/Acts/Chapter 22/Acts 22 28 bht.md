## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "But I (besides having the privilege like thee of being a Roman citizen) was also born one." 
2. "How was Paul a Roman citizen by birth? Certainly not because he was of Tarsus: for (1) that city had no such privilege... and (2) if this had been so, the mention of his being a man of Tarsus would have prevented his being scourged."
3. "It remains, therefore, that his father or some ancestor must have obtained the civitas, either as a reward for service or by purchase."

2. "But to put in a false claim to this privilege was a capital crime." 
3. "I was free bornâ€”born to it, by purchase, or in reward of services, on the part of his father or some ancestor."

### Albert Barnes:

3. "Later, it was sold for a trifle."

### John Calvin:
1. "Whereas Paul maketh answer, that he was free born, who never saw the city, yea, whose father it may be was never there, there is no cause why this should trouble any man."
2. "For those who are skillful in the Roman history know that certain were made free of the city who dwelt in the provinces, if, having deserved well of the commonwealth, or in war, or in other weighty affairs, they did desire and crave this reward of the deputies, [proconsuls]"
3. "Notwithstanding, I think that the chief captain was afraid because Paul was bound at his commandment, that he might be scourged, because this was to do injury to the body of a citizen of Rome, and to break the common liberty, and that [although] it was lawful to put a Roman in prison."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "obtained I this citizenship; the word, as Plumptre well remarks, expressing not the transition from bondage to freedom, but from the position of an alien to that of a citizen."
2. "Under the first CÃ¦sars the freedom of Rome was obtained with great difficulty, and cost a large sum of money."

2. "There is calm and simple dignity in this reply and pardonable pride."

- Attempt 1 BHT: The apostle Paul, when confronted by the tribune about his Roman citizenship, confidently responds But I (besides having the privilege like thee of being a Roman citizen) was also born one. This is not merely a boast, for Roman citizenship was not easily obtained during that time period. The purchase of Roman citizenship was a significant investment and was often obtained only at a great cost and with great difficulty. It is likely that Paul's Roman citizenship was either obtained as a reward for service or by purchase by his father or some ancestor. This privileged status is reflected in Paul's interactions with various authorities and his ability to navigate the political and social landscape with ease. As Christians, we can learn from Paul's example that we are not obligated to give up our civil privileges, but rather should strive to protect and preserve them for future generations.
