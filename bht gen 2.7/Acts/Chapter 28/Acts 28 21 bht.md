## BHT:
Before his appeal, the Jews in Jud√¶a had no definite reason to communicate with the Jews in Rome about Paul. Even after his appeal, it would have been hardly possible to send messengers before him.

It is doubtful that there was any dishonest concealment here.

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: Paul, before his appeal, seemed to have had no reason to communicate with the Jews in Rome about himself. Even after his appeal, it would have been nearly impossible for word to have reached them before he did. However, Paul expressed his anxiety to hear any tidings that might have come from Jerusalem, indicating his sincerity. Despite this, it seems that no information about Paul had reached Rome, and the Jews there claimed to have never heard about him. It is doubtful that there was any dishonest concealment here. The Jews may not have forwarded the accusation against Paul to their brethren in Rome, possibly perceiving their cause as hopeless. It is disingenuous for them to deny any knowledge of Paul's reputation among the rulers. Nevertheless, this denial carries weight and serves as a testimony to Paul's innocence.
