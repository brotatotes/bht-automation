## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "á¼€Î´ÎµÎ»Ï†Î¿Î¯, still softening his tone, and reminding them of their oneness of blood and covenant with the speaker."
2. "There need be no difficulty in the application of the á¼„Î³Î½Î¿Î¹Î± to even the rulers of the Jews. It admits of all degrees from the unlearned, who were implicitly led by others, and hated Him because others did, up to the most learned of the scribes, who knew and rightly interpreted the Messianic prophecies, but from moral blindness, or perverted expectations, did not recognize them in our Lord."
3. "Even Caiaphas himself, of whom apparently this could least be said, may be brought under it in some measure: even he could hardly have delivered over Jesus to Pilate with the full consciousness that He was the Messiah, and that he himself was accomplishing prophecy by so doing."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Our preacher, like his Master, 'will not break the bruised reed.'"
2. "His heaviest charges are prompted by love, which now hastens to assuage the wounds it was necessary to inflict."
3. "I wotâ€”'know.'"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He regarded them as of the same nation with himself; as having the same hopes, and as being entitled to the same privileges. The expression also shows that he was not disposed to exalt himself as being by nature more holy than they." 
2. "People are melted to contrition, not by reproaches, but by love."
3. "Ignorance, therefore, is a circumstance which must always be taken into view in an estimate of crime. It is at the same time true that they had opportunity to know that he was the Messiah, but the mere fact that they were ignorant of it was still a mitigating circumstance in the estimate of their crime."

### John Calvin:
1. "We must so temper our sermons that they may profit the hearers, for unless there be some hope of pardon left, the terror and fear of punishment doth harden menâ€™s hearts with stubbornness." 
2. "Thus doth Peter lessen the sin of his nation, because of their ignorance; for it had been impossible for them to have suffered and endured this conscience if they had denied the Son of God, and delivered him to be slain, wittingly and willingly."
3. "But a question may be moved here, if any man have offended wittingly and willingly, whether he shall surely fall into despair or not? I answer, that he doth not make mention in this place of all manner of sin; but only of the denying of Christ, and of the extinguishing of the grace of God, so much as in them did lie."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "And now, brethren."
2. "Through ignorance ye did it."
