# Acts 7:49 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Stephen's defense asserts that the temple cannot confine God's presence, emphasizing the universal and spiritual nature of Christianity. This challenges the Jewish limitations placed on the worship of God. Jesus taught that God is a spirit and can be worshipped anywhere, not just in a physical temple. The temple served as a symbol, but God's true dwelling transcends any human structure. Heaven is his throne, earth his footstool, making no house sufficient for his presence.

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: Stephen, in his defense, refers to Isaiah and affirms that the temple cannot contain God's presence. His argument highlights the universality and spirituality of Christianity, which is not restricted by Jewish limitations. Jesus himself emphasized that God is a spirit and can be worshipped anywhere, by anyone. This profound truth incensed the Sanhedrin, as it challenged their traditional beliefs. Ultimately, the temple was meant to be a sign of God's presence for the faithful, who ascend to him in heart and worship him spiritually. However, it is important not to create a worldly and carnal concept of God that keeps our minds fixed on earthly matters. Instead, we should strive to rise up in faith to a spiritual understanding of his presence. We must acknowledge that heaven is his throne, where his glory is most evident, while earth is his footstool, subject to his authority. In light of this, Stephen questions the necessity of a physical house for God. Truly, God is not limited to any human construction because he encompasses the entire expanse of heaven and earth.
