## BHT:
Baptism symbolizes the burial of the old life and the resurrection to new life in Christ. Through faith, believers put their trust in God's power and are spiritually raised.

Ultimately, baptism is a powerful picture of the change brought about by faith in the heart.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "the process itself of baptism is regarded as the burial of the former life: originally, perhaps, owing to the practice of immersion."
2. "The things represented by both figures belong to the essentials of the Christian life: the minor details of the sacrament which corresponded to them, may in different ages or climates be varied; but the spiritual figures remain."
3. "Surely it is dogmatically exact to say that Faith is the hand by which we lay hold on Christ the Ark of our refuge."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Baptism is regarded as the burial of the old carnal life, to which the act of immersion symbolically corresponds;...to insist on literal immersion in all cases would be mere legal ceremonialism." 
2. "Faith in God's mighty operation in raising again Jesus is saving faith...the same mighty power of God is exercised in raising one spiritually dead to the life of faith."
3. "As His literal resurrection is the ground of the power put forth in our spiritual resurrection now, so it is a pledge of our literal resurrection hereafter."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Buried with him in baptism..."
2. "Ye are risen with him - From the death of sin to the life of religion..."
3. "Through the faith of the operation of God - By a firm belief on the agency of God in raising him up..."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Ye were raised with Him...the raising is not the resurrection to eternal life at Christ's second coming, but the moral resurrection to a new life." 
2. "The emphasis which is laid on faith in the resurrection."
3. "vers. 11, 12 should be compared with Romans 6:2-6."

### John Calvin:
1. "Christ, says he, accomplishes in us spiritual circumcision, not through means of that ancient sign, which was in force under Moses, but by baptism."
2. "By baptism, therefore, we are buried with Christ, because Christ does at the same time accomplish efficaciously that mortification, which he there represents, that the reality may be conjoined with the sign."
3. "He adds, by faith, for unquestionably it is by it that we receive what is presented to us in baptism. But what faith ? That of his efficacy or operation, by which he means, that faith is founded upon the power of God."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The fellowship with Christ finds its sign and seal in the rite of baptism, which, as then administered, had its external resemblance to the burial and resurrection of Christ."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "For all who in the rite of baptism are plunged under the water, thereby declare that they put faith in the expiatory death of Christ for the pardon of their past sins." 
2. "In the symbol of baptism the resurrection to new life in Christ is pictured with an allusion to Christ's own resurrection and to our final resurrection." 
3. "Baptism gives a picture of the change already wrought in the heart 'through faith'."

### John Gill:
1. "Christ having died for their sins, was laid in the grave, where he continued for a while, and then rose again; and as they were crucified with him, they were also buried with him, as their head and representative; and all their sins too, which he left behind him in the grave, signified by his grave clothes there; and baptism being performed by immersion, when the person baptized is covered with water, and as it were buried in it, is a very significant emblem of all this."
2. "This shows now, that baptism was performed by dipping, or covering the whole body in water, for no other form of administration of baptism, as sprinkling, or pouring water on the face, can represent a burial, or be called one."
3. "it is through faith that saints see themselves buried and risen with Christ, to which the ordinance of baptism is greatly assisting, where there is true faith; for otherwise, without faith, this ordinance will be of no use to any such end and purpose; and it is not any faith that will avail, but that which is of God's operation; faith is not naturally in men, all men have it not; and those that have it, have it not of themselves, it is the gift of God; it is what be works in them, and by his power performs"

### John Wesley:
1. "The ancient manner of baptizing by immersion is as manifestly alluded to here, as the other manner of baptizing by sprinkling or pouring of water is." 
2. "But no stress is laid on the age of the baptized, or the manner of performing it, in one or the other; but only on our being risen with Christ, through the powerful operation of God in the soul."
3. "It does not appear, that in all this St. Paul speaks of justification at all, but of sanctification altogether."
