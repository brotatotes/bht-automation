# Ephesians 5:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In Christ's case, His headship over the church is uniquely connected to His role as the Savior of the body, distinct from any other form of headship. While a husband may be the head of his wife, this does not entail the same salvific role that Christ fulfills for His church. Christ's headship and salvation are inseparable, as He provides, preserves, and protects the body of believers.

- Attempt 1 BHT: In Christ's case, His headship over the church is uniquely connected to His role as the Savior of the body, distinct from any other form of headship. While a husband may be the head of his wife, this does not entail the same salvific role that Christ fulfills for His church. Christ's headship and salvation are inseparable, as He provides, preserves, and protects the body of believers. The husband's authority over the wife is a reflection of Christ's authority over the church, but it is the subjection to this authority that brings the wife comfort and spiritual benefit. Just as the church is saved through its submission to Christ, the wife's refusal to submit to her husband's authority is a rejection of the salvation and blessings that come with it.
