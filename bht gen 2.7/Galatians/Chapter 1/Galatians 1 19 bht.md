# Galatians 1:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
James, the Lord's brother, one of the Twelve apostles, is the only one Paul saw during his visit. He is not strictly Jesus' brother but rather a cousin or kinsman. Paul's mention of James as an apostle shows his equality with the Twelve and counters the attacks of the Judaizers. Notably, this James is not the same as James the son of Zebedee, who was still alive at that time.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "That James, the Lordâ€™s brother, was one of the Twelve, and the only one besides Peter whom Paul saw at this visit."
2. "After the choosing of the Twelve, the á¼€Î´ÎµÎ»Ï†Î¿Î¯ of our Lord did not believe on Him."
3. "We must then adopt (2): which is besides in consonance with other notices respecting the term á¼€Ï€ÏŒÏƒÏ„Î¿Î»Î¿Ï‚, and the person heve mentioned."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "James, the Lord's brotherâ€”This designation, to distinguish him from James the son of Zebedee, was appropriate while that apostle was alive. But before Paul's second visit to Jerusalem (Galatians 2:1; Acts 15:1-4), he had been beheaded by Herod (Acts 12:2). Accordingly, in the subsequent mention of James here (Galatians 2:9; Galatians 2:12), he is not designated by this distinctive epithet: a minute, undesigned coincidence, and proof of genuineness."
2. "James was the Lord's brother, not in our strict sense, but in the sense, 'cousin,' or 'kinsman' (Matthew 28:10; John 20:17). His brethren are never called 'sons of Joseph,' which they would have been had they been the Lord's brothers strictly."
3. "It is not likely there would be two pairs of brothers named alike, of such eminence as James and Jude; the likelihood is that the apostles James and Jude are also the writers of the Epistles, and the brethren of Jesus."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Of these, James the brother of John was slain by Herod Acts 12:2, and the other continued to reside in Jerusalem, Acts 15:13; Acts 21:13. This latter James was called James the Less Mark 15:40, to distinguish him from the other James, probably because he was the younger."
2. "It is probable that this was the James referred to here, as it is evident from the Acts of the Apostles that he was a prominent man among the apostles in Jerusalem."
3. "The word 'brother' may, according to Scriptural usage, be understood as denoting a near kinsman."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Not, I saw none other of the apostles, but I saw James." 
2. "The Lord's brother means that James was a son of Joseph and Mary." 
3. "The explanations which differ from that of Helvidius have grown, largely, out of the desire to maintain the perpetual virginity of Mary."

### John Calvin:
1. "Almost all the ancients are agreed that he was one of the disciples, whose surname was 'Oblias' and 'The Just', and that he presided over the church at Jerusalem."
2. "Nor is there any force in the defense offered by Jerome, that the word Apostle is sometimes applied to others besides the twelve; for the subject under consideration is the highest rank of apostleship, and we shall presently see that he was considered one of the chief pillars."
3. "The rest of the apostles, there is reason to believe, were scattered through various countries; for they did not idly remain in one place."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The James here spoken of is not James the elder, the son of Zebedee and Salome, and brother of St. John...but the same who...presided over the congregation of Jerusalem"
2. "The exceptive words 'but only'...intimates...that he was...an Apostle only in the wider sense, who, owing to his character, position, and relationship to the Lord, enjoyed apostolical authority."
3. "To distinguish him from the two Apostles of that name. 'Brother' is not cousin (for which Paul has the proper Greek term)...but either a uterine brother, i.e., a younger son of Joseph and Mary; or a son of Joseph from a previous marriage, and hence a step-son of Mary and a step-brother of Jesus."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "James, brother of the Lord, is here termed an apostle, though not one of the twelve as Barnabas is later so called."
2. "Paul is showing his independence of and equality with the twelve in answer to the attacks of the Judaizers."
3. "James the son of Zebedee was still living at that time."

### John Gill:
1. "as he did not receive the Gospel from Peter, so neither from any of the other apostles, whom he did not so much as see, much less converse with"
2. "this James was James the less, the son of Mary the wife of Cleophas, which Cleophas was the brother of Joseph, the husband of Mary the mother of our Lord"
3. "nor is James one of our Lord's disciples being called his brother, any contradiction to John 7:5 as the Jew affirms, where it is said, 'neither did his brethren believe in him'; since they might not believe in him then, and yet believe in him afterwards"

### John Wesley:
1. "But other of the apostles I saw none, save James the brother (that is, the kinsman) of the Lord."
2. "Therefore when Barnabas is said to have 'brought him into the apostles,' Acts 9:27, only St. Peter and St James are meant."

- Attempt 1 BHT: James, the Lord's brother, mentioned in Galatians 1:19, was one of the Twelve and one of the few apostles Paul saw during his visit. This James is distinguished from James the son of Zebedee, who was beheaded by Herod before Paul's second visit to Jerusalem. He is not strictly the physical brother of Jesus but rather a cousin or kinsman. Some believe that James, along with Jude, may have been the writer of the Epistles. Paul's mention of James as an apostle shows his independence and equality with the Twelve, countering the attacks of the Judaizers. It is important to note that this James is not the same as James the son of Zebedee, who was still alive at that time.
