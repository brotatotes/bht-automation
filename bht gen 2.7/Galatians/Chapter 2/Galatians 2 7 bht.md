# Galatians 2:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The leaders of the early Church approved of Paul's independent course of preaching the Gospel of the uncircumcision to the Gentiles. They recognized that he was entrusted with this specific task, while Peter was entrusted with the Gospel of the circumcision for the Jews. This division of labor was not a difference in type of Gospel, but a distinction of spheres. Both divisions preached the same Gospel, and there was a clear agreement among the leaders regarding this assignment.
