## BHT:
The promise made to Abraham and his seed primarily referred to Christ, who would unite both Jew and Gentile as fellow heirs.

All believers, vitally united to Christ, are part of the true spiritual Israel and inherit the blessings promised through Him.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The covenant was not merely nor principally made with Abraham, but with Abraham and HIS SEED, and that seed referred, not to the Jewish people, but to CHRIST."
2. "The central point of the Apostle’s argument is this: The seed to whom the promises were made, was Christ."
3. "Christ contains His people, and the mention even of the personal Christ would bring with it, in the Apostle’s mind, the inclusion of His believing people."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Christ not having come when the law was given, the covenant could not have been then fulfilled, but awaited the coming of Him, the Seed, to whom it was spoken."
2. "The promise that in Him 'all the families of the earth shall be blessed' joins in this one Seed, Christ, Jew and Gentile, as fellow heirs on the same terms of acceptability, namely, by grace through faith."
3. "God makes His covenant of promise with the one seed, Christ, and embraces others only as they are identified with, and represented by, Christ."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He designs evidently to be understood as affirming that in the use of the singular number σπέρμα sperma (seed), instead of the plural σπέρματα spermata (seeds), there is a fair ground of argument to demonstrate that the promise related to Christ or the Messiah, and to him primarily if not exclusively."
2. "...the promise made to Abraham Genesis 22:18, 'and in thy seed זרץ zera‛, Septuagint ἐν τῷ σπέρματί σου en tō spermarti sou), where the words both in Hebrew and in Greek are in the singular number) shall all the nations of the earth be blessed,' cannot refer to all the seed or the posterity of Abraham taken collectively."
3. "The promise was indeed at first general, and the term used was of the most general nature; but it was shown from time to time that God intended that it should be applied only to one branch or portion of the family of Abraham; and that limitation was finally so made as to terminate in the Messiah."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Even a man's covenant remains uncancelled and without additions. Similarly, God 's covenant - promises to Abraham remain valid; and this is made certain by the fact that the promises were given not only to Abraham but to his seed; and since the singular, seed, is used, and not seeds, it is evident that Christ is meant."
2. "There can be no disannulling by the law of a promise made not only to Abraham, but to his seed."
3. "The original promise referred to the posterity of Abraham generally, and therefore applies to Christ individually only as representing these : as gathering up into one all who should be incorporated with him."

### John Calvin:
1. "But if Christ be the foundation of the bargain, it follows that it is of free grace; and this too is the meaning of the word promise."
2. "Let them answer me then; how comes it that the thirteen tribes sprung from the twelve patriarchs were the seed of Abraham, in preference to Ishmaelites and Edomites? Why do they exclusively glory in that name, and set aside the others as a spurious seed?"
3. "We have ascertained, then, that we are all cursed by nature, and that the blessing of Abraham has been promised to all nations. Do all indiscriminately reach it? Certainly not, but those only who are 'gathered' to the Messiah; for when, under His government and direction, they are collected into one body, they then become one people."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The promised inheritance refers evidently in its next and literal sense to the land of Canaan, but in its deeper spiritual sense to the kingdom of Christ."
2. "The seed of Abraham comprehends, therefore, not only the Israelites under Moses and Joshua, but above all Christ and his people as the true spiritual Israel who enter into that heavenly rest."
3. "The seed includes, therefore, all true believers who are vitally united to Christ."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "But as of one (αλλ' ως εφ' ενος). But as in the case of one."
2. "But the promise to Abraham uses σπερμα as a collective substantive and applies to all believers (both Jews and Gentiles) as Paul has shown in verses Galatians 3:7-14."
3. "Here Paul uses a rabbinical refinement which is yet intelligible. The people of Israel were a type of the Messiah and he gathers up the promise in its special application to Christ."

### John Gill:
1. "The promises design the promises of the covenant of grace mentioned in the next verse, which are exceeding great and precious, better than those of any other covenant; and which are all yea and amen in Christ, and are chiefly of a spiritual nature."
2. "The promises here intended principally are such as these, that God will be their God, and they shall be his people, the promise of Christ as a Saviour and Redeemer of them; of the Spirit as their sanctifier, and the applier of all grace unto them; of justification by Christ's righteousness, and pardon by his blood; of adoption through free rich grace; of perseverance in grace, and of the eternal inheritance."
3. "but Christ mystical, the church, which is the body of Christ, of which he is the head, and is called by his name, 1 Corinthians 12:12 and designs all Abraham's spiritual seed, both Jews and Gentiles; who are all one in Christ, and so Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise."

### John Wesley:
1. "The chief of all, and which was several times repeated, was that of the blessing through Christ."
2. "But as of one — That is, one kind of seed, one posterity, one kind of sons. And to all these the blessing belonged by promise."
3. "Which is Christ — including all that believe in him. Genesis 22:18."
