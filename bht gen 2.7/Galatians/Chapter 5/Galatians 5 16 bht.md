# Galatians 5:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Walk in the Spirit, not in the flesh. The desires of the flesh, the cravings and longings of our corrupt nature, are contrary to the leading of the Spirit. As Christians, we should submit to the influences of the Holy Spirit and allow Him to guide our actions and behavior. The Holy Spirit and the flesh are constantly at odds with each other, and by choosing to follow the Spirit, we resist the desires of the flesh.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "πνεύματι, the normal dative, of the rule, or manner, after or in which: Meyer quotes Hom. II. ο.194, οὔτι Διὸς βέομαι φρεσίν: by the Spirit. But πν. is not man’s ‘spiritual part,’ as Beza, Rück., De W., al.; nor is πνεύματι ‘after a spiritual manner,’ Peile, nor will ἡ ἐνοικοῦσα χάρις give the force of πνεῦμα (Thdrt.): it is (as in Gal 5:5) the Holy Spirit of God: this will be clear on comparing with our Galatians 5:16-18, the more expanded parallel passage, Rom 7:22 to Romans 8:11."
2. "σαρκός ] the natural man: that whole state of being in the flesh, out of which spring the practices and thoughts of Galatians 5:19."
3. "Is this (1) merely future in meaning, and a sequence on πνεύματι περιπ., ‘and ye shall not fulfil,’ or is it (2) imperative, ‘and fulfil not?’ Ellic. in his note has shewn that this latter meaning is allowable, it being doubtful even in classical Greek whether there are not some instances of οὐ μή with the second person subjunctive imperatively used, and the tendency of later Greek being rather to use the subjunctive aorist for the future. And Meyer defends it on exegetical grounds. But surely (1) is much to be preferred on these same grounds. For the next and following verses go to show just what this verse will then assert, viz. that the Spirit and the flesh exclude one another."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The best way to keep tares out of a bushel is to fill it with wheat."
2. "The spirit and the flesh mutually exclude one another."
3. "The gentle dove trembles at the sight even of a hawk's feather."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The Christian life is often represented as a journey, and the word walk, in the scripture, is often equivalent to live."
2. "If a man would yield his heart to those influences, he would be able to overcome all his carnal propensities."
3. "The only way to overcome the corrupt desires and propensities of our nature is by submitting to the influences of the Holy Spirit."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Walk [περιπατειτε] . Frequent in a metaphorical sense for habitual conduct."
2. "In the Spirit [πνευματι] . Rather, by the Spirit, as the rule of action."
3. "The lust [επιθυμιαν] . Frequent in Paul, and usually in a bad sense; but see Philippians 1:23; 1 Thessalonians 2:17, and comp. Luke 22:15."

### John Calvin:
1. "The Galatians are indirectly told, that they are carnal, destitute of the Spirit of God, and that the life which they lead is unworthy of Christians..."
2. "This, he tells them, is an evidence that they do not walk according to the Spirit."
3. "The spiritual man may be frequently assaulted by the lusts of the flesh, but fulfill them, — he does not permit them to reign over him."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Walk by the Spirit, according to the rule and direction of the Holy Spirit who is the higher conscience and controlling principle of the Christian."
2. "The Holy Spirit and the sinful flesh are so antagonistic and irreconcilable that to follow the one is to resist and defeat the other."
3. "The antagonism between the carnal nature of man and the Holy Spirit of God is one of the fundamental ideas in Paul’s psychology."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Ye will not fulfill." 
2. "The lust of the flesh. The word is just craving or longing."
3. "The word is just craving or longing."

### John Gill:
1. "Walk in the Spirit, that is, either after the Spirit of God; making the word inspired by him the rule of behaviour."
2. "Taking him himself for a guide, who not only guides into all truth, but in the way of holiness and righteousness unto the land of uprightness."
3. "And depending upon his grace and strength for assistance throughout the whole of our walk and conversation."

### John Wesley:
1. "Walk by the Spirit — Follow his guidance in all things."
2. "And fulfil not — In anything."
3. "The desire of the flesh — Of corrupt nature."
