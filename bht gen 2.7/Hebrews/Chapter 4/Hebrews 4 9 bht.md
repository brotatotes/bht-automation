# Hebrews 4:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Therefore, as Christians, we are called to enter into a deeper and more profound rest - a Sabbath rest. Just as God rested from His works after creation and as Jesus entered into this rest, so too are we invited to enter into this divine rest through our faith in Christ. This rest goes beyond the physical rest of the weekly Sabbath and the temporary rest in the Promised Land.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Therefore there remains a keeping of sabbath as regards the word, it is only found, besides here, in Plut. de Superstitione, c. 3, ὦ βάρβαροι ἐξευρόντες, Ἕλληνες κακὰ τῇ δεισιδαιμονίᾳ, πηλώσεις, καταβορβορώσεις, σαββατισμούς, ῥίψεις ἐπὶ πρόσωπον, αισχρὰς προκαθέσεις, ἀλλοκότους προσκυνήσεις."
2. "For he that has entered into his (God’s) rest, has himself also rested from his (own) works, like as God rested from his own."
3. "For He that entered into his (own or God’s) rest, Himself also rested from His works like as God rested from His own: and therefore, from our Forerunner having entered into this sabbatism, it is reserved for us, the people of God, to enter into it with and because of Him."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "God's rest was a Sabbatism; so also will ours be."
2. "The 'rest' in this Hebrews 4:9 is the nobler and more exalted (Hebrew) 'Sabbath' rest; literally, 'cessation': rest from work when finished."
3. "The whole renovated creation shall share in it; nothing will there be to break the Sabbath of eternity; and the Triune God shall rejoice in the work of His hands."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "That heaven is a place of cessation from wearisome toil."
2. "Heaven will be like a Sabbath. The best description of it is to say it is 'an eternal Sabbath.'"
3. "Let those who love the Sabbath rejoice in the prospect of eternal rest in heaven."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Man's portion in the divine rest inaugurated at creation has never been really appropriated : but it still remaineth."
2. "The Sabbath rest points back to God's original rest, and marks the ideal rest - the rest of perfect adjustment of all things to God."
3. "The Sabbath-rest is the consummation of the new creation in Christ, through whose priestly mediation reconciliation with God will come to pass."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Therefore there remains (still unrealized in any rest that Israel then enjoyed) a sacred rest, a Sabbath-rest (the word is now changed), for the people of God."
2. "The use of the word Sabbath in this sense for the rest which God provides under the Gospel was quite familiar to the Jews."
3. "Into that rest all enter who believe."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "A sabbath rest (σαββατισμος). Late word from σαββατιζω...to keep the Sabbath, apparently coined by the author."
2. "Here it is parallel with καταπαυσις."
3. "For the people of God (τω λαω του θεου). Dative case of blessed personal interest to the true Israel."

### John Gill:

2. "Rather this intends the spiritual rest believers have in Christ under the Gospel dispensation, which they now enter into."
