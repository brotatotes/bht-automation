# Hebrews 5:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The appointment of Jesus as High Priest was not an act of self-glorification, but a divine appointment by the Father who declared Him as His Son. This appointment was intricately connected to Jesus' eternal generation as the Son, and the process of His exaltation through suffering was the work of the Father. Jesus did not assume the honor of the priesthood on His own, but it was the Father who nominated Him to this prestigious role.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Thus Christ also (as well as those others) did not glorify HIMSELF to be made High Priest, but He (i. e. the Father) who spake to Him, Thou art my son, I have this day begotten thee."
2. "It must be carefully observed, that the Writer does not adduce this text as containing a direct proof of Christ‚Äôs divine appointment to the High Priesthood: that follows in the next verse: nor again, does it merely assert, without any close connexion, that the same Divine Person appointed Him High Priest, who said to Him 'Thou art my Son': but it asserts, that such divine appointment was wrapped up and already involved in that eternal generation to the Sonship which was declared in these words."
3. "The true account seems to be this: the word ·ºêŒ¥œåŒæŒ±œÉŒµŒΩ contains in it the whole process of exaltation (through suffering) by which the Lord Jesus has attained the heavenly High Priesthood. This whole process was not his own work, but the Father‚Äôs, John 8:54."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "did not assume the glory of the priestly office of Himself without the call of God"
2. "the Father glorified Him or appointed Him to the priesthood"
3. "On His Sonship depended His glorification, and His being called of God as Priest"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Jesus was not ambitious; that he did not obtrude himself into the great office of high priest; he did not enter upon its duties without being regularly called to it."
2. "He received his appointment from him. This was decisive in the case, and this was sufficient, if it could be made out, for the only claim which Aaron and his successors could have to the office, was the fact that they had received their appointment from God."
3. "The propriety of this application is founded on the fact that the language in the Psalm is of so general a character, that it may be applied to 'any' exaltation of the Redeemer, or to any honor conferred on him."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "He did not glorify himself, but God who styled him 'son' glorified him."
2. "Thou art my Son is introduced thus in close connection with the call to the priesthood, in recognition of the fact that the priesthood of Christ had its basis in his sonship."
3. "Christ's priestly vocation ceases to be an accident in his history, and becomes an essential characteristic of his position as Son: sonship, christhood, priestliness, inseparably interwoven."

### John Calvin:
1. "The begetting of Christ, of which the Psalmist speaks, was a testimony which the Father rendered to him before men. Therefore the mutual relation between the Father and the Son is not what is here intended; but regard is rather had to men to whom he was manifested."
2. "Now, what sort of Son did God manifest to us? One indued with no honor, with no power? Nay, one who was to be a Mediator between himself and man; his begetting then included his priesthood."
3. "Christ did not make himself a high priest but God. And the reason why he speaks of God as having said 'My Son,' etc., seems to be this, ‚Äî to show that he who made him king made him also a high priest."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "These requisites of the high priests are all found in Christ, and found in Him in such a degree as proves Him to be superior to all others."
2. "He it was that made Him Priest, and made Him Priest in the very passage that speaks of Him as 'Son;' the 'Only-begotten.'"
3. "Others who regard the quotation as giving honour to the Son without making that honour an assertion of His Priesthood, interpret simply Christ did not Himself assume the office of Priest; God who acknowledges Him as His Son in a sense that raises Him above all creatures, God gives Him the office."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Jesus had divine appointment as high priest also."
2. "God did glorify Jesus in appointing him priest."
3. "Clearly the Father nominated the Son to the Messianic priesthood."

### John Gill:
1. "It was a glorifying of Christ, to make him an high priest; not as God, for as such no addition can be made to his glory."
2. "It was an honour to the human nature to be united to the Son of God; and to be separated from others to this office; and to be called unto it, qualified for it, and invested with it."
3. "Christ did not take this high and honourable office to himself, nor the glory of it; indeed, he did not receive it from man, nor was he made a priest according to the ceremonial law; yet he did not intrude himself into this office."

### John Wesley:
1. "Christ glorified not himself to be an high priest...did not take this honour to himself, but received it from him." 
2. "Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee - Not, indeed, at the same time; for his generation was from eternity." 
3. "Psalm 2:7."

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: The verse reveals that Jesus did not appoint Himself as High Priest, but it was the Father who had spoken to Him and declared Him as His Son. The divine appointment of Jesus to the priesthood was not a separate act, but was already involved in His eternal generation as the Son. The word glorify encompasses the entire process by which Jesus attained the heavenly High Priesthood, and this process was the work of the Father. The divine appointment of Jesus to the priesthood was intricately connected to His sonship. Ultimately, the Father's nomination of Jesus to the Messianic priesthood is evident, and Jesus did not assume this great honor on His own accord, but it was God who glorified and appointed Him to be the High Priest.
