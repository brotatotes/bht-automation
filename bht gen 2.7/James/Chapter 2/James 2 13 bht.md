### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: In James 2:13, the apostle conveys the equitable principle that there will be a judgment conducted on fair principles. However, the merciful will be triumphantly acquitted from this judgment because their acts of mercy towards others are empowered by God's own mercy towards them. This divine mercy, personified as an influential force, interposes and prevails over judgment. It is the mercy of God that covers and defends us when we deserve condemnation. Therefore, it is crucial for us to extend mercy towards others if we expect to receive mercy from God. This mercy, clothed in divine glory, triumphs over justice and graciously saves us from the dread and terror of judgment.
