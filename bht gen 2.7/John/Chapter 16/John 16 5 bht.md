2. "And when Christ had suggested to his disciples, that he was going to his Father's house, to prepare mansions for them, they did not seem to understand him, John 14:2."
3. "Nor did they ask what he meant by his Father's house, or what those mansions were he was going to prepare; and what the glory was he was going to possess for himself and them; they ask neither about the place he was going to, nor the way to it, nor the happiness to be enjoyed there."

### John Wesley:
1. None of you asketh me â€” Now when it is most seasonable. Peter did ask this before, John 13:36.
