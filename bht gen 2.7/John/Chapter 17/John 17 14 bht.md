# John 17:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Jesus prays for his followers, not just as individuals but as representatives of all believers. They are in the world but not of the world. When they conform to worldly standards, they fail to make a difference. The world hates them because they have received and proclaim the Father's word. In the face of persecution, believers can trust that God will protect them as they defend the Gospel.

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: Jesus prays for his followers, not just in his time, but for believers from every age. Though they are still in the world, they are not of the world, having been transformed by Christ. He sends them into the world, but they must maintain their distinctiveness and not conform to its values. When Christians fail to differentiate themselves, the world cannot see the difference or the benefit of the change. Believers face hatred from the world because they have received and proclaim the word of the Father. This identification with Christ means that they share in his peace, joy, and work. In the face of persecution, believers can trust that God will protect them and not abandon those who defend the Gospel.
