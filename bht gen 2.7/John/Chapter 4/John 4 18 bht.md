## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Notice it is ·ºÄŒªŒ∑Œ∏Œ≠œÇ, not ·ºÄŒªŒ∑Œ∏·ø∂œÇ: this one word was true: further shewn by the emphatic position of ·ºÑŒΩŒ¥œÅŒ± in our Lord‚Äôs answer."
2. "These five were certainly lawful husbands; they are distinguished from the sixth, who was not; probably the woman had been separated from some by divorce (the law of which was but loose among the Samaritans), from some by death, or perhaps by other reasons more or less discreditable to her character, which had now become degraded into that of an openly licentious woman."
3. "The conviction of sin here lies beneath the surface: it is not pressed, nor at the moment does it seem to have worked deeply, for she goes on with the conversation with apparent indifference to it; but our Lord‚Äôs words in John 4:25-26 would tend to infix it more deeply."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "You are not lawfully married to him."
2. "Either she might have left a former husband without divorce, and thus her marriage with this man was unlawful."
3. "She was living with him without the form of marriage, in open guilt."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The ‚Äòfive‚Äô were no doubt lawful husbands, from whom she had been separated either by death or by divorce."
2. "In contrast with the lawful marriages is set the present unlawful union with one who was no husband."
3. "Her life was sinful: in what degree we cannot learn from this brief statement. An age in which divorce was freely allowed cannot be judged by the same rules as one of stricter principles."

### John Gill:
1. "For thou hast had five husbands... Or rather, she had had so many, and had been divorced from everyone of them, for adultery... and the rather this may seem to be the case, as Dr. Lightfoot observes; since these husbands are mentioned, as well as he with whom she lived in an adulterous manner; and which suggests, that she had not lived honestly with them."
2. "he whom thou now hast, is not thy husband; that is, not thy lawful husband... though they cohabited as man and wife, when there was no such relation between them."
3. "Christ the omniscient God, who knew her full well, and the whole of her past infamous conversation, and her present lewd and wicked way of living, exposes all unto her."

### John Wesley:
1. Thou hast had five husbands ‚Äî Whether they were all dead or not, her own conscience now awakened would tell her.

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: In John 4:18, Jesus reveals to the Samaritan woman that she has had five husbands and the man she is currently with is not her lawful husband. These husbands may have been separated from her through divorce, death, or other discreditable circumstances, leading to her degraded reputation as an openly licentious woman. Though the woman initially appears indifferent to Jesus' conviction of her sin, his words would later deeply impact her. It is evident that her life has been marked by sinful choices, but the extent of her guilt is not explicitly stated. However, it is clear that the present union she is in is unlawful, contrasting with the five lawful marriages she had before. Through his omniscience, Jesus exposes her past and present actions, leading her to confront her conscience and consider the truth of his words.
