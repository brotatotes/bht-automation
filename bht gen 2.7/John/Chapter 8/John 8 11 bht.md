## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Albert Barnes:
1. "Neither do I condemn thee - This is evidently to be taken in the sense of judicial condemnation, or of passing sentence as a magistrate, for this was what they had arraigned her for."
2. "Go, and sin no more - You have sinned. You have been detected and accused. The sin is great. But I do not claim power to condemn you to die, and, as your accusers have left you, my direction to you is that you sin no more."
3. "Jesus was endowed with wonderful wisdom in meeting the devices of his enemies, and eluding their deep-laid plans to involve him in ruin."

### John Calvin:
1. "We are not told that Christ absolutely acquitted the woman, but that he allowed her to go at liberty."
2. "While Christ forgives the sins of men, he does not overturn political order, or reverse the sentences and punishments appointed by the laws."
3. "The design of the grace of Christ is that the sinner, being reconciled to God, may honor the Author of his salvation by a good and holy life."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The language, it will be observed, is not a sentence of acquittal: it is rather an intimation to the woman that she has still space given her for repentance and faith."
2. "Let her use her opportunities, and profit by the tender compassion of Him who drew publicans and sinners to His side, then will still more gracious words be addressed to her."
3. "The narrative has lived on through all ages of the Church as an illustration, not less striking than any other recorded in the Gospels, of that Divine wisdom with which Jesus knew how to combine what human wisdom has never been able to unite, condemnation of sin, and free and unrestricted mercy to the sinner."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "No one, Sir." She makes no excuse for her sin. Does she recognize Jesus as 'Lord'?
2. "Jesus does not condone her sin...but he does give the poor woman another chance."
3. "Jesus clearly felt that even a wicked woman can be saved."

### John Gill:
1. "Christ came not into the world to act the part of a civil magistrate, ... nor did he come into the world to condemn it, but that the world, through him, might be saved" 
2. "Our Lord manifested a regard, even to the law of Moses, when he bid this woman's accusers that were without sin, to cast the first stone at her" 
3. "As for himself, his office was not that of a civil magistrate, but of a Saviour and Redeemer; and suitably to that he acted in this case; he did not connive at the sin, he reproved for it; nor did he deny that she ought to suffer according to the law of Moses, but rather suggests she ought; but as this was not his province, he did not take upon him to pronounce any sentence of condemnation on her; but called her to repentance, and, as the merciful and compassionate Saviour, gave her reason to hope pardon and eternal life."

### John Wesley:
1. Neither do I condemn thee â€” Neither do I take upon me to pass any such sentence. Let this deliverance lead thee to repentance.
