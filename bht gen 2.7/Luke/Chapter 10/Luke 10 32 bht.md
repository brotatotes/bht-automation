# Luke 10:32 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Levite, an inferior minister of the law, did even worse than the priest in coming near to the wounded man. While he came and saw the condition of the man, he passed by without offering any aid. The Levites, responsible for religious duties, resembled the beadle of their time, observing but not taking action. The law, without any leniency, leaves a wounded soul uncovered, exposing the wounds of sin and providing no relief or transformation.

- Attempt 1 BHT: The Levite, an inferior minister of the law, did even worse than the priest in Luke 10:32. While he also came and saw the wounded man, he came near and then passed, seemingly implying that he went farther than the priest in coming near but did nothing to relieve him. The Levites, responsible for the duties of religion and the temple service, were like the beadle of their time, engaged in the service of the temple just as the Levite observed the wounded man but did not offer assistance. The law makes no allowances for the weakness of man, offering no relief for a wounded and naked soul, only opening the wounds of sin, filling the conscience with wrath and terror, and leaving one in their pre-existing state.
