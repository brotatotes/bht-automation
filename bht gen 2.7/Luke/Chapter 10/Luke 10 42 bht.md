## BHT:
Underneath lies the idea that the elaborate preparations and present life are insignificant compared to another. Although a Church full of Marys or Marthas could be detrimental, both are needed as complements. The best dish is fellowship with Jesus, and salvation is not the only important aspect. Jesus takes Mary's side against Martha's fussiness. Religion or piety is the one necessary thing, surpassing worldly affairs. Mary's choice of undivided devotion to Jesus' words and faith in him is eternal, offering a lasting portion.

2. "The hospitality of Martha was faulty in this respect, that she neglected the main business, and devoted herself entirely to household affairs.

3. "Christ only declares, that Mary is engaged in a holy and profitable employment, in which she ought not to be disturbed... for an opportunity so favorable is not always in her power."

2. "God himself is said to be the portion of his people, and a good one he is, and a portion that lasts for ever; and so is Christ."
3. "Faith which comes by hearing of the word, and so every other grace of the Spirit is what can never be lost; nor an interest in God, as a covenant God, or in Christ as a Saviour, nor a right and title to, nor meetness for eternal life, nor that itself, can be taken away, or the believer ever be deprived thereof."

### John Wesley:
1. Mary hath chosen the good part â€” To save her soul. Reader, hast thou?
