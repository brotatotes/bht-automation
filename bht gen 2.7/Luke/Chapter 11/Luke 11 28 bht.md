# Luke 11:28 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The authenticity of Christ's reply points to its historical nature. Jesus shifts the focus from himself to others, pronouncing blessedness on those who hear and keep the word of God. This surpasses the blessedness of being related to Christ in the flesh alone. Merely hearing the word without obedience holds little value, whereas true blessedness comes from both hearing and keeping the word. Jesus' mother herself would have forfeited her blessedness if she hadn't followed suit.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Philip Schaff:
1. "The ground of her blessedness, as in the case of all the human race, unto whom in the highest sense, 'a child is born, a son is given,' is that she too belonged to them that hear the word of God and keep it." 
2. "This woman truly represents devout Roman Catholics in their Adoration of the Virgin."
3. "His answer gives prominence not to His own word, but to â€˜the word of God;â€™ for though they are the same, the woman was thinking solely of His human birth, and not of His heavenly Father; and this mistake He would correct."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The originality of Christ's reply guarantees its historical character."
