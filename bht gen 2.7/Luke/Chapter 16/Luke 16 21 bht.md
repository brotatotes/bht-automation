## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "It would seem that he did obtain this wish, and that, as in ch. Luke 15:16, the ·ºêœÄŒπŒ∏. must mean, he looked for it, willingly took it."
2. "The ·ºÄŒªŒª·Ω∞ Œ∫Œ±ŒØ seems also to imply, that he got the crumbs: this verse, relating the two points of contrast to the rich man: his only food, the crumbs, with which he longed to fill his belly, but could not."
3. "His only clothing, nakedness and sores, and instead of the boon companions of the rich man, none to pity him but the dogs, who ·ºêœÄŒ≠ŒªŒµŒπœáŒøŒΩ certainly in pity, not ‚Äòdolorem exasperantes‚Äô (Bengel) his sores, as they do their own."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

### Marvin Vincent:

### John Calvin:
1. "There can be no doubt that those dogs were guided by the secret purpose of God, to condemn that man by their example."
2. "What could be more monstrous than to see the dogs taking charge of a man, to whom his neighbor is paying no attention; and, what is more, to see the very crumbs of bread refused to a man perishing of hunger, while the dogs are giving him the service of their tongues for the purpose of healing his sores?"
3. "When strangers, or even brute animals, supply our place, by performing an office which ought rather to have been discharged by ourselves, let us conclude that they are so many witnesses and judges appointed by God, to make our criminality the more manifest."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The crumbs which fell, lit, ‚Äòthe things which fell;‚Äô the best authorities omitting ‚Äòcrumbs.‚Äô These would scarcely satisfy him ; in any case the rich man gave himself no concern about the matter."
2. "Yea, even the dogs came and licked his sores. The dogs sought the same portion, but even they alleviated his pain by licking his sores."
3. "The pity of the wild and masterless dogs is contrasted with the indifference of the rich man."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The language reminds one of Luke 15:16 (the prodigal son) and the Syro-Phoenician woman (Mark 7:28)."
2. "If he means that he was dependent on casual scraps and it was so bad that even the wild dogs moreover were his companions in misery, the climax came that he was able to drive away the dogs."
3. "It is not clear whether the licking of the sores by the dogs added to the misery of Lazarus or gave a measure of comfort, as he lay in his helpless condition."
