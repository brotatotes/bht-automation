### John Gill:
1. "They are many, that are cleansed by the blood of Christ; his blood was shed for many, for the remission of sins; and by his righteousness, he justifies many; at least there are many who profess themselves to be cleansed by him, and yet there are but few that glorify him."

3. "Instances of gratitude are few, but as one in ten; now and then a single Samaritan, a stranger, one that has been a vile sinner, comes and acknowledges the grace of Christ in cleansing him; comes to the ministers of Christ, and to the churches, and tells them what God has done for his soul."

- Attempt 1 BHT: Were all ten not cleansed? Yet, where are the other nine? This serves as a reminder of Christ's omniscience, as He knew that only one out of the ten lepers had returned to give thanks. It is a prophetic illustration of the reception that Christ would receive from the Jews and the Gentiles. Although they had some gratitude, they lacked the personal gratitude that manifests in love. While they had enough faith to receive physical healing, it remains uncertain if they received any spiritual benefit. Many are cleansed by the blood of Christ, but only a few truly glorify Him. The flock of Christ, separated from the world, is but a small group, a remnant that remains faithful to Gospel order. Instances of genuine gratitude are rare, like the one in ten lepers who returned to acknowledge God's grace in their lives, sharing their testimony with churches and ministers.
