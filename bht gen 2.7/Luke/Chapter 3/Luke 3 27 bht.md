### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: In Luke 3:27, we see the name Salathiel mentioned, and it is noted that in Matthew 1:12, Salathiel is mentioned in relation to Jeconiah. This implies a possible connection between the genealogies in the two Gospels. Some speculate that this could be due to a Levirate marriage or Salathiel marrying a daughter of Neri.

Deeper exploration of this lineage reveals that Salathiel is the same person as Shealthiel mentioned in 1 Chronicles 3:19.
