# Luke 4:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The devil tempts Jesus by omitting a crucial phrase from Psalm 91:11, distorting its meaning. Without the phrase to keep thee in all thy ways, the devil seeks to justify his malicious intentions. However, by twisting the scripture, he fails to realize that the genuine sense of God's providence and protection remains unchanged. Satan's attempt to tempt Jesus into an unwarranted and sinful action is ultimately futile.
