# Luke 6:43 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
A good tree cannot produce corrupt fruit, just as one's life filled with evil cannot genuinely teach others.

False teachers, who claim to be good but produce corrupt fruit, are not truly good. This statement reminds us to evaluate both teachers and believers by the consistent goodness of their lives, not by merely hollow pretenses.

1. "For as that cannot be called a good tree, which brings forth bad fruit; so such men cannot be accounted good men, let them make ever so large pretensions to such a character, who are very busy in espying, discovering, and censuring the faults of their brethren."
2. "These words, with what follow in this, and the next verse, and the similes in them, are used by our Lord in Matthew, on account of false prophets or teachers; where he suggests, that as good and faithful ministers of the Gospel cannot, and do, not bring forth, and publish corrupt notions, and false doctrines... even usual, nor can it be, that a good tree should bring forth corrupt fruit; so, neither doth a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit."
3. "True believers... do not bring forth the evil fruit of sin, as the common and constant course of their lives and conversations; for that they never commit sin, or are entirely without it, cannot be said; but sin is not their usual and common practice, or they do not live in sin."
