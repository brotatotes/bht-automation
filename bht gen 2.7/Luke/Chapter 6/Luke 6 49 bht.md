# Luke 6:49 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The one who builds without a foundation is like a man who builds upon the sand. When the storm comes, his house collapses, resulting in a ruin. Without a secure foundation, the crash is catastrophic, resounding like the fall of a giant oak. On the contrary, the one who hears the word and builds upon the earth is secure and grounded.
