# Mark 13:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The repetition in the verse brings a sense of majesty to the discourse. The beginnings of sorrows are likened to the pains of a woman in labor, signifying that these troubles are only the beginning, leading up to something much greater. These troubles, such as rival claimants for the imperial purple and convulsions of the Roman world, would pale in comparison to the immense afflictions that would precede and accompany the destruction of Jerusalem. These afflictions would include public tumults, seditions, and murders. The word troubles is omitted in some versions, but it highlights the various forms of public distress that would occur.
