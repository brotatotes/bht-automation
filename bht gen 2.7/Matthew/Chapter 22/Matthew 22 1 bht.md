## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Albert Barnes:
1. "He made a still further statement, to show how the gospel would be received and treated by them."
2. "The real answer here, as is frequently the case in the New Testament, refers to what was passing in the mind, or to the conduct of those who were addressed, not to what they said."
3. "He answered or made reply to the Pharisees, who had been enraged at him for what he had already spoken to them."

### John Calvin:
1. "The design which Matthew had in view was, to point out the reasons why the scribes were excited to the highest pitch of fury."
2. "It is by no means probable, that the guest and friend of a Pharisee broke out into this exclamation from any sincere feeling of piety."
3. "He did not employ the phrase, eat bread, as a metaphor for enjoy eternal life, but appears to have dreamed of I know not what state, filled with prosperity and abundance of all things."

### Philip Schaff:
1. Matthew 22:1. Answered. See above.
	
 Again in parables; not necessarily, in a number of parables, but in parabolic discourse.
	


### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Some scholars consider this merely Matthew's version of the Lucan parable in the wrong place because of Matthew's habit of grouping the sayings of Jesus."
2. "But that is a gratuitous indictment of Matthew's report which definitely locates the parable here by Ï€Î±Î»Î¹Î½."
3. "Some regard it as not spoken by Jesus at all, but an effort on the part of the writer to cover the sin and fate of the Jews, the calling of the Gentiles, and God's demand for righteousness."

### John Gill:
1. "And Jesus answered and spake unto them again,.... Not to the multitude only, but to the chief priests, elders, Scribes, and Pharisees..."
2. "or if the chief priests and elders did go away, the Pharisees remained behind, as is clear from Matthew 22:15 to whom he spake by parables, similitudes, and comparisons, taken from earthly things..."
3. "and against whom he directed the following one; and said, as hereafter related."
