## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The interpretation is, the great marriage supper (Rev 19:9) of the Son of God: i.e. His full and complete union to His Bride the Church in glory: which would be to the guests the ultimate result of accepting the invitation." (Commentary)
2. "The difficulty, of the totality of the guests in this case constituting the Bride, may be lessened by regarding the ceremony as an enthronization, in which the people are regarded as being espoused to their prince." (Commentary)
3. "On the whole imagery, cf. Psalms 45:1-17." (Commentary)

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "In this parable...the Lord is revealing Himself in ever clearer light as the central Person of the kingdom, giving here a far plainer hint than in the last parable of the nobility of His descent." 
2. "The last was a parable of the Old Testament history; and Christ is rather the last and greatest of the line of its prophets and teachers than the founder of a new kingdom. In that, God appears demanding something from men; in this, a parable of grace, God appears more as giving something to them."
3. "These apparent contradictions (see on :-20) are resolved in this parable; and Jesus, in claiming to be this King's Son, serves Himself Heir to all that the prophets and sweet singers of Israel held forth as to Jehovah's ineffably near and endearing union to His people."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "God deals with man in his kingdom, or in regard to the dispensation of the gospel, as a certain king did." 
2. "This parable refers, undoubtedly, to the rejection of the Jews and to the calling of the Gentiles."
3. "The gospel, with all its privileges, was offered to the Jewish people; but through their wickedness and pride they rejected it, and all its blessings were offered to the Gentiles and accepted."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Made a marriage [ÎµÏ€Î¿Î¹Î·ÏƒÎµÎ½] . But the phrase refers to the marriage - feast, rather than to the marriage - ceremony. In Esther 9:22, the word is used of feasting without any reference to a marriage. Rev., a marriage - feast.


### John Calvin:
1. "There is no room to doubt that the discourse is expressly levelled against the Jews, as will more plainly appear a little afterwards."
2. "God bestowed on the Jews distinguished honor, by providing for them, as it were, a hospitable table; but they despised the honor which had been conferred upon them."
3. "It is true that those who were first invited did not live till the coming of Christ; but we know that all received an offer of the same salvation, of which they were deprived by their ingratitude and malice."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "A marriage feast for his son. [...] It was Christâ€™s marriage, i.e., with His covenant people, according to the imager of the Old Testament."
2. "See, also, in the New Testament where the Church is the Bride, and this marriage feast is the union of Christ and His Church in glory."
3. "Believers, as individuals, are guests, the Church as an ideal whole is the Bride."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The plural [marriage feasts], as here (Matthew 22:2; Matthew 22:3; Matthew 22:4; Matthew 22:9), is very common in the papyri for the wedding festivities (the several acts of feasting) which lasted for days, seven in Judges 14:17."
2. "The very phrase here, Î³Î±Î¼Î¿Ï…Ï‚ Ï€Î¿Î¹ÎµÎ¹Î½, occurs in the Doric of Thera about B.C. 200."
3. "The singular Î³Î±Î¼Î¿Ï‚ is common in the papyri for the wedding contract, but Field (Notes, p. 16) sees no difference between the singular here in Matthew 22:8 and the plural (see also Genesis 29:22; Esther 9:22; Macc. 10:58)."

### John Gill:
1. "The design of which is to express the great love of God the Father, who is represented by this certain king, in espousing any of the children of men to his own son."
2. "The view of it is to set forth the plenteous provisions of grace made under the Gospel dispensation in the word and ordinances."
3. "The person that contracted this relation between them, is the Father of Christ, who chose them for him to be his spouse and bride."

### John Wesley:
