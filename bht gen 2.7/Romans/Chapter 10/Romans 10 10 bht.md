# Romans 10:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Faith and confession are integral to salvation. Belief with the heart is not simply intellectual, but a mode of thinking guided by testimony or mediation. Confession is when faith proclaims the glory and grace of the Lord. Confession serves as a test of discipleship, especially in times of persecution. While faith leads to justification, confession is made for final salvation. Both faith and confession play instrumental roles in the process of salvation.

### John Gill:
1. "True faith does not lie in the bare assent of the mind to the Gospel, or any truth contained in it, respecting the person and office of Christ, so neither does it lie, as not in the brain, so not in the tongue, but in the heart."
2. "The use of this grace is, 'unto righteousness'; it is not instead of one, for faith is not our righteousness; nor is it in order to work out one, for this grace puts a soul on renouncing its own righteousness; but its use is to receive one, even the righteousness of Christ."
3. "This confession must be made both by words and facts, must be open, visible, and before men; and also real, hearty, and sincere, the words of the mouth agreeing with the experience of the heart."

### John Wesley:
1. "For with the heart ‚Äî Not the understanding only."
2. "Man believeth to righteousness ‚Äî So as to obtain justification."
3. "And with the mouth confession is made ‚Äî So as to obtain final salvation."
