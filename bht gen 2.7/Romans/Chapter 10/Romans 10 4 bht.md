# Romans 10:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Christ is the ultimate fulfillment and aim of the law. He ended the law as a method of salvation, putting a stop to its legislative authority. Through faith in Christ, we achieve the same end in regard to justification that would be accomplished through perfect obedience to the moral law. Christ is the termination of the law and it is through him that we are justified and receive the righteousness that the law points to but cannot provide.
