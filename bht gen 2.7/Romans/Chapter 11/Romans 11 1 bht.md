# Romans 11:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Paul vehemently objects to the idea of God casting away His people, asserting his own Israelite heritage as evidence against such a notion. He affirms that God has not rejected Israel entirely, neither now nor in the future, emphasizing that the restoration of the Jewish people will come as a Christian believing nation. Therefore, God's covenant with Israel remains intact and will be fulfilled on a national level rather than through the individual conversion of Jews.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Be it not so: for I also am an Israelite, of the seed of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin."
2. "It is against this that he puts in his strong protest. It is this which he disproves by a cogent historical parallel from Scripture, shewing that there is a remnant Œ∫Œ±·Ω∂ ·ºêŒΩ œÑ·ø∑ ŒΩ·ø¶ŒΩ Œ∫Œ±ŒπœÅ·ø∑ according to the election of grace."
3. "Thus the covenant of God with Israel, having been national, shall ultimately be fulfilled to them as a nation: not by the gathering in merely of individual Jews, or of all the Jews individually, into the Christian church, but by the national restoration of the Jews, not in unbelief, but as a Christian believing nation."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "I say then, Hath‚Äî'Did' God cast away his people? God forbid"
2. "Yet here the apostle teaches that, in two respects, Israel was not 'cast away'; First, Not totally; Second, Not finally."
3. "for I also am an Israelite‚ÄîSee Philippians 3:5, and so a living witness to the contrary."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Has God so renounced them that they cannot be any longer his people...God forbid."
2. "If I should say that all Jews must be excluded from the favor of God, then I also must be without hope of salvation, for I am a Jew."
3. "The Jews valued themselves much on having been descended from so illustrious an ancestor as Abraham...Paul shows them that he was entitled to all the privileges of such a descent."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Surely God has not, has He?"
2. "The verb means literally to thrust or shove."
3. "Paul adduces his own case first, to show that God has not rejected His people en masse."

### John Calvin:
1. "He so modifies what he had previously said respecting the repudiation of the Jews, that no one might think that the covenant formerly made with Abraham is now abrogated."
2. "That it should fail through any perfidiousness of men, was wholly unreasonable; for Paul holds this as a fixed principle, that since adoption is gratuitous and based on God alone and not on men, it stands firm and inviolable."
3. "He proves, in passing, by his own example, how unreasonable it was to think that the nation was utterly forsaken by God; for he himself was in his origin an Israelite, not a proselyte."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The divine act of casting off from Himself is not viewed as the cause... but as the penal consequence, of the disdaining God‚Äôs loving will" - Meyer

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Did God cast off? (ŒºŒ∑ Œ±œÄœâœÉŒ±œÑŒø Œø Œ∏ŒµŒøœÉ?). An indignant negative answer is called for by ŒºŒ∑ and emphasized by ŒºŒ∑ Œ≥ŒµŒΩŒøŒπœÑŒø (God forbid)."
2. "For I also (Œ∫Œ± Œ≥Œ±œÅ ŒµŒ≥œâ). Proof that not all the Jews have rejected Christ."
3. "See Philippians 3:5 for more of Paul's pedigree."

### John Gill:
1. "God forbid, when anything was objected which was displeasing to him, abhorred by him, which was not agreeable to the perfections of God, to the truth of his word, and promises, and could by no means be admitted of."
2. "for God had chosen him unto eternal salvation, Christ had redeemed him by his blood, and he was effectually called by grace; and as to his eternal state, he had no doubt or scruple about it."
3. "and yet he was one of the nation of the Jews, and therefore God had not cast them all away, as the objection insinuates."

### John Wesley:
1. Hath God rejected his whole people ‚Äî All Israel? In no wise. Now there is "a remnant" who believe, Romans 11:5; and hereafter "all Israel will be saved," Romans 11:26.

- Attempt 1 BHT: In Romans 11:1, Paul vehemently refutes the idea that God has completely rejected his people, the Israelites. He cites himself as a living example, being an Israelite from the tribe of Benjamin. Paul argues that God's covenant with Israel will ultimately be fulfilled not by the gathering of individual Jews into the Christian church, but by the national restoration of the Jews as a Christian believing nation. Furthermore, he emphasizes that Israel was not cast away totally or finally by God. The rejection of the Jews as a nation was consistent with God's promises to their fathers, and it does not imply the abrogation of the covenant made with Abraham.
