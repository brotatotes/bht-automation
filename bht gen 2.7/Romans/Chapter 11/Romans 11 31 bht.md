# Romans 11:31 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The apostle Paul discusses the unbelief of the Jews, which opened the way for the faith of the Gentiles. However, he also speaks of the mercy shown to the Gentiles as a means of Israel's eventual recovery. Through the believing Gentiles, the nation of Israel will come to acknowledge Jesus and receive mercy. God's purpose is for the Jews to receive a blessing yet, and this will be accomplished through the mercy shown to the Gentiles.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The apostle has hitherto dwelt upon the unbelief of the Jews as making way for the faith of the Gentilesâ€”the exclusion of the one occasioning the reception of the other; a truth yielding to generous, believing Gentiles but mingled satisfaction."
2. "Now, opening a more cheering prospect, he speaks of the mercy shown to the Gentiles as a means of Israel's recovery."
3. "It will be by the instrumentality of believing Gentiles that Israel as a nation is at length to 'look on Him whom they have pierced and mourn for Him,' and so to 'obtain mercy.'"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The immediate effect of the unbelief of the Jews was to confer salvation on the Gentiles, or to open the way for the preaching of the gospel to them."
2. "Each party should thus cause salvation to come to the other - the Jews to the Gentiles by their unbelief; but the Gentiles, in their turn, to the Jews by their belief."
3. "Christians shall be moved with deep compassion for the degraded and forsaken Jews, and they shall be called into the kingdom of God, and made efficient agents in extending the gospel through the whole world."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Have these (Jews) now, since the gospel of Christ was preached, been disobedient."
2. "That, in order that, by the mercy shown to you (lit. 'your mercy;') they also may now obtain mercy."
3. "The leading thought of the section (Romans 11:11) is here repeated, in the final summing up."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "By the mercy shown to you." 
2. "God's purpose is for the Jews to receive a blessing yet."

### John Gill:
1. "Now is the time of the Jews' unbelief, blindness has happened to them, the vail is over their hearts."
2. "They do not believe God in Christ; nor that he is the Father of Christ; or that Christ is the Son of God, the true Messiah, and Saviour of the world."
3. "The apostle's argument in favour of the call and conversion of the Jews, upon the whole is this, that since the unbelief of the Gentiles was no bar to their obtaining mercy, and that through the infidelity of the Jews; then it cannot be thought, that the present blindness, hardness of heart, enmity, and unbelief, which now attend the Jews, can be any obstacle to their obtaining mercy in the same way the Gentiles have; but as the one has been, the other also will be."
