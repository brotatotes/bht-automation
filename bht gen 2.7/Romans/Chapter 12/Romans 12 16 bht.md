- Attempt 1 BHT: Let us strive to foster a spirit of humility and solidarity with one another, rather than one of haughtiness, knowing that this is pleasing to God. We ought to be drawn towards those who are lowly, not aspiring after worldly ambitions, but rather cherishing lowly things and sympathizing with those in positions of low estate. It is important that we think the same thing, not seeking our own interests above others, and not being wise in our own estimation. Instead, we should direct our minds towards what is lowly and be content with humble circumstances. By doing so, we reflect the virtue of moderation, which honors others and helps to combat arrogance.
