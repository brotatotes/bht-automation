## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "By that Saviour whose name is alike dear to all of us and whose unsearchable riches I live only to proclaim, and by that love one to another which the blessed Spirit diffuses through all the brotherhood, making the labors of Christ's servants a matter of common interest to all‚ÄîI beseech you." 
2. "that ye strive together with me in your prayers to God for me"
3. "implying that he had his grounds for anxious fear in this matter."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "For the Lord Jesus Christ‚Äôs sake - [...] in order to promote his honor and glory, and to extend his kingdom among people."
2. "And for the love of the Spirit - [...] I beseech you now to manifest that love by praying earnestly for me."
3. "That ye strive together with me - That you unite with me in earnest prayer. The word 'strive' denotes intense 'agony' or effort, such as was used by the wrestlers in the Greek games; and then the 'agony,' or strong effort, which a man makes in prayer, who is earnestly desirous to be heard."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Strive together [œÉœÖŒΩŒ±Œ≥œâŒΩŒπœÉŒ±œÉŒ∏Œ±Œπ] . The simple verb is used of contending in the games, and implies strenuous effort. Here earnest prayer.


### John Calvin:
1. "He shows how grieved his godly mind was, by the earnest protestation he makes, in which he adds to the name of the Lord, the love of the Spirit, by which the saints ought to embrace one another."
2. "Since then it is so great a favor from God to be helped by the prayers of the faithful, that even Paul, a most choice instrument of God, did not think it right to neglect this privilege, how great must be our stupidity, if we, who are abject and worthless creatures, disregard it?"
3. "And indeed if our strength is derived from prayer to God, we can in no better way confirm our brethren, than by praying to God for them."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "By our Lord Jesus Christ, and by the love of the Spirit. 'For' is incorrect in both cases; 'through' is the literal sense, with the same force as in chap. Romans 12:1, presenting a motive."
2. "'Love of the Spirit' is that affection wrought by the Holy Spirit. Between Paul and the mass of his readers personally unknown to him, only such a love could be urged as a motive. It is more extended than personal affection."
3. "That ye strive together with me (the figure is that of a contest in the games) in your prayers, etc. 'Your' brings out the force of the article; the possessive pronoun, though found in some authorities, must be rejected."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The intermediate agents of the exhortation (the Lord Jesus and the love of the Spirit) as Œ¥ŒπŒ± is used after œÄŒ±œÅŒ±Œ∫Œ±Œªœâ in Romans 12:1."
2. "That ye strive together with me (œÉœÖŒΩŒ±Œ≥œâŒΩŒπœÉŒ±œÉŒ∏Œ± ŒºŒø)."
3. "For Christ's agony in prayer see Matthew 26:42; Luke 22:44."

### John Gill:
1. "For Christ's sake; whose servant he was, and in whose cause he was engaged, whose Gospel he preached, and whose glory he sought"
2. "For the love of the Spirit"
3. "That ye strive together with me in your prayers to God for me"

### John Wesley:
1. "I beseech you by the love of the Spirit ‚Äî That is, by the love which is the genuine fruit of the Spirit."
2. "To strive together with me in your prayers ‚Äî He must pray himself, who would have others strive together with him in prayer."
3. "Of all the apostles, St. Paul alone is recorded to desire the prayers of the faithful for himself."
