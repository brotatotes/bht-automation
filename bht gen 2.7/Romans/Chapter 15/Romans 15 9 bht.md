3. "The promise, 'In thee shall the nations of the earth be blessed,' was made to Abraham, and not to the Gentiles.

3. "What is here said by the Messiah to God, is that he would 'confess to him among the Gentiles'; which is to be understood not of confession of sin, or of a confession of faith in him; but of praise and thanksgiving, a celebration of his perfections, particularly his grace, mercy, and goodness."
