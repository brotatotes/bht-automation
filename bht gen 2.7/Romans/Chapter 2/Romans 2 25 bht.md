# Romans 2:25 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Circumcision, the outward sign of being within the covenant, is only beneficial if one keeps the law. Otherwise, one is no better than an uncircumcised Gentile. True circumcision requires faith and obedience of the heart and life. External advantages, like being a Jew or participating in rituals, don't save a person. The unholy Jew essentially becomes a Gentile, as circumcision becomes uncircumcision, having no benefit. True circumcision and true spirituality are matters of the heart.
