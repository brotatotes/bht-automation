- Attempt 1 BHT: What advantage then has the Jew? If true Judaism and circumcision are purely spiritual and the final judgment will be based on the state of the heart, what profit is there in external Jewish practices and ceremonial circumcision? This question arises as a natural response to the Apostle's previous indictment of the Jews in chapter 2. It is a pertinent question, given the argument that a Gentile who fulfills the requirements of the Law is treated as if circumcised. So, what is the benefit of circumcision? This question reflects the doubt about the purpose and significance of circumcision in separating the Jews from the Gentiles. It challenges the notion that a Jew has any advantage over a Gentile by birth or education. Ultimately, it points to the understanding that true circumcision is internal and spiritual, residing in the heart rather than in outward practices.
