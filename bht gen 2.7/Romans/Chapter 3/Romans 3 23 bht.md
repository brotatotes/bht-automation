# Romans 3:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
All people have sinned and fall short of the praise which comes from God. There is no difference between the best and the worst of humanity, for all have sinned and lack righteousness. Our sinful nature causes us to miss the mark and be separated from the glory of God. No one can earn God's approval by their own efforts. We are all deficient and in need of the righteousness that comes through faith.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "τῆς δόξης τοῦ θεοῦ ] Of the praise which comes from God"
2. "the Apostle is not speaking here of future reward, but of present worthiness"
3. "against both the usage of the word, and the context of the passage"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Though men differ greatly in the nature and extent of their sinfulness, there is absolutely no difference between the best and the worst of men, in the fact that 'all have sinned,' and so underlie the wrath of God."
2. "Have failed to earn His approbation."
3. "So the best interpreters."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "For all have sinned - This was the point which he had fully established in the discussion in these chapters."
2. "Have come short - Greek, 'Are deficient in regard to;' are lacking, etc."
3. "The glory of God - The praise or approbation of God. They had sought to be justified, or approved, by God; but all had failed."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "They sinned, and therefore they are lacking. See on Luke 14:14. The word is not merely equivalent to they are wanting in, but implies want under the aspect of shortcoming."
2. "The glory of God is used of the aggregate of the divine attributes and coincides with His self-revelation."
3. "The point under discussion is the want of righteousness. Unbelievers, or mere legalists, do not approve themselves before God by the righteousness which is of the law."

### John Calvin:
1. "There is no other way of attaining righteousness; for some cannot be justified in this and others in that way; but all must alike be justified by faith, because all are sinners, and therefore have nothing for which they can glory before God."
2. "There is then, according to what he teaches, no righteousness but what is perfect and absolute."

1. "For all sinned; this is the historical fact, they became sinners." 
2. "Fall short. As the result of their having become sinners." 
3. "Glory of God. This is variously explained as, glory before God, glory like God (in His image, showing His glory), glory from God."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Sinned (ηρμαρτον). This tense gathers up the whole race into one statement (a timeless aorist)."
2. "And fall short (κα υστερουντα). It is followed by the ablative case as here, the case of separation."
3. "Present middle indicative of υστερεω, to be υστερος (comparative) too late, continued action, still fall short."

### John Gill:
1. "all have sinned in Adam, are guilty by his sin, polluted with it, and condemned for it"
2. "there is no difference in the state and condition of men by nature"
3. "men, through sinning, come short of [eternal glory], and must of themselves do so for ever"

### John Wesley:
1. "For all have sinned — In Adam, and in their own persons; by a sinful nature, sinful tempers, and sinful actions."
2. "And are fallen short of the glory of God — The supreme end of man; short of his image on earth, and the enjoyment of him in heaven."
