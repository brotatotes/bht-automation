# Romans 4:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Abraham believed in God's promise even though it seemed impossible. He trusted that God, who can bring the dead to life, could overcome physical barriers and create what did not yet exist. By calling Abraham the father of many nations, God showed that his faith goes beyond physical descendants to include spiritual children. This illustrates God's power to name and speak of things that are not yet, bringing them into existence.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Abraham was the father of us all, though not physically, nor in actuality, seeing that we were not as yet, yet in the sight and estimation of God, in his relation with God, with whom no obstacles of nature or time have force."
2. "The peculiar excellence of Abrahamâ€™s faith, that it overleaped the obstacles of physical incapacity, and nonentity, and believed implicitly Godâ€™s promise."
3. "God calleth (nameth, speaketh of) the things that are not, as being (as if they were). This He did in the present case with regard to the seed of Abraham, which did not as yet exist."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Thus Abraham, in the reckoning of Him whom he believed, is the father of us all, in order that all may be assured, that doing as he did, they shall be treated as he was." (17. As it is written, &amp;c.â€”)
2. "The nature and greatness of that faith of Abraham which we are to copy is here strikingly described." (even God, quickeneth the deadâ€”)
3. "What he was required to believe being above nature, his faith had to fasten upon God's power to surmount physical incapacity, and call into being what did not then exist. But God having made the promise, Abraham believed Him in spite of those obstacles." (even God, quickeneth the deadâ€”)

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The argument of the apostle is founded in part on the fact that the past tense is used - I have made thee - and that God spoke of a thing as already done, which he had promised or purposed to do."
2. "The apostle evidently understands this promise as referring, not to his natural descendants only, but to the great multitude who should believe as he did."
3. "The giving of this promise, and its fulfillment, were such as strongly to remind us that God has power to give life to the dead."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The verb shows that the paternity was the result of a special arrangement. It would not be used to denote the mere physical connection between father and son."
2. "Who quickeneth the dead. This attribute of God is selected with special reference to the circumstances of Abraham as described in vers. 18, 21."
3. "The simplest explanation appears to be to give kalein the sense of nameth, speaketh of... The seed of Abraham 'which were at present in the category of things which were not, and the nations which should spring physically or spiritually from him, God spoke of as having an existence, which word Abraham believed."

### John Calvin:
1. "He who denies them to be capable of grace, does wrong to Abraham, whose faith was sustained by this thought, â€” that it matters not whether he was dead or not who is called by the Lord; to whom it is an easy thing, even by a word, to raise the dead through his own power."
2. "The character of the divine calling is, that they who are dead are raised by the Lord, that they who are nothing begin to be something through his power."
3. "The word 'call' ought not to be confined to preaching, but it is to be taken, according to the usage of Scripture, for raising up; and it is intended to set forth more fully the power of God, who raises up, as it were by a nod only, whom he wills."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The promise was of a spiritual seed."
2. "The pertinence of the quotation becomes obvious."
3. "God treats things... as if they do exist."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "A father of many nations. Only true in the sense of spiritual children as already explained, father of believers in God."
2. "Before him whom he believed even God. Incorporation of antecedent into the relative clause and attraction of the relative Ï‰ into Î¿Ï…."
3. "Calleth the things that are not as though they were. 'Summons the non-existing as existing.' God rejuvenated him and Sarah."

### John Gill:
1. "The passage referred to, is in Genesis 17:4; which proves him to be a father not of the Jews only, since they cannot be called 'many nations', but of the Gentiles also."
2. "The object of his faith is described as he, who quickeneth the dead: meaning either the dead body of Abraham and Sarah's womb; or Isaac, who was given up for dead; or the Gentiles, who were dead in trespasses and sins; or rather the dead bodies of men at the last day, a work which none but the almighty God can effect."
3. "he called Abraham the father of many nations, when he was not in fact, as if he really was; and the Gentiles his seed and offspring, before they were; and when he comes effectually to call them by his grace, they are represented as 'things which are not', whom he called, 'to bring to nought things that are'"


### John Wesley:
1. "Before God â€” Though before men nothing of this appeared, those nations being then unborn."
2. "The dead are not dead to him and even the things that are not, are before God."

- Attempt 1 BHT: In Romans 4:17, it is clear that God's estimation of Abraham, the father of us all, transcends physical and temporal limitations. Abraham's faith overcame physical barriers and trusted in God's promise, acknowledging that God can name and speak of things that are not yet, and bring them into existence. This faith in God's power to overcome obstacles is the essence of Abraham's example for believers. Through this faith, God called Abraham the father of many nations, emphasizing his spiritual progeny and not merely his physical descendants. God's ability to bring life to the dead is highlighted here, reminiscent of Abraham's situation in which he believed God's promise of an offspring despite his own physical incapacity and the nonexistence of the promised seed. This notion that God calls things that are not as though they were, or summons the non-existing as existing, is a key aspect of God's divine calling and power.
