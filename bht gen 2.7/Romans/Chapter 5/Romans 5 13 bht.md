# Romans 5:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Sin existed in the world before the law was given, but it was not counted as transgression without the law. God treated humanity as sinners even before the law was revealed, indicating the presence of a law during that time. Sin is not fully reckoned as transgression where there is no law, although sin still had consequences. Christ's atonement addresses even the inherited sinful nature of infants and those lacking understanding. (69 words)

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: Before the law was given, sin still existed in the world, but it was not counted as transgression because there was no formal law to hold people accountable. However, even without the Mosaic law, sin was still imputed and punishment was brought upon people. From the time of Adam until the law, God treated humanity as sinners, and there must have been a law in place because sin was imputed. Sin is not imputed when there is no law, meaning that without a formal law, sin is not fully reckoned as transgression. It is important to note that sin was present even before the Mosaic law, as both Jews and Gentiles were subject to sin. However, thanks to Christ's atoning death and grace, the sinful nature inherited by infants and idiots is dealt with. (91 words)
