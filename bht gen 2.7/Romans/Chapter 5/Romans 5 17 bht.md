## BHT:
Through the sin of one man, death reigned, but through Jesus Christ, we can reign in life.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Distinction the third , also in KIND; that which came in by the one sinner , was the reign of DEATH: that which shall come in by the One, Jesus Christ , will be a reigning in LIFE." 
2. "For (carrying on the argument from Romans 5:15 , but not so as to make parenthetical (Röthe) Rom 5:16 for δικαιοσύνης presupposes δικαίωμα ) if by the transgression of the one (man; the reading ἐν ( τῷ ) ἑνὶ παραπτώματι goes with ἁμαρτήματος for ἁμαρτήσαντος in Romans 5:16 ; both have evidently been corrections) death reigned by means of the one (man), much more (logical a fortiori ) shall they who receive the abundance of the grace and of the gift of righteousness (Romans 5:15 ; beware of the shallow and weakening notion, that it is “for τῆς δικαιοσύνης δεδωρημένης ”) reign in life (eternal) by means of the one (Man) Jesus Christ."
3. "ζωή is not only corporeal (the resurrection), but also spiritual and moral, as also in θάνατος we must include διὰ τῆς ἁμαρτίας Romans 5:12 . βασιλεύσουσιν is brought in by the antithesis: but it is elsewhere used (see reff.) to signify the state of blessedness, partly in an objective theocratic import (of the reign of the saints with Christ), partly in a subjective moral one, because reigning is the highest development of freedom, and the highest satisfaction of all desires.” De Wette."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Right to live"—"Righteous life"—life possessed and enjoyed with the good will, and in conformity with the eternal law, of "Him that sitteth on the Throne"; life therefore in its widest sense—life in the whole man and throughout the whole duration of human existence, the life of blissful and loving relationship to God in soul and body, for ever and ever.
2. "We shall reign in life." While freedom and might are implied in the figure of "reigning," "life" is represented as the glorious territory or atmosphere of that reign.
3. "If one man's one offense let loose against us the tyrant power of Death, to hold us as its victims in helpless bondage, 'much more,' when we stand forth enriched with God's 'abounding grace' and in the beauty of a complete absolution from countless offenses, shall we expatiate in a life divinely owned and legally secured, 'reigning' in exultant freedom and unchallenged might, through that other matchless 'One,' Jesus Christ!"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "If, under the administration of a just and merciful Being, it has occurred, that by the offence of one, death hath exerted so wide a dominion; we have reason much more to expect under that administration, that they who are brought under his plan of saving mercy shall be brought under a dispensation of life."
2. "The abundant favor; the mercy that shall counterbalance and surpass the evils introduced by the sin of Adam. That favor shall be more than sufficient to counterbalance all those evils."
3. "To show that people were thus justified by the gospel, was the leading design of the apostle; and the argument here is, that if by one man’s sin, death reigned over those who were under condemnation in consequence of it, we have much more reason to suppose that they who are delivered from sin by the death of Christ, and accepted of God, shall reign with him in life."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The effect of the second Adam cannot fall behind that of the first. If death reigned, there must be a reign of life."
2. "They which receive. Not believingly accept, but simply the recipients."
3. "Abundance of grace. Note the articles, the abundance of the grace."

### John Calvin:
1. "The sum of the whole is this — that Christ surpasses Adam; the sin of one is overcome by the righteousness of the other; the curse of one is effaced by the grace of the other; from one, death has proceeded, which is absorbed by the life which the other bestows."
2. "But the parts of this comparison do not correspond; instead of adding, 'the gift of life shall more fully reign and flourish through the exuberance of grace,' he says, that 'the faithful shall reign;' which amounts to the same thing; for the reign of the faithful is in life, and the reign of life is in the faithful."
3. "Hence the gift of righteousness is not a quality with which God endows us, as some absurdly explain it, but a gratuitous imputation of righteousness; for the Apostle plainly declares what he understood by the word grace."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "If this was God's way of justice, with much more certainty will His way of grace be, as is now described."
2. "The change of form brings into the foreground the persons who are the subjects of grace. With 'the trespass of the one' is contrasted the abundance of the grace as bestowed on, and accepted by, living persons."
3. "If, as a fact, sin and death were through Adam, then much more certain is it that abundant present grace and triumphant future glory shall be through our one head, Jesus Christ."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Much more (πολλω μαλλον). Argument a fortiori again."
2. "Condition of first class assumed to be true."
3. "Note balanced words in the contrast (transgression παραπτωματ, grace χαριτος; death θανατος, life ζωη; the one or Adam του ενος, the one Jesus Christ)."

### John Gill:
1. "in which death is represented as a mighty monarch, a powerful king; and designs not only corporeal death, which has mounted the throne by sin, and is supported in its dominion by an ordinance of heaven; but also a moral or spiritual death, which has seized on all mankind, and reigns in every power and faculty of the soul of man" 
2. "abundance of grace is designed, either something distinct from the justifying righteousness of Christ; such as the abundant grace and mercy of God, in regeneration and conversion; the various graces of the Spirit then implanted; the many things then wrought in the heart; the large discoveries! of pardoning grace, and the abundance of the love of God shed abroad in the soul by the Spirit" 
3. "now such persons who have received this abundant grace and free gift, shall reign in life by one, Jesus Christ; in corporeal life, they are not now subject to death as a penal evil, as other persons are, and though they die this death, they will triumph over it in the resurrection morn, they will rise again to everlasting life"

### John Wesley:
1. There is a difference between grace and the gift. Grace is opposed to the offence; the gift, to death, being the gift of life.
