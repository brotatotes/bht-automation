## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Or (supposing you do not assent to the argument in the last verse, see reff.) are ye ignorant (the foregoing axiom is brought out into recognition by the further statement of a truth universally acknowledged) that all we who were (i.e. all of us, having been [not as E. V., again most unfortunately, 'so many of us as were ;' giving it to be understood that some of them had not been thus baptized]) baptized into Christ Jesus (‚Äò into participation of,‚Äô ‚Äòinto union with ,‚Äô Christ, in His capacity of spiritual Mastership, Headship, and Pattern of conformity) were baptized into (introduced by our baptism into a state of conformity with and participation of) His death?"
2. "The Apostle refers (1) to an acknowledged fact, in the signification, and perhaps also in the manner (see below) of baptism that it put upon us ( Gal 3:27 ) a state of conformity with and participation in Christ;"
3. "and (2) that this state involves a death œÑ·øá ·ºÅŒºŒ±œÅœÑŒØ·æ≥ even as He died œÑ·øá ·ºÅŒºŒ±œÅœÑŒØ·æ≥ ( Rom 6:10 ); the meaning being kept in the background, but all the while not lost sight of, that the benefits of His Death were likewise made ours by our introduction into the covenant."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Whoso, then, has been baptized into Christ's death has formally surrendered the whole state and life of sin, as in Christ a dead thing."
2. "He has sealed himself to be not only 'the righteousness of God in Him,' but 'a new creature.'"
3. "He has bidden farewell, by baptism into Christ's death, to his entire connection with sin."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "By our very profession made in baptism, we have renounced sin, and have pledged ourselves to live to God."
2. "The act of baptism denotes dedication to the service of him in whose name we are baptized."
3. "Our baptism had a strong resemblance to his death. By that he became insensible to the things of the world; by baptism we in like manner become dead to sin."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The indicative mood presupposes an acquaintance with the moral nature of baptism, and a consequent absurdity in the idea of persisting in sin."
2. "Baptized into... denotes inward union, participation; not in order to bring about the union, for that has been effected."
3. "As He died to sin, so we die to sin, just as if we were literally members of His body."

### John Calvin:
1. "It is beyond any question, that we put on Christ in baptism, and that we are baptized for this end ‚Äî that we may be one with him."
2. "It is hence evident, that when we become partakers of the grace of Christ, immediately the efficacy of his death appears."
3. "His object seems to be merely to show that a change takes place in every true Christian, symbolized by baptism, and that this change bears a likeness to the death and resurrection of our Savior."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "If this is doubtful, then I appeal directly to your experimental knowledge."
2. "Baptism into Christ Jesus was the sign of participation in Him, union with Him."
3. "The reference to baptism does not suggest baptismal regeneration; it both connects and distinguishes baptism and regeneration, as the visible sign and the invisible grace of the renewing Spirit."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The translation 'into' makes Paul say that the union with Christ was brought to pass by means of baptism, which is not his idea, for Paul was not a sacramentarian." 
2. "Baptism is the public proclamation of one's inward spiritual relation to Christ attained before the baptism."
3. "Paul proceeds to explain [the relation to Christ's death] by the symbolism of the ordinance."

### John Gill:
1. "Whoever were baptized into Jesus Christ, were baptized into his death: and therefore must be dead to sin, and consequently ought not to live, nor can they live in sin."
2. "There is a difference between being baptized in water in the name of Christ, and being baptized into Christ, which believers in their baptism are."
3. "The true meaning of the phrase 'baptized into Christ'...is to be baptized purely for the sake of Christ, in imitation of him, who has set us an example, and because baptism is an ordinance of his."

### John Wesley:
1. "As many as have been baptized into Jesus Christ have been baptized into his death."
2. "In baptism we, through faith, are ingrafted into Christ."
3. "Through his Spirit, who fashions us like unto him, and particularly with regard to his death and resurrection."
