### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

### John Calvin:
1. "Let us know, that the Apostle does not simply exhort us to imitate Christ, as though he had said that the death of Christ is a pattern which all Christians are to follow; for no doubt he ascends higher, as he announces a doctrine, with which he connects, as it is evident, an exhortation; and his doctrine is this ‚Äî that the death of Christ is efficacious to destroy and demolish the depravity of our flesh, and his resurrection, to effect the renovation of a better nature, and that by baptism we are admitted into a participation of this grace."
2. "By the glory of the Father, that is, by that illustrious power by which he exhibited himself as really glorious, and as it were manifested the greatness of his glory. Thus often is the power of God, which was exercised in the resurrection of Christ, set forth in Scripture in sublime terms, and not without reason; for it is of great importance, that by so explicit a record of the ineffable power of God, not only faith in the last resurrection, which far exceeds the perception of the flesh, but also as to other benefits which we receive from the resurrection of Christ, should be highly commended to us."
3. "‚ÄòBuried with him,‚Äô means buried like him, or in like manner; and so ‚Äòcrucified with him,‚Äô in Romans 6:6, is the same: œÉœÖŒΩ prefixed to verbs, has clearly this meaning. See Romans 8:17; Colossians 3:1; 2 Timothy 2:11. ‚ÄòInto death‚Äô is not to be connected with ‚Äòplanted,‚Äô but with ‚Äòbaptism,‚Äô it was ‚Äòa baptism into death,‚Äô that is, which represented death, even death unto sin."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The death of the old man is at the same time the birth of the new."
2. "The Christian who is in fellowship with Christ, shares in his life."
3. "A life which never grows old, whose characteristic 'newness' is imperishable."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The picture in baptism points two ways, backwards to Christ's death and burial and to our death to sin, and forwards to Christ's resurrection from the dead and to our new life pledged by the coming out of the watery grave to walk on the other side of the baptismal grave." 
2. "It is a tragedy that Paul's majestic picture here has been so blurred by controversy that some refuse to see it."
