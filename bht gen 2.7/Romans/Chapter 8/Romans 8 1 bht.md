## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Now if Christ is in you, the (your) body indeed is dead on account of sin, but the (your) spirit is life on account of righteousness." 
2. "The (your) body indeed is dead... under the power of death physical (and eternal?) because of sin which it, per se, stands in, and serves."
3. "The (your) spirit is life on account of righteousness... the implanted righteousness of the sanctification of the Spirit."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The scope of [Romans 8:1] is to show how 'the law of sin and death' is deprived of its power to bring believers again into bondage, and how the holy law of God receives in them the homage of a living obedience."
2. "As Christ, who 'knew no sin,' was, to all legal effects, 'made sin for us,' so are we, who believe in Him, to all legal effects, 'made the righteousness of God in Him'... and thus, one with Him in the divine reckoning. There is to such 'NO CONDEMNATION.'"
3. "This is no mere legal arrangement: it is a union in life; believers, through the indwelling of Christ's Spirit in them, having one life with Him, as truly as the head and the members of the same body have one life."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The gospel does not pronounce condemnation like the Law. Its function is to pardon; the function of the law is to condemn." (quote 1)
2. "The function, design, and tendency of the gospel is to free from the condemning sentence of law. This is its first and its glorious announcement, that it frees lost and ruined people from a most fearful and terrible condemnation." (quote 2)
3. "If a man has [the fruits of the Spirit], he is a Christian; if not, he is a stranger to religion, whatever else he may possess." (quote 3)

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Being freed through Jesus Christ, there is therefore no condemnation now."
2. "Condemnation [Œ∫Œ±œÑŒ±Œ∫œÅŒπŒºŒ±] . As ch. 5 16, sentence of condemnation."
3. "Who walk not, etc. The best texts omit to the end of the verse."

### John Calvin:
1. "Though they were still beset by sin, they were yet exempt fiom the power of death, and from every curse, provided they lived not in the flesh but in the Spirit." 
2. "The trembling consciences of the godly have an invincible fortress, for they know that while they abide in Christ they are beyond every danger of condemnation."
3. "Those who walk after the Spirit are not such as have wholly put off all the emotions of the flesh, but they are those who sedulously labor to subdue and mortify the flesh, so that the love of true religion seems to reign in them."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "No condemnation. 'No' is in emphatic position. Some confine this to the act of Justification at the beginning of the Christian life, but it is better to refer it to the state of justification which culminates in final acquittal and glory."
2. "In Christ Jesus. In vital union with Him; the phrase being a deeply significant one; comp. John 15:1-7; Ephesians 1:23."
3. "The clause: ‚Äòwho walk not,‚Äô etc., is to be rejected, being probably taken from Romans 8:4. This addition weakens the Apostle‚Äôs statement, by making the walk appear as the ground of ‚Äòno condemnation.‚Äô"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "No condemnation (ŒøœÖŒ¥ŒµŒΩ Œ∫Œ±œÑŒ±Œ∫œÅŒπŒºŒ±). As sinners we deserved condemnation in our unregenerate state in spite of the struggle."
2. "But God offers pardon 'to those in Christ Jesus (œÑŒøŒπœÇ ŒµŒΩ ŒßœÅŒπœÉœÑœâ ŒôŒ∑œÉŒøœÖ). This is Paul's Gospel."
3. "The fire has burned on and around the Cross of Christ. There and there alone is safety. Those in Christ Jesus can lead the consecrated, the crucified, the baptized life."

### John Gill:
1. "there is not one condemnation lies against them, with respect to their numerous sins, original and actual, though every sin deserves one; not one from the law of God, of which sin is a transgression, for though that is a condemning law, yet it is only so to them that are under it; not to them that are Christ's, whom he has redeemed from it."
2. "condemnation may also be considered with respect to guilt; all mankind are guilty of Adam's sin, and are guilty creatures, as they are actual transgressors of the law; but an heart sprinkled with the blood of Christ, is clear of guilt; for all the guilt of sin is removed to Christ, and he has took it away; hence there is no obligation to punishment on them, for whom Christ died."
3. "condemnation may mean actual damnation, or eternal death, the wages of sin, which those who are in Christ shall never die; they are ordained to eternal life, and are redeemed from this death; they are made alive by Christ, and have eternal life secured to them in him, and which they shall certainly enjoy"

### John Wesley:
1. "There is therefore now no condemnation ‚Äî Either for things present or past." 
2. "Now he comes to deliverance and liberty." 
3. "The apostle here resumes the thread of his discourse, which was interrupted."

- Attempt 1 BHT: If Christ dwells in you, your body is dead because of sin, but your spirit is alive because of righteousness. This means that although your body is still subject to death because of sin, your spirit is alive and thriving because of the righteousness of Christ. The purpose of Romans 8:1 is to emphasize how believers are set free from the power of sin and death and can now live in obedience to God's holy law. By being united with Christ, we are made righteous in God's eyes and there is now no condemnation for us. This is not just a legal arrangement, but a true union in life, where believers have one life with Christ. We have been freed through Jesus Christ and therefore there is no condemnation for us.
