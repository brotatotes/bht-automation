# Romans 8:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
If we do not actively kill sin and allow the Spirit to sanctify us, sin will lead to our spiritual death. When we have the consciousness of spiritual life and the indwelling of the Spirit, it becomes an assurance of resurrection life. By putting sin to death and mortifying its power, we can partake in eternal life. Let us embrace Christ for both our justification and sanctification, for He has been given to us for both purposes.

- Attempt 1 BHT: If we do not actively kill sin and allow the Spirit of Christ to sanctify us, sin will ultimately lead to our spiritual death. However, when we have the consciousness of spiritual life and the indwelling of the Spirit, it becomes a glorious assurance of resurrection life in the body. By putting sin to death and mortifying its power, we can partake in eternal life. This requires us to actively strive to subdue the lusts of the flesh and put to death our habitual sinful practices. So, let us not live in sin, but rather embrace Christ for both our justification and sanctification, for He has been given to us for both these purposes.
