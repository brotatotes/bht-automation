# Romans 8:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The testimony of the Holy Spirit assures us of Christ's work in our lives. Through His presence, we become one spirit with the Lord Himself. Our cry of Abba, Father is not in isolation, but is accompanied by the distinct seal of the Holy Spirit within us. This witness of our sonship gives us a sense of dignity and new life. It is vital to recognize the Holy Spirit as a personal being, rather than a mere it.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "But on the other hand it does not consist in mere indefinite feeling, but in a certitude of the Spiritâ€™s presence and work continually asserted within us."
2. "On this direct testimony of the Holy Ghost rests, ultimately, all the regenerate manâ€™s conviction respecting Christ and His work."
3. "The spirit of man may sin, the Spirit of God cannot, but can only be grieved or quenched, and it is by the infusion of this highest Principle of Holiness, that man becomes ONE SPIRIT with the Lord Himself."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The Spirit itself... should be 'Himself'." 
2. "The testimony of our own spirit is borne in that cry of conscious sonship, 'Abba, Father'; but we are not therein alone; for the Holy Ghost within us, yea, even in that very cry which it is His to draw forth, sets His own distinct seal to ours."
3. "The one expresses the dignity to which we are admitted; the other the new life which we receive."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The Spirit - The Holy Spirit. That the Holy Spirit here is intended, is evident."
2. "It is his to renew the heart; to sanctify the soul; to produce 'love, joy, peace, long-suffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, temperance,' Galatians 5:22-23."
3. "If they do, the evidence is clear. If not, all vain confidence of good estate; all visions, and raptures, and fancied revelations, will be mere delusions."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Beareth witness with our spirit."
2. "This rendering assumes the concurrent testimony of the human spirit with that of the divine Spirit."
3. "Children."

### John Calvin:
1. "But Paul means, that the Spirit of God gives us such a testimony, that when he is our guide and teacher, our spirit is made assured of the adoption of God."
2. "For we must ever hold fast this principle, â€” that we do not rightly pray to God, unless we are surely persuaded in our hearts, that he is our Father, when we so call him with our lips."
3. "Let this truth then stand sure, â€” that no one can be called a son of God, who does not know himself to be such; and this is called knowledge by John, in order to set forth its certainty."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The Spirit itself; the Holy Spirit beareth witness with, or, â€˜to,â€™ our spirit, our renewed spirit, in which the Holy Spirit dwells."
2. "This implies a twofold witness: of the Holy Spirit, and also of our renewed spirit."
3. "That we are children of God. This is what is testified, and for such assurance we may seek, however fanaticism has perverted the passage."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "It is a grave mistake to use the neuter 'it' or 'itself' when referring to the Holy Spirit."
2. "Beareth witness with our spirit."
3. "See on Romans 2:15 for this verb with associative instrumental case. See 1 John 5:10 for this double witness."

### John Gill:
1. "The testimony of the Spirit is not the satisfaction of others, but the saints themselves; who are ready to doubt of it at times, because of the greatness of the favour, and their own sinfulness and unworthiness."
2. "The spirits of the saints are they which receive the witness of the Spirit of God, to which it is made; not to their ears, for it is not an audible testimony; but to their hearts, it is internal; to their renewed souls, where faith is wrought to receive it; to their understandings, that they may know and be assured of it; to their spirits, which are apt to faint and doubt about it."
3. "Now it is 'the Spirit itself' that bears this witness, and not others, or by others, but he himself in person; who is a divine witness, whose testimony therefore must be greater than others, and a faithful one, who will never deceive."

### John Wesley:
1. "The same Spirit beareth witness with our spirit â€” With the spirit of every true believer..."
2. "by a testimony distinct from that of his own spirit..."
3. "Happy they who enjoy this clear and constant."

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: The testimony of the Holy Spirit within us is not just a vague feeling, but a certainty of His presence and work. It is through this direct testimony that our conviction about Christ and His work is ultimately founded. As the Spirit of God joins with our own spirit, we become one with the Lord Himself and are able to cry out, Abba, Father. This testimony of our sonship gives us a deep sense of dignity and new life. It is important to note that the Holy Spirit should be referred to as Himself and not as an impersonal it. The Spirit's witness, accompanied by our own spirit, assures us that we are indeed children of God. We must hold fast to the truth that we are called sons and daughters of God and have a deep knowledge of this truth in our hearts.
