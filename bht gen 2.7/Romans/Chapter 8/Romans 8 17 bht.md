# Romans 8:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The children of God are joint-heirs with Christ, sharing in His inheritance as a result of their substantial unity with the Father. In Roman law, all children, both natural and adopted, were equal heirs, and the New Testament upholds this principle by making the redeemed equal to Christ. However, joint-heirship with Christ is not simply a matter of inheritance, but also involves a shared participation in His sufferings and eventual glory.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "It is by virtue of their substantial unity with the father, that the children come into participation of his possession. The Roman law regarded them as continuators of his personality."
2. "By the Roman law, the share of the firstborn was no greater than that of the other children, and the N. T. sets forth this view, making the redeemed equal to Christ (Romans 8:29), and Christ‚Äôs possessions, theirs."
3. "In the joint-heirship we must not bring out this point, that Christ is the rightful Heir, who shares His inheritance with the other children of God: it is as adoptive children that they get the inheritance, and Christ is so far only the means of it, as He gives them power to become sons of God."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "heirs of God‚Äîof our Father's kingdom."

1. "An adopted son comes in for a part of the inheritance, Numbers 27:0."
2. "This is an honor infinitely higher than to be heir to the most princely earthly inheritance; or than to be the adopted son of the most magnificent earthly monarch."
3. "If united in the same kind of sufferings, there is propriety in being united in destiny beyond the scenes of all suffering, the kingdom of blessedness and love."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Joint - heirs. Roman law made all children, including adopted ones, equal heritors."
2. "If so be that [ŒµŒπœÄŒµœÅ] . The conditional particle with the indicative mood assumes the fact. If so be, as is really the case."
3. "Suffer with Him. Mere suffering does not fulfill the condition. It is suffering with Christ."

### John Calvin:
1. "We are co-heirs with Christ, provided, in entering on our inheritance, we follow him in the same way in which he has gone before."
2. "God‚Äôs inheritance is ours, because we have by his grace been adopted as his children; and that it may not be doubtful, its possession has been already conferred on Christ, whose partners we have become."
3. "He denotes the order, which the Lord follows in dispensing salvation to us, rather than the cause; for he has already sufficiently defended the gratuitous mercy of God against the merits of works."

### Logs
- Attempt 1 BHT: By virtue of their substantial unity with the Father, the children of God come into participation of His possession. The Roman law considered all children as equal heirs, regardless of birth order or whether they were adopted, and the New Testament reflects this view by making the redeemed equal to Christ, even calling them joint-heirs with Him. However, it is important to understand that Christ is the rightful Heir, and it is as adoptive children that we receive the inheritance, with Christ as the means of it. Joint-heirship with Christ requires a conformity to Him in suffering, as suffering with Christ fulfills the condition for sharing in His glory. The sufferings we endure in this life serve to prepare us for the glory that awaits us as joint-heirs with Christ, in the kingdom of God.
