# Romans 8:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As Christians, we possess the firstfruit of the Spirit, the gift of the Spirit. We eagerly await the fullness of adoption and the redemption of our bodies. Though we have glimpses of heaven, we still groan under sin's weight and our earthly limitations. This groaning is not just for ourselves but for creation's transformation and others' salvation. The redemption of our body is crucial for our complete deliverance and the manifestation of our status as God's children.

### John Calvin:
1. "The excellency of our glory is of such importance even to the very elements, which are destitute of mind and reason, that they burn with a certain kind of desire for it; how much more it behoves us, who have been illuminated by the Spirit of God, to aspire and strive with firmness of hope and with ardour of desire, after the attainment of so great a benefit."
2. "And he requires that there should be a feeling of two kinds in the faithful: that being burdened with the sense of their present misery, they are to groan; and that notwithstanding they are to wait patiently for their deliverance."
3. "For Paul means this, that the eternal decree of God, by which he has chosen us to himself as sons before the foundation of the world, of which he testifies to us in the gospel, the assurance of which he seals on our hearts by his Spirit, would be void, except the promised resurrection were certain, which is its consummation."

- Attempt 1 BHT: As Christians, we possess the firstfruit of the Spirit, which is the gift of the Spirit. However, our salvation is not yet complete, and we eagerly await the fullness of our adoption and the redemption of our bodies. Though we have glimpses of heaven within us, we still groan under the weight of sin and the limitations of our earthly bodies. This groaning is not only for our own pains but also for the transformation of creation and the salvation of others. The redemption of our body is crucial for our complete deliverance and the manifestation of our status as children of God in the presence of all creation.
