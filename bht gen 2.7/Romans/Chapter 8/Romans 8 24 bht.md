# Romans 8:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Our salvation is a salvation in hope, for hope is the expectation of something yet to come. It sustains us in trials, enabling us to bear them with patience. It is not what is seen or already possessed, but rather what is unseen and future. Our hope is in the promise of eternal glory and happiness, laid up for us in heaven. Though we have received the firstfruits of salvation, we are saved by hope, eagerly awaiting its fulfillment.
