## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "the Spirit itself intercedes with groanings which cannot be expressed: i.e. the Holy Spirit of God dwelling in us, knowing our wants better than we, Himself pleads in our prayers, raising us to higher and holier desires than we can express in words, which can only find utterance in sighings and aspirations."
2. "the Spirit suggests to us the proper words of acceptable prayer, which would otherwise have been unutterable by us"
3. "No intercession in heaven is here spoken of, but a pleading in us by the indwelling Spirit, of a nature above our comprehension and utterance."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "It is not the proper matter of prayer that believers are at so much loss about, for the fullest directions are given them on this head: but to ask for the right things 'as they ought' is the difficulty."
2. "In these circumstances, how can it be but that much uncertainty should surround all our spiritual exercises, and that in our nearest approaches and in the freest outpourings of our hearts to our Father in heaven, doubts should spring up within us whether our frame of mind in such exercises is altogether befitting and well pleasing to God?"
3. "But not in vain are these groanings. For 'the Spirit Himself' is in them, giving to the emotions which He Himself has kindled the only language of which they are capable; so that though on our part they are the fruit of impotence to utter what we feel, they are at the same time the intercession of the Spirit Himself in our behalf."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "he greatly assists or aids us."
2. "The Holy Spirit greatly assists or aids us; not by praying for us, but in our prayers and infirmities."
3. "The Spirit greatly aids or supports us in those deep emotions, those intense feelings, those inward sighs which cannot be expressed in language, but which he enables us to bear, and which are understood by Him that searcheth the hearts."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "As we ought [Œ∫Œ±Œ∏Œø Œ¥ŒµŒπ] . Not with reference to the form of prayer, but to the circumstances: in proportion to the need."
2. "Maketh intercession for [œÖœÄŒµœÅŒµŒΩœÑœÖŒ≥œáŒ±ŒΩŒµŒπ] . Only here in the New Testament. The verb ejntugcanw means to light upon or fall in with; to go to meet for consultation, conversation, or supplication."
3. "Which cannot be uttered [Œ±ŒªŒ±ŒªŒ∑œÑŒøŒπœÇ]. This may mean either unutterable or unuttered."

### John Calvin:
1. "There is then no reason for any one to complain, that the bearing of the cross is beyond their own strength, since we are sustained by a celestial power."
2. "For what we should pray for, etc. He had before spoken of the testimony of the Spirit, by which we know that God is our Father, and on which relying, we dare to call on him as our Father."
3. "But the Spirit himself intercedes, (266) etc. Though really or by the event it does not appear that our prayers have been heard by God, yet Paul concludes, that the presence of the celestial favor does already shine forth in the desire for prayer."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The Spirit helps our weakness, in bearing the burden spoken of in Romans 8:23, in awaiting final redemption."
2. "The Holy Spirit is here spoken of in His saving work in us: while dwelling in us He makes intercession thus, Himself pleads in our prayers, raising us to higher and holier desires than we can express in words, which can only find utterance in sighings and aspirations."
3. "It is not absolutely and altogether unknown to us what we ought to ask, but only what is necessary to ask according to the given circumstances."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Here beautifully Paul pictures the Holy Spirit taking hold at our side at the very time of our weakness."
2. "How true this is of all of us in our praying."
3. "It is a picturesque word of rescue by one who 'happens on' one who is in trouble and pleads 'with unuttered groanings' or with 'sighs that baffle words'."

### John Gill:
1. "The people of God, all of them, more or less, have their infirmities in this life. They are not indeed weak and infirm, in such sense as unregenerate persons are...nor are they all alike infirm..."
2. "The Spirit...helpeth our infirmities...by bringing to remembrance, and applying the precious promises of the Gospel, by shedding abroad the love of God in their hearts, by acting the part of a comforter to them, by putting strength into them, and by assisting them in prayer to God."
3. "but what they are ignorant of is chiefly the matter of prayer...and more from an intemperate zeal, and with a view to self, than for the glory of God."

### John Wesley:
1. "Likewise the Spirit... groaneth, while he helpeth our infirmities, or weaknesses."
2. "Our understandings are weak, particularly in the things of God our desires are weak; our prayers are weak."
3. "The Spirit maketh intercession for us - In our hearts, even as Christ does in heaven."
