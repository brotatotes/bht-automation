## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The assurance which we have that God the Heart-Searcher interprets the inarticulate sighings of the Spirit in us, is, not strictly speaking, His Omniscience, but the fact that the very Spirit who thus pleads, does it ÎºÎ±Ï„á½° Î¸ÎµÏŒÎ½, in pursuance of the divine purposes and in conformity with Godâ€™s good pleasure."
2. "All these pleadings of the Spirit are heard and answered, even when inarticulately uttered."
3. "We may extend the same comforting assurance to the imperfect and mistaken verbal utterances of our prayers, which are not themselves answered to our hurt, but the answer is given to the voice of the Spirit which speaks through them, which we would express, but cannot."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "As the Searcher of hearts, He watches the surging emotions of them in prayer, and knows perfectly what the Spirit means by the groanings which He draws forth within us, because that blessed Intercessor pleads by them only for what God Himself designs to bestow." 
2. "It cannot but swell the heart of every intelligent Christian to think that if external nature has been mysteriously affected for evil by the fall of man, it only awaits his completed recovery, at the resurrection, to experience a corresponding emancipation from its blighted condition into undecaying life and unfading beauty."
3. "How cheering is it to be assured that the blessed Spirit, cognizant of it all, comes in aid of it all; and in particular, that when believers, unable to articulate their case before God, can at times do nothing but lie 'groaning' before the Lord, these inarticulate groanings are the Spirit's own vehicle for conveying into 'the ears of the Lord of Sabaoth' their whole case; and come up before the Hearer of prayer as the Spirit's own intercession in their behalf."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "To search the heart is one of his attributes which cannot be communicated to a creature." 
2. "He sees the anxious feelings of the soul, and is ready to aid and to bless." 
3. "That man is most safe who yields himself most entirely to the influence of the Holy Spirit."

### John Calvin:
1. "This is a remarkable reason for strengthening our confidence, that we are heard by God when we pray through his Spirit, for he thoroughly knows our desires..." 
2. "God regards not these emotions of the Spirit as new and strange, or that he rejects them as unreasonable, but that he allows them, and at the same time kindly accepts them, as allowed and approved by him." 
3. "Let us also hence learn, that what holds the first place in prayer is consent with the will of the Lord, whom our wishes do by no means hold under obligation."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Though the groanings are unutterable, God understands their meaning."
2. "The mind of the Spirit... may be but partially recognized by us in our weakness."
3. "What we cannot utter... is known to God, because in accordance with His will."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The Holy Spirit is the 'other Paraclete' who pleads God's cause with us as Christ is our Paraclete with the Father."
2. "The Holy Spirit interprets our prayers to God."
3. "The Holy Spirit 'makes intercession for us in accord with God's will.'"

### John Gill:
1. "This is the prerogative of God: and he knoweth what is the mind of the Spirit." 
2. "The omniscient God understands, and respects such kind of prayer." 
3. "Saints may be confident of the prevalence and success of such intercession."

### John Wesley:
