## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "(God) Who even (taking one act as a notable example out of all) did not spare His own Son..."
2. "His Ï…á¼±á½¸Ï‚ Î¼Î¿Î½Î¿Î³ÎµÎ½Î®Ï‚, the only one of Godâ€™s sons who is One with Him in nature and essence..."
3. "but delivered Him up on behalf of us all, how shall He not also with Him give freely to us all things?"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "God exercised, in His Paternal character, a mysterious act of Self-sacrifice, which, though involving none of the pain and none of the loss which are inseparable from the very idea of self-sacrifice on our part, was not less real, but, on the contrary, as far transcended any such acts of ours as His nature is above the creature's."
2. "Understand Christ's Sonship thus, and the language of Scripture regarding it is intelligible and harmonious; but take it to be an artificial relationship, ascribed to Him in virtue either of His miraculous birth, or His resurrection from the dead, or the grandeur of His works, or all of these togetherâ€”and the passages which speak of it neither explain of themselves nor harmonize with each other."
3. "How can we conceive that He should not [freely give us all things]?"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The most humble and obscure believer may derive consolation from the fact that Christ died for him, and that God has expressed the highest love for him which we can conceive to be possible."
2. "His giving his Son is a proof that he will give to us all things that we need. The argument is from the greater to the less. He that has given the greater gift will not withhold the less."
3. "He has evidence that God will continue to be his friend. He that has given his Son to die for his people will not withdraw the lesser mercies that may be necessary to secure their salvation."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "All gifts of God are to be received, held, and enjoyed in communion with Christ."
2. "Spared."
3. "Freely give. In contrast with spared."

### John Calvin:
1. "As it greatly concerns us to be so thoroughly persuaded of the paternal love of God, as to be able to retain our rejoicing on its account, Paul brings forward the price of our redemption in order to prove that God favors us."
2. "This passage ought to remind us of what Christ brings to us, and to awaken us to contemplate his riches; for as he is a pledge of Godâ€™s infinite love towards us, so he has not been sent to us void of blessings or empty, but filled with all celestial treasures."
3. "Christ himself, and everything that comes with or through him, is a favor freely bestowed, and not what we merit. This shuts out, as [Pareus] observes, everything as meritorious on the part of man. All is grace."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "He who even, or, indeed."
2. "The entire humiliation may be included, but the special reference to death is obvious."
3. "The fact that the gift of Christ for us is the gift of Christ to us, forms the basis of the conclusion."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Who as much as this" (Î³Îµ here magnifying the deed, intensive particle).
2. "The gift of 'his own son' is the promise and the pledge of the all things for good." 
3. "Christ is all and carries all with him."

### John Gill:
1. "He that spared not his own Son...is very amazing."
2. "God the Father delivered him, according to his determinate counsel and foreknowledge, into the hands of wicked men..."
