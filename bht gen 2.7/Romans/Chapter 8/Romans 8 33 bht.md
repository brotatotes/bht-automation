# Romans 8:33 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Who can accuse those whom God has justified? Is it Christ who died and intercedes for us, or is it God Himself? Satan may be the Accuser, but he must face the Judge with his charges. We can find comfort in being the elect of God, chosen for salvation before the foundation of the world. Rest assured that none can bring a charge against us that would condemn us, for it is God who justifies us.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Shall God, who justifies them...be their accuser?"
2. "Who is he that condemns them? Is it Christ who died, yea who rather is also risen, who also is at the right hand of God, who also intercedes for us?"
3. "All the great points of our redemption are ranged together, from the death of Christ to His still enduring intercession, as reasons for negativing the question above."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect?" 
2. "The first place in this Epistle where believers are styled 'the elect'."
3. "In what sense this is meant will appear in next chapter."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Who shall lay anything to the charge... as to cause their condemnation?"
2. "As they are the chosen of God, they are dear to him... none can bring against them a charge that would condemn them."
3. "The fact that he has justified them is, therefore, a strong proof that they will be saved."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Who shall lay - to the charge [ÎµÎ³ÎºÎ±Î»ÎµÏƒÎµÎ¹] . Only here by Paul. Frequent in Acts. See Rom 19:38, 40; Rom 23:28, 29; Rom 26:2, 7. Lit., 'to call something in one.' Hence call to account; bring a charge against." 
2. "The following clauses are differently arranged by expositors. I prefer the succession of four interrogatives: Who shall lay? etc. Is it God? etc. Who is He that condemneth? Is it Christ? etc."

### John Calvin:
1. "The first and the chief consolation of the godly in adversities, is to be fully persuaded of the paternal kindness of God."
2. "The antithetic clauses seem not indeed to be exactly arranged...Paul has not without reason made another arrangement, as he was anxious to arm the children of God, as they say, from head to foot, with that confidence which banishes all anxieties and fears."
3. "The drift of the whole is, that we are not only freed from terror by present remedies, but that God comes to our aid beforehand, that he may better provide for our confidence."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The term used is a legal one, and suggests an accusation resulting in condemnation."
2. "Only believers can with any propriety find comfort in the thought, and even they should be careful not to rest their faith upon a decree of election rather than the personal Saviour."
3. "If taken as a question, it is only a more rhetorical form of the same proof: â€˜Shall God who justifieth?â€™"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Satan is the great Accuser of the brethren."
2. "God is the Judge who sets us right according to his plan for justification."
3. "The Accuser must face the Judge with his charges."

### John Gill:
1. "The elect of God are a certain select number of persons, whom he has so loved, as of his sovereign good will and pleasure, to choose in Christ before the foundation of the world, unto eternal life and salvation, by certain ways and means of his own appointing."
2. "But all these charges avail nothing, since none of the divine persons, Father, Son, and Spirit, lay anything against them: not God the Father, for it is God that justifieth; he against whom sin is committed, who is the lawgiver, and the righteous judge, justifies them from every charge."
3. "Observe, that 'God's elect', as such, are the objects of justification; which proves the eternity of it; the speciality of it as belonging to particular persons, and the everlasting security and continuance of it."

### John Wesley:
1. "The gospel having the most strict connexion with the Books of the Old Testament, where these phrases frequently occur; and our Lord and his apostles being native Jews, and beginning to preach in the land of Israel, the language in which they preached would of course abound with the phrases of the Jewish nation."
2. "And the same appellations which once belonged to the Jewish nation were now given to the gentile Christians also together with which they were invested with all the privileges of 'the chosen people of God'; and nothing could cut them off from these but their own wilful apostasy."
3. "It does not appear that even good men were ever termed God's elect till above two thousand years from the creation. God's electing or choosing the nation of Israel, and separating them from the other nations, who were sunk in idolatry and all wickedness, gave the first occasion to this sort of language."
