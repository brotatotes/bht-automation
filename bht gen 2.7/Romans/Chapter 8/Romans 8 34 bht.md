## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

2. "Christ's sitting at the right hand of God...signifies the glory of the exalted Son of man, and the power in the government of the world in which He participates."
3. "His Session at God's right hand denotes His power to save us; His Intercession, His will to do it."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The function of passing sentence of condemnation on people shall pertain to Christ, the judge of quick and dead, and the apostle proceeds to say that it was certain that he would not condemn the elect of God."
