# Romans 8:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Our lives are shaped by the dominant influence of either the flesh or the Spirit. Those who live according to the flesh are driven by worldly desires, while those who live according to the Spirit prioritize the things of God. The contrast is evident in the goals, actions, and character of individuals. Through the transforming power of the Spirit, our minds can be directed towards the spiritual and eternal, rather than being consumed by worldly pursuits.
