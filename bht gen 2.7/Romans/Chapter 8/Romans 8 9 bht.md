# Romans 8:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
To be in the spirit means to be under the dominion of our renewed mind, for the indwelling of God's Spirit signifies our union with Christ. The Spirit of Christ, the Holy Spirit, possesses believers, infusing them with His gracious disposition. If a person lacks the Spirit of Christ, they do not belong to Him. This condition assumes the truth and calls for self-examination of our connection to Christ.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "But (oppos. to οἱ κατ. σάρ. ὄντες) ye are not in the flesh (see above), but in the Spirit, if so be that (‘provided that;’ not ‘since,’ as Chrys., Olsh., al., which would be ἐπείπερ: Chrys. tries to prove εἴπερ = ἐπείπερ here by adducing ref. 2 Thess., where, however, as here, the meaning is, ‘if so be that,’ ‘if at least.’"
2. "But (this must be rightly understood: for) if any man has not ([not ‘have not,’ as E. V.; the case is put as an existent one] οὐκ, and not μή, because it belongs to the verb and not to εἰ."
3. "Obs. here that πν. θεοῦ, πν. χριστοῦ, and χριστός, are all used of the Holy Spirit indwelling in the Christian), he is not His (belongs not to Him, in the higher and blessed sense of being united to Him as a member of Him)."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "To be 'in the spirit' means here to be under the dominion of our own renewed mind because the indwelling of God's Spirit is given as the evidence that we are 'in the spirit'." 
2. "It is as 'the Spirit of Christ' that the Holy Ghost takes possession of believers, introducing into them all the gracious, dove-like disposition which dwelt in Him."
3. "Even though intellectually convinced of the truth of Christianity, and in a general sense influenced by its spirit, if any man's heart be void, not of such dispositions, but of the blessed Author of them, 'the Spirit of Christ,' he is none of his."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Not in the flesh - Not under the full influence of corrupt desires and passions."
2. "The Holy Spirit is often represented as dwelling in the hearts of Christians...the meaning is not that there is a personal or physical indwelling of the Holy Spirit, but that he influences, directs, and guides Christians."
3. "If a man is not influenced by the meek, pure, and holy spirit of the Lord Jesus, if he is not conformed to his image, if his life does not resemble that of the Saviour, he is a stranger to religion."

### John Calvin:
1. "It is the surest mark by which the children of God are distinguished from the children of the world, when by the Spirit of God they are renewed unto purity and holiness."
2. "They who separate Christ from his own Spirit make him like a dead image or a carcase."
3. "We must either deny Christ, or confess that we become Christians through his Spirit."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "This conditional form is ‘an indirect incitement to self-examination’ (Meyer), and does not imply special doubt."
2. "That the Holy Spirit is here meant ought not to be doubted. ‘In you’ must not be weakened into ‘among you.’"
3. "He does not belong to Christ, perhaps implying that the Spirit unites the members of the mystical body of Christ to their Head, and that without this Spirit such union does not exist."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Not in the flesh...but in the spirit...the mystical union of the believer with Christ in the Holy Spirit."
2. "If as is the fact...The Spirit of Christ...Incidental argument for the Deity of Christ."
3. "Condition of first class, assumed as true."

### John Gill:
1. "The inhabitation of the Spirit is a distinguishing character of a regenerate man; which is to be understood not of his omnipresence, nor of a participation of his gifts, whether ordinary or extraordinary."
2. "The indwelling of the Spirit is the grand evidence of relation to God, of an interest in Christ and union to him, and of a man's state and condition God-ward."
3. "To have [the Spirit] is not barely to partake of his gifts, but of his graces; to be possessed of him as one's own; to have communion with him, and to have him dwelling in us."

### John Wesley:
1. "In the Spirit — Under his government."
2. "If any man have not the Spirit of Christ — Dwelling and governing in him."
3. "He is none of his — He is not a member of Christ; not a Christian; not in a state of salvation."

- Attempt 1 BHT: If we are truly in the Spirit, it means that we are under the dominion of our own renewed mind and have the indwelling of God's Spirit as evidence. The Holy Spirit, also known as the Spirit of Christ, takes possession of believers and introduces into them the gracious disposition that dwelt in Jesus. Conversely, if anyone's heart is void of the Spirit of Christ, they do not belong to Him. This passage speaks to the mystical union believers have with Christ in the Holy Spirit, and serves as an incidental argument for the Deity of Christ. It is a condition of first class, assumed as true, challenging us to examine ourselves and our relationship with Christ.
