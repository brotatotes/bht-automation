# 1 Corinthians 1:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
It has been clearly communicated to me by the members of Chloe's family, who some speculate might be the wife of Stephanas and mother of Fortunatus and Achaicus. These individuals, along with others from the Corinthian church, had sent their letter to me, bringing to my attention the disputes and divisions that were taking place among them. These contentions were causing factionalism and creating rifts within the church, as they clashed over matters such as their leaders and various doctrines and practices.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "We cannot fill up τῶν Χλόης, not knowing whether they were sons, or servants, or other members of her family."
2. "Nor can we say whether Chloe was an inhabitant of Corinth, or some Christian woman known to the Corinthians elsewhere, or an Ephesian, having friends who had been in Corinth."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The Corinthians 'wrote' to the apostle (1 Corinthians 7:1), consulting him concerning certain points; marriage, the eating of things offered to idols, the decorum to be observed by women in religious assemblies. But they said not a syllable about the enormities and disorders that had crept in among them."
2. "Hence his language about those evils is, 'It hath been declared unto me,' c. 'It is reported commonly' (1 Corinthians 5:1; 1 Corinthians 5:2). All this he says before he refers to their letter, which shows that the latter did not give him any intimation of those evils."
3. "He names the family, to let it be seen that he made his allegation not without authority: he does not name the individuals, not to excite odium against them. He tacitly implies that the information ought rather to have come to him directly from their presbyters, as they had consulted him about matters of less moment."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "My brethren - A token of affectionate regard, evincing his love for them, and his deep interest in their welfare, even when he administered a needed rebuke."
2. "It is most probable that Chloe was a member of the church at Corinth, some of whose family had been at Ephesus when Paul was, and had given him information of the state of things there."
3. "The probability is that Paul had received this information before they arrived."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "It hath been declared [εδηλωθη] . Rev., signified, which is hardly strong enough."
2. "The word means to make clear, or manifest [δηλος]."
3. "The persons may have been slaves who had come to Ephesus on business for their mistress, or members of her family."

### John Calvin:
1. "For he shows that they had not merely turned aside from a holy unity, but had even fallen into contentions, which are worse than jarrings of sentiment." 
2. "And that he may not be charged with believing too readily what was said, as though he lightly lent his ear to false accusations, he speaks with commendation of his informants, who must have been in the highest esteem, as he did not hesitate to adduce them as competent witnesses against an entire Church."
3. "That he might not exasperate their minds by undue severity, he has modified the reproof by an engaging form of address; not as though he would make light of the distemper, but with the view of bringing them to a more teachable spirit, for perceiving the severity of the malady."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "For it hath been signified unto me...literally, It was signified to me." 
2. "Whether the children, the kinspeople, or the servants of Chloe we do not know." 
3. "Already Christianity was working a social revolution in the position of women and slaves."

### John Gill:
1. "The thing was a clear point to him; he had no reason at all to doubt of the truth of it; nor could they deny it, the proof was so strong, the evidence so full, being given by them which are of the house of Chloe."
2. "He mentions this family by name, to show that he had not took up an idle tale, and received reports from anybody, nor from a single person only, but from a family of repute among them."
3. "And what they had made out clearly to him was, that there are contentions among you; about their ministers, as appears afterward, as well as about opinions in doctrines, and ceremonies in worship, which occasioned undue heats, and great indecencies, tending to make rents and schisms among them."

### John Wesley:
1. "It hath been declared to me by them of the family of Chloe — Whom some suppose to have been the wife of Stephanas, and the mother of Fortunatus and Achaicus."
2. "By these three the Corinthians had sent their letter to St. Paul, 1 Corinthians 16:17."
3. "That there are contentions — A word equivalent with schisms in the preceding verse."
