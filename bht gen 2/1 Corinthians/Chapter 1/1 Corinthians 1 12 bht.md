# 1 Corinthians 1:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
There are factions in your midst, boasting allegiance to different teachers. Some prefer Apollos' philosophical and rhetorical style, others rally around Peter as a representative of the Jewish-Christian perspective, and some exalt Paul. However, these divisions have led to contentions and a lowering of the name of Christ. The unity of the Church should be centered on Christ alone, recognizing our dependence on Him, rather than on any individual.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The meaning is clear, but the form of expression not strictly accurate, the á¼•ÎºÎ±ÏƒÏ„Î¿Ï‚ being a different person in each case."
2. "These designations are not used as pointing to actual parties formed and subsisting among the Corinthians, but as representing the SPIRIT WITH WHICH THEY CONTENDED against one another, being the sayings of individuals, and not of parties."
3. "This profession, of being guided especially by the words and acts of Paul, would probably belong to those who were the first fruits of, or directly converted under, his ministry. Such persons would contend for his apostolic authority, and maintain doctrinally his teaching, so far being right."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Not that they formed definite parties, but they individually betrayed the spirit
of party in contentions under the name of different favorite teachers."
2. "Apollos, doubtless,
did not willingly foster this spirit of undue preference."
3. "If it be wrong to boast 'I am of Peter,' how much
more so to boast 'I am of the Pope!'" [BENGEL].

### Albert Barnes:
1. "That every one of you saith - That you are divided into different factions, and ranged under different leaders." 
2. "It can scarcely be doubted that Paul here meant to say that there were parties existing in the church at Corinth, who were called by the names of himself, of Apollos, of Cephas, and of Christ."
3. "Apollos succeeded Paul in Achaia, and labored successfully there; see Acts 18:27-28. These two original parties might be again sub-divided. A part of those who adhered to Paul and Apollos might regard Saul with chief veneration, as being the founder of the church as the instrument of their conversion, as the chief apostle, as signally pure in his doctrine and manner; and a part might regard Apollos as the instrument of their conversion, and as being distinguished for eloquence."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The followers of Apollos preferred his more philosophical and rhetorical preaching to the simpler and more direct utterances of Paul."
2. "Peter would be the rallying-point for the Judaizing Christians, who claimed him as the apostle of the circumcision."
3. "The peculiar characteristics of this party, if it were such, can only be conjectured."

### John Calvin:
1. "My reason for saying that there are contentions among you is, because every one of you glories in the name of some individual."
2. "Where there are jarrings in religion, it cannot but be that menâ€™s minds will soon afterwards burst forth in open strife."
3. "The unity of the Church consists more especially in this one thing â€” that we all depend upon Christ alone, and that men thus occupy an inferior place, so as not to detract in any degree from his pre-eminence."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "People naturally have different tastes about styles of preaching and that is well"
2. "There is no evidence of a schism in doctrine between Paul and Peter."
3. "In scouting the names of the other leaders they lowered the name and rank of Christ to their level."

### John Gill:
1. "One part of them said, 'I am of Paul; he had been instrumental in their conversion... they were desirous of being called and distinguished by his name."
2. "But there was another party that said, 'and I of Apollos; in opposition to Paul... many were taken with his way of preaching; he was the preacher for them, and they chose to be called after him, and in distinction from others."
3. "Whilst another company of them said, 'and I of Cephas; or Peter, in opposition both to Paul and Apollos... for these must be supposed to be the converted Jews among them, who still retained a regard to the ceremonies of the law; wherefore they fixed on Peter as their minister, and to be called by his name."

2. "They spoke well, if they had not on this pretence despised their teachers."
3. "Perhaps they valued themselves on having heard Christ preach in his own person."
