# 1 Corinthians 1:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Is Christ divided? No, he is not. The unity of his body should not be fragmented or divided into different factions, for Christ is the one head of the Church. The glory and work of Christ should not be shared or divided between him and his servants. We should all be bound together in Christ, united and devoted to him alone, not seeking to divide his glory or undermine his authority. Christ is one, and his unity should be reflected in the unity of his body, the Church.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Is Christ (the Person of Christ, as the centre and bond of Christian unity not, the Gospel of Christ, nor the Church of Christ: nor the power of Christ) divided (not in the primary sense, but 'into various parts, one under one leader, another under another, which in fact would amount, after all, to a division against Himself)?"
2. "In μεμέρισται ὁ χριστός, the Majesty of Christ’s Person is set against the unworthy insinuation conveyed by μεμέρισται, in μὴ Παῦλος ἐσταυρώθη ὑπὲρ ὑμ. the meanness of the individual, Paul, is set against the triumph of divine Love implied in ἐστ. ὑπ. ὑμῶν. Two such contrasts could hardly but be differently expressed."
3. "Surely Paul was not crucified for you? By repudiating all possibility of himself being the Head and ἐπώνυμος of their church, he does so à fortiori for Cephas and Apollos: for he founded the Church at Corinth."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The unity of His body is not to be cut in pieces, as if all did not belong to Him, the One Head."
2. "'Was it Paul (surely you will not say so) that was crucified for you?' In the former question the majesty of 'CHRIST' (the Anointed One of God) implies the impossibility of His being 'divided.'"
3. "The cross claims us for Christ, as redeemed by Him; baptism, as dedicated to Him."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The apostle, therefore, asks, with strong emphasis, whether Christ was to be regarded as divided? Whether this single Supreme Head and Leader of the church, had become the head of different contending factions?"
2. "The atonement was the grand, crowning work of the Lord Jesus. It was through this that all the Corinthian Christians had been renewed and pardoned."
3. "By that, they had been solemnly and entirely devoted to the service of the only Saviour. 'Did I ever,' was the implied language of Paul, 'baptize in my own name? Did I ever pretend to organize a sect, announcing myself as a leader?'"

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Christ has been divided by your controversies. He is broken up into different party Christs." 
2. "Divided: so portioned up that one party may claim Him more than another." 
3. "Paul surely was not, etc. For is uJper on behalf of, not peri on account of, as some texts."

### John Calvin:
1. "Christ alone must reign in the Church...we should all be bound together in him..."
2. "We are not at liberty to put ourselves under bondage to men, because we are the Lord’s heritage."
3. "By this expression it is not simply intimated that baptism is founded on the authority of Christ, but depends also on his influence, and does in a manner consist in it; and, in fine, that the whole effect of it depends on this — that the name of Christ is therein invoked."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The fourth or Christ party claimed to possess Christ in a sense not true of the others."
2. "Paul shows his tact by employing himself as the illustration, rather than Apollos or Cephas."
3. "He is no rival of Christ."

### John Gill:
1. "Christ is not divided from his Father, not in nature; though he is to be distinguished from him, yet not to be divided."
2. "Nor is Christ divided from himself, not in his nature and person; the two natures, human and divine, are united in one person; they are to be distinguished, and not to be confounded, yet not to be separated as to wake two distinct persons."
3. "Nor is Christ divided from his Spirit, not from the person of the Spirit; he is to be distinguished from him as a person, but is one in nature with him; nor from his gifts and graces, which he has as man and Mediator without measure; nor from the work of the Spirit."

### John Wesley:
1. "Is Christ divided — Are not all the members still under one head?"
2. "The glory of Christ then is not to be divided between him and his servants."
3. "Neither is the unity of the body to be torn asunder, seeing Christ is one still."
