# 1 Corinthians 1:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
I am truly grateful that I did not baptize any of you, as it could have led to misunderstanding and division. I rejoice that God's providence worked in such a way that I baptized none of you, but rather left that task to others. Crispus, who used to be the ruler of the synagogue, and Gaius, who became a great host for the church, were baptized by me.

3. "There would have been no harm in it, but (as I have said) there is couched under this a heavy reproach against the Corinthians and their false apostles, inasmuch as a servant of the Lord found occasion to rejoice that he had refrained from a work, otherwise good and commendable, lest it should become an occasion of harm to them."
