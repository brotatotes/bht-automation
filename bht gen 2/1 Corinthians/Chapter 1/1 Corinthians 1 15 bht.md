# 1 Corinthians 1:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The apostle had a specific purpose in mind when he refrained from baptizing more people. He wanted to prevent any misunderstandings or accusations that he was baptizing in his own name, seeking personal honor and influence. By abstaining from baptizing, he avoided the possibility of individuals associating themselves with his name and forming a new sect. This decision aligned with Jesus' example, as even He did not personally baptize anyone to avoid similar controversies.
