# 1 Corinthians 1:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The passage mentions that Paul baptized the household of Stephanas. This includes adults, domestics, slaves, and children, which suggests that infants were included. Stephanas and his family were considered the firstfruits of Achaia, demonstrating their significance in the early church. While some argue that this supports the practice of infant baptism, it is important to note that Paul's focus is on the individuals he personally baptized in Corinth. He acknowledges that there may be others he baptized elsewhere but does not remember. This humility and admission show that Paul does not consider baptism essential to salvation or forgiveness.

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Paul calls him a first-fruit of Achaia (1 Corinthians 16:15) and so earlier than Crispus and he was one of the three who came to Paul from Corinth (1 Corinthians 16:17), clearly a family that justified Paul's personal attention about baptism."
2. "Besides (λοιπον). Accusative of general reference, 'as for anything else.' Added to make clear that he is not meaning to omit any one who deserves mention."
