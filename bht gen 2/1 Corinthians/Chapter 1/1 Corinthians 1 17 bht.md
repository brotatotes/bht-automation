# 1 Corinthians 1:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The role of baptism in Paul's mission was secondary to his primary purpose of preaching the gospel. This does not diminish the importance of baptism, as Paul highly esteemed it as a seal of our union with Christ. However, his main focus was to proclaim the good news and call people to repentance and to God. In doing so, he intentionally avoided relying on human wisdom or eloquence, recognizing that the power of the message lies in the simplicity of Christ crucified. It is through this straightforward declaration of truth that the transformative power of the gospel is realized.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "His mission was not to baptize: a trace already, of the separation of the offices of baptizing and preaching."
2. "It is evident that this is said in no derogation of Baptism, for he did on occasion baptize, and it would be impossible that he should speak lightly of the ordinance to which he appeals as the seal of our union with Christ."
3. "In wisdom of speech (i.e. the speculations of philosophy: that these are meant, and not mere eloquence or rhetorical form, appears by what follows, which treats of the subject, and not merely of the manner of the preaching) in order that the Cross of Christ might not be deprived of its effect."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Paul says this not to depreciate baptism; for he exalts it most highly."
2. "His and the apostles' peculiar work was to preach the Gospel, to found by their autoptic testimony particular churches, and then to superintend the churches in general."
3. "The cross of Christ—the sum and substance of the Gospel, Christ crucified."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Baptism was not his principal employment."
2. "The grand object of all ministers...to make known the glad tidings of salvation, and call people to repentance and to God."
3. "The preaching of the gospel depends for its success on the simple power of its truths, borne by the Holy Spirit to the hearts of people; and not on the power of argumentation, and the charms of eloquence."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The nucleus of the apostolic preaching was a fact - Christ crucified."
2. "To preach it as a philosophic system would be to empty it of its saving power."
3. "This truth finds abundant and lamentable illustration in the history of the Church."

### John Calvin:
1. "The duty of teaching had been principally enjoined upon him as that to which he should apply himself."
2. "The question here is, not as to the efficacy of baptism...but because it was given to few to teach, while many could baptize."
3. "The preaching of Christ crucified is simple and unadorned, and hence it ought not to be obscured by false ornaments of speech."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The injury done to the Cross by human wisdom" (1 Corinthians 1:17). 
2. "Wisdom of word here comprehends more than the mere rhetorical tricking out of the message, indeed, more or less of the substance of the message itself." 
3. "To a people thoroughly vitiated in their taste, to what temptation would the preacher of the Gospel be more open than that of shading off those features of it which are repulsive to the pride of the heart?"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "For Christ did not send me to be a baptizer like John the Baptist. But to preach the gospel." 
2. "Paul is fond of this late Greek verb from ευαγγελιον and sometimes uses both verb and substantive as in 1 Corinthians 15:1 'the gospel which I gospelized unto you.'"
3. "Not in wisdom of speech (singular). Preaching was Paul's forte, but it was not as a pretentious philosopher or professional rhetorician that Paul appeared before the Corinthians."

### John Gill:
1. "Baptism was not the chief and principal business he was sent about..."
2. "He was not sent so much about this work, but to preach the Gospel..."
3. "He was not sent with, or to preach, with words of man's wisdom, with human eloquence and oratory, with great swelling words of vanity, but in a plain, humble, modest manner..."

### John Wesley:
1. "For God did not send me to baptize — That was not my chief errand [...] but to preach the gospel"
2. "Not with wisdom of speech - With the artificial ornaments of discourse, invented by human wisdom."
3. "The whole effect of St. Paul's preaching was owing to the power of God accompanying the plain declaration of that great truth, 'Christ bore our sins upon the cross.'"
