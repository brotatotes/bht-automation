# 1 Corinthians 1:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
For the preaching of the cross, the doctrine of salvation by a crucified Christ, may seem foolish to those who reject it, viewing it as mere folly. However, to us who are saved, who have embraced the power of God through this message, it is the means by which we are delivered from sin and on the path to eternal salvation.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The preaching of the cross must mean: (1) That Christ died as an atoning sacrifice for the sins of people, and that it was this which gave its speciality to his sufferings on the cross. (2) That people can be reconciled to God, pardoned, and saved only by the merits and influence of this atoning sacrifice."
2. "The death on the cross was associated with the idea of all that is shameful and dishonorable; and to speak of salvation only by the sufferings and death of a crucified man, was suited to excite in their bosoms only unmingled scorn."

3. "In what way the preaching of the cross is the power of God unto salvation, we have explained in commenting upon Romans 1:16."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "For if to bid them change their whole course of life would startle them, to expect them to do it by believing in one who died a malefactor’s death would seem nothing less than sheer absurdity."
 2. "But unto us who are being saved... it is the power of God- divinely efficacious."
