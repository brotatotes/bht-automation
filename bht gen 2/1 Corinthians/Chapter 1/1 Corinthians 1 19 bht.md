# 1 Corinthians 1:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The prophecy from Isaiah 29:14 serves as a reminder that the wisdom of the wise can be confounded by God's divine intervention. It is not uncommon for individuals who consider themselves wise to make absurd judgments, showing the insufficiency of human wisdom. The Gospel often faces opposition and contempt from those considered wise in the eyes of the world, but its secret power cannot be ignored. As Isaiah declared, the wisdom of human understanding would be vanishing, ultimately revealing the superior wisdom of God.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The apostle does not affirm that this passage in Isaiah refers to the times of the gospel. The contrary is manifestly true.

2. "By these their wisdom and understanding would be nonplussed, so that they would reject them as foolishness, because their carnal reason could not reach them; which shows what an infatuation they were given up to."
3. "It was what was foretold in prophecy concerning the Jews, who had the oracles of God, and the advantage of a divine revelation; and therefore it need not be stumbling to them that are saved, that the Gospel should meet with so much scorn and contempt among them that perish in the Gentile world."

1. For it is written — And the words are remarkably applicable to this great event. Isaiah 29:14
