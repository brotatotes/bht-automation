# 1 Corinthians 1:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Corinthian church, known for its commercial significance and cultural influence, was recognized by Paul as a church of God due to their adherence to gospel doctrine and participation in sacraments. The believers in Corinth were called to be saints, set apart for God's service and sanctified through Jesus Christ. Despite certain flaws, the Corinthians were part of the universal body of Christ, together with all who call upon the name of our Lord Jesus Christ in worship and prayer. In this way, Paul's message reaches beyond the limits of Corinth to encompass all believers throughout the world.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Est enim hæc periculosa tentatio, nullam Ecclesiam putare ubi non appareat perfecta puritas." 
2. "The Church of England has adopted from this verse her solemn explanation of the term, in the 'prayer for all sorts and conditions of men:' 'More especially, we pray for the good estate of the Catholic Church; that it may be so guided and governed by thy good Spirit, that all who profess and call themselves Christians may be led into the way of truth, and hold the faith in unity of spirit, in the bond of peace, and in righteousness of life.'"
3. "The harshness of the position of ἡγιασμένοις ἐν χρ . Ἰης . is in favour of its being the original one: hallowed (i.e. dedicated) to God in (in union with and by means of) Jesus Christ."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "It is a dangerous temptation to think there is no church where there is not apparent perfect purity."
2. "It was the Church of God, not of this or of that favorite leader."
3. "The true CATHOLIC CHURCH...consisting of all, wherever they be, who call on Jesus as their Savior in sincerity."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The church is called 'the church of God,' because it has been founded by His agency, and was devoted to his service." 
2. "To those who are made holy... implies that they were in fact holy... truly devoted to God."
3. "The Lord of all - both Jews and Gentiles - of all who profess themselves Christians, of whatever country or name they might have originally been."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The commercial position of Corinth was, therefore, most important, communicating with the eastern and the western world, with the north and the south."
2. "It was the 'Vanity Fair' of the Roman Empire, at once the London and the Paris of the first century after Christ."
3. "When, therefore, the apostle preached to the Corinthians, the Gospel spoke to the whole world and to the living present."

### John Calvin:
1. "What ground, then, had Paul for recognizing a Church at Corinth? It was this: that he saw among them the doctrine of the gospel, baptism, the Lord’s Supper — tokens by which a Church ought to be judged of."
2. "Now the term sanctification denotes separation. This takes place in us when we are regenerated by the Spirit to newness of life, that we may serve God and not the world."
3. "For, after making mention of all that in every place call upon the name of Christ our Lord, he adds, both theirs and ours, manifestly for the purpose of showing that Christ is the one common Lord, without distinction, of all that call upon him, whether they be Jews or Gentiles."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Called to be saints; not in the mere external sense of Matthew 20:16, but in that inward, efficacious, saving sense which invariably issues in the cordial reception of the Gospel message."
2. "To get rid of the natural sense of these words, a passive sense has been put upon them, as if the meaning were who are called by the name of Christ [...] but in these two places it is the middle sense of the verb ‘call’ (‘calling on’ or ‘invoking’) that is plainly intended."
3. "When we find a phrase transferred to Christians, defining them as ‘callers upon,’ ‘invokers,’ or ‘worshippers of’ Christ, what can we conclude but that the first Christians were taught to regard their Master as the rightful Heir of all the worship which the ancient Church had been trained to render to Jehovah alone?"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The church of God (τη εκκλησια του θεου). Belonging to God, not to any individual or faction, as this genitive case shows."
2. "It is God's church even in Corinth, 'laetum et ingens paradoxon' (Bengel)."
3. "He [Christ] is the sphere in which this act of consecration takes place."

### John Gill:
1. "a church of God is not to be unchurched for everything that is amiss in them"
2. "though they were chosen to holiness in Christ, and through sanctification of the Spirit unto salvation, yet before calling were unholy"
3. "Invocation of the name of Christ not only respects prayer to him, but includes the whole of religious worship"

### John Wesley:
1. "Sanctified through Jesus Christ — And so undoubtedly they were in general, notwithstanding some exceptions."
2. "With all that in every place — Nothing could better suit that catholic love which St. Paul labours to promote in this epistle, than such a declaration of his good wishes for every true Christian upon earth."
3. "Call upon the name of our Lord Jesus Christ — This plainly implies that all Christians pray to Christ, as well as to the Father through him."
