# 1 Corinthians 1:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Where are the wise and the scribe, those who boast in their wisdom and knowledge? Where is the disputer of this world? God has made foolish the wisdom of this world, which is shown to be of no value when compared to the Gospel of Christ. Just as God brought deliverance to Judea from Sennacherib, He has shown that human wisdom and understanding are futile in the face of His victorious plan of salvation.
