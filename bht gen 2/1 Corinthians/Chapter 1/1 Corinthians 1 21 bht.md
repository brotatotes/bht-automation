# 1 Corinthians 1:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
For all of humanity's wisdom, both Jews and Gentiles failed to truly know God. Despite the clear signs of His existence in creation and the testimony of the prophets, they remained spiritually blind. God, in His infinite wisdom, chose a seemingly foolish path to bring salvation to those who would believe. The preaching of the Gospel, which the world may regard as foolishness, is in fact the power of God unto salvation. Through the proclamation of the Gospel, God regenerates and quickens hearts, revealing the need for salvation and pointing to Christ as the source of true redemption.
