# 1 Corinthians 1:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Jews, like always, were seeking miraculous signs as evidence of the divine message. On the other hand, the Greeks were in pursuit of worldly wisdom and intellectual understanding. Despite these different desires, the message of Christianity is centered on the crucifixion of Christ, which may seem weak and foolish to both groups. In every generation, there are those who demand visible miracles and those who rely solely on human reason. However, the true power of the Gospel lies not in signs and wisdom, but in the transformative message of the cross.

3. "By an incessant demand for miracles, they in a manner sought to bind God to their laws — that, in accordance with the dullness of their apprehension, they sought as it were to feel him out in manifest miracles — that they were taken up with the miracles themselves, and looked upon them with amazement — and, in fine, that no miracles satisfied them, but instead of this, they every day gaped incessantly for new ones."

### Philip Schaff:
