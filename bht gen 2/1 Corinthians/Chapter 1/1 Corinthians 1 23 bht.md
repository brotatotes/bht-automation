# 1 Corinthians 1:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
We boldly proclaim the message of Christ crucified, not engaging in futile debates or arguments. This message is a stumbling block to the Jews who expected a triumphant Messiah and a stumbling block to the Gentiles who view it as foolishness. Despite the opposition and ridicule we face from both groups, we continue to preach the plain historical truth of Christ's crucifixion, which is the only hope of salvation.
