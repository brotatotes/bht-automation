Christ, in all his humility, is both the power and wisdom of God. Through his cross, death, life, and kingdom, he reveals himself as the answer to both Jews and Greeks. When people are called out of darkness and illuminated by the Spirit of God, they see the beauty and excellence of Christ and his Gospel. In his crucifixion, he bears the sins of his people and satisfies justice, all while destroying the work of Satan. Those who are open-minded and called by God experience the power and wisdom of Christ firsthand.
