# 1 Corinthians 1:25 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The wisdom of God, as displayed in the gospel, may seem foolish to the world, but in reality, it surpasses all human wisdom. Similarly, the apparent weakness of God, seen in the crucifixion of Christ, is stronger than any strength that humans possess. The gospel, which the world deems as foolishness, is actually wiser and more powerful than anything that humans can comprehend.
