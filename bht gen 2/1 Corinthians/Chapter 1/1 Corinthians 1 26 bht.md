# 1 Corinthians 1:26 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Behold your calling – consider the nature of those whom God calls. Not many of them are wise or mighty according to worldly standards. The majority of the Christian church consists of those whom the world would deem foolish or weak. This is intentional on God's part, as He often chooses and calls individuals with different backgrounds and characteristics. The success of the gospel does not depend on human wisdom or strength, but rather on the divine wisdom and power of God.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "As a proof that the foolishness of God is wiser than men and the weakness of God stronger than men, he calls attention to the fact that the Christian church, so full of divine wisdom and strength by the indwelling Spirit of God, consisted for the most part, not of the wise or mighty among men, but of those whom the world despised."
2. "That not many of you are wise according to the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble."
3. "The ancient Christians were for the most part slaves and men of low station; the whole history of the expansion of the church is in reality a progressive victory of the ignorant over the learned, the lowly over the lofty, until the emperor himself laid down his crown before the cross of Christ."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "What Paul is dwelling on is the weakness of the instrumentality which the Lord employed to convert the world."
2. "The whole history of the expansion of the Church is a progressive victory of the ignorant over the learned, the lowly over the lofty."
3. "wise ... after the flesh—the wisdom of this world acquired by human study without the Spirit."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The design of the apostle here is, to show that the gospel did not depend for its success on human wisdom."
2. "His argument is, that 'in fact' those who were blessed by it had not been of the elevated ranks of life mainly, but that God had shown his power by choosing those who were ignorant, and vicious, and abandoned, and by reforming and purifying their lives."
3. "The reason why God had chosen his people from that rank is stated in 1 Corinthians 1:29."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Calling (klhsin). Not condition of life, but your calling by God; not depending on wisdom, power, or lineage."
2. "Noble [ευγενεις] . Of high birth. So originally, though as Greece became democratic, it came to signify merely the better sort of freemen."
3. "Aeschylus makes Clytaemnestra say to the captive Cassandra that if slavery must befall one there is an advantage in having masters of ancient family property instead of those who have become unexpectedly rich."

### John Calvin:
1. "Understanding it in the imperative, he stirs them up, as it were, from their drowsiness to a consideration of the matter itself."
2. "Paul [...] does not say here, that there are none of the noble and mighty that have been called by God, but that there are few."
3. "Let those, therefore, that are contemptible in the eyes of the world, think thus with themselves: 'What modesty is called for on our part, when even those that have high honor in the view of the world have nothing left them?'"

### Philip Schaff:
1. "For behold your calling, brethren, how that not many wise men after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble, are called."
2. "This imperative rendering is preferable to the indicative of our Authorised Version: 'Ye see.' It is the peculiar usage of the New Testament, and it is thrice so used in this very Epistle."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Behold (βλεπετε). Same form for imperative present active plural and indicative."
2. "Either makes sense as in John 5:39 εραυνατε and 1 Corinthians 14:1 πιστευετε."
3. "Calling (κλησιν). The act of calling by God, based not on the external condition of those called (κλητο, verse 1 Corinthians 1:2), but on God's sovereign love."
4. "It is a clinching illustration of Paul's argument, an argumentum ad hominem."
5. "How that (οτ). Explanatory apposition to κλησιν."
6. "After the flesh (κατα σαρκα). According to the standards of the flesh and to be used not only with σοφο (wise, philosophers), but also δυνατο (men of dignity and power), ευγενεις (noble, high birth), the three claims to aristocracy (culture, power, birth)."
7. "Are called. Not in the Greek, but probably to be supplied from the idea in κλησιν."

### John Gill:
1. "The apostle does not say that there were none of the wise, the mighty, and noble called... but there were not many of them; instances of this kind are but few recorded in the Scripture."
2. "Nobility, riches, and learning, as they do not at all contribute towards a man's salvation, so neither can they hinder it where grace takes place."
3. "Generally speaking, God has thought fit, for wise reasons, to choose and call persons of different characters."

### John Wesley:
1. "Behold your calling — What manner of men they are whom God calls."
2. "Not many wise men after the flesh — In the account of the world."
3. "Not many mighty — Men of power and authority."
