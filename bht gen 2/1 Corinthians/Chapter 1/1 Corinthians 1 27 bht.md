# 1 Corinthians 1:27 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
God's choice of individuals, considered foolish by worldly standards, demonstrates His deliberate and graceful will. His purpose is to humble the wisdom of the world and bring salvation to those who may seem unwise. This deliberate selection serves to confound the wise and bring shame to their supposed superiority. The outcome of God's choice is to astonish the rich and mighty by exalting the lowly and giving them positions of honor and glory.

3.
