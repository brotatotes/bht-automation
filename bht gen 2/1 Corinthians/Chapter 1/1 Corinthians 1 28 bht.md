# 1 Corinthians 1:28 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Jews, in their contempt for the Gentiles, often referred to them as 'those who are not.' Conversely, they held themselves in high esteem. However, God, in His wisdom, chose the despised and insignificant things of the world to bring down the things that are highly valued by men. This serves as a reminder that God's ways are not man's ways, and He often uses the weak and lowly to accomplish His purposes.
