# 1 Corinthians 1:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The greeting of Grace be to you is a familiar salutation that Paul often uses in his epistles, including the one being addressed here. It reflects the concept of unmerited favor and blessing that comes from God. The subsequent wish for peace is a desire for harmony and tranquility that can only be found in a close relationship with God. This combination of grace and peace emphasizes the richness of God's love and the need for inner calm in the midst of life's challenges.
