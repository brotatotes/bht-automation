# 1 Corinthians 1:30 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Those who belong to God receive their spiritual life from Him, for He is the author of it. In Christ Jesus, wisdom is found in various aspects - in His incarnation, in His obedience, in His teaching, in His atoning death, and in His glorification and sending of the Spirit. The terms righteousness, sanctification, and redemption illustrate and exemplify the wisdom manifested in Christ. By faith, we apprehend in Christ both forgiveness of sins and regeneration, for He is the source of our righteousness and holiness. We are chosen and placed in Christ by God's grace alone.
