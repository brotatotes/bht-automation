This confirmation of the testimony of Christ attested to the truth of the gospel and was evident in the transformation of the Corinthians as a community. The Corinthians recognized that these gifts were bestowed upon them through the ministry of Paul, which served as a reminder of their previous reverence and affection for him as their spiritual father.
