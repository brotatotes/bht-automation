# 1 Corinthians 10:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Consider the experiences of your forefathers who, although chosen by God and given special privileges, were ultimately rejected by Him. They were under the protective cloud, a visible symbol of God's presence, which shielded them from the elements and provided guidance. They also passed through the sea as God miraculously opened a path for them. Reflecting on these accounts, we should be mindful of the possibility of being rejected by God ourselves if we do not heed His warnings and remain faithful.
