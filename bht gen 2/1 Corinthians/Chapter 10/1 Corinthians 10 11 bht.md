# 1 Corinthians 10:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The examples and admonitions of past events in Scripture teach us important principles of human nature and divine governance. They depict the weaknesses of humanity and our need for divine protection. These lessons are not exclusive to the Corinthians but have relevance for Christians in all periods. As the last dispensation, we are living in a time where the consequences and lessons of these examples hold even greater weight. The ends of the ages have arrived, representing the culmination of God's plan and underscoring the significance of the present age.
