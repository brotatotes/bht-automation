# 1 Corinthians 10:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Let him who believes himself to be standing firmly take heed, for it is this very confidence that puts him at risk of falling. We must not be deceived by our own sense of security, but instead remain vigilant and cautious. The danger lies in thinking we are self-sufficient, for it is in our weakness and dependence on God that we find true safety. We should never become complacent or rely solely on our own strength, but always remember the need to rely on God's grace and guidance.
