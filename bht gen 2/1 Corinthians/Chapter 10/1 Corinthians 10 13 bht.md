# 1 Corinthians 10:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
No temptation that they faced was beyond human endurance, as it was either common to everyone or within their capacity to bear with divine assistance. God is faithful and will not allow them to be tempted beyond what they can handle. He will also provide a way for them to escape the temptation, as he allows it and arranges it for their ultimate deliverance.
