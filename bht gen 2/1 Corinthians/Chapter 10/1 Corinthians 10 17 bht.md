# 1 Corinthians 10:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When we partake of the bread of communion, we become one bread with Christ and one body with Him, signifying our union with Him. This communion is what brings us all together as one, despite our many individual differences. We are like different parts of one and the same broken bread, all united in our shared participation in the body of Christ. As we receive the bread, it serves to unite us and emphasize our oneness as believers in the body of Christ.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "By partaking of that bread, we become, not figuratively but literally, one bread: it passes into the substance of our bodies, and there is in every one who partakes, a portion of himself which is that bread."
2. "The argument is a very simple and direct one; the bread is the Body of Christ; we partake of the bread: therefore we partake of the Body of Christ."
3. "The above remarks show also the untenableness of the rendering of Calv., Beza, Bengel, al., 'because there is one bread (antecedent), we being many are one body' (consequent): for this would parenthesize 1 Corinthians 10:17, and take it altogether out of the argument, giving it a sense which, as occurring here, would be vapid."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "We, the many (namely, believers assembled; so the Greek), are one bread (by our partaking of the same loaf, which becomes assimilated to the substance of all our bodies; and so we become), one body."
2. "One loaf alone seems to have been used in each celebration."
3. "We . . . all—Greek, 'the whole of us.'"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "We are all one society; united as one, and for the same object."
2. "Our partaking of the same bread is an emblem of the fact that we are one."
3. "And we thus show publicly that we are united, and belong to the same great family."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Seeing that there is one bread, we who are many are one body."
2. "By each and all receiving a piece of the one loaf, which represents Christ's body, they signify that they are all bound in one spiritual body, united to Christ and therefore to each other."
3. "That all may be one by partaking of His blood."

### John Calvin:
1. "He mentions this by the way, that the Corinthians may understand that we must, even by external profession, maintain that unity which subsists between us and Christ."
2. "In this second part of the statement, he makes mention only of the one part of the Sacrament, and it is the manner of Scripture to describe by Synecdoche the entire Supper by the breaking of bread."
3. "It is necessary to warn my readers, in passing, as to this, lest any less experienced person should be put off his guard by the foolish cavil that is brought forward by certain sycophants."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "In all ancient times friends were made one over a common meal; much more is this oneness manifested when, on some festal occasion, great principles are represented and celebrated by those whose principles they are."
2. "How much more when Christians, as 'one body,' 'eat of that bread' in which their Lord would have them see 'His body broken for them,' and 'drink of that cup' in which they were to see 'His blood of the new covenant shed for them,' Thus was their common oneness with Him, in the first instance, and in virtue of this, their oneness among themselves, visibly set forth and palpably expressed."
3. "Now comes the conclusion to be drawn from this in relation to idolatrous feasts that, on the same principle, all who partake of idol feasts partake of the idolatries themselves, and have fellowship with the idol-deities there represented."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "One bread (εις αρτος). One loaf."
2. "Of the one bread (του ενος αρτου). Of the one loaf."
3. "One body (εν σωμα). Here the mystical spiritual body of Christ as in 1 Corinthians 12:12, the spiritual kingdom or church of which Christ is head (Colossians 1:18; Ephesians 5:23)."

### John Gill:
1. "The several members of the church of Christ; particular believers are indeed many, considered in themselves, in their own persons; yet by virtue of their union to Christ, which is manifested by their communion with him, they are one bread with him, the bread of life, and one body with his, signified by the bread."
2. "They are of one and the same mass and lump, they are incorporated together, they are flesh of his flesh, and one spirit with him."
3. "Believers, though they are many, yet are one body, of which Christ is the head; one in union with him and one another, and one in their communion together at the Lord's table."

### John Wesley:
1. "For it is this communion which makes us all one."
2. "We being many are yet, as it were, but different parts of one and the same broken bread."
