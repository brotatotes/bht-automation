# 1 Corinthians 10:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Behold the distinction between literal Israel, the Jewish people, and the spiritual Israel, the Christians who are the true children of faith. Just as those who partake of the sacrifices in the Jewish context have communion with the altar and the God to whom they are offered, so too do those who eat of the sacrifices offered to idols declare their fellowship with and worship of idols. Let us remember that our spiritual worship and communion with God are of greater significance than any carnal or idolatrous acts.
