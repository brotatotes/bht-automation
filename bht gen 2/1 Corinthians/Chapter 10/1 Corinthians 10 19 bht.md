# 1 Corinthians 10:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
An idol is not something divine or real, for it is nothing but a delusion. Therefore, when the Gentiles sacrifice to idols, they are actually offering their sacrifices to demons. It is important to understand that idols have no power or significance, but the intent and motive behind the sacrifices are what matter. The uncanny connection between heathen worship and the dominion of Satan and his angels should not be overlooked.
