# 1 Corinthians 10:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Israelites, like Christians through baptism, entered into a covenant with God and were initiated into the Mosaic economy. The cloud and the sea served as symbols of their initiation, with the cloud providing shade from God's wrath and the sea representing their passage through water. The Israelites recognized Moses as their leader and professed subjection to his laws. While they did not immerse in the waters of the sea, their passage through it signified their burial with Christ and resurrection to a new life. Their baptism into Moses mirrored our baptism into Christ, both signifying a spiritual union.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Entered by the act of such immersion into a solemn covenant with God, and became His church under the law as given by Moses, Godâ€™s servant, just as we Christians by our baptism are bound in a solemn covenant with God, and enter His Church under the Gospel as brought in by Christ, Godâ€™s eternal Son." (43 words)
2. "The cloud and the sea were both aqueous; serves the Apostle to indicate the outward symbols of their initiation into the church under the government of Moses as the servant of God, and to complete the analogy with our baptism." (38 words)
3. "The allegory is obviously not to be pressed minutely: for neither did they enter the cloud, nor were they wetted by the waters of the sea; but they passed under both, as the baptized passes under the water." (32 words)

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Baptized" is here equivalent to "initiated": it is used in accommodation to Paul's argument to the Corinthians; they, it is true, have been "baptized," but so also virtually were the Israelites of old; if the virtual baptism of the latter availed not to save them from the doom of lust, neither will the actual baptism of the former save them.
2. There is a resemblance between the symbols also: for the cloud and sea consist of water, and as these took the Israelites out of sight, and then restored them again to view, so the water does to the baptized.
3. Christ is the pillar cloud that screens us from the heat of God's wrath.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "They were baptized 'in the cloud' and 'in the sea,' and this cannot be understood as a religious rite administered by the hand of man."
2. "They received and acknowledged him [Moses] as their ruler and guide; they professed subjection to his laws, and were brought under his authority. They were thus 'initiated into' his religion, and thus recognized his divine mission, and bound themselves to obey his injunctions."
3. "From this whole narrative it is evident that they passed through the sea without being 'immersed' in it. The waters were driven into high adjacent walls for the very purpose that they might pass between them dry and safe."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Baptized unto Moses...They were introduced into a spiritual union with Moses, and constituted his disciples."
2. "The cloud and the sea are in their nature water."
3. "The cloud was diffused and suspended water."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "and were all baptized into Moses i.e. into the Mosaic economy." 
2. "even as the Christians had the starting-point of their new life when publicly 'baptized into Christ.'"


### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The mystic cloud covered the people while the sea rose in walls on each side of them as they marched across."
2. "The immersion was complete for all of them in the sea around them and the cloud over them."
3. "Moses was their leader then as Christ is now and so Paul uses ÎµÎ¹Ï‚ concerning the relation of the Israelites to Moses as he does of our baptism in relation to Christ."

### John Gill:
1. "Their baptism was in the cloud, and in the sea; which may be considered either as together or separately... and very fitly represented the ordinance of baptism as performed by immersion." 
2. "Their following Moses into the sea, which is meant by their being 'baptized into him', was an acknowledgment of their regard unto him, as their guide and governor, as baptism is a following of Christ... and a profession of our faith in him, as our surety and Savior."
3. "The descent of the Israelites into the sea... has a very great agreement with baptism, as administered by immersion, in which the person baptized goes down into the water, is buried with Christ therein, and comes up out of it as out of a grave."

### John Wesley:
1. "Initiated into the religion which he taught them."
2. "Perhaps sprinkled here and there with drops of water from the sea or the cloud, by which baptism might be the more evidently signified."
