# 1 Corinthians 10:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Idol worship is a dangerous practice, as revealed in the passage at hand. Although idols themselves hold no power, they are used as mediums for worshipping other supernatural beings. Paul emphasizes that sacrifices offered by the Gentiles are not made to true gods, but rather to devils. The idea of demonic influence behind idolatry is a recurring theme in the New Testament. To avoid falling into this trap, believers are urged to stay away from idolatrous practices and any associations with them, as they involve communion with demons.
