# 1 Corinthians 10:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Partaking in the Lord's Supper symbolizes a deep communion with Christ and dedication to Him. On the contrary, participating in idolatrous feasts indicates a harmful fellowship with demons. It is impossible to have true allegiance to both.

3. "Either the sentiment is unmeaning, or it is a prayer offered to a pagan god, or it is mockery of Yahweh; and in either case it is improper and wicked."

### Marvin Vincent:
