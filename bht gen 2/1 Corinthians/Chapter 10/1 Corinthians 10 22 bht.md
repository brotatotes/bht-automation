# 1 Corinthians 10:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Nothing is more highly resented by God than when we divide our worship between Him and idols. It's as if we are proclaiming a war against Him, which is a futile attempt for we are feeble compared to His omnipotence. Giving in to idolatry not only brings us into fellowship with demons but also exposes us to the wrath of an almighty and provoked God. Let us not deceive ourselves; we cannot provoke the Lord without consequences, and we are certainly not stronger than Him to withstand His anger.

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Do we provoke the Lord to jealousy?—by dividing our fellowship between Him and idols."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The sentiment of Paul is, that to join in the worship of idols, or in the observance of their feasts, would be to participate in that which had ever been regarded by God with special abhorrence, and which more than anything else tended to provoke his wrath."
2. "Any course of life that tends to alienate the affections from God, and to fix them on other beings or objects, is a sin of the same kind as that referred to here."
3. "And it may be asked of Christians now, whether they will by such inordinate attachments provoke the Lord to wrath? whether they will thus excite his displeasure, and expose themselves to his indignation?"

### Marvin Vincent:

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The word 'jealousy,' as applied to God, seems to express the sense of slighted love in one of two wedded parties towards the other."
2. "Here this idea is transferred to Christ; for since 'the table of the Lord' certainly means Christ’s eucharistic table, 'the Lord,' whom they 'provoked to jealousy' by partaking both of it and of idol-feasts, must be the Lord Jesus."
3. "Would ye try your strength against His?"
