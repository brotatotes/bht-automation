## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "He recurs to the plea of ch. 1 Corinthians 6:12; reasserts his modification of it, with a view, after what has passed since, to shew its reasonableness, and to introduce the following directions."
2. "οἰκοδομεῖ] viz. the Christian body: tend to build up the whole, or the individual parts, of that spiritual temple, God’s οἰκοδομή."

3. "Paul does not appeal to the apostolic decision, which seems to have been not so much regarded outside of Palestine, but rather to the broad principle of true Christian freedom, which does not allow us to be governed by external things, as though, because we can use them, we must use them (1 Corinthians 6:12). Their use or non-use is to be regulated by regard to edification."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Though it may be admitted that it was strictly 'lawful' to partake of that meat, yet there were strong reasons why it was inexpedient; and those reasons ought to have the binding force of law."
