# 1 Corinthians 10:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Our aim should be to bring one another to perfection and not merely seek personal gratification. Instead of focusing solely on pleasing ourselves, we are called to prioritize the welfare and betterment of others. This means considering the purity and salvation of those around us and being willing to forego our own rights or interests when it is for the benefit of our neighbors. It is through this selfless attitude that we can truly embody the love and compassion that Christ calls us to.
