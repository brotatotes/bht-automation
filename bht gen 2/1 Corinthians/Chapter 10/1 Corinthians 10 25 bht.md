# 1 Corinthians 10:25 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Corinthians are advised to exercise caution regarding purchasing and eating meat that may have been offered to idols. The important factor to consider is conscience, as it determines the acceptability of consuming such meat. The market is a place where meat is sold indiscriminately, and inquiring about its origin may lead to unnecessary scruples. Therefore, the Corinthians are encouraged not to ask questions but to buy and eat the meat without concerns regarding its idolatrous associations. This principle applies to the market and not to the idol's temple, where caution should be exercised.

2. "They were to abstain from attending on the feasts of the idols in the temple, from partaking of meat that had been offered them, and from celebrations observed expressly in honor of idols; but lest they should become too scrupulous, the apostle tells them that if the meat was offered indiscriminately in the market with other meat, they were not to hesitate to purchase it, or eat it."
3. "Asking no question for conscience‚Äô sake - Not hesitating or doubting, as if it might possibly have been offered in sacrifice. Not being scrupulous, as if it were possible that the conscience should be defiled."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "In the Macellum at Pompeii we can imagine to ourselves the poor Christians buying their modest pound of meat in the Corinthian Macellum (1 Corinthians 10:25), with the same life-like reality with which the Diocletian maximum tariff called up the picture of the Galilean woman purchasing her five sparrows."
