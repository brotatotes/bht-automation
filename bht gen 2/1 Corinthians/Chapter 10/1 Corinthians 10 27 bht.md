# 1 Corinthians 10:27 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Christianity does not require us to withdraw from social life or break the bonds of contact. We are encouraged to engage in society, taking care not to harm weak consciences. While attending a feast offered by non-believers, it is best to be cautious and considerate. Though it may be preferable to decline, there is no absolute prohibition. We are permitted to partake in the meal, asking no questions for conscience sake. In such situations, the goal is to maintain Christian principles and promote the comfort and usefulness of believers.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Christianity is not designed to abolish the courtesies of social life; or to break the bonds of contact; or to make people misanthropes or hermits."
2. "It allows and cultivates, under proper Christian restraints, the contact in society which will promote the comfort of people, and especially that which may extend the usefulness of Christians."

### John Calvin:
1. "He shows then, in short, that care must be taken not to hurt weak consciences."
2. "He intimates indirectly, that he does not altogether approve of it, and that it would be better if they declined, but as it is a thing indifferent, he does not choose to forbid it absolutely."
3. "It becomes us to proceed with caution, where we see that we are in danger of falling."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "If one of them that believe not biddeth you to a feast not an idolatrous festival, but a social feast."

3. "Whatsoever is set before you, eat, asking no questions for conscience sake."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
