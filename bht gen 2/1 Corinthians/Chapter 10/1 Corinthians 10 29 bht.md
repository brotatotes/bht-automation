# 1 Corinthians 10:29 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When considering matters of Christian freedom, it is important to take into account the conscience of others who may have different convictions. One should not exercise their liberty to the point of causing offense or leading others into sin. It is better to abstain from certain practices if it means avoiding condemnation and preserving unity among believers. Ultimately, our own consciences should be the guiding factor in making decisions, not the opinions or persuasions of others.
