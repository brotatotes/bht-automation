# 1 Corinthians 10:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The manna mentioned here is described as spiritual meat and is a symbolic representation of the Christian sacrament of Baptism. It signified the purity and excellence of the heavenly provision from God. This manna, although physical food, had a deeper spiritual meaning and represented the true bread from heaven, which is Jesus Christ. Just as the manna was a gift from God, the sacraments are also gifts that hold great importance in the Christian faith. They are not merely signs or remembrances but have a profound impact on one's membership in Christ.

3. "We can scarcely avoid recognizing in these words a tacit reference to our Lordâ€™s discourse, or at all events to the substance of it."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
