# 1 Corinthians 10:33 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In his pursuit to please all people, the apostle Paul strived to accommodate himself to others, making sure not to compromise his own conscience or the real good of others. He aimed to be a faithful servant of Christ, setting an example through his self-denial and holiness. His ultimate goal was to lead others to salvation, seeking not his own advantage but the spiritual well-being of those he encountered. By behaving in this manner with all men, Paul hoped to fulfill his calling as an instrument of God's grace and mercy.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "His own course of conduct: As I in all things please (‘am pleasing:’ as Meyer well remarks, not the result, but the practice on Paul’s part;"
2. "His great aim and end; so ch. 1 Corinthians 9:22."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. 33. I please—I try to please
	(1 Corinthians 9:19; 1 Corinthians 9:22;
	Romans 15:2). 
	not seeking mine own—
	(1 Corinthians 10:24). 
	many—rather as Greek,
	"THE many."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "His main object had been to please all people; that is, not to alarm their prejudices, or needlessly to excite their opposition, while he made known to them the truth, and sought their salvation."
2. "It is well when a minister can without ostentation appeal to his own example, and urge others to a life of self-denial and holiness, by his own manner of living, and by what he is himself in his daily walk and conversation."

### John Calvin:
1. "Paul accommodated himself to men only in things indifferent, and in things lawful in themselves."
2. "The former is that sweet inoffensiveness of spirit which teaches us to lay aside all self-will and self-importance, that charity which 'seeketh not her own,' and 'is not easily provoked;' it is that spirit, in short, which the same writer elsewhere recommends from the example of Christ himself."
3. "The latter spirit referred to is that sordid compliance with the corruptions of human nature, of which flatterers and deceivers have always availed themselves, not for the glory of God or the good of men, but for the promotion of their own selfish designs."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Within the limits of Christian consistency, and so far as was fitted to win others to Christ, he was ready to go; but concessions compromising his own conscience, and against the real good of others, he would never make."
2. "Indeed, on one occasion, when a fellow-apostle yielded on this point, his indignation was roused, and he was constrained to administer a rebuke (Galatians 2:11, etc.)."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Mine own profit (το εμουτου συμφερον). Old word from συμφερω, to bear together, and explains use of verb in verse 1 Corinthians 10:23."
2. "That they may be saved (ινα σωθωσιν). First aorist passive subjunctive of σωζω, to save, with ινα purpose clause with same high motive as in 1 Corinthians 9:22."
3. "This is the ruling passion of Paul in his dealings with men."

### John Gill:
1. "The apostle sets himself as an example...in all to act the part of a faithful servant of Christ." 
2. "He neglected his own private advantage...that they may be saved."
3. "He behaved in this manner to all men, that he might be the instrument of the spiritual good and salvation of the chosen ones among them."
