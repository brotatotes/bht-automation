# 1 Corinthians 10:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Israelites in the wilderness drank from a spiritual rock that accompanied them, which was a typification of Christ. This rock, though not physically following them, was a source of supernatural blessings bestowed upon them by God. The water flowing from the rock represented the Messiah and the blessings that come from Him. Similarly, Christians, like the Israelites, journey through this world as pilgrims, with the wilderness representing the challenges they face. This biblical account demonstrates the continuity between the Old and New Testaments, as the rock symbolizes Christ's presence with His people throughout history.

3. "The gushing fountain of water might be regarded as a representation of the Messiah, and of the blessings which result from him... Christians, like the children of Israel, are passing through the world as pilgrims, and to them that world is a wilderness - a desert."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "This 'meat' and 'drink' are called 'spiritual,' perhaps primarily, as having been supplied supernaturally... but mainly because under this merely outward and visible sustenance, by which the chosen people were enabled to pursue their way to the Promised Land, is couched the higher nutriment of God’s true people which certainly is 'Christ' in their progress towards the 'better country.'" 
2. "The reader should observe how, five times in the course of these four opening verses, the word 'all' is ominously repeated, the more emphatically to make the sad contrast between the commencement and the close of the journey... how all had a common start, and, almost to the end, all made common progress, and yet, as is now to be added, in the case of most of them, far from a common end."
