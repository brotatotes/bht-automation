# 1 Corinthians 10:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The caution against idolatry is given in the second person, highlighting the severity of the danger the Corinthians were facing. The apostle warns them not to become idolaters, just as the Israelites did when they worshipped the golden calf. The word play in this context refers to the licentious revelry that was part of idol-worship. It is important to heed this warning, as God has shown in the past how much He abhors idolatry and the consequences that follow. So, let us not forget the lessons of the past and guard ourselves against any form of idolatry.
