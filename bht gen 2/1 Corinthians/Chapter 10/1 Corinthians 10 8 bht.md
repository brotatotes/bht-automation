# 1 Corinthians 10:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Corinthians were warned against the dangers of practicing fornication, as it was a prevalent sin among them. In the book of Numbers, we learn about the punishment that came upon the Israelites who had engaged in fornication and idolatry, resulting in the death of twenty-four thousand individuals. This severe consequence serves as a reminder of the seriousness of such immoral actions, and it highlights the close association between idolatry and fornication. The apostle Paul urges the Corinthians to learn from this history and refrain from engaging in these destructive behaviors.
