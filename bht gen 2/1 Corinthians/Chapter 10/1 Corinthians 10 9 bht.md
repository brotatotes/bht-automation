# 1 Corinthians 10:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Let us be cautious not to tempt Christ by doubting His power and faithfulness. Just as the Israelites, who had experienced the miraculous provision of water from the rock, still complained and murmured out of unbelief. Our lack of trust in Christ's ability to supply our needs can lead us astray and hinder us from experiencing His full provision in our lives. Let us instead place our faith entirely in Him and His promises.
