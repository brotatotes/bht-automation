# 1 Corinthians 11:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Women wearing a veil in public worship signifies their subjection to their husbands and respects God's order of authority. The angels, who observe and appreciate the importance of order and subordination, are present in worship, and it is crucial for women to maintain a modest and submissive appearance. Wearing a veil is not limited to married women, but applies to all women as a means of honoring God's divine economy. By doing so, women avoid disrupting the divine harmony and show their reverence for God and the angels who witness their worship.

"It is asked, whether he speaks of married women exclusively, for there are some that restrict to them what Paul here teaches, on the ground that it does not belong to virgins to be under the authority of a husband.

3. "When, therefore, women venture upon such liberties, as to usurp for themselves the token of authority, they make their baseness manifest to the angels.
