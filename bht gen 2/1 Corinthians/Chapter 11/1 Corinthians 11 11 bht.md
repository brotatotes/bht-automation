# 1 Corinthians 11:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the Lord Jesus, there is neither male nor female. This powerful statement reminds us that in the kingdom of God, there is no differentiation or superiority based on gender. Both men and women are valued equally and play vital roles in God's plan. This unity is aligned with God's will, as He intends for the inclusion and interdependence of both sexes. In Christ, gender is not a factor in matters of faith and spiritual privileges. All believers, regardless of gender, are united, redeemed, and will be glorified together in Him.
