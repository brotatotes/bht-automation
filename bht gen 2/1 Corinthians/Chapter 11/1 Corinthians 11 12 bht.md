# 1 Corinthians 11:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
This passage highlights the interdependence and unity between man and woman. Just as Eve was formed from Adam, so every man comes into being through a woman. This mutual reliance reflects the divine order established by God. By acknowledging this inherent connection, we are called to value and cultivate a harmonious partnership between the sexes. It also serves as a reminder that ultimately, all things, including the differences between men and women, have their origin in God.
