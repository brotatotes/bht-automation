# 1 Corinthians 11:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Consider for yourselves whether it is fitting for a woman to pray to God while going against the customary practice of covering her head in public. The apostle Paul appeals to the Corinthians' sense of propriety, leaving it to them to judge the matter. He emphasizes the importance of maintaining decorum and modesty in public worship, suggesting that it would be indecent for a woman to pray to God without her head covered, going against established customs. Thus, Paul's question prompts the Corinthians to carefully consider what is appropriate and respectful in their worship practices.
