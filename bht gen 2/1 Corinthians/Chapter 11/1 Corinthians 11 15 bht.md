# 1 Corinthians 11:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
It is beautiful and becoming for a woman to have long hair, as it is a glory to her and adorns her femininity. However, it is important to note that the covering of hair is not a matter of personal preference or choice, but rather, it is rooted in cultural and societal norms. In ancient times, it was customary for Jewish women to cover their hair as a sign of modesty. Therefore, it is not just a matter of personal style, but an acknowledgment of the times and customs in which they lived.
