# 1 Corinthians 11:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this passage, it is clear that there was a dispute among the Corinthians regarding certain customs in their worship. However, it is important to note that being contentious and stirring up disputes does not contribute to the truth or the peace of God's churches. Instead, it is essential to consider the universal practice and the customs of different churches. While there may be variations in practices that are not essential, it is crucial for individuals to avoid being contentious for the sake of contention. The focus should be on maintaining peace and unity within the church.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "But if any man seems to be contentious...let him know that...we...including the women...declare that...it is neither our practice, nor that of the Churches, to dispute." 
2. "He thus cuts off all further disputation on the matter by appealing to universal Christian usage."
3. "This appeal, 'to THE CHURCHES,' was much heard again at the Reformation: but has since been too much forgotten."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "A reproof of the Corinthians' self-sufficiency and disputatiousness."
2. "The usage of true 'churches (plural: not, as Rome uses it, 'the Church,' as an abstract entity; but 'the churches,' as a number of independent witnesses) of God' is a valid argument in the case of external rites, especially, negatively, for example, Such rites were not received among them, therefore, ought not to be admitted among us: but in questions of doctrine, or the essentials of worship, the argument is not valid."
3. "Catholic usage is not an infallible test of truth, but a general test of decency."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "If any man, any teacher, or others, 'is disposed' to be strenuous about this, or to make it a matter of difficulty; if he is disposed to call in question my reasoning, and to dispute my premises and the considerations which I have advanced, and to maintain still that it is proper for women to appear unveiled in public..."
2. "This, therefore, would be a sufficient reason why it should not be done in Corinth, even if the abstract reasoning should not convince them of the impropriety."
3. "The sense is, that it is contrary to custom there for women to appear in public unveiled. This custom, the apostle argues, ought to be allowed to have some influence on the church of Corinth, even though they should not be convinced by his reasoning."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Not the custom of contentiousness, but that of women speaking unveiled."
2. "The testimonies of Tertullian and Chrysostom show that these injunctions of Paul prevailed in the churches."
3. "In the sculptures of the catacombs the women have a close-fitting head-dress, while the men have the hair short."

### John Calvin:
1. "A contentious person is one whose humor inclines him to stir up disputes, and does not care what becomes of the truth."
2. "Contention is a pernicious thing, and ought, therefore, to be banished from the Churches."
3. "For we must not always reckon as contentious the man who does not acquiesce in our decisions, or who ventures to contradict us; but when temper and obstinacy show themselves, let us then say with Paul, that contentions are at variance with the custom of the Church."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "If in the spirit of contradiction a man will not yield to such considerations, let him know at least that he is setting himself against the universal practice, and disturbing the peace of God’s churches."
2. "To those who, in a narrow spirit, insist on having Divine prescription for the most insignificant details of religious life and public worship, this appeal to 'nature itself,' as a great guide in relation to the decencies of public worship, should read a wholesome lesson."
3. "Whatever in church organization and public worship is injurious to vital Christianity to spiritual life is to be discountenanced, as sacrificing the end to the means; but within those limits, not a little variety, suggested by national taste or climatic conditions, is surely admissible."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Contentious (φιλονεικος). Old adjective (φιλοσ, νεικος), fond of strife. Only here in N.T. If he only existed in this instance, the disputatious brother."
2. "Custom (συνηθειαν). Old word from συνηθης (συν, ηθος), like Latin consuetudo, intercourse, intimacy. In N.T. only here and 1 Corinthians 8:7 which see."
3. "In the sculptures of the catacombs the women have a close-fitting head-dress, while the men have the hair short" (Vincent).

### John Gill:
1. "If anyone will not be satisfied with reasons given for men's praying and prophesying with their heads uncovered, and women's praying and prophesying with their heads covered; but will go on to raise objections, showing that they contend not for truth, but victory."
2. "We have no such custom, nor the churches of God; meaning, either that men should appear covered, and women uncovered in public service, and which should have some weight with all those that have any regard to churches and their examples."
3. "A man that is always contending for contention sake, continually cavilling and carping at everything in churches, constantly quarrelling and giving uneasiness, is not fit to be a church member, nor to continue in the communion of the church, disturbing its peace."

### John Wesley:
1. "The several churches that were in the apostles' time had different customs in things that were not essential."
2. "And in all things merely indifferent the custom of each place was of sufficient weight to determine prudent and peaceable men."
3. "But those who are referred to here by the apostle were contentious, not conscientious, persons."
