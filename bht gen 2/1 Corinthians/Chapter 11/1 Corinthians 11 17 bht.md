# 1 Corinthians 11:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When Paul declares, I praise you not, he is expressing his disappointment. In previous verses, he commended the Corinthians for their faithfulness to his teachings. However, in this instance, he could not praise them at all. Their gatherings failed to serve their intended purpose, which was for edification and growth in grace. Instead, their meetings led to negative outcomes, fostering indulgence, heresies, and divisions. Paul's admonishment emphasizes the importance of gathering together for the betterment of the faith community, rather than for detrimental purposes.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "But this (viz. what has gone before, respecting the veiling of women; not, as Chrys., Theophyl, Grot., Bengel, al., that which follows: see below) I command you not praising." 
2. "Because you come together not for the better but for the worse. These last words ὅτι … συνέρχ, are introduced with a manifest view to include more than the subject hitherto treated, and to prepare the way for other abuses of their assemblies to be noticed."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "This I enjoin (you) not praising (you)."
2. "I must now give injunction in the name of the Lord, on a matter in which I praise you not; namely, as to the Lord's Supper."
3. "The result of such 'coming together' must be 'condemnation'."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Your meetings, and your observance of the ordinances of the gospel, do not promote your edification, your piety, spirituality, and harmony; but tend to division, alienation, and disorder."
2. "You should assemble to worship God, and promote harmony, love, and piety; the actual effect of your assembling is just the reverse."
3. "These evil consequences were chiefly two, first, divisions and contentions; and, secondly, the abuse and profanation of the Lord’s Supper."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. I declare [παραγγελλω] . Wrong. It means in the New Testament only command. See on Luke 5:14; Acts 1:4.

### John Calvin:
1. "Let this then be taken as a general statement, that the Corinthians are reproved, because they came together not for the better but for the worse."
2. "For the effect of our conduct is, that those things, which, from their own nature, and from God’s appointment, ought to have been salutary, become unprofitable."
3. "This is much more criminal, and yet it almost always follows the other, for if we derive no advantage from God’s benefits, he employs this method of punishing our carelessness — that we are made worse by them."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "But in giving you this charge, I praise you not, that ye come together not for the better, but for the worse."
2. "The 'charge' or 'command' is not what went before (as most modern interpreters understand it), but as will appear on careful study, we think the whole directory here following, as to the celebration of the Lord’s Supper."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "I praise you not." 
2. "For the better."
3. "For the worse."

### John Gill:
1. "I praise you not; as he did in 1 Corinthians 11:2 that they were mindful of him, remembered his doctrines, and kept the ordinances in the manner he had delivered them to them."
2. "...but in what he was about to say, he could not praise them at all."
3. "...not for the better; for edification and instruction, for the quickening and comforting of your souls; that you may grow in grace and knowledge, become more holy, zealous, fruitful, and useful: but for the worse; to indulge luxury and intemperance, to encourage heresies, schisms, and divisions, and so grow more carnal, scandalous, and useless."
