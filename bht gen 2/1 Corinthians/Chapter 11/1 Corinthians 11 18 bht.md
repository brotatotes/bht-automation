# 1 Corinthians 11:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When the Corinthians gathered as a Christian assembly, there were divisions among them, not in the sense of separating from the church, but rather uncharitable divisions within it. These divisions were not external separations, but inward animosities that led to heresies. Paul reproved these factions, emphasizing the importance of tender care for one another and the danger of indulging in any temper contrary to it. Though he partly believed the reports he received, he hoped that the situation was not as bad as rumored, as matters can often be exaggerated by fame.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The σχίσματα before the Apostle’s mind are, specifically, those occurring at the Agapæ, but on the mention of them, he breaks off to show that such divisions were to be no matters of surprise, but were ordained to test them..."
2. "The ABUSE OF SPIRITUAL GIFTS, which also created disorder in their assemblies, was the other point before his mind, when he wrote this πρῶτον."
3. "Said in gentleness: q. d. 'I am unwilling to believe all I hear concerning the point, but some I cannot help believing.'"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The 'divisions' (Greek, 'schisms') meant, are not merely those of opinion, but in outward acts at the love-feasts, (1 Corinthians 11:21)."
2. "But though not expressed, a second abuse was in his mind when he said, 'In the first place,' namely, THE ABUSE OF SPIRITUAL GIFTS, which also created disorder in their assemblies."

1. "Not the church edifice, a meaning which the word never has in the New Testament, and which appears first in patristic writings."
2. "The marginal rendering of the Rev. is better: in congregation."

### John Calvin:
1. "It is a reproof of a general kind — that they were not of one accord as becomes Christians, but every one was so much taken up with his own interests, that he was not prepared to accommodate himself to others."
2. "Hence arose that abuse, as to which we shall see in a little — hence sprung ambition and pride, so that every one exalted himself and despised others — hence sprung carelessness as to edification — hence sprung profanation of the gifts of God."

### John Gill:
1. "The first thing he took notice of as worthy of dispraise and reproof, in their religious assemblies, were their animosities and factions."
2. "This the apostle had heard from the house of Chloe: and I partly believe it;... but yet he had it from such good hands, that he could not but believe there was something in it."
3. "...he hoped in that charity which hopeth all things, that it was not quite so bad as was feared or represented, since things are generally heightened and increased by fame."

### John Wesley:
1. "It is plain that by schisms is not meant any separation from the church, but uncharitable divisions in it; for the Corinthians continued to be one church; and, notwithstanding all their strife and contention, there was no separation of any one party from the rest, with regard to external communion."
2. "Therefore, the indulging any temper contrary to this tender care of each other is the true scriptural schism."
3. "Both heresies and schisms are here mentioned in very near the same sense; unless by schisms be meant, rather, those inward animosities which occasion heresies; that is, outward divisions or parties: so that whilst one said, 'I am of Paul,' another, 'I am of Apollos,' this implied both schism and heresy."
