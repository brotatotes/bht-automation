# 1 Corinthians 11:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
For there must be divisions among you, caused by different factions and conflicting opinions. These divisions serve a purpose of testing the genuineness of believers and exposing the hypocrisy of the false. It is through such trials and separations that the true friends of God are distinguished from the contentious and separatists. These divisions and heresies fulfill a divine purpose in the purification and manifestation of the approved among us. Let us, therefore, hold fast to the truth and persevere in steadfastness, so that it may be known who among us are the sincere followers of the Lamb.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "There must be (not only dissensions, but) even heresies... indicating a further and more matured separation, where not only is there present dissension, as in the Agap√¶, but a deliberate choice and maintenance of party distinction."
2. "It does not appear, in spite of all that has been written in Germany on the supposed parties of ch. 1 Corinthians 1:10, that such separations had yet taken place among the Corinthians."
3. "But this hardly justifies the climax, Œ¥Œµ·øñ Œ≥·Ω∞œÅ Œ∫Œ±·Ω∂ Œ±·º±œÅ.) among you, that the approved [also] may be made manifest among you; viz. through a better and nobler spirit being shewn by them, than by the contentious and separatists."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "heresies" means "schisms which have now become inveterate"
2. "The 'must be' arises from sin in professors necessarily bearing its natural fruits: these are overruled by God to the probation of character of both the godly and the ungodly, and to the discipline of the former for glory."
3. ST. AUGUSTINE'S rule: "In doubtful questions, liberty; in essentials, unity; in all things, charity."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It is necessary...they are to be expected, and they serve the purpose of showing who are, and who are not, the true friends of God."
2. "The words 'heresy' and 'heresies' occur only...and in Galatians 5:20; 2 Peter 2:1...But there is no evidence that the word is used in this signification in the New Testament."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Heresies [Œ±ŒπœÅŒµœÉŒµŒπœÇ] . See on 2 Peter 2:1. In Paul only here and Galatians 5:20. Better, parties or factions, as the result of the divisions.

### John Calvin:
1. "For in this way hypocrites are detected ‚Äî in this way, on the other hand, the sincerity of believers is tried."
2. "But observe what Paul says ‚Äî there must be, for he intimates by this expression, that this state of matters does not happen by chance, but by the sure providence of God, because he has it in view to try his people, as gold in the furnace, and if it is agreeable to the mind of God, it is, consequently, expedient."
3. "We know that the Lord, by his admirable wisdom, turns Satan‚Äôs deadly machinations so as to promote the salvation of believers."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "For there must be also heresies among you. The word signifies, first, a ‚Äòtaking‚Äô or ‚Äòchoice;‚Äô then, the thing chosen, and (in matters of judgment) an ‚Äòopinion‚Äô or set of opinions: here it is used in a bad sense, as in Galatians 5:20, for opinions tending to rend the Church."

### John Wesley:
