# 1 Corinthians 11:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Many Christians are commended for their remembrance and adherence to the traditions and instructions given to them. It is important to hold fast to these traditions, which can include both good and bad practices. The apostle Paul commends the Church for maintaining the ordinances and teachings passed down by the apostles. However, it is worth considering whether the majority of Christians today would receive the same praise from the apostle, given the state of their adherence to these traditions.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "He praises them for the degree in which they did this already, and expresses it by the slight word μέμνησθε." 
2. "And ye keep (continue to believe and practise) the traditions (apostolic maxims of faith and practice, delivered either orally or in writing, 2Th 2:15)." 
3. "This was their general practice: the exceptions to it, or departures at all events from the spirit of those παραδόσεις, now follow."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "ye remember me in all things—in your general practice, though in the particular instances which follow ye fail."
2. "The reference here is mainly to ceremonies... But the difficulty is to know what is a genuine apostolic tradition intended for all ages."
3. "Those preserved in the written word alone can be proved to be such [apostolic traditions]."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Paul always chose to commend Christians when it could be done, and never seemed to suppose that such praise would be injurious to them."
2. "That you are disposed to regard my authority and seek my direction in all matters pertaining to the good order of the church."
3. "The apostles had 'delivered' to them certain doctrines, or rules, respecting the good order and the government of the church; and they had in general observed them, and were disposed still to do it."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "By these words Paul avoids any possible charge of imposing his own notions upon the Church."
2. "He delivers to them what had been delivered to him."
3. "Compare 1 Timothy 1:11; 2 Thessalonians 2:15."

### John Calvin:
1. "Much, therefore, depends upon decorum and that not merely for securing for our actions gracefulness and beauty, but also to accustom our minds to propriety."
2. "For there is nothing of inconsistency in saying that very many sins, and of various kinds, prevail among a particular people — some cheating, others plundering — some envying, others quarrelling, and another class guilty of fornication — while, at the same time, in respect of the public form of the Church, the institutions of Christ and his Apostles are maintained."
3. "What has it to do with those silly trifles of ceremonies, which are to be seen in Popery? What has it to do with a worse than Jewish superstition? What has it to do with a tyranny worthy of Phalaris, by which they torture miserable consciences?"

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Now I praise you that ye remember me in all things all the instructions I gave you, and hold fast the traditions."
2. "The word means ‘things delivered’ in any way, whether orally or in writing, as is plain from what follows."
3. "Even the Rhemish Version renders it 'precepts,' the Authorised Version ordinances, that is, the directions which he gave them for their guidance."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Hold fast the traditions (τας παραδοσεις κατεχετε). Hold down as in 1 Corinthians 15:2. Παραδοσις (tradition) from παραδιδωμ (παρεδωκα, first aorist active indicative) is an old word and merely something handed on from one to another."
2. "The thing handed on may be bad as in Matthew 15:2 (which see) and contrary to the will of God (Mark 7:8) or it may be wholly good as here."
3. "There is a constant conflict between the new and the old in science, medicine, law, theology. The obscurantist rejects all the new and holds to the old both true and untrue. New truth must rest upon old truth and is in harmony with it."

### John Gill:
1. "that ye remember me in all things"
2. "keep the ordinances, as I delivered them to you"
3. "but was the apostle alive now, would, or could he praise the generality of those that are called Christians on this account?"

### John Wesley:
1. I praise you — The greater part of you.
