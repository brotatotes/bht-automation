# 1 Corinthians 11:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Corinthians, due to their divisions and improper conduct, had strayed from the true meaning and purpose of the Lord's Supper. Rather than partaking in a sacred and solemn memorial of Christ's death, their gatherings had become centered around their own self-indulgence and personal meals. Consequently, their actions had led to a deviation from the true observance of the Lord's Supper, separating it from its intended significance as a remembrance of Christ and His sacrifice.
