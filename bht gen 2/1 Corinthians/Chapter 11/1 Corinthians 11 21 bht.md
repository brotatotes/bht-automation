# 1 Corinthians 11:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Corinthians had completely missed the purpose of the Lord's Supper, turning it into a selfish feast where the rich indulged themselves while the poor were left hungry and neglected. They disregarded the idea of communal sharing and unity, each prioritizing their own desires and needs. This was a stark contrast to the intended practice of the Love-feasts, which aimed to demonstrate equality among all believers. Unfortunately, their behavior resembled the pagan feasts, rather than the holy, solemn occasion it was meant to be.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Obviously the ἕκαστος must be limited to the rich: the poor had no ἴδιον δεῖπνον to take, and were the losers by the selfishness of the rich."
2. "πεινᾷ: one is craving (the poor), another is drunken (the rich. There is no need to soften the meaning of μεθύει: as Meyer says, 'Paul draws the picture in strong colours, and who can say that the reality was less strong?')."


### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Instead of 'tarrying for one another' (1 Corinthians 12:21; 1 Corinthians 12:25)." 
2. "His own supper—'His own' belly is his God (1 Corinthians 12:25-); 'the Lord's Supper,' the spiritual feast, never enters his thoughts."
3. "The one has more than is good for him, the other less [BENGEL]."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "They had entirely mistaken the nature of the ordinance, and had converted it into an occasion of ordinary festivity, and even intemperance."
2. "Each one is regardless of the needs of the others... It had become a scene where every man ate by himself; and where the very idea that there was anything like a 'common' celebration, or a celebration 'together,' was abandoned."
3. "The apostle meant to say, that they ate and drank to excess; and that their professed celebration of the Lord’s Supper became a mere revel."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Taketh before other. Not waiting for the coming of the poor to participate.

### John Calvin:
1. "It is truly wonderful, and next to a miracle, that Satan could have accomplished so much in so short a time."
2. "This, having become customary, was looked upon as lawful."
3. "Paul would have them in no way mix up this spiritual banquet with common feasts."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "In apostolic times it was never observed by itself, so far as appears, but always in connection with those friendly meals called 'Agapse' or 'Love Feasts,' designed partly to exhibit and exemplify the equality of all Christians rich and poor, slaves and masters alike but also as a way of helping the poorer members without creating the feeling of pauperism."
2. "The rich brought of their abundance to these tables, and the humbler classes what they could."
3. "Thus, in place of a simultaneous observance of the Lord’s Supper, every one might be seen 'taking his own supper before other,' 'one hungry,' namely, the poor, who were put off with a sorry portion, another 'drinking freely.'"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "It was conduct like this that led to the complete separation between the Love-feast and the Lord's Supper."
2. "It was a mere grab-game."
3. "Hungry poor meeting intoxicated rich, at what was supposed to be a supper of the Lord."

### John Gill:
1. "But instead of that, he sat down and ate it himself, and would not stay till the rest came, to eat together."
2. "Some went without, whilst others had too much; and thus the designed end was not answered, and the whole was a piece of confusion and disorder."
3. "He that came late had nothing to eat, and so was hungry; when he that was first either eat and drank to excess, or at least very plentifully, so that he was very cheerful, and more disposed to carnal mirth, than in a serious and solemn manner to partake of the Lord's supper."

### John Wesley:
1. "Instead of all partaking of one bread, each person brings his own supper."
2. "The poor, who cannot provide for themselves, have nothing; while the rich eat and drink to the full."
