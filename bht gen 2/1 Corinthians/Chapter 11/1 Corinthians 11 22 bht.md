# 1 Corinthians 11:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Do not bring your worldly feasting and revelry into the sacred assembly of the church. It is not appropriate to show contempt for the poor and needy who are part of the congregation. Instead, let each person eat and drink in their own homes. To bring such disorderly and unequal feasts into the house of God is disrespectful and shameful. Remember that the church of God is made up of the poor, who are chosen by Him. So, do not despise them, but show them love and respect.
