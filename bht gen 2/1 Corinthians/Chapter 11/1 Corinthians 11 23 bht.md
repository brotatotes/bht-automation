# 1 Corinthians 11:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Lord's Supper is a sacred and significant institution, not to be taken lightly. The apostle Paul, in all humility and with utmost respect, received direct revelation from the Lord himself regarding its origin and purpose. This divine authority underscores the importance and proper observance of the Lord's Supper as a solemn remembrance of Christ's sacrifice.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "I received from the Lord (by special revelation) that which I also delivered to you, that the Lord Jesus, &c."
2. "He was being betrayed. 'There is an appearance of fixed order, especially in these opening words, which indicates that this had already become a familiar formula.'"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "His object is to show the unworthiness of such conduct from the dignity of the holy supper." 
2. "The renewal of the institution of the Lord's Supper by special revelation to Paul enhances its solemnity." 
3. "With the traitor at the table, and death present before His eyes, He left this ordinance as His last gift to us, to commemorate His death. Though about to receive such an injury from man, He gave this pledge of His amazing love to man."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "He did not, therefore, denounce them even for their irregularity and gross disorder; he did not use harsh, violent, vituperative language, but he expected to reform the evil by a mild and tender statement of the truth, and by an appeal to their consciences as the followers of the Lord Jesus."
2. "The reason why he here says that he had received it directly from the Lord is, doubtless, that he might show them that it was of divine authority."
3. "He wished evidently to bring before their minds the deeply affecting circumstances of his death; and thus to show them the utter impropriety of their celebrating the ordinance with riot and disorder."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "I received...giving the weight of personal authority to the statement." 
2. "...the sense of an immediate communication from Christ to Paul."
3. "He instituted the Eucharist while His betrayal was going on."

### John Calvin:
1. "For the institution of Christ is a sure rule, so that if you turn aside from it but a very little, you are out of the right course."
2. "Nothing is more manifest than that their Mass is diametrically opposed to the sacred Supper of our Lord. I go farther — we show in the plainest manner, that it is full of wicked abominations: hence there is need of reformation."
3. "I have not delivered to you an invention of my own: I had not, when I came to you, contrived a new kind of Supper, according to my own humor, but have Christ as my authority, from whom I received what I have delivered unto you, in the way of handing it over."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Language could not make it more clear than it is here, that the memorial design of this institution is the primary one."
2. "The emphatic 'I' clearly implies that the revelation came direct from Christ to the apostle himself."
3. "We cannot but think that the apostle did use the word 'given', since his constant companion uses it (Luke 22:19)."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Direct claim to revelation from the Lord Jesus on the origin of the Lord's Supper."
2. "Paul received the account from the Lord and passed it on from himself to them, a true παραδοσις (tradition)"
3. "Imperfect passive indicative (irregular form for παρεδιδοτο, Robertson, Grammar, p. 340)."

### John Gill:
1. "The divine authority of the Lord's supper is here expressed; it was not only instituted by him as Lord, having all power and authority in and over his churches, to appoint what ordinances he pleases; but the plan and form of administration of it were received from him by the apostle."
2. "For whatever he received from Christ, whether a doctrine or an ordinance, he faithfully delivered to the churches, from whom he kept back nothing that was profitable, but declared the whole counsel of God unto them."
3. "The circumstance of Judas's betraying him is mentioned, not only because it was in the night, and a work of darkness; but being in the same night he instituted the supper, shows the knowledge he had of his death by the means of the betrayer, and his great love to his disciples, his church and people..."

### John Wesley:
1. I received — By an immediate revelation.
