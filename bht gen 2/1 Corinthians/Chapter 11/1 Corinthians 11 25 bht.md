# 1 Corinthians 11:25 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Therefore, it is important to understand that the Lord's Supper is distinct from a common meal, as it was instituted after supper. The cup, which represents the new covenant in Christ's blood, serves as a symbol of the forgiveness of sins and the blessings of the new covenant. Thus, when partaking in the Lord's Supper, it is a remembrance of the sacrifice of Christ and the remission of sins.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Here the memorial design of the Lord’s Supper is reiterated, as if to teach that, if this was not its sole design, yet any view of it, which either sinks this altogether or throws it into the shade, must be erroneous."
2. "But since in classical Greek this word signifies a 'testament,' 'disposition,' or 'will,' and since in Hebrews 9:16-17, the writer seems clearly to avail himself of both ideas gliding out of the covenant idea into that of testament it is not necessary altogether to exclude that idea here."
