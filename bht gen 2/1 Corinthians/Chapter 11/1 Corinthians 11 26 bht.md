The act of partaking in the Lord's Supper is a public proclamation of the death of the Lord until His second coming. This proclamation is not only a remembrance of Him but also a declaration of our personal faith in His sacrifice. The Supper serves as a vivid realization of Christ's presence, not a literal change of the bread into His body. It is an ordinance that is to be observed and perpetuated in the Church until the end of time, symbolizing His presence among us until His glorious return.
