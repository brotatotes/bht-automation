# 1 Corinthians 11:27 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Partaking of the Lord's Supper in an unworthy manner refers to approaching it without reverence or understanding of its significance. It is not about our personal worthiness, but about our attitude and approach. To eat the bread without regard for Christ's appointment or the purpose behind it is to partake unworthily. It is essential to have a correct understanding of the purpose and significance of the Lord's Supper to approach it in a worthy manner. When we approach with reverence and understanding, we honor Christ's sacrifice and receive the spiritual benefits it offers.

### Henry Alford:
1. "The death of the Lord was brought about by the breaking of His body and shedding His blood: this Death we proclaim in the ordinance by the bread broken the wine poured out, of which we partake."
2. "Whoever therefore shall either eat the bread or drink the cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the Body and Blood of the Lord: i.e. 'crimini et pœnæ corporis et sanguinis Christi violati obnoxius erit:' Meyer."
3. "Such an one proclaims the death of Christ, and yet in an unworthy spirit with no regard to that Death as his atonement, or a proof of Christ’s love: he proclaims that Death as an indifferent person: he therefore partakes of the guilt of it."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Impropriety in only one of the two elements, vitiates true communion in both."
2. "Any who takes the bread without the wine, or the wine without the bread, 'unworthily' communicates, and so 'is guilty of Christ's body and blood'; for he disobeys Christ's express command to partake of both."
3. "However unworthy we be, if we examine ourselves so as to find that we penitently believe in Christ's Gospel, we may worthily communicate."

### Albert Barnes:

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Unworthily [αναξιως] . Defined by "not discerning the Lord 's body," ver. 29. Guilty [ενοχος] . See on Mark 3:29; James 2:10.

### John Calvin:
1. "There was one fault that prevailed among the Corinthians. He takes occasion from this to speak of every kind of faulty administration or reception of the Supper."
2. "Hence there are various degrees of this unworthiness, so to speak; and some offend more grievously, others less so."
3. "For I cannot endure to maim Christ, and I shudder at the absurdity of affirming that he gives himself to be eaten by the wicked in a lifeless state, as it were."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Wherefore whosoever shall eat the bread [1] or [2] drink the cup of the Lord unworthily ‘unsuitably;’ out of keeping in mind and heart with the design of this ordinance, not “as it becometh the Gospel” (Philippians 1:27), not “walking worthily of the Lord” (Colossians 1:10), not “bringing forth fruits worthy of repentance” (Luke 3:8)."
2. "shall be guilty of the body and the [1] blood of the Lord guilty, that is, of His death. So Chrysostom and Grotius, we think, correctly understand this."
3. "But to eat and drink at the Lord’s Table as at a common meal (for that is the case supposed) is certainly to put an affront upon the body and blood of Christ."
