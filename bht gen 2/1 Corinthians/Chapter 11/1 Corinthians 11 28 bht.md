# 1 Corinthians 11:28 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Before participating in the ordinance, it is essential for a person to truly examine themselves to determine if they have a genuine sense of sin, sorrow, and repentance. They must also assess whether they are in the faith and have a sincere love for Christ, giving Him all the glory. If one can come to a personal satisfaction regarding these matters, they should not be discouraged or hindered, as they have an undoubted right to come to the table of the Lord.
