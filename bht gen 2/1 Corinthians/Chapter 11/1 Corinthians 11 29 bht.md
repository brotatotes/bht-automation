# 1 Corinthians 11:29 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
He who eats and drinks without discerning the body, eats and drinks judgment to himself. The judgment is described as temporal and the result of eating and drinking improperly, incurring condemnation. The person fails to make the proper distinction between the bread used in the Lord's supper and common food, not appreciating the significance and sacredness of the Lord's body. Such unworthy eating and drinking cause harm to oneself and can lead to the Divine displeasure.

3. "The Lord's body is His literal body appreciated and discerned by the soul in the faithful receiving, and not present in the elements themselves."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Eateth and drinketh damnation - This is evidently a figurative expression, meaning that by eating and drinking improperly he incurs condemnation; which is here expressed by eating and drinking condemnation itself."
2. "The word here used (κρῖμα krima) properly denotes judgment; the result of judging, that is, a sentence; then a sentence by which one is condemned, or condemnation; and then punishment; see Romans 3:8; Romans 13:2."
3. "Not discerning the Lord’s body - Not discriminating...between the bread which is used on this occasion and common and ordinary food. Not making the proper difference and distinction between this and common meals."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "This false and horrible rendering has destroyed the peace of more sincere and earnest souls than any other misread passage in the New Testament."
2. "The verb [discerning] primarily means to separate, and hence to make a distinction, discriminate. Rev., in margin, discriminating."
3. "The object of the discrimination here referred to, may, I think, be regarded as complex...such discernment of the peculiar significance and sacredness of the Lord 's body as shall make him shrink from profanation and shall stimulate him to penitence and faith."

### John Calvin:
1. "He who shall eat unworthily, eateth judgment to himself... This food, otherwise health-giving, will turn out to their destruction, and will be converted into poison to those that eat unworthily." 
2. "They handle the sacred body of Christ with unwashed hands, nay more, as if it were a thing of nought, they consider not how great is the value of it." 
3. "The body is presented to them, though their unworthiness deprives them of a participation in it."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "For he that eateth or drinketh, eateth and drinketh judgment unto himself, if he discern not the body." (The evidence for the omission of “unworthily” and “Lord’s” before “body” is, we think, conclusive; but the sense is the same.)”
2. “Discerning the body” sounds very abrupt to us who are accustomed to the fuller form; but it is perhaps all the more emphatic.
3. By “eating and drinking Judgment” is meant incurring the effects of the Divine displeasure.

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "If he discern not the body" - The verb δια-κρινω is an old and common word, our dis-cri-minate, to distinguish.
2. "Eating the bread and drinking the wine as symbols of the Lord's body and blood in death probes one's heart to the very depths."

### John Gill:
1. "This they may be said to eat and drink, because their unworthy eating and drinking are the cause and means of it."
2. "Such an one is said to eat and drink this judgment or condemnation to himself, and not another; he is injurious to nobody but himself."
3. "Because they distinguish not the Lord's supper from an ordinary and common meal, but confound them together...or discern not the dignity, excellency, and usefulness of Christ's body."

### John Wesley:
1. "For he that eateth and drinketh so unworthily as those Corinthians did, eateth and drinketh judgment to himself - Temporal judgments of various kinds."
2. "Not distinguishing the sacred tokens of the Lord's body - From his common food."
