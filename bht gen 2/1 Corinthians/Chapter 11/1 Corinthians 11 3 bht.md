# 1 Corinthians 11:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Christ is the head of every individual human nature, a common public head to all His elect, and the representative head of believers. God, as the Father, is the head of Christ, signifying their same divine nature. Though the man is the head of the woman, it does not mean they are not of the same human nature, just as the Father being the head of Christ does not indicate a different divine nature.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The gospel unquestionably did much for the emancipation of women, who in the East and among the Ionian Greeks were kept in unworthy dependence."
2. "The women over-stepped the bounds of their sex, in coming forward to pray and to prophesy in the assembled church with uncovered heads."
3. "Observe that though the distinction of the sexes is abolished in Christ, as far as the offer of and standing in grace is concerned, yet for practical purposes, and for order and seemliness, it subsists and must be observed."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The Gospel, doubtless, did raise women from the degradation in which they had been sunk, especially in the East."
2. "Yet, while on a level with males as to the offer of, and standing in grace (Galatians 3:28), their subjection in point of order, modesty, and seemliness, is to be maintained."
3. "Jesus, therefore, must be of the same essence as God: for, since the man is the head of the woman, and since the head is of the same essence as the body, and God is the head of the Son, it follows the Son is of the same essence as the Father" [CHRYSOSTOM].

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Every Christian should recollect the relation in which he stands to him, as one that is suited to produce the strictest decorum, and a steady sense of subordination."
2. "The sense is, she is subordinate to him, and in all circumstances - in her demeanor, her dress, her conversation, in public and in the family circle - should recognize her subordination to him."
3. "Christ, as Mediator, has consented to assume a subordinate rank, and to recognize God the Father as superior in office."

### John Calvin:
1. "Evil manners beget good laws."
2. "Let us, for the present, take notice of those four gradations which he points out. God, then, occupies the first place: Christ holds the second place."
3. "In the meantime, however, he does not disturb civil order or honorary distinctions, which cannot be dispensed with in ordinary life."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Though this is true universally for 'He hath given Him power over all flesh' and to be 'Head over all things to the Church,' it is of Christians that the apostle is here speaking." 
2. "The head of the woman (under Christ) is the man, and the head of Christ is God considered as the Father's Servant, in which capacity He spake when He said, 'I glorified Thee on the earth, having accomplished the work which Thou hast given me to do.'"
3. "It is in this aspect of mutual relation in the work of redemption that 'the Head of Christ is God' with which His proper Personal Divinity is in entire harmony."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "But I wish you to know, censure in contrast to the praise."
2. "Rather, God is the head of Christ, since κεφαλη is anarthrous and predicate."

### John Gill:
1. "Christ is the head of every individual human nature...he is the head of nature to all men, as he is of grace to his own people."
2. "Christ is the head of every believing man; he is a common public head, a representative one to all his elect."
3. "The man is first in order in being, was first formed, and the woman out of him, who was made for him, and therefore must be head and chief; as he is also with respect to his superior gifts and excellencies, as strength of body, and endowments of mind."

### John Wesley:
1. "The head of every man — Particularly every believer."
2. "But we can no more infer that they are not of the same divine nature, because God is said to be the head of Christ, than that man and woman are not of the same human nature, because the man is said to be the head of the woman."
