# 1 Corinthians 11:31 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
If we were to sincerely evaluate ourselves, our knowledge, and our intentions before participating in the Lord's Supper, we would be spared from the divine punishment that may befall those who approach it in a careless manner. This requires us to reflect on our sin, confess and mourn over it, and separate ourselves from those who engage in ungodly behavior. By doing so, we can avoid the judgment and punishment of God.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "δέ contrasts with this state of sicknesses and deaths: it might be otherwise. This διεκρινόμεθα (parallel with δοκιμαζέτω before) should be rendered by the same word as διακρίνων before, the idea being the same." 
2. "'Appreciate,' if etymologically understood, is the nearest to the meaning: in Latin dijudico, which the Vulg. has, is an excellent rendering, preserving also the ‘judico,’ so essential to the following clause."
3. "But as certainly, we find the other sense: e.g. Herod. iii. 25, of Cambyses, εἰ … ἀπῆγε ὀπίσω τὸν στρατὸν … ἦν ἂν σοφὸς ἀνήρ. So that the E. V. may here be kept if thought desirable."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "If we duly judged ourselves, we should not be (or not have been) judged."
2. "In order to duly judge or 'discern [appreciate] the Lord's body,' we need to 'duly judge ourselves.'"
3. "A prescient warning against the dogma of priestly absolution after full confession, as the necessary preliminary to receiving the Lord's Supper."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "If we would judge ourselves...we should escape the condemnation to which they are exposed who observe it in an improper manner."
2. "If we would exercise proper 'severity' and 'honesty' in determining our own character and fitness for the ordinance, we should not expose ourselves to the divine displeasure."
3. "If we wish to escape the divine displeasure; if we wish the communion to be followed with joy, and peace, and growth in grace...we should exercise a severe judgment on our character, and feelings, and motives."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Render, as Rev., if we discerned ourselves; i.e., examined and formed a right estimate."
2. "We should not be judged [ουκ αν εκρινομεθα]. By God. Here judged is correct."
3. "A proper self-examination would save us from the divine judgment."

### John Calvin:
1. "God does not all of a sudden become enraged against us, so as to inflict punishment immediately upon our sinning, but that, for the most part, it is owing to our carelessness, that he is in a manner constrained to punish us."
2. "We either avert, or mitigate impending punishment, if we first call ourselves to account, and, actuated by a spirit of repentance, deprecate the anger of God by inflicting punishment voluntarily upon ourselves."
3. "Believers anticipate, by repentance, the judgment of God, and there is no other remedy, by which they may obtain absolution in the sight of God, but by voluntarily condemning themselves."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "If we did but take the case of our spiritual condition faithfully into our own hands, we should thus take it (so to speak) out of God’s hands, and so avert the tokens of His Fatherly displeasure."
2. "'If we discerned ourselves, we should not be judged.'"


### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "...they had not been judging themselves discriminatingly..."
2. "...they would not be judged..."

### John Gill:
1. "Examine, try, and prove ourselves...before we eat and drink."
2. "Condemn ourselves...by confessing, acknowledging, and mourning over sin, and by repentance for it."
3. "Separate ourselves from the company of profane sinners, come out from among them, and touch not their unclean things."

### John Wesley:
1. "If we would judge ourselves — As to our knowledge, and the design with which we approach the Lord's table."
2. "We should not be thus judged — That is, punished by God."
