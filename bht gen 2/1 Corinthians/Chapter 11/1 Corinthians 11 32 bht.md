When we experience God's judgment and discipline, it is not to bring about our destruction, but rather to bring us to repentance and salvation. We should not be afraid or alarmed by our difficulties, for they are evidence of the Lord's love and care for us. By enduring and embracing His discipline, we can be assured that we will not be condemned with the unbelieving world.
