# 1 Corinthians 11:34 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Lord's Supper is not a common feast intended to satisfy physical appetites. Instead, it is a solemn commemoration and should be approached with reverence. Before participating in the Supper, it is important to take care of one's physical hunger at home. The arrangements and order for the Supper should be determined based on the specific needs of times, places, and individuals. If believers were to faithfully follow these instructions, the Lord's Supper would bring comfort and serve as a meaningful ordinance.
