# 1 Corinthians 11:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Every man is meant to have a deep reverence for God when praying or speaking in public, as they are acting as God's representatives. Having one's head covered during these moments is seen as a sign of dishonor towards Christ, who holds authority over all. This act reflects a lack of submission to Christ and goes against the appropriate decorum in public worship. It is important for men to approach their spiritual duties with a sense of humility and respect, upholding the honor and authority of Christ in their actions.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The case of the man here treated... was an actually occurring one among the Corinthians."
2. "The Jews when praying in public put over their heads a veil... to show their reverence before God and their unworthiness to look on Him."
3. "The head of the man... has been explained to be CHRIST. Him he dishonours, by appearing veiled before men, thus recognizing subjection to them in an assembly which ought to be conformed to Christian order."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "having—that is, if he were to have: a supposed case to illustrate the impropriety in the woman's case."
2. "He dishonoreth his head... by wearing a covering or veil, which is a mark of subjection, and which makes him look downwards instead of upwards to his Spiritual Head, Christ, to whom alone he owes subjection."
3. "Why, then, ought not man to wear the covering in token of his subjection to Christ, as the woman wears it in token of her subjection to man? 'Because Christ is not seen: the man is seen; so the covering of him who is under Christ is not seen; of her who is under the man, is seen.'"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The simple idea here is, that they spoke in the public assemblies, and professed to be the expounders of the divine will."
2. "To remove the hat, the turban, or the covering of the head, is a mark of respect for a superior when in his presence."
3. "In the presence of a prince or a nobleman, it would be considered as a mark of disrespect should the head be covered. So in the presence of Christ, in whose name he ministers, it is a mark of disrespect if the head is covered."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Referring to the tallith, a four-cornered shawl having fringes consisting of eight threads, each knotted five times, and worn over the head in prayer."
2. "The Romans, like the Jews, prayed with the head veiled."
3. "The Grecian usage, which had become prevalent in the Grecian churches, seems to have commended itself to Paul as more becoming the superior position of the man."

### John Calvin:
1. "He says that the man commits an offense against Christ his head if he prays or prophesies with his head covered. Because he is subject to Christ, with this understanding, that he is to hold the first place in the government of the house — for the father of the family is like a king in his own house."
2. "Thus the honor of Christ is infringed upon. For example, if the man does not keep his own station — if he is not subject to Christ in such a way as to preside over his own family with authority, he obscures, to that extent, the glory of Christ, which shines forth in the well-regulated order of marriage."
3. "The one rule to be observed here is decorum. If that is secured, Paul requires nothing further."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Every man praying or prophesying... having his head covered, dishonoureth his head covering what God made to be exposed."
2. "Speaking by Divine Inspiration... either to God in public prayer, or from God in preaching."
3. "God made [the head covering] to be exposed."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Having his head covered (κατα κεφαλης εχων). Literally, having a veil (καλυμμα understood) down from the head (κεφαλης ablative after κατα as with κατα in Mark 5:13; Acts 27:14)."
2. "It is not certain whether the Jews at this time used the tallith, 'a four-corned shawl having fringes consisting of eight threads, each knotted five times' (Vincent) as they did later."
3. "The Greeks (both men and women) remained bareheaded in public prayer and this usage Paul commends for the men."

### John Gill:
1. "This is to be understood of praying and prophesying in public...meant by prophesying."
2. "Having his head covered...a spirit of bondage unto fear...with his head uncovered."
3. "Rather the reason should be...boldness, and superiority...dishonourable."

### John Wesley:
1. "Every man praying or prophesying — Speaking by the immediate power of God."
2. "Dishonoureth his head — St. Paul seems to mean, As in these eastern nations veiling the head is a badge of subjection, so a man who prays or prophesies with a veil on his head, reflects a dishonour on Christ, whose representative he is."
