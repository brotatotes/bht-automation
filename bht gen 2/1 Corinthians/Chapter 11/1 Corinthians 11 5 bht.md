# 1 Corinthians 11:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the passage, it is evident that women were not allowed to pray or preach publicly in the congregation. Therefore, when a woman prays or prophesies without a veil on her face, she dishonors the man, who is her head. This act is equivalent to cutting her hair short and adopting a hairstyle associated with men. During that time, men commonly wore very short hair. Thus, by not having a veil or any form of covering, a woman's appearance would resemble that of a man and would bring dishonor and scandal.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "She, if she uncovers herself, dishonours her head by apparently casting off his headship."
2. "But if this be acknowledged to be shameful, let the further decency of the additional covering be conceded likewise."
3. "The neut. is used because the identity is generic, not individual."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "This instance of women speaking in public worship is an extraordinary case, and justified only by the miraculous gifts which such women possessed as their credentials... The ordinary rule to them is: silence in public."
2. "Mental receptivity and activity in family life are recognized in Christianity, as most accordant with the destiny of woman."
3. "...in putting away the veil, she puts away the badge of her subjection to man, which is her true 'honor'; for through him it connects her with Christ, the head of the man."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "That there were females in the early Christian church who corresponded to those known among the Jews in some measure as endowed with the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, cannot be doubted."
2. "If it is now pled, from this example, that women should speak and pray in public, yet it should be just so far only as this example goes, and it should be only when they have the qualifications that the early 'prophetesses' had in the Christian church."
3. "To remove that, is to remove the appropriate mark of such subordination, and is a public act by which she thus shows dishonor to the man."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The Corinthian women had disused the costume of the head-dress in the Christian assemblies, perhaps as an assertion of the abolition of sexual distinctions, and the spiritual equality of the woman with the man in the presence of Christ." 
2. "Among the Jews, in ancient times, both married and unmarried women appeared in public unveiled. The later Jewish authorities insisted on the use of the veil."
3. "Paul means that a woman praying or prophesying uncovered puts herself in public opinion on a level with a courtesan."

2. "Nature itself, says he, abhors it. To see a woman shaven is a spectacle that is disgusting and monstrous."
3. "It is not, therefore, without good reason that Paul, as a remedy for this vice, sets before them the opposite idea — that they be regarded as remarkable for unseemliness, rather than for what is an incentive to lust."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "But every woman praying or prophesying with her head unveiled dishonoureth her head...the meaning to be that each sex disgraces itself by appearing in public unsuitably to what nature teaches to be the peculiarity of each, the words have their natural sense." 
2. "If she will officiate with bare head, she may just as well have it shaven; the severest censure he could pass upon it."

1. "With her head unveiled."
2. "One and the same thing as if she were shaven."
3. "He does not here condemn the act, but the breach of custom which would bring reproach."

### John Gill:

2. "Hence it is said, 'that uncovering of the head is a reproach' to the daughters of Israel."
3. "To be without a veil, or some sort of covering on her head, according to the custom of the country, is the same thing as if her head was shaved; and everyone knows how dishonourable and scandalous it is for a woman to have her head shaved."

### John Wesley:
1. "But every woman...prays or prophesies without a veil on her face...reflects dishonor on man, her head."
