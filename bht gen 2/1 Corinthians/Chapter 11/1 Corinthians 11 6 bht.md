# 1 Corinthians 11:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
If a woman chooses to remove her head covering, let her also cut her hair short like a man's, for in doing so, she discards the symbol of her submission. However, let her consider the shame and ridicule that will accompany this choice, as such behavior is deemed disgraceful even by non-believers. Therefore, if it is deemed shameful for a woman to appear in public with her hair shorn, she should keep her head covered as a sign of modesty and respect.
