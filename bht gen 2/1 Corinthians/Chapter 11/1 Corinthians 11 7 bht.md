# 1 Corinthians 11:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
A man does not need to cover his head because he represents God's dominion and is the image of God. In contrast, the woman is the glory of man, created to assist and honor him. Thus, when she appears before God, she should have her head covered as a sign of submission to man's authority.
