# 1 Corinthians 11:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
For the man is not of the woman, but the woman of the man. The man was formed directly by God, not derived from the woman. This highlights the preeminence of men over women in the order of creation. The woman, in turn, was made from the man's side, establishing a dependent relationship between them. This distinction in origin affirms the unique role and purpose each gender has in God's design. The man, being the beginning of the woman, holds a position of authority and leadership, as designed by God.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The man is not (emphasis on ἐστιν, which prevents the ἐκ having a figurative sense, of dependence: 'takes not his being,' in the fact of his original creation."
2. "The woman out of the man (compare Genesis 2:23, κληθήσεται γυνή, ὅτι ἐκ τοῦ ἀνδρὸς αὐτῆς ἐλήφθη)."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The woman was made by God mediately through the man, who was, as it were, a veil or medium placed between her and God."
2. "The man being made immediately by God as His glory, has no veil between himself and God."

### Albert Barnes:
1. For the man is not of the woman - The man was not formed from the woman.But the woman of the man - From his side; Genesis 2:18, Genesis 2:22-23.

### John Calvin:
1. "For the man is not from the woman. He establishes by two arguments the pre-eminence, which he had assigned to men above women. The first is, that as the woman derives her origin from the man, she is therefore inferior in rank."
2. "That the man is the beginning of the woman and the end for which she was made, is evident from the law. It is not good for a man to be alone. Let us make for him, etc. Farther, God took one of Adam’s ribs and formed Eve."
3. "As a work fitted for some design is inferior to its cause and the design for which it is made."

### John Gill:
1. "For the man is not of the woman,.... In the present state of things, and according to the ordinary course of generation and propagation of mankind, man is of the woman, though not without the means of man..." 
2. "...but the apostle respects the original formation of man, as he was immediately made by God out of the dust of the earth, before the woman was in being, and so not of her..."
3. "...her original under God, is owing to him; and therefore as he was first in being, he must be superior to her..."

### John Wesley:
1. The man is not — In the first production of nature.
