The creation of man and woman serves distinct purposes. The man was made not for the woman, but for God's service and glory. In contrast, the woman was created to be the man's companion, supporting him in various aspects of life, including worship and the upbringing of children. This highlights the significance of unity and mutual support in the relationship between man and woman, showcasing the divine intention for their roles and responsibilities.
