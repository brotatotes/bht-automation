# 1 Corinthians 12:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The gift of discerning is the ability to judge whether someone possesses a sincere and upright spirit, whether their spiritual gifts are natural or supernatural, and whether those who claim to speak by inspiration do so from a divine, natural, or diabolical spirit

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "discourse flowing from the revelation and impulse of the Holy Spirit, which, not being attached to any particular office in the church, but improvised, disclosed the depths of the human heart and of the divine counsel, and thus was exceedingly effectual for the enlightening, exhortation, and consolation of believers, and the winning of unbelievers."
2. "the power of distinguishing between the operation of the Spirit of God and the evil spirit, or the unassisted human spirit"
3. "the power of uttering, in ecstasy, as the mouthpiece of the Spirit, prayer and praise in languages unknown to the utterer, or even in a spiritual language unknown to man"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "working of miracles—As 'healings' are miracles, those here meant must refer to miracles of special and extraordinary POWER (so the Greek for 'miracles' means); for example, the raising of the dead, the infliction of death by a word, the innocuous use of poisons, c., are miracles of special power. Compare Mark 6:5 Acts 19:11."
2. "prophecy—Here, probably, not in the wider sense of public teaching by the Spirit; but, as its position between 'miracles' and a 'discerning of spirits' implies, the inspired disclosure of the future."
3. "discerning of spirits—discerning between the operation of God's Spirit, and the evil spirit, or unaided human spirit."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The expression used here, 'working of miracles' refers probably to the more 'extraordinary' and 'unusual' kinds of miracles; to those which were regarded as in advance of the power of healing diseases."
2. "This must refer to some power of searching into the secrets of the heart; of knowing what were a man’s purposes, views, and feelings."
3. "The power of interpreting foreign languages; or of interpreting the language which might be used by the 'prophets' in their communications;."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Prophecy. Not mere foretelling of the future...delivering inspired exhortations, instructions, or warnings." 
2. "Discerning of spirits. Distinguishing between the different prophetic utterances, whether they proceed from true or false spirits."
3. "It was an ecstatic utterance, unintelligible to the hearers, and requiring interpretation...It therefore impressed unchristian bystanders as a barbarous utterance, the effect of madness or drunkenness."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Discernings of spirits (διακρισεις πνευματων). A most needed gift to tell whether the gifts were really of the Holy Spirit and supernatural or merely strange though natural or even diabolical (1 Timothy 4:1; 1 John 4:1)."
2. "Divers kinds of tongues (γενη γλωσσων). It was not mere gibberish or jargon like the modern "tongues," but in a real language that could be understood by one familiar with that tongue."
3. "The interpretation of tongues (ερμηνεια γλωσσων). In case there was no one present who understood the particular tongue it required a special gift of the Spirit to some one to interpret it if any one was to receive benefit from it."

### John Gill:
1. "Such as raising the dead, causing the blind to see, the deaf to hear, the dumb to speak, the lame to walk, and the like."
2. "Either foretelling of future events, or a gift of understanding the prophecies of the Old Testament, and of preaching the Gospel."
3. "By which gift such that were possessed of it could, in some measure, discern the hearts of men, their thoughts, purposes, and designs, their secret dissimulation and hypocrisy."

### John Wesley:
1. "The discerning — Whether men be of an upright spirit or no; whether they have natural or supernatural gifts for offices in the church; and whether they who profess to speak by inspiration speak from a divine, a natural, or a diabolical spirit."
