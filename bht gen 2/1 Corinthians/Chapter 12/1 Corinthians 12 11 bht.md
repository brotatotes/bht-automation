# 1 Corinthians 12:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
All the various spiritual gifts and abilities that individuals possess can be traced back to the Holy Spirit. It is the Spirit who distributes these gifts to believers according to His own will and purpose. No one should be prideful about their gifts, as they are not earned or achieved, but rather given by God's sovereign choice and mercy. This truth should unite believers and prevent any rivalry or superiority among themselves. The Spirit's distribution of gifts reflects His divine nature and wisdom, as He bestows them to each believer individually for the common benefit of all.
