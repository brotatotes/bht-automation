# 1 Corinthians 12:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Christ is not only the head of the Church, but also the body itself. The Church, united with Christ, forms an organic whole. Just as the different members of the human body are all vital and necessary, the various gifts and functions of believers are valuable for the well-being of the whole body. In this unity, the Church shares in the oneness and unity of Christ, establishing a deep connection between the Head and His body. Thus, the church, as the body of Christ, is a representation of the glorious spiritual unity found in Christ.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The organic unity of the various members in one body is predicated of CHRIST, i.e., the Church as united in Him."
2. "The repetition of 'the body' strongly sets forth the unity of the members as an organic whole."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Unity, not unvarying uniformity, is the law of God in the world of grace, as in that of nature."
2. "As the many members of the body compose an organic whole and none can be dispensed with as needless, so those variously gifted by the Spirit, compose a spiritual organic whole, the body of Christ, into which all are baptized by the one Spirit."
3. "So also is Christ—that is, the whole Christ, the head and body."

### Albert Barnes:

2. "The human body is one, and yet is composed of various members and parts that all unite harmoniously in one whole."

### John Calvin:
1. "It is usual, however, for any society of men, or congregation, to be called a body, as one city constitutes a body, and so, in like manner, one senate, and one people."
2. "The meaning therefore is — 'Though the members of the body are various, and have different functions, they are, nevertheless, linked together in such a manner that they coalesce in one.'"
3. "In this, then, our consolation lies — that, as he and the Father are one, so we are one with him. Hence it is that his name is applied to us."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "For as the body is one, and hath many members, and all the members of the body, being many, are one body; so also is Christ who with the Church is an organic whole." 
2. "The received reading, 'of the one body,' has very weak support."

### Archibald T. Robertson:

3. "This idea he now elaborates in a remarkable manner."
