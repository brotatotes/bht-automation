# 1 Corinthians 12:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Through baptism, we are all brought together as members of Christ's body, symbolizing the inward changes worked within us by the Holy Spirit. This unity is not dependent on our external circumstances or social status, but on the inner transformation brought about by the grace of the Spirit. Regardless of our backgrounds or differences, whether Jew or Gentile, slave or free, if we have experienced the regeneration and sanctification of the Spirit, we all belong to Christ and are united as one body in Him.
