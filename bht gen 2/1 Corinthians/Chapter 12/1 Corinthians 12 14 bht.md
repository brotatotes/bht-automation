# 1 Corinthians 12:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The body is not one member, nor is any one member the body. The church of Christ does not consist of only one type of person, but many members. Just as in the body there are different members in different stations, in the church, there are members of varying gifts and stations. Yet, all members are one in Christ the head and are related to each other. The analogy of the body serves to show the mutual dependence and importance of each member in the body, emphasizing the unity and diversity found in the church.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The object of the continuation of the simile seems to be, to convince them that their various gifts had been bestowed by God on them as members of the Christian body, and that they must not, because they did not happen to possess the gifts of another, consider themselves excluded from the body."
2. "The passage is also illustrated by Seneca de Ira, ii. 31, ‘Quid si nocere velint manus pedibus, manibus oculi? Ut omnia inter se membra consentiunt, quia singula servari totius interest: ita homines singulis parcent, quia ad cœlum geniti sumus: salva autem esse societas nisi amore et custodia partium non potest.'"
3. "See also id. vii. 13: Clem [58] ad Cor. c. xxxvii. p. 284: and other examples in Wetstein."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The analogy of the body, not consisting exclusively of one, but of many members, illustrates the mutual dependence of the various members in the one body, the Church."
2. "The well-known fable of the belly and the other members, spoken by Menenius Agrippa, to the seceding commons, was probably before Paul's mind, stored as it was with classical literature."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The body is made up of many members, which have various offices."
2. "We are to expect the same variety there; and we are not to presume either that all will be alike."
3. "We are not to presume ... that any member that God has placed there will be useless."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The student will naturally recall the fable of the body and the members uttered by Menenius Agrippa, and related by Livy, 2, 32."
2. "The illustration seems to have been a favorite one, and occurs in Seneca, Marcus Antoninus, and others."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The point sounds like a truism, but it is the key to the whole problem of church life both local and general."
2. "Socrates pointed out how absurd it would be if feet and hands should work against one another when God made them to cooperate."
3. "Seneca alludes to it as does Marcus Aurelius and Marcus Antoninus."

### John Gill:
1. "For the body is not one member,.... Not only one; nor is anyone member the body, though ever so eminent, as the head or eye: thus the church of Christ is not one person only, or does not consist of one sort of persons..."
2. "...as only of Jews, or only of Gentiles, or only of rich and freemen, or only of men of extraordinary gifts and abilities, or greatly eminent for grace and spiritual knowledge:but many; members..."
3. "...so in the mystical body of Christ, the church, there are many members, some in a higher station, others in a lower some of greater gifts, grace, and usefulness, others of lesser; some Jews, other Gentiles; some bond, others free; yet all one in Christ the head, and all related to each other."
