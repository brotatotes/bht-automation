# 1 Corinthians 12:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Every member of the body, no matter how humble, plays a vital role in the church. We must not underestimate our worth or compare ourselves unfavorably to others. Just as the foot should not discredit itself for not being a hand, we should not diminish our value based on different roles or abilities. Instead, we should appreciate the diverse contributions and functions of each member. Ambition, envy, and misdirected emulation should not divide us. Let us recognize that every individual has an important place in the body of believers, regardless of their position or abilities.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The Œø·Ωê œÄŒ±œÅ·Ω∞ œÑ. Œ∫. œÑ. Œª. are best taken as a question, appealing to the sense of the reader: they thus have more of the vigour of the Apostle‚Äôs style."
2. "œÄŒ±œÅŒ¨, see reff."
3. "The double negation strengthens, see Winer, edn. 6, ¬ß 55. 9 b (he takes the two, in this case, as destroying one another (?), see ib. a)."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The humbler members ought not to disparage themselves, or to be disparaged by others more noble."
2. "As in life each compares himself with those whom he approaches nearest in gifts, not those far superior."
3. "The foot and hand represent men of active life; the ear and eye, those of contemplative life."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The same figure and illustration which Paul here uses occurs also in pagan writers."
2. "The idea here is, that as the foot and the ear could not pretend that they were not parts of the body, and even not important, because they were not the eye, etc."
3. "No Christian, however humble his endowments, could pretend that he was useless because he was not more highly gifted and did not occupy a more elevated rank."

### John Calvin:
1. "Each member ought to rest satisfied with its own place and station, and not envy the others."
2. "For the eye has a more honorable place in the body than the hand, and the hand than the foot."
3. "These things are said of the natural body, but they must be applied to the members of the Church, lest ambition or misdirected emulation and envy should be the occasion of bad feeling among us."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "If the foot shall say, Because I am not the hand, I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the body?" - The interrogative sense is against the usage of the Greek language with two such negatives. 
2. "The grammatical principle is undoubtedly correct; but since very much depends in such cases on how the statement is concerned by the writer, we incline to think that the real sense is conveyed quite as correctly by the interrogative form as by the affirmative." - The interrogative form of this verse is most accordant with the lively style and strain of the argument.

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "I am independent of the body, not dependent on the body."
2. "It is not therefore not of the body."
3. "The two negatives (ŒøœÖ--ŒøœÖŒ∫) do not here destroy one another. Each retains its full force."

### John Gill:
1. "One that is in the lowest station in the church... represents the least of saints... who has the smallest degree of heavenly affection, and knowledge of spiritual light and understanding."
2. "Christ... regards such as members; he admires the 'beauty' of his church's 'feet', and has provided for the covering, ornament, and security of them... he regards their prayers, and takes notice and accepts of their meanest services."
3. "They are, and should be considered as members of the body, by the rest and by themselves, the mystical body, the church."

### John Wesley:
1. "The foot is elegantly introduced as speaking of the hand; the ear, of the eye; each, of a part that has some resemblance to it."
2. "So among men each is apt to compare himself with those whose gifts some way resemble his own, rather than with those who are at a distance, either above or beneath him."
3. "Is it therefore not of the body ‚Äî Is the inference good? Perhaps the foot may represent private Christians; the hand, officers in the church; the eye, teachers; the ear, hearers."
