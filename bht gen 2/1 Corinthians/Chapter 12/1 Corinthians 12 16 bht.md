# 1 Corinthians 12:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In understanding the significance of 1 Corinthians 12:15, it becomes clear that the ear is seen as a less noble part, while the eye is regarded as the most noble. The essence lies in truly hearing and grasping the word of God, not only as passive listeners, but as ones who love, savor, and relish in it. This active engagement calls for understanding, belief, and actions aligned with the teachings. Just as ministers of the Gospel radiate insight and light, true members of the church, regardless of their role, are respected and esteemed by Christ and their fellow believers.
