# 1 Corinthians 12:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The passage reminds us of the importance of diversity within the body of Christ. Just as the eye is a remarkable and vital organ, it would be absurd if the entire body consisted only of eyes. Each member has a unique function and contribution to make, just like the different gifts granted by the Spirit. It would be foolish to desire equality to the point of excluding other members or neglecting their roles. Instead, we should honor and value the various gifts and functions within the body, acknowledging that each one is necessary for its overall health and effectiveness.
