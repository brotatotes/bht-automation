# 1 Corinthians 12:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
God's arrangement of the members of the body is purposeful and intentional, according to His will. Each member has been assigned a specific place and function, with the utmost wisdom and goodness. Therefore, let us submit to God's design, knowing that He has positioned each one in the best possible situation for the benefit and service of the whole. Instead of questioning or resisting God's will, let us recognize that He works all things according to the counsel of His own perfect wisdom.
