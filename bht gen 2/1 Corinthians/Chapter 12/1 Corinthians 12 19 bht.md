# 1 Corinthians 12:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
If all the members of the body were the same, like all eyes or all ears or all hands or all feet, the body would not function properly. Similarly, if the community of the saints were all the same, consisting only of ministers or only of hearers, there would be no diverse and beneficial body of believers. The proper arrangement of different members with their unique gifts contributes to the unity and usefulness of the church. It is crucial to recognize that in God's wisdom, He has designed this variety for the common advantage and well-being of all.
