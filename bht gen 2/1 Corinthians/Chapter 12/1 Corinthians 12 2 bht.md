# 1 Corinthians 12:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The believers were once led astray, blindly following idols that were devoid of any speech or divinity. Their pagan worship lacked any fixed principles, as they were led by the whims and delusions of false guides. However, in contrast to these dumb idols, they now believed in a living and speaking God who worked through His Spirit within them. The former confusion and lack of understanding in their pagan worship had now been replaced by the grace and gifts of the Spirit. They were to humbly acknowledge God's free grace and the unworthiness of their past idolatrous practices.
