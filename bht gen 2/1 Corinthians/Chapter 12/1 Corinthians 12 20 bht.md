# 1 Corinthians 12:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The unity of the body is evident in the fact that it is made up of many members which have different functions and roles, yet they are all interconnected and reliant on one another. Each member plays a unique and essential part in the body, and without any one of them, there would be a lack, and the body would not be complete. This unity is necessary as the members need one another in order to fulfill their purposes and functions within the body.
