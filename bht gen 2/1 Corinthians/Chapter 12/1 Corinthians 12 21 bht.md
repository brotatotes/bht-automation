# 1 Corinthians 12:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The interconnectedness and value of every member within a body cannot be underestimated, regardless of their rank or significance. Just like the hand is indispensable to the eye, and the feet are as crucial as the head, each individual plays a vital role in the functioning of the whole. Even those who are considered less important or esteemed are actually necessary for the well-being and productivity of the entire body. It is essential for the higher members to acknowledge and appreciate the contributions of the lower members, as they cannot effectively fulfill their duties without their cooperation and assistance.
