# 1 Corinthians 12:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The seemingly weaker members of the body are actually necessary for its proper function, just like the brain, belly, and eye. While they may be more susceptible to harm or disease, they should not be overlooked or undervalued. These feeble and delicate parts, which call forth our greater care for their preservation, contribute to the overall health and well-being of the body. They have an important role to play, just as vital organs are crucial for life. It is through recognizing and supporting these seemingly weaker members that the body can thrive and grow, building itself up in love.

3. "The feeble and tender saints, whose hearts and hands are to be strengthened, whose infirmities are to be bore, have their usefulness; and the effectual working in the measure of every part, even of the feeble and tender, maketh increase of the body, to the edifying of itself in love."
