# 1 Corinthians 12:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Certain parts of the body, which may be deemed less honorable or comely, actually warrant more abundant honor and care. The act of adorning and covering these parts serves as a reflection of this principle. Likewise, within the church, we should extend greater concern and respect towards those who may be considered of lower rank or lacking in spiritual gifts. In doing so, we prevent any disgrace from impacting the entire body and maintain the integrity of God's name and Christ's ways.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Perhaps he alludes (as distinguished from τὰ ἀσχήμ . below) to those limbs which we conceal from sight in accordance with custom, but in the exposure of which there would be no absolute indecency." 
2. "Honouring them more than the face, the noblest part, which we do not clothe."
3. "Here there is no ἃ δοκοῦμεν, and no ambiguity. Chrys. (ibid.) says: … ἀλλʼ ὅμως πλείονος ἀπολαύει τιμῆς · καὶ οἱ σφόδρα πένητες, κἂν τὸ λοιπὸν γυμνὸν ἔχωσι σῶμα, οὐκ ἂν ἀνάσχοιντο ἐκεῖνα τὰ μέλη δεῖξαι γυμνά."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "We think" the feet and the belly "less honorable," though not really so in the nature of things.
2. Bestow... honour—putting shoes on (Margin) the feet, and clothes to cover the belly.
3. Uncomely parts—the secret parts: the poorest, though unclad in the rest of the body, cover these.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "We bestow upon them more attention and honor then we do on the face that is deemed comely, and that is not covered and adorned as the other parts of the body are."
2. "We adorn and decorate the body with frivilous apparel. Those parts which decency requires us to conceal we not only cover, but we endeavor as far as we can to adorn them. The face in the mean time we leave uncovered."
3. "The idea is, that, in like manner, we should not despise or disregard those members of the church who are of lower rank, or who are less favored than others with spiritual endowments."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The more abundant honor is shown by the care in clothing."
2. "The comeliness is outward, as is shown by the verb we put on."
3. "The comeliness is outward, as is shown...by the compounds of 'ochma' fashion."

### John Calvin:
1. "The dishonor of one member turns out to the common disgrace of the whole body."
2. "Those parts that involve shame, or are less comely, are cared for by us with greater concern."
3. "To invest with honor is to put on a covering for the sake of ornament, in order that those members may be honorably concealed, which would involve shame if uncovered."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Upon these we bestow more abundant honour in covering and care."
2. "Our uncomely parts have more abundant comeliness to protect them from unjust disparagement in relation to other parts of the body."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "We bestow (περιτιθεμεν). Literally, We place around as if a garland (Mark 15:17) or a garment (Matthew 27:28)."
2. "More abundant comeliness (ευσχημοσυνην περισσοτεραν). One need only mention the mother's womb and the mother's breast to see the force of Paul's argument here. The word, common in old Greek, from ευσχημων (ευ, well, σχημα, figure), here only in N.T."
3. "One may think of the coal-miner who digs under the earth for the coal to keep us warm in winter. So ασχημων (deformed, uncomely), old word, here only in N.T., but see 1 Corinthians 7:36 for ασχημονεω."

### John Gill:
1. "The poor members of Christ's church, who are thought to be, though they really are not, the less honourable, have the more abundant honour conferred on them by God and Christ."
2. "These Christ has given his churches a particular charge to take care of now, and will own them as his brethren at the great day, before angels and men..."
3. "...all possible care taken that their faults may not be exposed to the world, that so the name of God, and ways of Christ, may not be blasphemed and evil spoken of."

### John Wesley:
1. We surround with more abundant honour — By so carefully covering them.More abundant comeliness — By the help of dress.
