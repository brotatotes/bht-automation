# 1 Corinthians 12:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Our body is a harmonious structure, each part dependent on another, with God giving greater honor to the parts that lack. This is similar to how the church is composed of diverse individuals, rich and poor, with varying gifts. God has arranged it this way, so that each member can contribute to the well-being of the whole. We should recognize and value every member, understanding that each has an important role to play in the growth and functioning of the church.
