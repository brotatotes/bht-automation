# 1 Corinthians 12:25 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The body of believers should strive for unity and harmony, avoiding division and disunity. All members, regardless of their abilities, should be valued and not disregarded. Instead, there should be genuine care and concern for one another. Just as trouble in one part of the body affects the whole, the well-being of each member should be a concern for the entire body. This analogy illustrates the interconnectedness and mutual dependence within the body of believers. This understanding should lead to a sincere and selfless care for the welfare of all members.
