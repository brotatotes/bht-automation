# 1 Corinthians 12:26 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When a member of the church experiences affliction, whether it be physical or emotional, the rest of the body should be affected by it. They should offer condolences, sympathize, and provide assistance. It is important to weep with those who are mourning and share in their sorrows. Just as the death of one brother brings grief to all, the loss of one member affects the entire community.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "But perhaps the analogy requires that we should rather understand δοε . of those things which physically refresh or benefit the member, e.g. anointing or nourishment." 
2. "we see that God’s temperament of the body has not failed of its purpose, for the members sympathize most intimately with one another."
3. "Chrys. again with equal beauty instances, στεφανοῦται ἡ κεφαλή, καὶ ἅπας ὁ ἄνθρωπος δοξάζεται · λέγει τὸ στόμα, καὶ γελῶσιν ὀφθαλμοὶ καὶ εὐφραίνονται (ibid.)."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "When a thorn enters the heel, the whole body feels it, and is concerned: the back bends, the belly and thighs contract themselves, the hands come forward and draw out the thorn, the head stoops, and the eyes regard the affected member with intense gaze" [CHRYSOSTOM].
2. "When the head is crowned, the whole man feels honored, the mouth expresses, and the eyes look, gladness" [CHRYSOSTOM].

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The word 'suffer' here refers to disease, or sickness...disease in any one part tends to diffuse itself through, and to affect the whole frame."
2. "In all things pertaining to religion and to their mutual welfare, they should feel that they have a common cause, and regard it as a privilege to aid one another."
3. "If one member is favored with remarkable talent, or is raised to a station of influence, and exerts his influence in the cause of Christ, all the members of the church partake of the benefit."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "If any one was beaten or maimed or suffered any violence, any man that would and was able might prosecute the wrongdoer; intending by this to accustom the citizens, like members of the same body, to resent and be sensible of one another's injuries." (Plutarch of Solon's Laws)
2. "As in the body, when but a finger is hurt, the whole frame, drawn towards the soul and forming one realm under the ruling power therein, feels the hurt and sympathizes all together with the part affected." (Plato)
3. "The head is crowned, and all the members have a share in the honor; the eyes laugh when the mouth speaks." (Chrysostom)

### John Calvin:
1. "Such a measure of fellow-feeling...is to be seen in the human body, that, if any inconvenience is felt by any member, all the others grieve along with it, and, on the other hand, rejoice along with it, in its prosperity." 
2. "Nothing, however, is better fitted to promote harmony than this community of interest, when everyone feels that, by the prosperity of others, he is proportionally enriched, and, by their penury, impoverished."
3. "Hence there is no room there for envy or contempt."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Suffer with it (συνπασχε). Medical term in this sense in Hippocrates and Galen. In N.T only here and Romans 8:17 (of our suffering with Christ)."
2. "One of Solon's Laws allowed retaliation by any one for another's injuries. Plato (Republic, V, 462) says the body politic 'feels the hurt' as the whole body feels a hurt finger."
3. "Rejoice with it (συνχαιρε). This is fortunately true also. One may tingle with joy all over the body thanks to the wonderful nervous system and to the relation between mind and matter. See 1 Corinthians 13:6 for joy of love with truth."

### John Gill:
1. "So when anyone member of the mystical body is in affliction, whether inward or outward, of body or mind, the rest are, or should be, affected with it, condole, sympathize, help, and assist."
