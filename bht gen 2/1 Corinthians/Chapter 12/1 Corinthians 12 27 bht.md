# 1 Corinthians 12:27 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Each church is a representation of the body of Christ, with its individual members fulfilling specific roles and functions. It is essential to recognize that Christ is the head of the entire church, and all members are united and subject to Him. Just as the members of a human body work together harmoniously, so should the members of the church. Each individual has a unique place and purpose within the body, contributing to its overall function. Therefore, let us value and appreciate one another's contributions, fostering mutual affection, fellow-feeling, and concern for the common advantage of the church.
