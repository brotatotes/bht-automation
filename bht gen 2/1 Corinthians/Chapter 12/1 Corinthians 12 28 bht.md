# 1 Corinthians 12:28 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the church, there are different orders or ranks that God has established. The first rank consists of apostles, who were specially chosen and directly commissioned by Christ Himself. They played a crucial role in spreading the gospel to the nations. The second rank includes prophets, who either foretell future events or speak through extraordinary inspiration to build up the church. Lastly, there are teachers, who hold a significant position in the church and precede even those who work miraculous signs and wonders. These various roles are essential for the growth and edification of the church.
