# 1 Corinthians 12:29 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Are all? Certainly not. In the body of Christ, each member has different roles and gifts. Some are prophets, distinct from apostles and teachers. Others may not possess any of these gifts. The distribution of offices and gifts reminds us that no one person is sufficient in all things, but together they form a complete body. This passage serves to humble and prevent boasting, envy, and arrogance among believers. It also highlights that not everyone possesses the gift of performing miracles, a characteristic of early times.
