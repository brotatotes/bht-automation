# 1 Corinthians 12:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
No one can attribute true lordship or redemption to Jesus without the presence of the Holy Spirit. This Spirit is the source of spiritual gifts, dwelling only among Christians who speak by Him. Those who reject Jesus as Lord or speak against Him are not under the influence of the Holy Spirit but are following the ways of the unconverted Gentiles. It is through the Spirit of God that we are brought back into the way of truth and are able to honor the name and work of Jesus Christ.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The Spirit of God, or the Holy Ghost, is the Power pervading the speaker, the Element in which he speaks."
2. "Jesus (not Christ, the Name of office, itself in some measure the object of faith, but Jesus, the personal Name, the historical Person whose life was matter of fact: the curse, and the confession, are in this way far deeper) is accursed."
3. "By these last words the influence of the Holy Spirit is widened by the Apostle from the supernatural gifts to which perhaps it had been improperly confined, to the faith and confession of every Christian."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The same Spirit is called at one time 'the Spirit of GOD'; at another, 'the HOLY Ghost,' or 'Holy Spirit.' Infinite Holiness is almost synonymous with Godhead."
2. "Jesus—not an abstract doctrine, but the historical, living God-man."
3. "The spiritual man feels Him to be the Source of all blessings and to be severed from Him is to be accursed."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The design of the passage is, to give them some simple general guide by which they could at once recognize the operations of the Spirit of God, and determine whether they who claimed to be under that operation were really so."
2. "The argument is, that the Holy Spirit in all instances would do honor to Jesus Christ, and would prompt all who were under his influence to love and reverence his name."
3. "We may learn from it: (1) That it is a proof that any man is under the influence of the Holy Spirit who is heartily disposed to honor the name and work of Jesus Christ."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Calleth Jesus accursed [λεγει αναθεμα ιησους] . Lit., saith Anathema Jesus."
2. "Rev., preserving the formula, saith Jesus is Anathema."
3. "Paul uses only the form ajnaqema, and always in the sense of accursed."

### John Calvin:
1. "What the Corinthians had experienced in themselves is common to all mankind—to wander on in error, previously to their being brought back, through the kindness of God, into the way of truth."
2. "From this, too, it follows, that all things that pertain to the true knowledge of God are the gifts of the Holy Spirit."
3. "No one, speaking by the Spirit of God, can revile Christ; so, on the other hand, no one can speak well of Christ, but by the Spirit of Christ."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Speaking in the Spirit of God...Jesus is anathema" - On the distinction between αναθεμα (curse) and αναθημα (offering), see discussion there.
2. "Jesus is Lord...The term Κυριος, as we have seen, is common in the LXX for God. The Romans used it freely for the emperor in the emperor worship."
3. "One is reminded of the demand made by Polycarp that he say Κυριος Χαεσαρ and how each time he replied Κυριος Ιησους."

### John Gill:
1. "No man speaking by the Spirit of God calleth Jesus accursed; or 'anathema', as did the unconverted Gentiles" 
2. "These crucify him afresh, trample him under foot, count his blood as a common thing, and do malice to his Spirit; and therefore cannot be thought to have him, and speak by him." 
3. "No man can call him his Lord, can appropriate him to himself truly and really, as his Lord, Saviour, and Redeemer...but by the Spirit"

### John Wesley:
1. "Since the heathen idols cannot speak themselves, much less give spiritual gifts to others, these must necessarily be among Christians only."
2. "As none who does this, (which all the Jews and heathens did,) speaketh by the Spirit of God - Is actuated by that Spirit, so as to speak with tongues, heal diseases, or cast out devils."
3. "None have the Holy Spirit but Christians: all Christians have this Spirit."
