# 1 Corinthians 12:30 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In 1 Corinthians 12:10, Paul poses the question of whether all believers have the ability to interpret unknown tongues. One perspective states that anointing with oil for healing was exclusively carried out by church elders. Another viewpoint emphasizes that not everyone possesses the gift of speaking in tongues, contrary to popular desire. Similarly, the interpretation of unknown tongues is seen as a distinct ability bestowed on certain individuals. These insights illuminate the context of Paul's query, revealing the varied spiritual gifts present within the church community.

1.  Do all interpret?  (ŒºŒ∑ œÄŒ±ŒΩœÑŒµœÇ Œ¥ŒπŒµœÅŒºŒ∑ŒΩŒµœÖŒøœÖœÉŒπŒΩ?). He adds this query to the list in 1 Corinthians 12:28, but it is in 1 Corinthians 12:10. 

### John Gill:
1. "When anointing with oil, in order to heal the sick, was in use, it was only performed by the elders of the church, not by the common members of it."
2. "Do all speak with tongues? No; it was not true in fact, as they well knew; though this was greatly coveted after, as a following chapter of this epistle shows."
3. "Do all interpret? That is, unknown tongues, strange languages; or can they? No. This also was a peculiar gift bestowed on some persons only."
