# 1 Corinthians 12:31 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Desiring the best gifts is commendable, as long as it is accompanied by a pursuit of the most excellent gift that surpasses all others. While it may be difficult for everyone to attain the best gifts, there is a gift that is far more excellent than any other. This gift is accessible to all and is necessary for our spiritual well-being.

In every word, work, wish, fear - pilot, comrade, helper, savior; glory of gods and men, leader best and brightest; in whose footsteps let every man follow, sweetly singing in his honor that sweet strain with which love charms the souls of gods and men" (Plato, 'Symposium,' 197).
