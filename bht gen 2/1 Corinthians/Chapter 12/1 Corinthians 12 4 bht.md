# 1 Corinthians 12:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The diverse gifts present in the Christian church are distinct and varied, but they all originate from the same source - the Holy Spirit. Each member of the church is endowed with unique spiritual abilities that serve a specific purpose within the body of Christ. Therefore, it is important to value and appreciate the different gifts, as they all contribute to the overall functioning and growth of the church.

3. "The sum of what he states amounts to this ‚Äî that gifts are not distributed thus variously among believers, in order that they may be used apart, but that in the division there is a unity, inasmuch as one Spirit is the source of all those gifts, one God is the Lord of all administrations, and the author of all exercises of power."
