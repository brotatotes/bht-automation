# 1 Corinthians 12:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
There are different roles and functions within the church, appointed by the Lord Himself. These ministries vary in importance and serve various purposes, but they are all necessary for the body of Christ to function effectively. No one should boast or feel inferior based on their specific role, as each ministry has been assigned by God. The diversity of offices and services within the church is designed to bring glory to the Lord and fulfill His purposes.
