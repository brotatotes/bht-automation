# 1 Corinthians 12:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
God, who is the source of all good and praiseworthy things, is also the Energizer of the Universe. The various powers and qualifications found in the Church are manifestations of His work. These operations, or effects, are attributed to the Holy Spirit, who is referred to as the Spirit, the Lord, and God. Together with the Father and the Son, the Holy Spirit is part of the divine Trinity. It is important to note that while believers may possess different gifts, they all originate from the same God.
