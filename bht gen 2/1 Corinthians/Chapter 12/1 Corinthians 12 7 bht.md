# 1 Corinthians 12:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The manifestation of the Spirit is a gift that is given to every individual for the benefit of the entire body of believers. This gift, bestowed by the Spirit, serves to demonstrate and reveal His work and nature within each person. It is not only for personal gain but also for the collective well-being of the Church as a whole. When the Spirit enriches us with His gifts, He unveils His treasures to make known to us what would otherwise be hidden. May we use these gifts wisely and for the common good.

### John Calvin:
1. "The manifestation of the Spirit may be taken in a passive as well as in an active sense - in a passive sense, because wherever there is prophecy, or knowledge, or any other gift, the Spirit of God does there manifest himself – in an active sense, because the Spirit of God, when he enriches us with any gift, unlocks his treasures, for the purpose of manifesting to us those things that would otherwise have been concealed and shut up."
2. "As to this Paul answers - (with a view to utility) - πρὸς τὸ συμφερον; that is, that the Church may receive advantage thereby."
