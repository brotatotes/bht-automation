# 1 Corinthians 12:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Believers are endowed with different gifts by the Spirit of God. Wisdom enables individuals to order their Christian lives according to foundational principles, while knowledge grants theoretical insight into divine matters. Both gifts are crucial for active participation in the Church. Wisdom allows for comprehensive views of redemption, while knowledge imparts revealed truths. The Spirit empowers believers with these gifts, working within their hearts and minds. Through these gifts, believers gain a deeper understanding of God's wisdom and the mysteries of His redemptive plan.
