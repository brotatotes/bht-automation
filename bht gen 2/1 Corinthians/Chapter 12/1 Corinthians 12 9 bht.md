# 1 Corinthians 12:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Faith can be understood as an extraordinary trust in God, even in the face of difficult or dangerous situations. It may also refer to the ability to preach and defend the doctrine of faith with boldness and intrepidity, which comes from the Spirit of God. The gift of healing is not limited to miraculous healings, but can also work through natural remedies. Similarly, other gifts from God may manifest in subtle ways, under human studies and efforts, with God's power being more abundant when given more room.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "A faith, enabling a man to place himself beyond the region of mere moral certainty, in the actual realization of things believed, in a high and unusual manner."
2. "In, i.e. by and through, as the effective cause and the medium."
3. "Gifts of (miraculous) healings; plur., to indicate the different kinds of diseases, requiring different sorts of healing."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "faith—not of doctrines, but of miracles: confidence in God, by the impulse of His Spirit, that He would enable them to perform any required miracle."
2. "Its nature, or principle, is the same as that of saving faith, namely, reliance on God; the producing cause, also, in the same, namely, a power altogether supernatural."
3. "Hence, we see, saving faith does not save by its intrinsic merit, but by the merits of Him who is the object of it."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Many of the most useful people in the church are distinguished mainly for their simple confidence in the promises of God..."
2. "Humble piety and reliance in the divine promises, and that measure of ardor, fearlessness, and zeal which result from such confidence..."
3. "Faith is one of the highest endowments of the Christian life; and yet, though all may obtain it, it is one of the rarest endowments."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Faith. Not saving faith in general, which is the common endowment of all Christians, but wonder - working faith.

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Faith (πιστις). Not faith of surrender, saving faith, but wonder-working faith like that in 1 Corinthians 13:2 (Matthew 17:20; Matthew 21:21)."
2. "Gifts of healings (χαρισματα ιαματων). Ιαμα, old word from ιαομα, common in LXX, in N.T. only in this chapter. It means acts of healing as in Acts 4:30 (cf. James 5:14) and Luke 7:21 (of Jesus)." 
3. "Note εν here as just before."

### John Gill:
1. "Not the grace of faith, which is common to all believers, though given by the same Spirit: but rather the doctrine of faith, and ability to preach it, and boldness and intrepidity of spirit to assert and defend it in the face of all opposition; all which are from the Spirit of God"
2. "Though generally this is understood of a faith of working miracles, but the working of miracles is mentioned afterwards as distinct, unless it can be thought that this is the general name for miracles, and the rest that follow the particulars of them."
3. "Now these gifts were bestowed in common, by the Spirit, on apostles, prophets, and pastors, or elders of the church, in those early times."

### John Wesley:
1. "Faith may here mean an extraordinary trust in God under the most difficult or dangerous circumstances."
2. "The gift of healing need not be wholly confined to the healing diseases with a word or a touch. It may exert itself also, though in a lower degree, where natural remedies are applied."
3. "And thus it may be with regard to other gifts likewise...the power of God exerts itself in a more covert manner, under human studies and helps; and that the more plentifully, according as there is the more room given for it."
