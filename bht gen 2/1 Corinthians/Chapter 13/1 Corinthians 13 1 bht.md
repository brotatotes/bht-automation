# 1 Corinthians 13:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The gift of tongues, though highly valued in the Corinthian church, pales in comparison to the grace of love. Love is the par excellence way in the letter to the Corinthians. It surpasses the noisy and jangling sounds of the other gifts, like a sweet bell in the midst of confusion. Just as the cymbal produces clashing sounds, the gifts without love are nothing more than empty noise, lacking the depth and meaning that love provides.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Even if I can speak, though I speak."
2. "Tongues speaking in all possible ways, surely, in the common acceptation of words, must mean tongues speaking all possible languages."
3. "Love to all, in its most general sense, as throughout the chapter: no distinction being here drawn between love to man and to God, but the general principle dealt with, from which both spring."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "He does not except even himself, and so passes from addressing them ('unto you') to putting the case in his own person." 
2. "Speaking with tongues... and with the command of various languages, which some at Corinth abused to purposes of mere ostentation."
3. "Charity is the principle of the ordinary and more important gifts of the Spirit, as contrasted with the extraordinary gifts."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "To correct this, and to show them that all this would be vain without love, and to induce them, therefore, to seek for love as a more valuable endowment..."
2. "The language of angels here seems to be used to denote the highest power of using language, or of the most elevated faculty of eloquence and speech."
3. "The sense is, 'If I could speak all languages, yet if I had not love, the faculty would be like the clattering, clanging sound of the cymbal, that contributes nothing to the welfare of others. It would all be hollow, vain, useless.'"

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Charity follows the caritas of the Vulgate, and is not used consistently in the A. V. On the contrary, in the gospels, ajgaph is always rendered love, and mostly elsewhere, except in this epistle, where the word occurs but twice."
2. "Charity, in modern usage, has acquired the senses of tolerance and beneficence, which express only single phases of love."
3. "The comparison is between the unmeaning clash of metal, and music; between ecstatic utterances which are jargon, and utterances inspired by love, which, though unintelligible to the hearers, may carry a meaning to the speaker himself and to God."

### John Calvin:
1. "This, then, is the most excellent way, when love is the regulating principle of all our actions."
2. "For nothing is so excellent or estimable as not to be vitiated in the sight of God, if love is wanting."
3. "It is not then to be wondered, if all our deeds are estimated by this test - their appearing to proceed from love."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The gift of tongues seems to have been largely possessed and eagerly exercised in the Corinthian church."
2. "'The most exalted form of creature utterance.'"
3. "I am become sounding brass or a clanging cymbal giving forth no real music but mere jumbling sounds."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "It comes like a sweet bell right between the jangling noise of the gifts in chapters 12 and 14."
2. "Love is the way par excellence of 1 Corinthians 12:31."
3. "Whether Paul had ever seen Jesus in the flesh, he knows him in the spirit."

### John Gill:
1. "The grace of love which they were possessed of, was abundantly preferable to it."
2. "The apostle suggests, that the grace of love which they were possessed of, was abundantly preferable to it."
3. "But rather, 'the loud', or 'high sounding cymbal'...to the confused clamours and noises made upon going to battle, just upon the onset, by drums and cymbals."
