# 1 Corinthians 13:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When the fullness of knowledge and understanding of God's mysteries is realized, the limitations and imperfections of our current knowledge will fade away. At death and in the last day, we will finally experience the perfect and complete revelation. The partial and incomplete knowledge we currently possess will vanish, along with its slow and unsatisfactory methods of attainment and communication. We will be transformed and will no longer rely on the fragmentary and imperfect understanding we have now.
