# 1 Corinthians 13:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In our current state, we have only a limited understanding, comparable to that of children. However, we can look forward to a time when we will have a much greater knowledge and wisdom. We will grow out of our childish ways and embrace a mature understanding of spiritual matters. This transition will be voluntary and effortless, as we willingly discard our previous limited perspectives.
