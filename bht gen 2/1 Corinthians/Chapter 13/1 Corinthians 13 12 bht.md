# 1 Corinthians 13:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In our current understanding of God, it is akin to looking at a dim reflection in a mirror, only perceiving His imperfect forms. This leaves us with puzzling and intricate thoughts, causing everything to be somewhat of a riddle. However, in the future, we will have a direct and unobstructed view of God, seeing Him face to face with clarity and distinction. In that moment, our knowledge will be complete and comprehensive, mirroring the way God knows and understands us fully, transcending the limitations of our earthly existence.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "[Through a mirror] i.e. as Billroth, Meyer, and De W. according to the popular illusion, which regards the object, really seen behind the mirror, as seen through it." 
2. "There is a reference to ref. Num., œÉœÑœåŒºŒ± Œ∫Œ±œÑ·Ω∞ œÉœÑœåŒºŒ± ŒªŒ±ŒªŒÆœÉœâ Œ±·ΩêœÄ·ø∑ ·ºêŒΩ Œµ·º¥Œ¥ŒµŒπ, Œ∫Œ±·Ω∂ Œø·Ωê Œ¥Œπ º Œ±·º∞ŒΩŒπŒ≥ŒºŒ¨œÑœâŒΩ. Many take the words adverbially, 'enigmatically'...because Œ±·º¥ŒΩŒπŒ≥ŒºŒ± is objective, not subjective... 'a dark hint given by words.'"
3. "I shall thoroughly know even as I was (during this life: he places himself in that state, and uses the aor. as of a thing gone by) thoroughly known."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The contrast is between the inadequate knowledge of an object gained by seeing it reflected in a dim mirror (such as ancient mirrors were), compared with the perfect idea we have of it by seeing itself directly."
2. "But neither 'eye nor ear' can fully represent (though the believer's soul gets a small revelation now of) 'the things which God hath prepared for them that love Him.'"
3. "Now we are known by, rather than know, God."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Compared with what it will be in the future world, it is like the imperfect view of an object which we have in looking through an obscure and opaque medium compared with the view which we have when we look at it 'face to face.'"
2. "It is, therefore, probable that he refers to those transparent substances which the ancients had, and which they used in their windows occasionally; such as thin plates of horn, transparent stone, etc."
3. "But then shall I know - My knowledge shall be clear and distinct. I shall have a clear view of those objects which are now so indistinct and obscure."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The thought of imperfect seeing is emphasized by the character of the ancient mirror, which was of polished metal, and required constant polishing..."
2. "The figure of the mirror, illustrating the partial vision of divine things, is frequent in the rabbinical writings..."
3. "The word expressing the obscure form in which the revelation appears."

### John Calvin:
1. "The ministry of the word, I say, is like a looking-glass...For we, who have not as yet reached that great height, behold the image of God as it is presented before us in the word, in the sacraments, and, in fine, in the whole of the service of the Church."
2. "The knowledge of God, which we now have from his word, is indeed certain and true, and has nothing in it that is confused, or perplexed, or dark, but is spoken of as comparatively obscure, because it comes far short of that clear manifestation to which we look forward."
3. "Then we shall see God ‚Äî not in his image, but in himself, so that there will be, in a manner, a mutual view."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The mirrors of those days were not like ours, but polished metallic surfaces, reflecting objects but imperfectly..."
2. "...the observer seemed to see 'through' it."
3. "As we are here perfectly known of God, so hereafter we shall ourselves know perfectly; in the sense, however, not of absolute but of relative perfection."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "To see a friend's face in a cheap mirror would be very different from looking at the friend."
2. "Face to face. Note triple use of œÄœÅŒøœÇ which means facing one as in John 1:1."
3. "I shall fully know. Future middle indicative as Œ≥ŒπŒΩœâœÉŒ∫œâ (I know) is present active and ŒµœÄŒµŒ≥ŒΩœâœÉŒ∏Œ∑ŒΩ (I was fully known) is first aorist passive."

### John Gill:
1. "In this present life, they that are enlightened by the Spirit of God, see God, the perfections and glory of his nature, the riches of his grace and goodness, as displayed in Christ."
2. "But then face to face: there will be no intervening mediums of vision; not the glass of the word and ordinances; there will be no need of them, God and Christ will be seen as they are."
3. "He signifies that he should know God, Christ, angels, and glorified saints, and all truths in a perfect manner, even as he was known of God and Christ perfectly, allowing for the difference between the Creator and the creature."

### John Wesley:
1. "But by means of a glass - Or mirror, which reflects only their imperfect forms, in a dim, faint, obscure manner; so that our thoughts about them are puzzling and intricate, and everything is a kind of riddle to us."
2. "But then ‚Äî We shall see, not a faint reflection, but the objects themselves. Face to face ‚Äî Distinctly."
3. "But then I shall know even as also I am known ‚Äî In a clear, full, comprehensive manner; in some measure like God, who penetrates the centre of every object, and sees at one glance through my soul and all things."
