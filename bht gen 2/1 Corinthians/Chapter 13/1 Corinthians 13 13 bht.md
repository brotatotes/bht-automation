# 1 Corinthians 13:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Faith, hope, and love are the enduring graces that remain with God's people. Love surpasses the transient gifts and is the greatest virtue as it continues to hold a significant place in preserving the Church. While faith and hope have their purpose in the present, love prevails through perfection and even in the life to come. It is in love that saints serve one another, both in temporal and spiritual matters. Love is the ultimate expression of God's character, making it the greatest of all virtues.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Some gifts shall pass away but these three great graces shall remain for ever FAITH, HOPE, LOVE."
2. "But how can faith abide, faith, which is the evidence of things not seen, where all things once believed are seen? In the form of holy confidence and trust, faith will abide even there."
3. "The greater, because it contains in itself the root of the other two: we believe only one whom we love, we hope only that which we love."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Whereas it is the case that the three gifts, 'prophecy,' 'tongues,' and 'knowledge' (cited as specimens of the whole class of gifts) 'fail,' there abide permanently only these threeâ€”faith, hope, charity." 
2. "Charity, or love, alone never faileth."
3. "Even hereafter faith in the sense of trust in God 'abideth'; also 'hope,' in relation to ever new joys in prospect, and at the anticipation of ever increasing blessedness, sure never to be disappointed. But love alone in every sense 'abideth'; it is therefore 'the greatest' of the three, as also because it presupposes 'faith,' which without 'love' and its consequent 'works' is dead."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "And now abideth...faith, hope, and love would 'remain' when the gift of tongues should cease, and the need of prophecy, etc.; that is, these should survive them all."
2. "They would survive them all; would be valuable when they should cease; and should, therefore, be mainly sought; and of these the greatest and most important is love." 
3. "But the greatest of these is charity - Not because it is to 'endure' the longest, but because it is the more important virtue; it exerts a wider influence; it is more necessary to the happiness of society; it overcomes more evils."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Now is logical and not temporal, bringing out the contrast with the transient gifts."
2. "Abideth. Not merely in this life. The essential permanence of the three graces is asserted."
3. "In their nature they are eternal."

### John Calvin:
1. "This is a conclusion from what goes before â€” that love is more excellent than other gifts."
2. "Faith and hope belong to a state of imperfection: love will remain even in a state of perfection."
3. "Hence it is evident, that it is declared here to be superior â€” not in every respect, but inasmuch as it will be perpetual, and holds at present the first place in the preservation of the Church."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The cardinal graces of faith and hope and love, without which the Christian character cannot exist, will abide on earth as long as the Church itself is left there."
2. "As to the future of those graces, the truth would seem to be that since 'faith' and 'hope' will certainly pass into sight, and so be lost in any distinctive sense, they are to be viewed as, in their very nature, temporary means towards something else into which they are destined to pass; while love, from its very nature, though admitting of indefinite increase, can never pass into anything else and higher, and so is necessarily eternal."
3. "In every other Religion and Ethical system, the true foundation of such a character is wanting, and the true source of the power to realise and exemplify it is unknown."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The other gifts pass away, but these abide forever."
2. "Love is necessary for both faith and hope."
3. "Greatest, Dr. Jones holds, because love is an attribute of God."

### John Gill:
1. "These are the three chief and leading graces in God's people, and they abide and continue with them."
2. "Love will outlive death, and be in its height and glory in the other world."
3. "Love saints serve one another, both in things temporal and spiritual, and chiefly it is said to be the greatest, because most durable."

### John Wesley:
1. Faith, hope, love â€” Are the sum of perfection on earth; love alone is the sum of perfection in heaven.
