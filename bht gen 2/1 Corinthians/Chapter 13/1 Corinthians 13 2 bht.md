# 1 Corinthians 13:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The apostle Paul emphasizes that although one may possess insightful knowledge and prophetic abilities, even understanding the deepest spiritual mysteries, or having extensive knowledge of natural phenomena, all these would be in vain if devoid of love for God and others. Regardless of the ability to perform miraculous deeds, without love, one amounts to nothing. Love is the defining factor that brings true value to all other spiritual gifts and knowledge.
