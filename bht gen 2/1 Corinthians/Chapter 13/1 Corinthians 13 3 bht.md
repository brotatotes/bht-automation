# 1 Corinthians 13:3 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Even if I were to give away my possessions little by little to help the poor, and even if I were to offer my body to be burned for my faith, it would be meaningless without the genuine love that comes from God. These actions may benefit others and gain recognition, but without the love that God gives, they hold no true value in the context of salvation. True love, which is described in the following verses, is the essential and eternal requirement.
