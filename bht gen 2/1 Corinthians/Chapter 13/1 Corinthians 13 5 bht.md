# 1 Corinthians 13:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Love is a gracious virtue that guides one's behavior to act appropriately in different circumstances. It is considerate of others and does not seek to offend or be indecent in speech. Love also extends beyond self-interest, prioritizing the welfare of others and promoting the honor of Christ. It is zealous for righteousness and easily stirred to love and good works. Furthermore, love does not jump to negative assumptions about others; it does not willingly think ill of them or imagine evil without evidence. Overall, love manifests itself in actions that are fitting, unselfish, and free from judgment.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Love is so personified, as here to he identified with the man possessing the grace, who does not seek τὰ ἑαυ τοῦ."
2. "Love imputeth not (the) evil: οὐδὲν πονηρὸν οὐ μόνον οὐ κατασκενάζει ἀλλ' οὐδὲ ὑποπτεύει κατὰ τοῦ φιλουμένου."
3. "The article seems here to have the force of implying that the evil actually exists, 'the evil' which is, but Love does not impute it."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Love makes allowances for the falls of others, and is ready to put on them a charitable construction."
2. "Love, so far from devising evil against another, excuses 'the evil' which another inflicts on her."
3. "Love...doth not meditate upon evil inflicted by another, and in doubtful cases, takes the more charitable view."

### Albert Barnes:

2. "True religion, or love to others, will prompt us to seek their welfare with self-denial, and personal sacrifice and toil."
3. "Love, or a person under the influence of love, is not malicious, censorious, disposed to find fault, or to impute improper motives to others."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The verb occurs only here and Acts 17:16. The kindred noun paroxusmov, in Acts 14:39, describes the irritation which arose between Paul and Barnabas." 
2. "It is used of provoking God, Deuteronomy 9:8; Psalms 105:29; Isaiah 65:3."

2. "Seeketh not its own is unselfish, disinterested."
3. "Love puts the most favourable construction on another’s actions; while the absence of love is always indicated by the disposition, when any action is to be accounted for, of two motions always to fasten on the worst."

1. "Doth not behave itself unseemly...Not indecent." 
2. "Seeketh not its own...Its own interests." 
3. "Taketh not account of evil...the evil done to love with a view to settling the account."

### John Gill:
1. "A man unprincipled with this grace will be careful that no filthy and corrupt communication proceed out of his mouth, which may offend pious ears."
2. "One endued with this grace thinks nothing unseemly and unbecoming him, however mean it may appear, in which he can be serviceable to men, and promote the honour of religion and interest of Christ."
3. "Such an one is provoked at sin, at immorality and idolatry, as Paul's spirit was stirred up or provoked, when he saw the superstition of the city of Athens; and is easily provoked to love and good works, which are entirely agreeable to the nature of charity."

### John Wesley:
1. "It doth not behave indecently — Is not rude, or willingly offensive, to any. It renders to all their due - Suitable to time, person, and all other circumstances."
2. "Nay, sometimes the lover of mankind seeketh not, in some sense, even his own spiritual advantage; does not think of himself, so long as a zeal for the glory of God and the souls of men swallows him up."
3. "Love thinketh no evil - Indeed it cannot but see and hear evil things, and know that they are so; but it does not willingly think evil of any; neither infer evil where it does not appear. It tears up, root and branch, all imagining of what we have not proof."
