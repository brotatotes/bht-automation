# 1 Corinthians 13:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Love does not find pleasure in the wrongdoing of others, as some do, but instead grieves when even an enemy commits sin. It does not take delight in hearing or repeating these acts. Love desires that wrongdoing may be forgotten forever. Instead, love finds joy in the truth and the fruit it produces, which is holiness of heart and life.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "rejoices not at (the) iniquity, i.e. at its commission by others, as is the habit of the unloving world."
2. "rejoices with the Truth, ἡ ἀλήθ. being personified, and meaning especially the spread among men (as opposed to ἀδικία) of the Truth of the Gospel, and indeed of the truth in general, in opposition to those who (ref. Rom.) τὴν ἀλήθειαν ἐν ἀδικίᾳ κατέχουσι, who (ref. 2 Tim.) ἀνθίστανται τῇ ἀληθείᾳ."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Rejoiceth with the truth." Exults not at the perpetration of iniquity by others, but rejoices when the truth rejoices; sympathizes with it in its triumphs.
2. "The truth" and "unrighteousness" are contrasted.
3. The false charity which compromises "the truth" by glossing over "iniquity" or unrighteousness is thus tacitly condemned.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Love does not find pleasure in hearing others accused of sin, and in having it proved that they committed it."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Love's native element is goodness and truth: apart from the truth it knows neither father nor mother, husband nor wife, son nor daughter."
2. "Its antipathies are only with evil, its sympathies with truth and with those who believe and know the truth, who are ready to 'contend earnestly' for it, and if need be to suffer for it."
3. "The home of love is among the truthful, the believing, the holy; it breathes its own air in the 'kingdom of righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Ghost.'"
