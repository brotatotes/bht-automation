# 1 Corinthians 13:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Love, in its true form, has the power to cover and conceal the faults and imperfections of others. It refrains from spreading gossip or exposing the wrongdoing of others. Love is patient and forgiving, never quick to anger or seek revenge. It believes the best about people and gives them the benefit of the doubt. Love hopes for the fulfillment of God's promises and holds on to that hope even in the face of seemingly impossible circumstances. It endures through all trials and injustices, relying on the strength of Christ.
