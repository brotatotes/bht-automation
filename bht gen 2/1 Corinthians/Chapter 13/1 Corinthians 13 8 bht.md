# 1 Corinthians 13:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Love never fails. It is a grace that endures for eternity and accompanies us to heaven. While other spiritual gifts may cease or become obsolete, love remains steadfast. In the heavenly realm, where perfection abounds, there will be no need for prophecies or the gift of tongues. The imperfect languages of earth will give way to a universal language. Our pursuit of knowledge in this world will eventually fade away in the light of eternity, like starlight vanishes in the brilliance of the midday sun.

3. "A primary fulfilment of Paul's statement took place when the Church attained its maturity; then 'tongues' entirely 'ceased,' and 'prophesyings' and 'knowledge,' so far as they were supernatural gifts of the Spirit, were superseded as no longer required when the ordinary preaching of the word, and the Scriptures of the New Testament collected together, had become established institutions."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Charity never faileth - Paul here proceeds to illustrate the value of love, from its 'permanency' as compared with other valued endowments. It is valuable, and is to be sought because it will always abide; may be always exercised; is adapted to all circumstances, and to all worlds in which we may be placed, or in which we may dwell."
2. "The sense is, that while other endowments of the Holy Spirit must soon cease and be valueless, love would abide, and would always exist."
3. "The essential idea in this passage is, that all the knowledge which we now possess shall lose its effulgence, be dimmed and lost in the superior light of heaven. But love shall live there; and we should, therefore, seek that which is permanent and eternal."

### Marvin Vincent:

2. "All these special spiritual gifts will pass. It is amazing how little of human work lasts."

### John Gill:
1. "Charity never faileth....It may be greatly damped by the growth of error and heresy, which eat as do a canker; and may be much obstructed by an anxious and immoderate care and concern for worldly things...but this grace never fails as to its principle."
2. "But whether there be prophecies, they shall fail...or else the gifts of explaining the prophecies of the Old Testament, and of preaching the doctrines of the Gospel, will be no more, because there will be no need of them in a state of perfection."
