# 1 Corinthians 13:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In our current state of imperfection, our knowledge is limited and incomplete. Even the most knowledgeable among us have only partial understanding of the truth. The prophecies we deliver are fragmented and imperfect, not encompassing the entirety of God's wisdom and knowledge. It is important to recognize our limitations and strive for greater understanding, knowing that our knowledge will always fall short of the perfect knowledge found in heaven.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. 9, 10. in part—partially and
	imperfectly. Compare a similar contrast to the "perfect man,"
	"the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ" ( :-).

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Our knowledge here is imperfect and obscure...and we should not regard that as of such vast value which is imperfect and obscure..."
2. "This idea of the obscurity and imperfection of our knowledge, as compared with heaven, the apostle illustrates...by comparing it with the knowledge which a child has, compared with that in maturer years..."
3. "And we prophesy in part...the same imperfection which attends knowledge. It is only in part; it is imperfect; it is indistinct, compared with the full view of truth in heaven..."

### John Calvin:
1. "He now proves that prophecy, and other gifts of that nature, are done away, because they are conferred upon us to help our infirmity."
2. "It is owing to our imperfection that we at present have knowledge and prophecy. Hence the phrase 'in part' means — 'Because we are not yet perfect.'"
3. "Let us observe, however, what Paul designs to prove — that the gifts in question are but temporary."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "For we know in part, even in respect of the supernatural gift of knowledge."
2. "We prophesy in part, in necessarily broken, fragmentary utterances, giving at best but imperfect views of Divine truth."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1.  In part  (εκ μερους). See on 1 Corinthians 12:27. As opposed to the whole. 

### John Gill:
1. "the true meaning is, that though the rule of knowledge is perfect, and all the saints have knowledge, and every truth of the Gospel is known; yet by those that know most, it is known but imperfectly"
2. "the truth itself may be most clearly discerned, as it is revealed in the word; yet the manner of it, how it is, may not be known; and many difficulties may attend it, and objections be raised to it, which are not easily solved"
3. "their prophesying or explaining the prophecies of the Old Testament, or the mysteries of the Gospel, is but imperfect at best in the present state of things."

### John Wesley:
1. "The wisest of men have here but short, narrow, imperfect conceptions, even of the things round about them, and much more of the deep things of God."
2. "Even the prophecies which men deliver from God are far from taking in the whole of future events, or of that wisdom and knowledge of God which is treasured up in the scripture revelation."
