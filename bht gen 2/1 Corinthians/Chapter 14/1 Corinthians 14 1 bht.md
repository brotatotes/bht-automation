# 1 Corinthians 14:1 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Let love be your first and chief aim, constantly pursuing it and allowing it to guide your actions. While it is important to desire and earnestly seek after spiritual gifts, such as prophecy, let us remember that love surpasses them all. As we cultivate a spirit of love, we will regulate ourselves properly in the use of these gifts, ensuring that they serve to benefit and build up the church. Prophecy, in particular, is to be desired zealously, as it is the most valuable and useful gift for edifying the church and bringing conviction to sinners.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Follow after love, yet desire earnestly spiritual gifts: ‘If I exalt love above all mere gifts, this is not meant to disparage the gifts, nor to quench the desire to possess and exercise them; only in doing so, forget not that the best and most useful of them all is prophecy.’"
