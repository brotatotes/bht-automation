# 1 Corinthians 14:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
There are perhaps countless different languages in the world, each with its own significance and meaning. From the various voices spoken by different nations, each language carries a unique message that is intelligible to those who understand it. This understanding is crucial, as it is through language that ideas are conveyed and understood. Without the ability to speak and communicate articulately, messages would remain inarticulate and unclear.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "...the rendering 'for example,' though in meaning it nearly approaches it..."
2. "The use of φωνῶν, and not γλωσσῶν, is no doubt intentional, to avoid confusion..."
3. "But the common rendering is both simpler, and better sense: none of them is without signification, as E. V.: or, is inarticulate."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "It may chance" ( :-). 
2. "so much," used generally for a definite number left undefined ( :-; also 2 Samuel 12:8). 
3. None is without its own voice, or mode of speech, distinct from the rest.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "There are perhaps, or for example, very many kinds of voices in the world; and all are significant. None are used by those who speak them without meaning; none speak them without designing to convey some intelligible idea to their hearers."
2. "The 'argument' is, that as 'all' the languages that are in the world, however numerous they are, are for 'utility', and as none are used for the sake of mere display, so it should be with those who had the power of speaking them in the Christian church."
3. "They should speak them only when and where they would be understood."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Voices - without signification [φωνων - αφωνων] . The translation loses the word - play. So many kinds of voices, and no kind is voiceless. By voices are meant languages.

### John Calvin:
1. "He uses the term dumb here, to mean confused — as opposed to an articulate voice."
2. "The whole order of nature, therefore, as appointed by God, invites us to observe a distinction."
3. "Every language is intelligible to some nation or other; and it is only to persons who are ignorant of it, that its words are destitute of signification."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "There are so many kinds of voices (articulate languages) in the world, and no kind is without signification without definite meaning."
2. "[In the LXX. this word is so used; and in 2 Peter 2:16 the ass that reproved Balaam is called the voiceless ass, because its bray is no articulate language]."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Without signification (αφωνον). Old adjective (α privative and φωνη). Without the faculty of speech."
2. "It may be (ε τυχο). Condition of fourth class (ε and aorist optative of τυγχανω), if it should happen."
3. "Common enough idiom. Cf. τυχον in 1 Corinthians 16:6."

### John Gill:
1. "There are, it may be, so many kinds of voices,... as many as there are nations in the world."
2. "Every language, and every word in a language, has a meaning in it, an idea annexed to it, which it conveys to him that understands it."
3. "That cannot be done without a voice ordinarily speaking."
