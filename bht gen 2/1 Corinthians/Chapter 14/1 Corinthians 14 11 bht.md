# 1 Corinthians 14:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When we speak in a language that others do not understand, our words become meaningless to them. We become like foreigners, unable to communicate effectively. It is foolish and pointless to speak in a way that others cannot comprehend. Just as a foreign language is unintelligible to us, so too our unintelligible speech becomes like gibberish to those around us. Instead, let us strive to speak in a way that can be understood and bridges the gap of understanding between us.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The meaning of the voice - Of the language that is uttered, or the sounds that are made."
2. "I shall be unto him ... - What I say will be unintelligible to him, and what he says will be unintelligible to me. We cannot understand one another any more than people can who speak different languages."
3. "A barbarian - See the note at Romans 1:14. The word means one who speaks a different, or a foreign language."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Barbarian. Supposed to be originally a descriptive word of those who uttered harsh, rude accents - bar bar."
2. "Socrates, speaking of the way in which the Greeks divide up mankind, says: 'Here they cut off the Hellenes as one species, and all the other species of mankind, which are innumerable and have no connection or common language, they include under the single name of barbarians.'"
3. "Later, the word took the sense of outlandish or rude."

### John Calvin:
1. "The tongue ought to be an index of the mind...How foolish then it is and preposterous in a man, to utter in an assembly a voice of which the hearer understands nothing." 
2. "By these words he intimates, that to speak in an unknown tongue, is not to hold fellowship with the Church, but rather to keep aloof from it."
3. "He who will act this part, will be deservedly despised by others, because he first despises them."

### Philip Schaff:

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The meaning of the voice (την δυναμιν της φωνης). The power (force) of the voice."

### John Gill:
1. "Therefore if I know not the meaning of the voice,.... The force and power of a language, the signification of it, the ideas its words convey, but only hear the sound of it: I shall be to him that speaketh a barbarian, and he that speaketh shall be a barbarian unto me."
2. "The sense is, that where the signification of a language and the sense of words are not known, the speaker is like a man that lives in a strange country to him that hears him; and the hearer is like to one that lives in a strange country to him that speaks, since they cannot understand one another."
3. "The word sometimes is used for men, αφωνοι η ανκοοι, "that can neither speak nor hear", men dumb and deaf; and when words cannot be understood, the case is all one as with such persons."

### John Wesley:
1. I shall be a barbarian to him — Shall seem to talk unintelligible gibberish.
