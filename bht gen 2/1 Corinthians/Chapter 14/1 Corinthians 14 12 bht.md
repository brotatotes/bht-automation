# 1 Corinthians 14:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Since you desire spiritual gifts and are zealous for them, it is important to seek the edification of the church through the exercise of these gifts. The term spirits refers to the extraordinary gifts of the Holy Spirit, and as believers, it is right for us to desire and excel in these gifts. By prophesying, we are able to communicate truth clearly and effectively, bringing edification to the church and glorifying the Lord in the process.
