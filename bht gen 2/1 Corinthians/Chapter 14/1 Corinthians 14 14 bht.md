# 1 Corinthians 14:14 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When I pray in an unknown tongue, my spirit is filled with holy desires and fervent prayer, guided by the Holy Spirit. However, my understanding is unfruitful and does not contribute to the edification of others. My intellect, lacking a clear understanding of the words spoken, produces no beneficial outcome. While my prayers may be heartfelt and meaningful to me, they are useless if they are not intelligible and comprehensible to others. It is important that my prayers are not just a display of spiritual fervor, but also engage my mind and bring understanding to those who hear them.
