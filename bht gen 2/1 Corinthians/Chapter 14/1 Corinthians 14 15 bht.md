# 1 Corinthians 14:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As believers, we are encouraged to engage in prayer and worship with both our spirit and our understanding. Prayer is a meaningful exercise of the mind, and we should pray in a way that is intelligible to ourselves and others. Similarly, when we sing praises to God, we should do so in a way that reaches our intellect and stirs our emotions. It is important that our worship is understandable and beneficial to the congregation. Therefore, we should strive to pray and sing in a manner that unites the advantages of both spiritual engagement and understanding.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "What then is (the case) (i.e. as our 'What then?') I will pray with the spirit: I will pray also with my mind, (i.e. will interpret my prayer for the benefit of myself and the church)." 
2. "This resolution, or expression of self-obligation, evidently leads to the inference, by and by clearly expressed, that if he could not pray with the mind, he would keep silence." 
3. "ψαλῶ hence we gather that the two departments in which the gift of tongues was exercised were prayer and praise. On the day of Pentecost it was confined to the latter of these."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "I will not only pray with my spirit, which might leave the understanding unedified, BUT with the understanding also."
2. "I will keep silence altogether if I cannot pray with the understanding (so as to make myself understood by others)."
3. "A prescient warning, mutatis mutandis, against the Roman and Greek practice of keeping liturgies in dead languages, which long since have become unintelligible to the masses."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "I will endeavor to 'blend' all the advantages which can be derived from prayer; I will 'unite' all the benefits which 'can' result to myself and to others."
2. "I deem it of vast importance to pray with the spirit in such a way that the 'heart' and the 'affections' may be engaged, so that I may myself derive benefit from it; but I will also unite with that, utility to others."
3. "It is evident that the same thing might take place in singing which occurred in prayer. It might be in a foreign language, and might be unintelligible to others. Paul, therefore, says that he would so celebrate the praises of God as to excite the proper affections in his own mind, and so as to be intelligible and profitable to others."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The noun psalm, which is etymologically akin to this verb, is used in the New Testament of a religious song in general, having the character of an Old Testament psalm."

### John Calvin:
1. "He allows, therefore, and sanctions the use of a spiritual gift in prayer, but requires, what is the main thing, that the mind be not unemployed."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Prayer is an intelligent exercise of the mind."
2. "Paul prefers singing that reaches the intellect as well as stirs the emotions."
