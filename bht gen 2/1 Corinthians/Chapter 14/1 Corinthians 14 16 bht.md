# 1 Corinthians 14:16 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When the portion of the service dedicated to giving thanks to God is conducted in a manner that is not understandable, how can someone who is not learned in these matters respond with an affirming Amen if they do not understand what is being said? It is important for all members of the congregation, including private hearers, to be able to join in and confirm the words being spoken, as it was the customary practice for the entire assembly to participate in this way.

1. "If he that frames or utters forth prayers in the name of the people is not understood by the assembly, how will the common people add an expression of their desires in the close, so as to take part in them?
