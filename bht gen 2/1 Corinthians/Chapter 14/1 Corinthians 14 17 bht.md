# 1 Corinthians 14:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When offering thanksgiving in a foreign tongue, it is not the act itself that is criticized, for it is a good thing inspired by the Spirit. However, it becomes unedifying when done without considering the understanding of others. Even though your thanksgiving may be heartfelt and genuine, it loses its value if the people around you cannot comprehend it. Your words of gratitude may be eloquent, but they do not benefit those standing beside you, as they cannot grasp the meaning behind them.
