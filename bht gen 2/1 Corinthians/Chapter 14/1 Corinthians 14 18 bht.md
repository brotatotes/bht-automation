# 1 Corinthians 14:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
I thank God for the ability to speak in tongues more than all of you. While this is a remarkable ability, my focus in the church is not on showcasing my linguistic prowess. Instead, I prioritize understanding and edification. I value speaking just a few words in a language that can be understood by all over speaking many words in a tongue that only I understand. My goal is to instruct and uplift others. Rather than despising or envying the gift of tongues, I humbly acknowledge its origin in God and express gratitude for His bestowal.
