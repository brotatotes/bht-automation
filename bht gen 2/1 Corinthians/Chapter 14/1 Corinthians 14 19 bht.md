# 1 Corinthians 14:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the assembly, I would rather speak a very few words that are understandable and beneficial, than speak countless words yet unintelligible. The word church here does not refer to a physical building, but to the organized body of Christians gathered for worship. Paul, in his desire for edification, chose to speak in a way that could be understood, rather than displaying his ability to speak in diverse tongues. He valued the importance of clarity and utility in his words, seeking to build up and benefit others in the congregation.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "in (the) assembly, ‘in the congregation’ [this is the better rendering here, and wherever there is a chance of the word church being mistaken as meaning a building]"
2. "The art. is omitted after a preposition: so Middleton, ch. vi. § 1; the logical account of which is, that the prep. serves to categorize the substantive following it, and so make it general instead of particular."
3. "διὰ τοῦ νοός has probably been a correction, because λαλεῖν τῷ νοΐ was found harsh, the understanding being only the indirect instrument."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

### John Calvin:
1. "Now as Paul, who might otherwise have exulted loftily in his power of speaking with tongues, voluntarily abstains from it, and, without any show, aims at edification exclusively, he reproves, by this means, the empty ambition of those, that are eagerly desirous to show themselves off with empty tinkling."
2. "The authority of the Apostle ought, also, to have no little weight in drawing them off from vanity of this kind."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Private ecstasy is one thing (cf. 2 Corinthians 12:1-9) but not in church worship."
2. "For the rare verb κατηχεω see on Luke 1:4; Acts 18:25."

1. "Yet in the church I had rather speak five words... meaning a very few words, which he chose to speak in the church before the congregation, when and where saints were met together for public worship, for their edification and comfort, and the glory of God."
2. "For though at other times, and to other people, he might think fit to make use of his gift in speaking with divers tongues, yet at such a time and place he thought it much more eligible to say ever so few words with understanding: so as to be understood by others, as well as himself."
3. "Than to deliver ever so long an oration in a language not understood by them, which could be of no use unto them... five words understood were more likely to be of use than ten thousand spoken in a strange language."
