# 1 Corinthians 14:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The one who speaks in an unknown tongue is essentially speaking to God, as no one else can understand him. It is like speaking in a language that only God can grasp. The mysteries and hidden things that are spoken remain unintelligible to others, rendering the message ineffective for edification.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "For he that speaks in a tongue, speaks not to men but to God; for no one understands him...the assembly do not understand him...but in the spirit he speaks mysteries." 
2. "His spirit is the organ of the Holy Ghost, but his understanding is unfruitful."
3. "He speaks mysteries, things which are hidden from the hearers, and sometimes also from himself."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

2. "no man understandethâ€”generally speaking; the few who have the gift of interpreting tongues are the exception."
3. "mysteriesâ€”unintelligible to the hearers, exciting their wonder, rather than instructing them."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The faculty of speaking intelligibly, and to the edification of the church, is of more value than the power of speaking a foreign language."
2. "It is as if he spoke to God. No one could understand him but God."
3. "This would doubtless be the case, that those who were thus endowed would deliver most important truths, but they would be 'lost' upon those who heard them, because they could not understand them."

### John Calvin:
1. "He accordingly shows, from principles already assumed, how perverse a thing this is, inasmuch as it does not at all contribute to the edifying of the Church."
2. "He speaketh mysteries and hidden things, and things, therefore, that are of no profit."
3. "The term denotes a foreign language. The reason why he does not speak to men is â€” because no one heareth, that is, as an articulate voice. For all hear a sound, but they do not understand what is said."

1. "upon which account the apostle recommends prophesying, praying, and singing, in a language that was understood"
 
2. "he may hear a sound, but he cannot tell the meaning of it, and so it is of no use and advantage to him"
