# 1 Corinthians 14:20 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Believers, do not be like children in your understanding. It is folly to pursue what is regarded as a curse by God. Guard against childishness and let the word of God bear fruit in your lives. Be mature in your thinking, applying your manly sense to all matters. In matters of malice, be innocent like babes. But in your understanding, strive to be men, mature and discerning between good and evil. Let us not be lacking in spiritual knowledge, but rather be innocent, humble, and wise in the ways of the Lord.
