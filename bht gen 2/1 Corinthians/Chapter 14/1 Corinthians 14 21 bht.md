# 1 Corinthians 14:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the Old Testament, it is written that God used foreign languages as a form of punishment for the unbelief of His people. Just as He spoke to them in a language they did not understand through the Babylonians, so He will make use of foreign tongues to accomplish His purposes. This warning serves as a reminder that speaking in unknown tongues should not be desired, as it was a form of judgment and not a blessing. This prophecy from the Old Testament was also fulfilled on the day of Pentecost.
