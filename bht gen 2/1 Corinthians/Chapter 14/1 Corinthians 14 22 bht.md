# 1 Corinthians 14:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Tongues are intended as a sign to unbelievers, serving to engage their attention and convince them that the message being spoken is from God, while prophecy is primarily for the confirmation and edification of those who already believe. The diverse tongues spoken in a miraculous way were used to prepare the unbelievers to listen and believe, whereas prophecy serves to build up, exhort, and comfort believers.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "the tongues about which his argument was concerned."
2. "tongues are (a sign) for the unbelieving, not for the believing."
3. "Prophecy, i.e. inspired and intelligent exposition of the word and doctrine, was eminently for believers, but, as below, would be also profitable to unbelievers, furnishing a token that God was truly among his assembled servants."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Tongues (unknown and uninterpreted) are not a sign mainly intended for believers, but mainly to be a condemnation to those who reject the sign and the accompanying message."
2. "Since they will not understand, they shall not understand."
3. "Prophesying has no effect on unbelievers, but it makes believers of those not wilfully unbelievers and spiritually nourishes those that already believe."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Tongues are for a sign, an indication, an evidence, or a proof that God has imparted this power, and that he attends the preaching of the gospel with his approbation."
2. "It is a miracle designed to convince them of the truth of the Christian religion."
3. "Though it may be really under the influence of the Holy Spirit, and may be really by inspiration, yet it is not so evidently such as is the power of speaking foreign languages. It was, therefore, better adapted to edify the church than to convince gainsayers."

### John Calvin:
1. "You see, brethren, that what you so eagerly desire is not a blessing bestowed by God upon believers, but a punishment, by which he inflicts vengeance upon unbelievers."
2. "Tongues, in so far as they are given for a sign — that is, for a miracle — are appointed not properly for believers, but for unbelievers."
3. "The Corinthians brought forward that gift improperly and out of its right place, allowing prophecy in the meantime to be neglected, which was peculiarly and specially set apart for believers."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Tongues are for a sign, not to them that believe, but to the unbelieving who, on hearing their own language spoken by those who themselves understood it not, would be filled with awe." 
2. "Prophesying is for a sign, not to the unbelieving, but to them that believe."

### John Gill:
1. "Tongues are a sign...of wrath and punishment inflicted on a rebellious and unbelieving people." 
2. "Speaking with divers tongues was used in a miraculous way...to prepare [unbelievers] to listen and believe."
3. "Prophesying...serves for the edification, exhortation, and comfort of believers...much more eligible to be used in a church of Christ than speaking with tongues."
