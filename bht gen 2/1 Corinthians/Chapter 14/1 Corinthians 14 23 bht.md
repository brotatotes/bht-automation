# 1 Corinthians 14:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When the church gathers for worship, it is important for them to prioritize understanding and clarity. Speaking in tongues, while a valid gift, may confuse and alienate visitors who are unacquainted with the practice. As such, it is essential for the church to consider the impact their worship has on those who are unlearned or unbelieving. Otherwise, they may mistakenly perceive the church as a chaotic gathering of madmen. In order to avoid this confusion, proper order and intelligibility should be maintained, ensuring that all who attend can receive edification and understanding from the worship service.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The supposition is this: that all the (Corinthian) church is assembled, and all its members speak with tongues...then ἰδιῶται, 'plain believers,' persons unacquainted with the gift and its exercise, come in."
2. "It is obvious that the hypothesis of all being assembled and all having the gift must not be pressed to infer that no such ἰδιώτης could be found...the whole difficulty seems to me mere trifling."
3. "The ἰδ. plainly cannot be, as De W. maintains, an unbeliever, for his case is separately mentioned. Such plain men, or perhaps a company of unbelievers, have come in: they have no understanding of what is going on: the γλῶσσαι sound to them an unmeaning jargon; and they come to the conclusion, 'These men are mad;'"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The more there are assembled, and the more that speak in unknown tongues, the more will the impression be conveyed to strangers 'coming in' from curiosity ('unbelievers'), or even from a better motive ('unlearned'), that the whole body of worshippers is a mob of fanatical 'madmen'." 
2. "The Church is like the company of builders of Babel after the confusion of tongues, or like the cause tried between two deaf men before a deaf judge, celebrated in the Greek epigram." 
3. "Unlearned—having some degree of faith, but not gifts."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The idea is, that the church would usually speak the same language with the people among whom they dwelt; and if they made use of foreign languages which were unintelligible to their visitors, it would leave the impression that the church was a bedlam."
2. "Those that are unacquainted with foreign languages, and to whom, therefore, what was said would be unintelligible."
3. "They will not understand what is said; it will be a confused jargon; and they will infer that it is the effect of insanity."

### John Calvin:
1. "You do not, therefore, see what to the unlearned and unbelieving is perfectly manifest."
2. "They are for a sign to fill them with astonishment - not to instruct them or to reform them."
3. "Paul's meaning, therefore, is - that the Corinthians would be justly convicted of madness by the unbelieving and unlearned, however much they might please themselves."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "If therefore the whole church be assembled together, and all speak with tongues, and there come in men unlearned or unbelieving not members of the church, and not understanding the tongues, yet not hostile or captious, but such as those in Acts 2:13..." 
2. "...will they not say that ye are mad? to the scandal of the Christian name."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "These unbelievers unacquainted with Christianity will say that the Christians are raving mad."
2. "They will seem like a congregation of lunatics."

### John Gill:
1. "Hence may be observed the custom of the primitive churches to meet together, in some certain place, for divine worship; nor did the members of them in common forsake the assembling of themselves together on that account."
2. "And it may be seen from hence, that the church, and the place where it met, are two different things."
3. "Speaking in a strange language to a congregation that knows not one word of what is said, is speaking to the air, and to no profit at all to them that hear; and who but a madman would do this?"

### John Wesley:
1. "Sometimes prophecy is of more use, even to unbelievers, than speaking with tongues."
2. "Several bad men met together hinder each other by evil discourse. Single persons are more easily gained."
