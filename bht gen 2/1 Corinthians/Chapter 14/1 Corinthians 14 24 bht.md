# 1 Corinthians 14:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When believers prophesy and speak the truth of God in an understandable language, it has a powerful impact. It convicts and searches into the hearts of unbelievers and plain men, laying bare their hidden thoughts and character. Even today, powerful preaching can still reveal a person's true self. Such revelation often leads people to fall on their faces and worship God, acknowledging His presence among His people. The effect of prophesying is not only to convict and examine, but also to bring about genuine worship and recognition of God's truth.
