# 1 Corinthians 14:26 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
What a disorderly situation it was, brethren, when each person would begin to sing a psalm, or deliver a doctrine, or speak in an unknown tongue, or declare a revelation, or interpret what others were saying, creating chaos rather than edifying the church. How necessary it is for all things to be done in an orderly manner, with each gift being used for the purpose of edification, that is, building up and benefiting the hearers.
