# 1 Corinthians 14:27 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When it comes to speaking in tongues, the apostle Paul advises that no more than two or three individuals should do so in one gathering. He emphasizes the importance of promoting edification and ensuring that the gift serves its purpose of convincing unbelievers. In addition, Paul highlights the need for interpretation, suggesting that one person should interpret the tongues spoken, and not multiple individuals. By adhering to these guidelines, the Corinthians can avoid confusion and foster a more orderly and beneficial worship experience.
