# 1 Corinthians 14:28 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
If there is no interpreter present, the speaker in unknown tongues should remain silent in the church and instead speak privately to himself and to God. This private speaking allows for personal edification and communion with God, even if it does not benefit the congregation. Speaking privately in this way shows a contrast to public speaking in the Church, which is not allowed without interpretation.

3. "For instead of assisting, it would but dampen their devotion, and therefore it was very reasonable he should be silent there."
