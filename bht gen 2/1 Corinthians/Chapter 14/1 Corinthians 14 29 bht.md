# 1 Corinthians 14:29 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Let two or three prophets speak at one meeting, not burdening the people by restricting the number. As each prophet speaks, the others should carefully discern and judge the message, comparing it with the word of God. Believers should not believe every spirit, but test and examine the teachings, judging them based on the truth of Scripture and the leading of the Holy Spirit. Through this practice of discernment, we can ensure that the message aligns with God's Word and is truly from the Spirit.

3. "Such would exercise that gift, to determine whether the spirit was of God: see ch. 1 Corinthians 12:3; 1 John 4:1-3."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "two or three—at one meeting (he does not add 'at the most,' as in :-, lest he should seem to 'quench prophesyings,' the most edifying of gifts), and these 'one by one,' in turn (1 Corinthians 14:27, 'by course,' and 1 Corinthians 14:31)."
2. "Paul gives here similar rules to the prophets, as previously to those speaking in unknown tongues."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "And let the other judge." - The more probable sense...supposes that they were to compare one doctrine with another, and deliberate on what was spoken, and determine whether it had evidence of being in accordance with the truth.
2. "It may be that the apostle here refers to those who had the gift of discerning spirits...to determine by what spirit the prophets who spoke were actuated."

### John Calvin:
1. "This is true, for we know it by every day’s experience."
2. "He does not, however, restrict the number so definitely, as when he was treating of tongues, for there is less danger, in the event of their applying themselves for a longer time to prophesyings, nay more, continued application would be the most desirable thing of all."
3. "For it is of no small advantage, that there should be some that are skillful in judging, who will not allow sound doctrine to be perverted by the impostures of Satan, or to be otherwise corrupted by silly trifles."
