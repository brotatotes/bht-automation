# 1 Corinthians 14:30 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When a revelation is made to another person who is sitting and listening, and they have a clearer understanding or knowledge of what is being spoken about, it is appropriate for the first person to remain silent and let the second person share their revelation. This was the practice in the early churches, where the congregation would sit and the prophet or preacher would stand or sit as they saw fit. Sometimes these revelations were given in a sudden and extraordinary manner, for the benefit of the entire community.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "But if a revelation shall have been made to another (prophet) while sitting by, let the first (who was prophesying) hold his peace."
2. "The rendering of Grot., al., 'let him (the second) wait till the first has done speaking', q. d., 'let the first have left off,' is ungrammatical."
3. "See also 1 Corinthians 14:28; 1 Corinthians 14:34."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "But if any thing."
2. "Let him who heretofore spoke, and who came to the assembly furnished with a previous ordinary (in those times) revelation from God, give place to him who at the assembly is moved to prophesy by a sudden revelation from the Spirit."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "If anything be revealed to another - If, while one is speaking, an important truth is revealed to another, or is suggested to his mind by the Holy Spirit..."
2. "Let the first hold his peace - That is, let him that was speaking conclude his discourse, and let there not be the confusion arising from two persons speaking at the same time."
3. "But the obvious meaning of the passage is, that the man that was speaking was to close his discourse and be silent. It does not follow, however, that he was to be rudely interrupted. He might close his discourse deliberately, or perhaps by an intimation from the person to whom the revelation was made."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. That sitteth. Rev., sitting by. The speaker standing.

### John Calvin:
1. "They have no longer any occasion to complain, that the Spirit is bound, or that his mouth is shut. For all have opportunity and liberty allowed them of speaking when there is occasion for it."
2. "This only is the true liberty of the Spirit — not that every one be allowed to blab out rashly whatever he pleases, but that all, from the highest to the lowest, voluntarily allow themselves to be under control, and that the one Spirit be listened to, by whatever mouth he speaks."
3. "If something be revealed to some minister, who hath a seat among those that teach, etc., not revealed in that very instant: but if he saith that he hath received some revelation from God, then let the first be silent and give way to him."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "But if a revelation is made to another sitting by in the attitude of a hearer, while another prophet is speaking." 
2. "Let the first keep silence probably on some hint to that effect being given to the speaker."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1.  Let the first keep silence  (ο πρωτος σιγατω). To give the next one a chance. 

### John Gill:
1. "If he has a clearer revelation made to him of what the other is speaking of, and has a more distinct knowledge of it, and is capable of removing any difficulty that attends it, and of expressing it more plainly, and of proving it more largely, and of setting it in an easier light to the understandings of men: let the first hold his peace."
2. "Hence it may be observed, that the custom of the primitive churches was to hear the word sitting, and the prophet or preacher stood, or sat, as he thought fit."
3. "Sometimes a revelation was made, and light conveyed to these prophets in a very sudden and extraordinary manner, when it was proper that it should be at once communicated for the good of the whole society."
