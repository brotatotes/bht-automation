# 1 Corinthians 14:31 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Every member of the church who possesses the gift of prophecy should be given the chance to speak one by one. This practice ensures that everyone has an opportunity to express their thoughts and teachings in an orderly manner. By doing so, the church can create an environment that promotes learning and edification for all its members. It is important to remember that even those with great knowledge and understanding can benefit from hearing others' perspectives and teachings.
