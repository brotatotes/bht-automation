# 1 Corinthians 14:32 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The spirits of the prophets, filled with the Holy Spirit, are subject to their own control and judgment. The divine authority of the prophetic word does not depend on visions, but on whether the message is from the Spirit of God. The prophets have the responsibility to scrutinize and examine each other's doctrine, ensuring that it aligns with the truth. The spiritual gifts of the prophets do not extinguish their conscious powers of free agency, but allow them to use their judgment in speaking and exercising their gifts.
