# 1 Corinthians 14:33 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
God desires peace and order in His assemblies. Disorder and confusion do not come from Him. When it comes to worship, it is important to conduct ourselves in a peaceful and orderly manner. We should avoid contentions and strive for harmony. Women are also encouraged to maintain silence in the churches. This promotes reverence and decorum in the presence of God. Let us remember that God is not a God of disorder, but of peace. We need to strive for this in our worship and interactions with one another.

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Confusion [ακαταστασιας] . See on commotions, Luke 21:9; and unruly, James 3:8. Compare 2 Corinthians 6:5."
2. "As in all the churches of the saints."
3. "The old arrangement is retained by Rev. and by Westcott and Hort, though the latter regard the words and the spirits - of peace as parenthetical."

### John Calvin:

2. "Let us, therefore, bear in mind, that, in judging as to the servants of Christ, this mark must be kept in view — whether or not they aim at peace and concord, and, by conducting themselves peaceably, avoid contentions to the utmost of their power."
3. "We must, indeed, in the first place, make it our aim, that the truth of God may, without contention, maintain its ground; but if the wicked resist, we must set our face against them, and have no fear, lest the blame of the disturbances should be laid to our charge."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "For God is not a God of confusion, but of peace such as His organs therefore ought to be." 
2. "As in all the churches of the saints and so surely in yours."
3. "The last clause of this verse is made the first of the following sentence by a number of critics (De Wette. Billroth. Meyer, and formerly Stanley) reading thus: 'As in all the churches of the saints let the women keep silence,' etc., and so Lachmann and Tischendorf print it in their texts: but not Tregelles. Their grounds appear to us weak, and the proposed connection seems far from natural."
