# 1 Corinthians 14:34 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the church setting, it is generally expected for women to remain silent and not speak publicly. However, if they feel a strong prompting from the Holy Spirit, an exception can be made. This rule specifically applies to teaching in public assemblies, as women are still called to be in subjection to the men who have the responsibility of leading and instructing the congregation. The restriction on women speaking in the church is rooted in the idea that it goes against the power dynamics outlined in God's law, emphasizing the need for women to exercise subjection.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The same construction where a second verb must be supplied from the context, occurs 1 Timothy 4:3." 
2. "Their speaking in public would be of itself an act of independence; of teaching the assembly, and among others their own husbands."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "For women to speak in public would be an act of independence, as if they were not subject to their husbands."
2. "For 'under obedience,' translate, 'in subjection' or 'submission,' as the Greek is translated."
3. "The term 'the law' is applied to the whole Old Testament."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The sense evidently is, that in all those things which he had specified, the women were to keep silence; they were to take no part."
 
2. "It is probable that, on pretence of being inspired, the women had assumed the office of public teachers."
 
3. "No rule in the New Testament is more positive than this; and however plausible may be the reasons which may be urged for disregarding it, and for suffering women to take part in conducting public worship, yet the authority of the apostle Paul is positive, and his meaning cannot be mistaken."

### John Calvin:
1. "This, however, we must understand as referring to ordinary service, or where there is a Church in a regularly constituted state; for a necessity may occur of such a nature as to require that a woman should speak in public; but Paul has merely in view what is becoming in a duly regulated assembly."
2. "For what is there to hinder their being in subjection, and yet at the same time teaching? I answer, that the office of teaching is a superiority in the Church, and is, consequently, inconsistent with subjection."
3. "Paul’s reasoning, however, is simple — that authority to teach is not suitable to the station that a woman occupies, because, if she teaches, she presides over all the men, while it becomes her to be under subjection."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Let the women keep silence in the churches: for it is not permitted unto them to speak." 
2. "But let them be in subjection, as also saith the law referring probably to Genesis 3:16, of which idea all subsequent passages of the same import are but repetitions and expansions."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "For some reason some of the women were creating disturbance in the public worship... There is no doubt at all as to Paul's meaning here."
2. "In church the women are not allowed to speak nor even to ask questions. They are to do that at home."
3. "Certainly women are still in subjection to their husbands... but somehow modern Christians have concluded that Paul's commands on this subject... were meant for specific conditions that do not apply wholly now."

### John Gill:
1. "This is a restriction of, and an exception to one of the above rules, that all might prophesy; in which he would be understood of men only, and not of women."
2. "It was not allowed by God that they should speak in any authoritative manner in the church; nor was it suffered in the churches of Christ; nor was it admitted of in the Jewish synagogue."
3. "By this the apostle would signify, that the reason why women are not to speak in the church, or to preach and teach publicly, or be concerned in the ministerial function, is, because this is an act of power, and authority; of rule and government, and so contrary to that subjection which God in his law requires of women unto men."

### John Wesley:
1. "Let your women be silent in the churches — Unless they are under an extraordinary impulse of the Spirit."
2. "For, in other cases, it is not permitted them to speak - By way of teaching in public assemblies."
3. "But to be in subjection — To the man whose proper office it is to lead and to instruct the congregation."
