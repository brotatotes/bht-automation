# 1 Corinthians 14:35 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In order to maintain order and prevent disruption during public worship, it is advised that women should refrain from speaking when seeking to learn something. Instead, they are encouraged to ask their husbands for guidance in a private setting. This distinction between public and private inquiry helps preserve the dignity and modesty expected of women. By adhering to this teaching, women can avoid bringing shame not only upon themselves but also upon the church community. This firm instruction should be followed wholeheartedly, as it provides clear guidance on maintaining propriety and order in worship settings.

2. "shame‚Äîindecorous."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Their inquiries will not be attended with the irregularity and disorder which would occur should they interrupt the order and solemnity of public worship."
2. "It does not become their rank in life; it is not fulfilling the object which God evidently intended them to fill."
3. "Neither of these come under the apostle's idea of a church. And in such meetings, no rule of propriety or of the Scriptures is violated in their speaking for the edification of each other, or in leading in social prayer."

### John Calvin:
1. "That he may not seem, by this means, to shut out women from opportunities of learning."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "On the subject of women officiating in the public assemblies, there is an apparent discrepancy between chap. 11 and chap. 14. In the one chapter they are supposed to 'pray' and 'prophesy' in the public assemblies, without a word of disapproval, nay, with directions how to do it: here, the thing is expressly forbidden." 
2. "What forced on the question whether such a gift should be exercised in the public assemblies, was a certain unseemliness about it, as practised at Corinth, which so impressed some in that Church as to occasion one of their questions for the apostle to answer."
3. "The decision here given is so explicit and so peremptory, that the only wonder is how any candid reader should question it."

### John Gill:
1 . "If they are desirous of learning anything in relation to doctrine, duty, or discipline, and of improving their knowledge of divine things, which is very commendable in them."
2 . "It is a shame to themselves, as being contrary to the natural modesty and bashfulness of the sex, and a shame to the church, to the non-members of it, and especially to the elders, and more experienced part of it, to be taught and directed by a woman."
3 . "It is a disgrace to herself and sex, as betraying uncommon pride and vanity, and an unnatural boldness and confidence; and a disgrace to the church to be under such a ministry and conduct."

### John Wesley:
1. "And even if they desire to learn anything - Still they are not to speak in public..." 
2. "but to ask their own husbands at home - That is the place, and those the persons to inquire of."
