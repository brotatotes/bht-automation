# 1 Corinthians 14:36 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The Corinthians should not think that they are the sole possessors of the word of God, as it came out of Zion and spread to other churches as well. They should consider the practices of the churches in Judea, the first Gospel churches, and conform to them regarding certain customs. It is important for them to recognize that other churches have also received the word of God and have not introduced the same customs. Therefore, they should humbly follow the judgment and practices of others, as they are all part of the larger body of Christ.
