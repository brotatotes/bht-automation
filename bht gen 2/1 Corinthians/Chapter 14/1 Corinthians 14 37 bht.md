# 1 Corinthians 14:37 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
If anyone considers himself to be a prophet or spiritually gifted, let him demonstrate it by recognizing that the instructions I am writing are the commandment of the Lord. Let him acknowledge that these regulations are in line with the teachings of Christ and should be esteemed as such. For whatever was commanded by the apostles under divine inspiration is no different than a direct command from Christ himself.

3. "He that is ignorant, let him be ignorant. This, it is true, was allowable for Paul, who was fully assured as to the revelation that he had received from God, and he ought also to have been well known to the Corinthians, so that they should have looked upon him in no other light, than as an Apostle of the Lord."
