# 1 Corinthians 14:4 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
He who speaks in an unknown tongue may find personal spiritual edification, as his heart is warmed and his devotion is deepened. However, when it comes to the edification of the church as a whole, it is the one who prophesies that truly builds up the body of believers. Therefore, it is important to prioritize that which benefits the entire congregation over individual gratification.
