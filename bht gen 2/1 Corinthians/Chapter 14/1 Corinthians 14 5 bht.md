# 1 Corinthians 14:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Though Paul desired for all to possess the gift of tongues, he emphasized that prophesying had greater value. While speaking in tongues required interpretation, prophecy directly benefited all. Paul's message emphasized that usefulness and edification were more significant than impressive talents or abilities. The priority was to prioritize the building up of the church rather than pursuing self-centered gifts. The key was to use gifts in a way that brought about genuine growth and understanding.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "He shews that it is from no antipathy to or jealousy of the gift of tongues that he thus speaks: but (force of the Œ¥Œ≠) that he wished them all to speak with tongues, but rather that they should prophesy." 
2. "The distinction between the acc. and inf. after Œ∏Œ≠Œªœâ, as the simple direct object of the wish, and ·ºµŒΩŒ± with the subj., as its higher and ulterior object, has been lost in the E. V."
3. "ŒºŒµŒØŒ∂œâŒΩ Œ¥Œ≠ is transitional. ŒºŒµŒØŒ∂œâŒΩ: see reff., superior in usefulness, and therefore in dignity."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Now I wish you all to speak with tongues (so far am I from thus speaking...) but rather IN ORDER THAT you should prophesy."
2. "Tongues must therefore mean languages, not ecstatic, unintelligible rhapsodie (as NEANDER fancied)."
3. "Except he interpret‚Äîthe unknown tongue which he speaks, 'that the Church may receive edifying (building up).'"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It is an important endowment, and is not, in its place, to be undervalued."
2. "The power of speaking in an unknown tongue was certainly a more striking endowment than that of speaking so as simply to be 'useful,' and yet the apostle tells us that the latter is the more valuable."
3. "A man who is useful, however humble and unknown he may be, really occupies a more elevated and venerable rank than the man of most splendid talents and dazzling eloquence, who accomplishes nothing in saving the souls of people."

### John Calvin:
1. "So far is he from wishing them abolished or thrown away."
2. "At the same time, the cases are very different. For Paul takes in languages of any sort ‚Äî such as served merely for the publication of the gospel among all nations."
3. "But it often happens that the use of a foreign tongue is seasonable. In short, let us simply have an eye to this as our end ‚Äî that edification may redound to the Church."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Now I would have you all speak with tongues, but rather that ye should prophesy ‚Äòbecause tongues require an interpreter, else they are a heap of unmeaning sounds, whereas by prophecy all may at once benefit.‚Äô" 
2. "Could anything make it clearer that 'speaking with tongues' meant speaking in articulate and actually spoken languages, unknown to the speaker save through an interpreter himself or another?"
3. "All other explanations are forced and inconsistent with the plain facts of the case, while some of them carry absurdity on their face."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Except he interpret (ŒµŒ∫œÑŒøœÇ Œµ ŒºŒ∑ Œ¥ŒπŒµœÅŒºŒ∑ŒΩŒµœÖŒ∑). Pleonastic combination of ŒµŒ∫œÑŒøœÇ (preposition except) and Œµ ŒºŒ∑ (if not, unless) as in 1 Corinthians 15:2; 1 Timothy 5:19."
2. "For use of Œµ with subjunctive rather than ŒµŒ±ŒΩ see Philippians 3:12 (common enough in the Koine, Robertson, Grammar, pp. 1017f., condition of third class)."
3. "On the verb see on 1 Corinthians 12:30; Luke 24:27; Acts 9:36.Receieve (ŒªŒ±Œ≤Œ∑). Second aorist (ingressive) active subjunctive of ŒªŒ±ŒºŒ≤Œ±ŒΩœâ, may get edification."

### John Gill:
1. "He was not against their speaking with tongues, but this was the most eligible, for which he gives this reason: for greater is he that prophesieth, than he that speaketh with tongues; that is, he is more useful and profitable to men, and so consequently more honourable, in higher esteem, and more valued, and in greater dignity, being in a more serviceable post and office, and which is more beneficial and advantageous to mankind."
2. "Except he interpret; what he said; and then he might stand upon an equal foot, and be equally useful with him that prophesieth; but this everyone could not do that spake with tongues."
3. "That the church may receive edifying: which otherwise cannot be thought it should, or be expected, and then an opportunity and ordinance would be wholly lost."

### John Wesley:
1. Greater ‚Äî That is, more useful. By this alone are we to estimate all our gifts and talents.
