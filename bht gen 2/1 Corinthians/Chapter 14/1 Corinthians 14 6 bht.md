# 1 Corinthians 14:6 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
What benefit would it bring you if I were to come speaking in tongues that you do not understand? It is only through the interpretation of these tongues, through the revelation of gospel mysteries, through the imparting of knowledge of ancient types and prophecies, and through the teaching of doctrine that your minds can truly be enlightened and your lives transformed.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "That there is no edification without interpretation."
2. "The second ἐάν is parallel to the first, not dependent on ὠφελήσω."
3. "Est enim hæc verborum complexio ex eo genere, cujus jam apud Homerum exempla inveniuntur, quod duplicem habet apodosin, alteram præmissam, sequentem alteram: quæ ratio ibi maxime apta est, ubi in magno animi motu, quasi non satis sit id quod præmissum est, aliud infertur secunda apodosi, quod gravius sit et fortius."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "But now"; seeing there is no edification without interpretation.
2. "Revelation . . . prophesying—corresponding one to the other; 'revelation' being the supernatural unveiling of divine truths to man, 'prophesying' the enunciation to men of such revelations."
3. "So 'knowledge' corresponds to 'doctrine,' which is the gift of teaching to others our knowledge."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "If he should come among them speaking foreign languages, it could be of no use unless it were interpreted to them."
2. "Paul had the power of speaking foreign languages ... but he did not use this power for ostentation or display, but merely to communicate the gospel to those who did not understand his native tongue."
3. "The sense of this passage, therefore, is clear. Though Paul should utter among them, as he had abundant ability to do, the most weighty and important truths, yet, unless he interpreted what he said in a manner clear from obscurity, like 'revelation;' or intelligibly, and so as to constitute 'knowledge;' or in the manner that the prophets spoke, in a plain and intelligible manner; or in the manner usual in simple and plain 'instruction,' it would be useless to them."

### John Calvin:
1. "He proposes himself as an example...to show them how much better it were to apply their minds to prophesyings."
2. "He mentions...revelation, knowledge, prophesying, and doctrine...revelation and prophesying I put in one class...I am of the same opinion as to knowledge and doctrine...Doctrine is the way of communicating knowledge."
3. "Thus a Prophet will be — one who interprets and administers revelation...which is obtained only by revelation, and the special inspiration of God."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "What shall I profit you, unless I speak to you either by way of revelation, or of knowledge, or of prophesying, or of teaching?" 
2. "Four things nominally, but in reality only two distinct ways of edifying by the exercise of spiritual gifts: the first pair ('revelation' and 'knowledge'), those by which the speaker received supernaturally what he had to impart to others; the second pair ('prophesying' and 'teaching'), those by which he gave it forth to his audience."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "If I come (εαν ελθω)."
2. "What shall I profit you (τ υμας ωφελησω)."
3. "Two accusatives with this verb (see 1 Corinthians 13:3)."
4. "Unless I speak (εαν μη λαλησω)."
5. "Second condition (also third class) with the one conclusion (cf. 1 Timothy 2:5)."

### John Gill:
1. "What use would my ministry be to you? what instruction, comfort, and edification, could you receive by it?" 
2. "By the use and exercise of these gifts, he might be profitable to them, to lead them into a clearer view of the doctrines of the Gospel, and for the further improvement of their knowledge in the Scriptures of truth." 
3. "This could never be done by bare speaking with tongues, and with tongues they understood not."

### John Wesley:
1. "Revelation — Of some gospel mystery."
2. "Knowledge — Explaining the ancient types and prophecies."
3. "Doctrine — To regulate your tempers and lives."
