# 1 Corinthians 14:7 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Even though things without life, like a pipe or harp, can produce sound, it is only when there is a distinction in the tones, when specific musical notes are played, that the music becomes meaningful. Without this differentiation, the sounds produced would be nothing more than a jumble of noise. In the same way, speaking in an unknown tongue would be meaningless and ineffective without someone who understands it. Just as we need the proper modulation and understanding to appreciate music, we also need clarity and comprehension in communication to make any message meaningful.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "[ὅμως] occurs here and in the two other places where it is used in the N. T. (reff.) at the beginning of the sentence, out of its logical order, which would be before ἐὰν διαστολὴν …, thus: Things without life which yield sound, whether flute or harp, yet, if they do not , &c."
2. "The renderings, 'even things without life' (E. V.), or 'things which, though without life, yet give sound' (Winer, edn. 6, § 61. 5. f.), are inadmissible..."
3. "[ἐὰν διαστ.] If they (the ἄψυχα φ. δ.) shall not have yielded a distinction (of musical intervals) in their tones, how shall be known that which is being played on the flute or that which is being played on the harp?"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "And things without life-giving sound, whether pipe or harp, YET (notwithstanding their giving sound) if they give not a distinction in the tones (that is, notes) how?" &c.
2. "What is piped or harped—that is, what tune is played on the pipe or harp."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Unless they give a difference in the 'tones,' such as are indicated in the gamut for music."
2. "How shall it be known ... That is, there would be no time, no music. Nothing would be indicated by it. It would not be suited to excite the emotions of sorrow or joy."
3. "Unless there was something that was suited to excite thought or emotion; unless what was spoken was made 'intelligible,' no matter how important in itself it might be, yet it would be useless."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Voice [φωνην] . See on sound, Romans 10:18. The sound generally."
2. "Harp [κιθαρα] . See on Revelation 5:8."
3. "Distinction [διαστολην] . Proper modulation. Compare the use of the word in Romans 3:22; Romans 10:12."

### John Calvin:
1. "A man cannot give life to a harp or flute, but he makes it give forth a sound that is regulated in such a manner, that it can be distinguished. How absurd then it is, that even men, endowed with intelligence, should utter a confused, indistinguishable sound!" 
2. "We all know by experience what power music has in exciting men’s feelings, so that Plato affirms, and not without good reason, that music has very much effect in influencing, in one way or another, the manners of a state."
3. "To speak into the air is to beat the air to no purpose. 'Thy voice will not reach either God or man, but will vanish into air.'"

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Even things without life giving sound, whether pipe or harp the only kind of musical instruments known to the Greeks."
2. "If they give not a distinction in the sounds or 'notes,' such as to denote some musical ideas, how shall it be known what is piped or harped? what are the ideas intended."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Things without life (αψυχα). Without a soul (α privative, ψυχη) or life."
2. "Pipe (αυλος). Old word (from αω, αυω, to blow), only here in N.T."
3. "Harp (κιθαρα). Old word. Stringed instrument as pipe, a wind instrument."

### John Gill:
1. "except they give a distinction in the sounds; or 'tunes', so as one may be discerned from another; as that this is such a musical note, and that is another"
2. "such an use of instruments would be a mere jargon, and not music, and so yield no pleasure to the ear, or mind"
3. "and just the like must speaking in an unknown tongue be, to one that understands it not"

### John Wesley:
1. How shall it be known what is piped or harped — What music can be made, or what end answered?
