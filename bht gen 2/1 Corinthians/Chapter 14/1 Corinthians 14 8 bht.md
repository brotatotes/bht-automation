# 1 Corinthians 14:8 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The sound of the trumpet serves as the alarm of war, gathering and directing the soldiers in battle. Similarly, the Gospel is the instrument that gathers and directs believers in their spiritual journey and prepares them for the battle against their spiritual enemies. However, if the trumpet gives an uncertain sound, if grace and works are blended together, or if faith or works replace the righteousness of Christ, then it becomes impossible to properly prepare for the battle. Understanding the clear and distinct sound of the trumpet is essential in order to be equipped for the fight.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Since in all ages the advance and retreat of armies have been directed by sound of trumpet, it is indispensable that the notes expressing each should be sufficiently distinct, the one from the other, and easily understood."
