# 1 Corinthians 14:9 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When sharing the Gospel, it is crucial to speak in a language that is clear and easily understood. If we speak in a foreign language, it will be in vain and of no use unless it is interpreted. It is like speaking into the air, with no one comprehending our words. Our goal should always be to communicate in a way that is intelligible, so that the message of the Gospel can have a meaningful impact on the hearers, leading to their understanding and transformation.
