# 1 Corinthians 15:10 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
By acknowledging that his identity and accomplishments were solely due to the grace of God, the apostle Paul humbly recognized that he owed everything to God's unmerited favor. The grace bestowed upon him was not in vain, but rather equipped him with divine gifts for the proclamation of the Gospel. Paul's diligent labor and surpassing effort were driven by the deep awareness of God's extraordinary love for him. Ultimately, he understood that it was not his own abilities, but the continual presence of God's grace that empowered and guided him in his apostolic ministry.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "With the humiliating conviction of his own unworthiness is united the consciousness of that higher Power which worked on and in him, and this introduces his chastened self-consciousness of the extent and success of his apostolic labours."
2. "The Grace of God worked with him in so overwhelming a measure, compared to his own working, that it was no longer the work of himself but of divine Grace."
3. "The right view of this preponderance of Grace prevents the misunderstanding of the words which has led to the insertion of the article, ἡ σὺν ἐμοί, whereby Grace becomes absolutely the sole agent, which is contrary to fact."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The repetition implies the prominence which God's grace had in his mind, as the sole cause of his marvellous conversion and subsequent labors."
2. "His grace which was (showed) towards me."
3. "'not I, but grace,' implies, that though the human will concurred with God when brought by His Spirit into conformity with His will, yet 'grace' so preponderated in the work, that his own co-operation is regarded as nothing, and grace as virtually the sole agent."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "What I have is to be traced to him, and not to any native tendency to goodness, or any native inclination to his service, or to any merit of my own."
2. "The reason why Paul here introduces the subject seems to be this. He had incidentally, and undesignedly, introduced a comparison in one respect between himself and the other apostles."
3. "If a man has been successful as a preacher; if he has been self-denying, laborious, and the instrument of good, he cannot be insensible to the fact, and it would be foolish affectation to pretend ignorance of it."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Was not [ου εγενηθη] . Rev., better, was not found : did not turn out to be.

### John Calvin:
1. "He does not here claim anything as his own, as if he had himself, independently of God, done anything praiseworthy."
2. "I maintain...that there is no reason on that account, why we should divide between him and God the praise, that ought to be ascribed wholly to God."
3. "Let us learn, therefore, that we have nothing that is good, but what the Lord has graciously given us, that we do nothing good but what he worketh in us."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "But by the grace of God I am what I am: and his grace which was bestowed upon me was not in vain." 
2. "I laboured more abundantly than they all, yet not I."
- Commentary on 1 Corinthians 15:10.

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "What I am (ο ειμ). Not, who (ος), but what (ο), neuter singular. His actual character and attainments."
2. "All 'by the grace of God' (χαριτ θεου)."
3. "I laboured more abundantly than they all (περισσοτερον αυτων παντων εκοπιασα). This is sober fact as shown by the Acts and Paul's Epistles."

### John Gill:
1. "But by the grace of God I am what I am" - As he was what he was by the grace of God, in a private capacity, upon a level with other Christians, on account of faith and any holiness of his own, but by grace.
2. "His grace... was not in vain" - For what qualifies men for the preaching of the Gospel is not human learning, nor natural parts, but peculiar gifts, freely bestowed by God, and are not in vain, but to the good of souls and the glory of God.
3. "Yet not I, but the grace of God" - He attributes all to the grace of God and nothing to himself. It was the grace of God that made him an apostle, qualified him for it, enabled him to labor and suffer, and gave success to all his ministrations.

### John Wesley:
1. "I laboured more than they all — That is, more than any of them, from a deep sense of the peculiar love God had shown me."
2. "Yet, to speak more properly, it is not I, but the grace of God that is with me - This it is which at first qualified me for the work, and still excites me to zeal and diligence in it."
