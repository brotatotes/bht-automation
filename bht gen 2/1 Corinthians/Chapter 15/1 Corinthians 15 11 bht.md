# 1 Corinthians 15:11 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The essence of our preaching, whether it comes from me or from my fellow apostles, remains the same. The establishment of the truth is of utmost importance, regardless of who proclaims it. We all defend the same great doctrines, emphasizing that Christ died, was buried, and rose again. These fundamental truths are at the core of our preaching, and they have been believed by all Christians, forming the basis of our faith. The focus should be on the substance of our message, rather than the individuals delivering it.
