# 1 Corinthians 15:12 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
How can some assert such a thing? How can they deny the reality of the resurrection while Christ is being preached as risen from the dead? Such a denial challenges the very foundation of our faith. These skeptics may have been influenced by the philosophical beliefs they held before coming to know Christ. They fail to recognize that the resurrection of Christ is not a mere hypothetical concept but a proven and significant truth.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "But if CHRIST is preached [not subjunctive, be preached: he is arguing from a matter of fact, not from a mere hypothesis] that He is risen from the dead (if an instance of such resurrection is a fact announced in our preaching), how say some among you (how comes it to pass that some say) that a resurrection of the dead does not exist?"
2. "It is an interesting question, WHO these τινες were; and one which can only be answered by the indications which the argument in this chapter furnishes."
3. "The opposition between Sadduceism and Christianity was so complete, that we have little reason to think that any leaven of the Sadducees ever found its way into the church."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "...some of you deny that which is a necessary consequence of Christ's resurrection, namely, the general resurrection..."
2. "...Gentile reasoners who would not believe it because they did not see 'how' it could be..."
3. "...Christ is announced by us eye-witnesses as having risen from the dead..."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The whole argument is based on the fact that the Lord Jesus had risen. If that was admitted, he shows that it must follow that his people would also rise."
2. "If this was the doctrine on which the church was based, that the Lord Jesus rose from the dead, how could the resurrection of the dead be denied?"
3. "The doctrine of the resurrection, therefore, does not rest on a metaphysical subtilty; it does not depend on human reasoning; it does not depend on analogy; it rests just as the sciences of astronomy, chemistry, anatomy, botany, and natural philosophy do, 'on well ascertained facts.'"

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "There is no resurrection."
2. "Had this been lawful, Zeus would not have stopped him who knew the right way to restore men from the dead."

### John Calvin:
1. "Christ did not die, or rise again for himself, but for us: hence his resurrection is the foundation of ours, and what was accomplished in him, must be fulfilled in us also."
2. "Otherwise he would have risen again needlessly and to no purpose, because the fruit of it is to be sought, not in his own person, but in his members."
3. "For in Adam we die, and we recover life only in Christ; hence it follows that his resurrection is the foundation of ours, so that if that is taken away, it cannot stand."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Now if Christ is preached that he hath been raised from the dead..."
2. "How say some among you that there is no resurrection of the dead?"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Christ is preached."
2. "There were sceptics in Corinth, possibly in the church, who denied the resurrection of dead people just as some men today deny that miracles happen or ever did happen."
3. "Paul's answer is the resurrection of Christ as a fact. It all turns on this fact."

### John Gill:
1. "It was indeed but some of them, not all that were chargeable with this bad principle, which the apostle asks how, and with what face they could assert, then it had been preached, and so fully proved to them, that Christ was risen from the dead."
2. "For not only the saints rose in, and with Christ, as their head representatively, and which is the sense of the prophecy in Hosea 6:2 but because he is their head, and they are members of him, therefore as sure as he the head is risen, so sure shall the members rise likewise."
3. "Besides, as he became incarnate, obeyed, suffered, not for himself, but for his people, so he rose again on their account, and that they dying might rise also; which if they should not, one end at least of Christ's resurrection would not be answered."

### John Wesley:
1. How say some — Who probably had been heathen philosophers.
