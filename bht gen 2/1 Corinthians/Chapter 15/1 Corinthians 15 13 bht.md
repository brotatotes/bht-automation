# 1 Corinthians 15:13 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
If it is believed that resurrection is impossible, then it must follow that Christ has not been raised. The denial of the resurrection of the dead leads to the denial of the resurrection of Christ, and ultimately undermines the Christian faith. The resurrection of Christ and the resurrection of believers are inseparably linked, as what is true for the whole is true for the part.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "ἀν  .   νεκ  .   οὐκ ἔστιν" - the words ( οὐκ ) of the deniers.
2. "οὐδὲ χριστ  .   ἐγήγερται" - This inference depends, as Grot. observes, on the maxim, “Sublato genere tollitur et species;” the Resurrection of Christ being an  instance of the  rule , that dead  men rise; inasmuch as  He is man.
3. "This is enlarged on, 1 Corinthians 15:20-22"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "If there be no general resurrection, which is the consequent, then there can have been no resurrection of Christ, which is the antecedent." 
2. "The head and the members of the body stand on the same footing: what does not hold good of them, does not hold good of Him either."
3. "His resurrection and theirs are inseparably joined."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "If the whole subject is held to be impossible and absurd, then it must follow that Christ is not 'risen,' since there were the same difficulties in the way of raising him up which will exist in any case."
2. "Paul thus shows them that the denial of the doctrine, or the maintaining the general proposition 'that the dead would not rise,' led also to the denial of the fact that the Lord Jesus had risen, and consequently to the denial of Christianity altogether, and the annihilation of all their hopes."
3. "There was, moreover, such a close connection between Christ and his people, that the resurrection of the Lord Jesus made their resurrection certain."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "But if there is no resurrection of the dead, neither hath Christ been raised." 
2. "For, as logicians say, the genus being destroyed, the species of necessity goes with it."
3. "The root and the branches, the head and the members, stand and fall together."

### Archibald T. Robertson:

1. "If there be no resurrection of the dead...then is Christ not risen."
2. "The apostle argues from a general, to a particular; from the general resurrection of the dead, to the particular resurrection of Christ."
