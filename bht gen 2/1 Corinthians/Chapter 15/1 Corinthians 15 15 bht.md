# 1 Corinthians 15:15 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
If the dead do not rise, if the notion of resurrection is absurd and impossible, it would mean that the testimonies of the apostles, who witnessed the resurrection of Christ, are false and dishonorable. This accusation is severe, as being labeled a false witness is a great scandal. However, it is inconceivable to accuse the apostles, appointed by God as heralds, of spreading falsehood. Such an accusation is blasphemous and execrable, as it impugns the character of God Himself. Denying the resurrection not only undermines the apostles' credibility, but also challenges the truth and integrity of God.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "False witnesses concerning God (gen. obj.), not 'belonging to God' (gen. subj.), as Billroth: and false witnesses, as bearing false testimony (see below), not, as Knapp, as pretending to be witnesses, and not being." 
2. "Not, as commonly, and even Meyer, 'against God:' but as E. V., of, or concerning God."
3. "If in reality, as they assert..."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Testified of God" - the Greek preposition with the genitive implies, not direct antagonism, but indirect to the dishonor of God. English Version is probably better.
2. "If so be" - it is not right to tell untrue stories, though they are told and seem for the glory of God.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It will follow, if the Lord Jesus was not raised up, that we have been false witnesses of God."
2. "Nothing could be regarded as a greater crime than this, whatever might be the immediate subject under consideration."
3. "They had had ample opportunity to know whether God did raise up the Lord Jesus; and they were witnesses who had no inducement to bear a false witness in the case."

### John Calvin:
1. "Yet this also was no trivial absurdity — that the Apostles, who were ordained by God to be the heralds of his eternal truth, were detected as persons who had deceived the world with falsehoods; for this tends to God’s highest dishonor."
2. "The reason, too, that is added, corresponds well — because they had declared what was false, not as from themselves, but from God."
3. "He declares that God will be exposed to the charge of falsehood, inasmuch as what they publish has come forth from him."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "False witnesses of God (ψευδομαρτυρες του θεου). Late word, but ψευδομαρτυρεω, to bear false witness, old and common." 
2. "The genitive (του θεου) can be either subjective (in God's service) or objective (concerning God). Either makes good sense." 
3. "This is the more natural way to take κατα and genitive, against God not as equal to περ (concerning)."

### John Gill:
1. "And we are found false witnesses of God...what greater scandal, or a more odious character can be fixed upon a man, than to be a false witness?"
2. "But God forbid that such an imputation should be fastened upon the holy apostles of Christ, who cannot be thought to have any sinister end in publishing such a falsehood."
3. "If they are false witnesses, they are false witnesses of God; they are of his suborning...which to say nothing can be thought of more blasphemous and execrable."

### John Wesley:
1. If the dead rise not — If the very notion of a resurrection be, as they say, absurd and impossible.
