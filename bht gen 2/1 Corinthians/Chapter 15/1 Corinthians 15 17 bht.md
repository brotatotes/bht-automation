# 1 Corinthians 15:17 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
If Christ is not raised, our faith is in vain; our hope in the removal of sin's guilt and power would be frustrated. We would remain in our sins, under the condemnation and dominion of sin. The forgiveness, justification, and deliverance we have experienced would prove fruitless, for it is grounded in Christ's resurrection. Without his resurrection, there is no atoning value in his death, and our sins would still hold sway over us. But we can be assured that Christ is indeed risen, as attested by God, and through his life, we are saved.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "ματαία] from μάτην, and thus more directly pointing at the frustration of all on which faith relies as accomplished, e.g. the removal of the guilt and power of sin..."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Ye are, by the very fact (supposing the case to be as the skeptics maintained), frustrated of all which 'your faith' appropriates."
2. "Ye are still under the everlasting condemnation of your sins (even in the disembodied state which is here referred to), from which Christ's resurrection is our justification."
3. "Saved by his life."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Their faith was vain, 'because,' if Christ was not raised up, they were yet unpardoned sinners."
2. "You have reason to believe that your sins are forgiven. You cherish that belief on evidence that is satisfactory to you. But if Christ is not raised, that cannot be true."
3. "You have evidence that you are not under the dominion of sin. You have repented of it; have forsaken it; and are leading a holy life. You know that, and cannot be induced to doubt this fact. But all that is to be traced to the doctrine that the Lord Jesus rose from the dead."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Vain [ματαια] . A different word, signifying fruitless. The difference is between reality and result.

### John Calvin:
1. "Although Christ by his death atoned for our sins...has by death destroyed the power of death, and the devil himself, yet there would have been none of all these things, if he had not, by rising again, come off victorious."
2. "If the resurrection is overthrown, the dominion of sin is set up anew."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Vain (ματαια). Old word from adverb ματην (Matthew 15:9), devoid of truth, a lie."
2. "Ye are yet in your sins (ετ εστε εν ταις αμαρτιαις υμων). Because the death of Christ has no atoning value if he did not rise from the dead."
3. "In that case he was only a man like other men and did not die for our sins (verse 1 Corinthians 15:3)."

### John Gill:
1. "And if Christ be not raised, your faith is vain....and yet is vain, than which nothing can be more absurd." 
2. "ye are yet in your sins: in a state of nature and unregeneracy, under the power and dominion of sin, being neither regenerated nor sanctified;"
3. "moreover, if Christ is not risen, his people are under the guilt of their sins; there is no expiation nor remission of them, nor justification from them..."

### John Wesley:
1. "Ye are still in your sins — That is, under the guilt of them."
2. "So that there needed something more than reformation, (which was plainly wrought,) in order to their being delivered from the guilt of sin."
3. "Even that atonement, the sufficiency of which God attested by raising our great Surety from the grave."
