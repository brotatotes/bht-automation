# 1 Corinthians 15:18 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Is it possible to believe that those who have fallen asleep in Christ have perished? Can we accept that those who have died, placing their faith in Jesus, have lost their lives and existence altogether? No, it cannot be so. For those who sleep in Jesus will be brought by God with Him on the day of His return, to be forever with Him and eternally joyful.

### Henry Alford:
1. "those who fell asleep in Christ, perished (i.e. passed into misery in Hades)."
2. "ἐπὶ μὲν οὖν τοῦ χριστοῦ  θάνατον καλεῖ , ἵνα τὸ πάθος πιστώσηται · ἐπὶ δὲ ἡμῶν  κοίμησιν , ἵνα τὴν ὀδύνην παραμυθήσηται . ἔνθα μὲν γὰρ παρεχώρησεν ἡ ἀνάστασις , θαῤῥῶν καλεῖ θάνατον . ἔνθα δὲ ἐν ἐλπίσιν ἔτι μένει , κοίμησιν καλεῖ ."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "In Christ's case the term used is death, to assure us of the reality of His suffering; in our case, sleep, to give us consolation."
2. "In His case, His resurrection having actually taken place, Paul shrinks not from the term death; in ours, the resurrection being still only a matter of hope, he uses the term falling asleep."
3. "Perished—Their souls are lost; they are in misery in the unseen world."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Can you believe it possible that the good people who have believed in the Lord Jesus are destroyed? Can you believe that your best friends, your kindred, and your fellow Christians who have died, have gone down to perdition?"
2. "There are multitudes who are made good men by the gospel...Can it be believed that they will be destroyed? That they will perish with the profane, and licentious, and unprincipled? That they will go down to dwell with the polluted and the wicked?"
3. "He, therefore, who becomes an infidel 'believes' that his pious friends - his sainted father, his holy mother, his lovely Christian sister or child, is deluded and deceived; that they will sink down to the grave to rise no more; that their hopes of heaven will all vanish, and that they will be destroyed with the profane, the impure, and the sensual."

### John Calvin:
1. "Of what advantage were it to the dead that they once were Christians? Hence our brethren who are now dead, did to no purpose live in the faith of Christ." 
2. "For although the souls of the dead are now living, and enjoy quiet repose, yet the whole of their felicity and consolation depends exclusively on the resurrection; because it is well with them on this account, and no other, that they wait for that day, on which they shall be called to the possession of the kingdom of God." 
3. "Hence as to the hope of the dead, all is over, unless that day shall sooner or later arrive."

### Archibald T. Robertson:

2. "Have perished (απωλοντο). Did perish. Second aorist middle indicative of απολλυμ, to destroy, middle, to perish (delivered up to eternal misery)."
3. "Cf. 1 Corinthians 8:11."

### John Gill:
1. "Death is often represented by a sleep...with a view to the resurrection, which will be an awaking out of it."
2. "If Christ is not risen, [those who have died in Christ] are perished: soul and body."
3. "Can it be that any that are in Christ...should ever perish? or those that are asleep in him be lost? No, those that sleep in Jesus, will God bring with him at the last day, who shall be forever with him, and forever happy."

### John Wesley:
1. They who sleep in Christ — Who have died for him, or believing in him.Are perished — Have lost their life and being together.
