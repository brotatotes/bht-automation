# 1 Corinthians 15:19 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
If our hope in Christ is limited to this present life, our faith would be in vain, and we would be truly miserable. The Christian's hope is not rooted in worldly pleasures or temporary achievements, but in the promise of eternal life through our Savior, Jesus Christ. It is in this hope that we find true happiness and meaning, even in the midst of trials and tribulations. Therefore, let us hold steadfastly to our hope in Christ and trust in His faithful promises beyond this earthly existence.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Assuming this ἀπώλεια of the dead in Christ, the state of Christians is indeed miserable."
2. "The right arrangement of the Greek gives the key to the sentence: εἰ ( ἐν τῇ ζωῇ ταύτῃ ἐν χριστῷ ἠλπικότες ἐσμὲν ) μόνον, 'if all we have done is merely  having hoped in Christ in this life,'"
3. "We are most to be pitied (most miserable) of all men; viz. because they, all other men, live at ease, we on the contrary are ever exposed to danger and death."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "If our hopes in Christ were limited to this life only, we should be, of all men, most to be pitied."
2. "While others live unmolested, we are exposed to every trial and persecution, and, after all, are doomed to bitter disappointment in our most cherished hope."
3. "All our hope of salvation, even of the soul (not merely of the body), hangs on the resurrection of Christ, without which His death would be of no avail to us."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "If in this life only we have hope in Christ...if all our hopes shall be disappointed...we...suppose that this refers to the apostles only...If they failed in that they failed in everything."
2. "More to be pitied or commiserated than any other class of people...their condition and hopes...would be most deplorable; they would be more deserving of pity than any other class of people."
3. "This passage...does not mean that virtue and piety are not attended with happiness...the Christian has no happiness in 'religion itself'...a life of virtue and piety would be more happy than a life of sin. But it means that the condition of the Christian would be more 'deplorable' than that of other people; he would be more to be pitied."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Only. To be taken with the whole clause, at the end of which it stands emphatically."
2. "If in this life we are hopers in Christ, and if that is all."
3. "If we are not such as shall have hope in Christ after we shall have fallen asleep."

### John Calvin:
1. "To believe in this life means here to limit the fruit of our faith to this life, so that our faith looks no farther, and does not extend beyond the confines of the present life."
2. "Paul did not dream of Elysian fields, and foolish fables of that sort, but takes it for granted, that the entire hope of Christians looks forward to the final day of judgment."
3. "Christians would be the most miserable of all men if their confidence were confined to this world."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Building our hope of a future resurrection on a mere delusion, to die at length as a fool dieth."
2. "If in this life only we have hoped in Christ, we are of all men most pitiable."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Hope limited to this life even if 'in Christ.' Only qualifies the whole clause." 
2. "If our hope is limited to this life, we have denied ourselves what people call pleasures and have no happiness beyond." 
3. "Paul makes morality turn on the hope of immortality. Is he not right?"

### John Gill:
1. "The object of a believer's hope is not any creature, man, or angel; nor any creature enjoyment, as gold and silver; nor any creature righteousness, moral, legal, and civil; nor any external privilege, or profession of religion; but Christ alone as a surety, Saviour, and Redeemer"

### John Wesley:
1. "If in this life only we have hope — If we look for nothing beyond the grave."
2. "But if we have a divine evidence of things not seen, if we have 'a hope full of immortality,' if we now taste of 'the powers of the world to come,' and see 'the crown that fadeth not away,' then, notwithstanding all our present trials, we are more happy than all men."
