# 1 Corinthians 15:2 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Salvation is not a one-time event but a ongoing process that depends on holding fast to the teachings of Christ. It is through this faithful adherence to the Gospel that believers are saved. However, it is also important to examine the genuineness of one's faith. If our belief in Christ is in vain or merely superficial, it lacks the transformative power of true faith. Therefore, let us hold fast to the truth and ensure that our faith is not in vain.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "By which ye are saved, if ye hold fast (in memory and personal appropriation) with what speech I preached it unto you."
2. "Unless—which is impossible, your faith is vain, in resting on Christ's resurrection as an objective reality."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "By which also ye are saved - On which your salvation depends... that by which they had been built up; and that which was connected with their salvation." 
2. "If ye keep in memory - Margin, as in the Greek, 'if ye hold fast.' The idea is, that they were saved by this, or would be, if they faithfully retained or held the doctrine as he delivered it... and all the arts of false teaching to wrest it from them." 
3. "Unless ye have believed in vain - You will be saved by it, if you adhere to it unless it shall turn out that it was vain to believe, and that the doctrine was false... unless all your profession is false and hollow, you will be saved by this great doctrine which I first preached to you."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The salvation of the readers depends on their holding fast the word preached."
2. "Paul say that their holding it fast was the condition on which he preached it."

### John Calvin:
1. "In the first, he reproves their carelessness or fickleness, because such a sudden fall was an evidence that they had never understood what had been delivered to them, or that their knowledge of it had been loose and floating, inasmuch as it had so quickly vanished."
2. "By the second, he warns them that they had needlessly and uselessly professed allegiance to Christ, if they did not hold fast this main doctrine."
3. "To believe in vain, according to the use of ancient languages, is to believe without just reason and authority, giving credit to idle reports as true and authentic."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "In what words I preached it unto you... it is not clear whether the clause depends on γνωριζω like the other relatives, but most likely so." 
2. "Paul assumes that they are holding it fast." 
3. "Condition of first class, unless in fact ye did believe to no purpose (εικη, old adverb, only in Paul in N.T.). Paul holds this peril over them in their temptation to deny the resurrection."

### John Gill:
1. "Salvation is inseparably connected with true faith in Christ as a Saviour, and with a hearty belief of his resurrection from the dead, which is the earnest and pledge of the resurrection of the saints." 
2. "It is the man that perseveres in the faith and doctrine of Christ that shall be saved; and everyone that has truly believed in Christ, and cordially embraced his Gospel, shall hold on, and out to the end." 
3. "A mere historical faith may be in vain; this a man may have, and not the grace of God, and so be nothing; with this he may believe for a while, and then drop it."

### John Wesley:
1. "Ye are saved, if ye hold fast — Your salvation is begun, and will be perfected, if ye continue in the faith."
2. "Unless ye have believed in vain — Unless indeed your faith was only a delusion."
