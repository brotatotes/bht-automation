Christ's resurrection serves as the guarantee and assurance of the resurrection of all believers who have fallen asleep in him.

The undeniable proof of Christ's resurrection offers a solid and convincing foundation for this hope, which remains steadfast and certain for all the righteous.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Christ, in rising from the dead, is but the firstling or earnest of the resurrection of the whole number of those that sleep."
2. "There does not appear to be any intended reference to the legal ordinance of the first-fruits, but however general the application of the analogy may be, it can hardly fail to have been suggested to the mind of a Jew by the Levitical ordinances."
3. "From the logical connexion, [τῶν κεκοιμημένων] should mean, not the dead in Christ, but all the dead; but it is the Christian dead who are before the Apostle’s mind when he calls our risen Lord ἀπαρχὴ τῶν κεκ."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The first-fruits—the earnest or pledge, that the whole resurrection harvest will follow."
2. "Our faith is not vain, nor our hope limited to this life."
3. "The time of writing this Epistle was probably about the Passover...and the same was the day of Christ's resurrection: whence appears the appropriateness of the image."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "That was a point on which he was certain. He had seen him after he was risen; and he could no more doubt this 'fact' than he could any other which he had witnessed with his own eyes." 
2. "It may also be implied here, as Grotius and Schoettgen have remarked, that he is the first of those who were raised so as not to die again; and that, therefore, those raised by Elisha and by the Saviour himself do not come into the account. They all died again; but the Saviour will not die, nor will those whom he will raise up in the resurrection die any more."
3. "May it not be implied that, by the resurrection of the Lord Jesus, all those of whom he speaks are regarded as sacred to God, and as consecrated and accepted by the resurrection and acceptance of him who was the first-fruits?"

### Marvin Vincent:
1. The first - fruits [απαρχη] . See on James 1:18. Omit become. Compare Colossians 1:18, and see on Revelation 1:5.

### John Calvin:
1. "Christ has risen; and he adds that he is thefirst-fruits, (48) by a similitude taken, as it appears, from the ancient ritual of the law."
2. "For as in the first-fruits the produce of the entire year was consecrated, so the power of Christ’s resurrection is extended to all of us."
3. "I rather prefer, however, to understand the statement in this sense — that the rest of the dead will follow him, as the entire harvest does the first-fruits."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "But now hath Christ been raised from the dead. As if impatient at having to linger over such wretched speculations, with what a bound does the apostle here spring on the firm ground and into the clear air of an indubitable resurrection in the Person of Christ."
2. "The allusion here is as obvious as it is beautiful. On the morrow after the first Sabbath of the Passover, a sheaf of the first-fruits of the barley harvest was reaped and 'waved before the Lord,' as a joyful pledge of the full harvest to come (Leviticus 23:10-11; Leviticus 23:15-16)."
3. "Even so, on the morrow after the first Sabbath of that Passover when our Lord was crucified being the first day of the week did He rise 'the First-fruits of His sleeping people.'"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "But now (νυν δε). Emphatic form of νυν with - added (cf. 1 Corinthians 12:18). It is the logical triumph of Paul after the reductio ad impossibile (Findlay) of the preceding argument."
2. "The first-fruits (απαρχη). Old word from απαρχομα, to offer firstlings or first-fruits. In LXX for first-fruits. In papyri for legacy-duty, entrance-fee, and also first-fruits as here."
3. "Christ is 'first-born from the dead' (Colossians 1:18). Others raised from the dead died again, but not so Jesus."

### John Gill:
1. "And became the firstfruits of them that slept; who were already fallen asleep; respecting chiefly the saints that died before the resurrection of Christ;"
2. "The firstfruits were what first sprung out of the earth, were soonest ripe, and were first reaped and gathered in, and then offered unto the Lord; so Christ first rose from the dead, and ascended to heaven, and presented himself to God; as the representative of his people;"
3. "The firstfruits sanctified the rest of the harvest, represented the whole, gave right to the ingathering of it, and ensured it; Christ by lying in the grave, and rising out of it, sanctified it for his people, and in his resurrection represented them; they rose with him, and in him; and their resurrection is secured by his; because he lives, they shall live also."

### John Wesley:
1. "Christians 'have hope,' not 'in this life only.'"
2. "The proof is short, but solid and convincing, that which arose from Christ's resurrection."
3. "The earnest, pledge, and insurance of their resurrection who slept in him: even of all the righteous."
