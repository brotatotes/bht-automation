# 1 Corinthians 15:21 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
By the sin of the first man, death entered into the world and affected all of humanity, bringing about physical death. However, through the redemptive work of Christ, who is both God and man, there is hope for the resurrection of the dead. Christ, through His death and resurrection, has abolished death and obtained for His people the right to resurrection. He will be the one to raise all the dead, and while all will be raised by His power, it is the saints, those united to Him, who will experience the fullness of resurrection.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "MAN the bringer-in both of death and life: explanation (not proof) of Christ being the ἀπαρχὴ τ . κεκοιμ .: and (1) in that He is MAN: it being necessary that the first-fruit should be as the lump."
2. "The verity lying at the root of this verse is, that by MAN ONLY can general effects pervading the whole human race be introduced."
3. "δι ʼ ἀνθρώπου, sc. ἐστίν."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The first-fruits are of the same nature as the rest of the harvest; so Christ, the bringer of life, is of the same nature as the race of men to whom He brings it."
2. "Just as Adam, the bringer of death, was of the same nature as the men on whom he brought it."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The sense is, evidently, that in consequence of the sin of Adam all people die, or are subjected to temporal death."
2. "This passage may be regarded as proof that death would not have entered the world had it not been for transgression..."
3. "The apostle here, by 'man,' undoubtedly refers to Adam; but the particular and specific idea which he intends to insist on is, that, as death came by human nature, or by a human being, by a man, so it was important and proper that immortality, or freedom from death, should come in the same way, by one who was a man."

### John Calvin:
1. "Christ in like manner, who is the antitype, did not rise for himself alone; for he came, that he might restore everything that had been ruined in Adam."
2. "We must observe, however, the force of the argument; for he does not contend by similitude, or by example, but has recourse to opposite causes for the purpose of proving opposite effects."
3. "He proves it from contraries, because death is not from nature, but from man’s sin."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "For since by man came death" - a grandly rhythmical expression of the grand truth, that the ruin and recovery of humanity spring alike from within itself. 


### Archibald T. Robertson:
1.  By man also  (δα δι' ανθρωπου). That is Jesus, the God-man, the Second Adam (Romans 5:12). The hope of the resurrection of the dead rests in Christ. 

### John Gill:
1. "The first man, by sin, was the cause of death; of its coming into the world, and upon all men, by which corporeal death is here meant."
2. "Christ is the meritorious and procuring cause of the resurrection of his people; he by dying has abolished death; and by rising from the dead has opened the graves of the saints, and procured their resurrection for them, obtained for them a right unto it, and made way for it."
3. "He also will be the efficient cause of the resurrection; all the dead will be raised by his power, and at the hearing of his voice; though the saints only will be raised by him, in virtue of their union to him, and interest in him, being members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones."
