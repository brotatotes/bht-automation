# 1 Corinthians 15:22 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Romans 5 contrasts the effects of Adam's actions and Christ's redemptive work. Through Adam, all of humanity experiences the consequence of sin, which is physical death. However, in Christ, there is the opportunity for all to receive eternal life. The focus is not on individual salvation but on the universal impact of Adam's fall and Christ's redemption. Through Adam, death entered the world, but through Christ, life is made available to all. This passage highlights the breadth of Christ's redemptive work and offers hope for the restoration and eternal life for all who are in Christ.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "In that He is...the bringer-in of LIFE, as Adam was the bringer-in of DEATH."
2. "The antithesis is merely between the bringing in of death by Adam, and of life (its opposite) by Christ."
3. "That death physical involved death eternal that life eternal (in its only worthy sense) involves bliss eternal, is not so much as thought of, while the two great opposites, Death and Life, are under consideration."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. 22. in Adam allâ€”in union of
	nature with Adam, as representative head of mankind in their fall. 
	in Christ . . . allâ€”in
	union of nature with Christ, the representative head of mankind in
	their recovery. The life brought in by Christ is co-extensive with
	the death brought in by Adam.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "His deed was the procuring cause, or the reason, why all are subjected to temporal death."
2. "His argument, therefore, requires him to show only that temporal death, or mortality, was introduced by the first man, and that this has been counteracted by the second."
3. "The sceptre of death shall be broken, and his dominion destroyed, by the fact that all shall be raised up from the dead."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. All - all. What the all means in the one case it means in the other.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "It has been the Divine plan from the first, and will be to the last, that mankind shall be dealt with under two heads Adam and Christ hence called 'the first man' and 'the second man;' as if there never had been, nor ever will be more than those two men. In the one all die, in the other all are made alive."
2. "This being contrary to both the spirit and letter of all Scripture elsewhere, many others believe (2) that though the life meant here is indeed co-extensive with the death spoken of, it does not mean the life actually conferred upon anyone, but the life procured and made available for all on condition of their believing."
3. "One other way of explaining these words remains, which preserves the strict analogy between the death and the life and is in harmony with all other Scripture: (3) that the death by Adam and the life by Christ, here intended, mean death and life in their whole extent, as actually experienced."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "He means resurrection (restoration) by the verb here, but not necessarily eternal life or salvation."
2. "All who die die in Adam, all who will be made alive will be made alive (restored to life) in Christ."
3. "The same problem occurs in Romans 5:18 about 'all,' and in verse 1 Corinthians 15:19 about 'the many.'"

### John Gill:
1. "All men were in Adam seminally, as the common parent of human nature... they all sinned in him, and so died in him... the sentence of death passed on them in him." 
2. "To be quickened or made alive, is with the Jews, and other eastern nations, a phrase of the same signification with being raised from the dead... the apostle is not speaking of such a life, but of a corporeal one."
3. "As all that were in Adam... died in him, became mortal, and subject to death through him; so all that are in Christ... shall be raised to an immortal life by him."

### John Wesley:
1. "As through Adam all, even the righteous, die, so through Christ all these shall be made alive."
2. "He does not say, 'shall revive,' (as naturally as they die,) but shall be made alive, by a power not their own."
