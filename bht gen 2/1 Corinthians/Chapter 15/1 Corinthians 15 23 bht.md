# 1 Corinthians 15:23 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this passage, we are reminded that in the universal resurrection, all individuals will not hold the same rank. Christ will be first, followed by the godly who die in Him. The key to understanding this passage lies in the prophecy of Jesus in Matthew 24 and the distinction between His coming and the end. The focus here is on the resurrection of the saints, separate from the general judgment. Each person will occupy their rightful place in the process of resurrection, as each resurrection is part of the great final gathering of all nations.

2. "The key to the understanding of this passage is to be found in the prophecy of our Lord, Matthew 24:25, but especially in the latter chapter."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Though all shall rise again, let not any think all shall be saved; nay, each shall have his proper place, Christ first, and after Him the godly who die in Christ, in a separate band from the ungodly, and then 'the end,' that is, the resurrection of the rest of the dead." 
2. "Christ's own flock shall share His glory 'at His coming,' which is not to be confounded with 'the end,' or general judgment. The latter is not in this chapter specially discussed, but only the first resurrection, namely, that of the saints."
3. "The second coming of Christ is not a mere point of time, but a period beginning with the resurrection of the just at His appearing, and ending with the general judgment."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The 'order' which is here referred to is, doubtless, mainly that of 'time'; meaning that Christ would be first, and then that the others would follow."
2. "He was first in rank, in dignity, and in honor; he was the leader of all others, and their resurrection depended on his."
3. "This proves that the dead will not be raised until Christ shall re-appear. He shall come for that purpose; and he shall assemble all the dead, and shall take his people to himself."

2. "Here in the sense of band, or company, in pursuance of the principle of a descending series of ranks, and of consequent subordinations which is assumed by Paul."
3. "The reference is not to time or merit, but simply to the fact that each occupies his own place in the economy of resurrection, which is one great process in several acts."

### John Calvin:
1. "Let us therefore reckon it enough, that we now have in Christ the first-fruits, and that his coming will be the time of our resurrection."
2. "For our life must still be hid with him, because he has not yet appeared."
3. "It would therefore be preposterous to wish to anticipate that day of the revelation of Christ."
