# 1 Corinthians 15:24 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
At the end, Christ will deliver up His mediatorial kingdom to the Father, accomplishing the goal of redemption. This does not mean an end to His reign, but a change in administration. All powers, even those opposing Him, will submit. God's unity and the Church will be fully manifested. The Father's reign continues, and Christ's glory remains. His delivery of the kingdom to the Father signifies the completion of His work and the fulfillment of God's plan.
