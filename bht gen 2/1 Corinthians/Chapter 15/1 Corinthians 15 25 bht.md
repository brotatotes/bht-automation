# 1 Corinthians 15:25 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Christ's reign is a divine appointment until all enemies have been subjected to his authority. This continuation of his mediatorial kingdom is not only necessary but also foretold and promised. The enemies under his feet will be subdued as part of his ultimate victory. The subjugation of these enemies is both a fulfillment of prophecy and a testament to the propriety of his reign. Through his reign, Christ will accomplish the work necessary to bring about a right and tranquil state.
