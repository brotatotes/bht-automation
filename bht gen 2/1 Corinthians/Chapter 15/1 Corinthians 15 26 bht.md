# 1 Corinthians 15:26 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Death, as the consequence of sin, is the last enemy to be overcome in the grand plan of redemption. It is an unnatural separation, rupturing the eternal fellowship between God and His creation. However, through the sacrifice of Christ, death loses its sting for believers, becoming their passage to eternal glory. The destruction of death itself, along with the defeat of sin and Satan, will ultimately be realized. This divine order showcases the triumph of the gospel over all enemies, where death is abolished and the fullness of God's redemptive plan is accomplished.
