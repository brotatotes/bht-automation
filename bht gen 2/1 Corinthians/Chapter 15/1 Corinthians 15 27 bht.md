# 1 Corinthians 15:27 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
God's declaration of all things being subjected to Him is a manifest truth that must be understood and interpreted in that way. It is a powerful statement that signifies the absolute subjection of everything to Him. This includes both visible and invisible aspects of creation. The intensity of this subjection implies that there is no aspect of the universe, except for the Father, that is not subject to Him. This declaration is rooted in the words of the Psalmist, who was inspired by God's own saying. It is a remarkable piece of information that highlights the supreme authority and dominion of God.
