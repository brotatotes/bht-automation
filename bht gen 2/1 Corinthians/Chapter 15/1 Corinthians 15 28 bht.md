# 1 Corinthians 15:28 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In the end, all things, including the Son, will be brought under subjection to God. This does not mean that the Son is inferior to the Father, but rather that the Son, as a voluntary and co-equal participant in the Godhead, will willingly hand over authority to the Father. Once all enemies are overcome and God's kingdom is fully established, it will be evident that God is all in all. At that time, God will reign supreme over the universe, and all creatures, including believers, will recognize and acknowledge Him as their ultimate Lord and King.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The interpretations, that subjection is only an hyperbolical expression for the entire harmony of Christ with the Father... are idle subterfuges."
2. "The refutation of these and all other attempts to explain away the doctrine here plainly asserted, of the ultimate subordination of the Son, is contained in the three precise and unambiguous words, αὐτὸς ὁ υἱός."
3. "ἵνα ᾖ ὁ θ. πάντα ἐν πᾶσιν] that God (alone) may be all things in all, i.e. recognized as sole Lord and King."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Son . . . himself . . . subject—not as the creatures are, but as a Son voluntarily subordinate to, though co-equal with, the Father."
2. "Then, and not till then, 'all things,' without the least infringement of the divine prerogative, shall be subject to the Son, and the Son subordinate to the Father, while co-equally sharing His glory."
3. "Even the saints do not fully realize God as their 'all' now, through desiring it; then each shall feel, God is all to me."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Shall be brought under subjection. When all his enemies shall be overcome and destroyed; or when the hearts of the redeemed shall be entirely subject to God. When God’s kingdom shall be fully established over the universe."
2. "It has been proposed to render this, “even then shall the Son,” etc.; implying that he had been all along subject to God; had acted under his authority; and that this subjection would continue even then in a sense similar to that in which it had existed; and that Christ would then continue to exercise a delegated authority over his people and kingdom."
3. "That God may be supreme; that the Divinity, the Godhead, may rule; and that it may be seen that he is the Sovereign over all the universe."

### John Calvin:
1. "For the present, as the Devil resists God, as wicked men confound and disturb the order which he has established, and as endless occasions of offense present themselves to our view, it does not distinctly appear that God is all in all; but when Christ will have executed the judgment which has been committed to him by the Father, and will have cast down Satan and all the wicked, the glory of God will be conspicuous in their destruction." 
2. "God, holding the government of the heaven and the earth by himself, and without any medium, will in that respect be all, and will consequently at last be so, not only in all persons, but also in all creatures."
3. "Paul’s words, however, mean nothing but this, that all things will be brought back to God, as their alone beginning and end, that they may be closely bound to him."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "To those who find the supreme Divinity of Christ in every account of His work, and who cannot rest on a Saviour without absolutely Divine properties, the following remarks may prove helpful." 
2. "The kingdom itself, then, and Christ as the principle of all its highest activities, is never to disappear if anything certain can be gathered from these disclosures." 
3. "He surrenders, therefore, the seals of office; and as He was 'exalted to be a Prince and Saviour' for all saving purposes, He will, when these ends have been fully achieved, 'be subjected unto Him that did subject all things unto Him,' and, as the grand result, GOD, in the most absolute sense Father, Son, and Holy Ghost will be all in the entire new creation."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Merely, 'when the all things are subjected unto him.' The aorist subjunctive has given translators a deal of needless trouble in this passage."
2. "The final goal of all God's redemptive plans as Paul has so well said in Romans 11:36."
3. "Precisely this language Paul will use of Christ (Colossians 3:11)."

### John Gill:

### John Wesley:
1. "The Son also shall be subject - Shall deliver up the mediatorial kingdom."
2. "All things, (consequently all persons,) without any interruption, without the intervention of any creature, without the opposition of any enemy, shall be subordinate to God."
3. "All shall say, 'My God, and my all.'"
