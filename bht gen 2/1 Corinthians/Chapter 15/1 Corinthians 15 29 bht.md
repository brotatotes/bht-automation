# 1 Corinthians 15:29 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The interpretation of this passage has generated diverse viewpoints. Some scholars argue that those who are baptized for the dead do so in anticipation of receiving blessings in the realm of the deceased. Others propose that this practice involves individuals being baptized as a symbol of taking the place of deceased believers. Despite these differing interpretations, the apostle employs these arguments to reinforce the teaching on the resurrection of the dead.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "What will become of 'what account can they give of their practice?'"
2. "The only legitimate reference is, to a practice...of survivors allowing themselves to be baptized on behalf of (believing?) friends who had died without baptism."
3. "This explanation of the passage may be safely accepted, as exhibiting a curious relic of primitive superstition, which...gradually dwindled away till it was only to be found in some obscure sects, where it lost its original significance."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "What account can they give of their practice; why are they at the trouble of it, if the dead rise not?" 
2. "But if so, it is strange there is no direct censure of it." 
3. "The best punctuation is, 'If the dead rise not at all, why are they then baptized for them?'"

### Albert Barnes:
1. "That this view is plausible, and that it suits the strain of remark in the following verses, is evident. But there are objections to it..."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "What shall they do [œÑŒπ œÄŒøŒπŒ∑œÉŒøœÖœÉŒπŒΩ] . What will they effect or accomplish."
2. "Paul is evidently alluding to a usage familiar to his readers; and the term employed was, as Godet remarks, in their vocabulary, a sort of technical phrase."
3. "A large number of both ancient and modern commentators adopt the view that a living Christian was baptized for an unbaptized dead Christian."

### John Calvin:
1. "For my part, however, I cannot by any means be persuaded to believe this, for it is not to be credited, that those who denied that there was a resurrection had, along with others, made use of a custom of this sort."
2. "Let us now inquire as to the meaning. At one time I was of opinion, that Paul here pointed out the universal design of baptism, for the advantage of baptism is not confined to this life; but on considering the words afterwards with greater care, I perceived that Paul here points out something peculiar."
3. "They were, then, baptized for the dead, inasmuch as it could not be of any service to them in this world, and the very occasion of their asking baptism was that they despaired of life."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "A most difficult verse, of which the interpretations that have been given are endless."
2. "Surely this scarcely deserves notice. Plainly, the allusion is to some act performed in expectation of future benefit to themselves, which benefit would be lost if the dead did not rise."
3. "Our verse would then mean: 'What is to become of those who in advancing to baptism do so as not knowing that it may not prove their death-warrant, if the dead rise not?'"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "This passage remains a puzzle."
2. "The Greek expositors took it to be about the dead (œÖœÄŒµœÅ in sense of œÄŒµœÅ as often as in 2 Corinthians 1:6) since baptism is a burial and a resurrection (Romans 6:2-6)."
3. "Others take it to mean that Paul and others were in peril of death as shown by baptism (see verse 1 Corinthians 15:30)."

### John Gill:
1. "The apostle here returns to his subject, and makes use of new arguments to prove the doctrine of the resurrection of the dead."
2. "...interpreters go different ways: some think the apostle has in view a custom of some, who when their friends died without baptism, used to be baptized in their room..."
3. "Others imagine, that he intends such as were baptized, and added to the church, and so filled up the places of them that were dead..."

### John Wesley:
1. "Who are baptized for the dead" - Perhaps baptized in hope of blessings to be received after they are numbered with the dead.
2. "Or, 'baptized in the room of the dead'" - Of them that are just fallen in the cause of Christ: like soldiers who advance in the room of their companions that fell just before their face.
