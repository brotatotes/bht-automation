# 1 Corinthians 15:30 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
We, the apostles, constantly face danger and risk our lives every hour. It is clear that if there is no hope for a better life after death, then our actions would be in vain. We would be foolish to undergo such risks without the expectation of a glorious resurrection. Our willingness to endure these perils is rooted in the belief in the future state and the evidence that supports it. Without the hope of resurrection, our endeavors and sacrifices would lack purpose and wisdom.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Not only the practice of those just spoken of, but his own, and that of those like him, were absurd, if there be no resurrection."
2. "Observe that the argument here applies equally to the future existence of the soul."
3. "Nescio quomodo in-hæret in mentibus quasi seculorum quoddam augurium futurorum … quo quidem demto, quis tam esset amens, qui semper in laboribus et periculis viveret?"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "A gradation from those who could only for a little time enjoy this life, to us, who could enjoy it longer, if we had not renounced the world for Christ."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Why do we constantly risk our lives, and encounter danger of every kind? This refers particularly to Paul himself and the other apostles, who were constantly exposed to peril by land or by sea in the arduous work of making known the gospel."
2. "The argument here is plain. It is, that such efforts would be vain, useless, foolish, unless there was to be a glorious resurrection. They had no other object in encountering these dangers than to make known the truths connected with that glorious future state; and if there were no such future state, it would be wise for them to avoid these dangers."
3. "It would not be supposed that we would encounter these perils constantly, unless we were sustained with the hope of the resurrection, and unless we had evidence which convinced our own minds that there would be such a resurrection."

### John Calvin:
1. "To no purpose would we stand in peril every hour, if we did not look for a better life, after death has been passed through."
2. "This magnanimity of soul, I say, in despising death, would be ascribed to rashness rather than firmness, if the saints perished at death, for it is a diabolical madness to purchase by death an immortal fame."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "If their conduct, supposing there is no resurrection, is folly, are we preachers, in hourly peril of our lives, any wiser?"
2. "Why do we also (we preachers) stand in jeopardy every hour?"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "We also as well as those who receive baptism which symbolizes death."
2. "Paul's Epistles and Acts... throw light on Paul's argument."
3. "He was never out of danger from Damascus to the last visit to Rome."

### John Gill:
1. "Not only they that have suffered martyrdom for the faith of Christ... have acted very injudiciously and indiscreetly..."
2. "We... must be highly blameworthy, who continually expose ourselves to dangers, and are for Christ's sake killed all the day long, are every moment liable to innumerable injuries, tortures and death..."
3. "...such, as they must be of all men the most miserable, so of all men the most stupid."
