# 1 Corinthians 15:32 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
If to use a popular phrase, like saying 'I have fought with wild beasts at Ephesus,' which represents a dangerous and tumultuous struggle; if I have faced such fierce opposition and hostility, it would mean nothing if there is no hope of resurrection. It would be like embracing the perspective of those who proclaim, 'Let us eat and indulge ourselves, for there is no future beyond this life.' However, this would be a foolish and empty mindset, as it ignores the truth of the resurrection and the eternal hope it brings.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The stress of the first clause is on κατὰ ἄνθρωπον, and its meaning, merely as man, i.e. 'according to this world's views,' 'as one who has no hope beyond the grave.'" 
2. "[The expression 'I fought with beasts'] must be right: for his Roman citizenship would have precluded his ever being literally thrown to beasts." 
3. "If dead men rise not, i.e. 'if none of the dead rise.'"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "If 'merely as a man' (with the mere human hope of the present life not with the Christian's hope of the resurrection; answering to 'If the dead rise not,' the parallel clause in the next sentence), I have fought with men resembling savage beasts."
2. "Though the tumult had not yet taken place (for after it he set out immediately for Macedonia), this Epistle was written evidently just before it, when the storm was gathering; 'many adversaries' were already menacing him."
3. "Quoted from the Septuagint, where the prophet describes the reckless self-indulgence of the despisers of God's call to mourning, Let us enjoy the good things of life now, for it soon will end."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It is the most natural interpretation to suppose that Paul, on some occasion, had such a contest with a wild beast at Ephesus. It is that which would occur to the great mass of the readers of the New Testament as the obvious meaning of the passage."
2. "The state of things in Ephesus when Paul was there Acts 19:0 was such as to make it nowise improbable that he would be subjected to such a trial."
3. "The phrase κατὰ ἄνθρωπον kata anthrōpon, as a 'man,' may mean, that, 'to human appearance,' or so far as man was concerned, had it not been for some divine interposition, he would have been a prey to the wild beasts. Had not God interposed and kept him from harm, as in the case of the viper at Melita Acts 28:5, he would have been put to death."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "After the manner of men...for temporal reward; and not under the influence of any higher principle or hope."
2. "The natural reference is to his experience with the ferocious mob at Ephesus."
3. "Let us eat and drink, etc. Cited, after the Septuagint, from Isaiah 22:13. It is the exclamation of the people of Jerusalem during the siege by the Assyrians."

### John Calvin:
1. "If all my hopes were confined to this world?"
2. "Let us eat and drink...encourage themselves in wantonness and unbridled mirth..."
3. "If death is the end of man, there is nothing better than that he should indulge in pleasure, free from care, so long as life lasts."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Clearly, the statement is to be understood in a figurative sense, thus: ‘If after encountering, as I did at Ephesus, such a furious opposition as was more like a rush of wild beasts than the hostility of reasonable men.’"
2. "This maxim, though found in a fragment of the Greek poet Menander (about B.C. 280), was not likely taken directly from him by our apostle; for it is just such a proverbial saying as, when once penned, would be sure to be caught up and repeated from mouth to mouth."
3. "A different punctuation of this verse is adopted by many of the best interpreters, thus: 'what doth it profit me! If the dead are not raised, let us eat,' etc. So Chrysostom of the Cithers, and of the moderns Beza, Bengel, De Wette, Meyer, Stanley, and Alford..."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "After the manner of men. Like men, for applause, money, etc."
2. "If he were cast to the lions unlawfully, he could have prevented it by claiming his citizenship."
3. "Paul is not giving his own view, but that of people who deny the resurrection."

### John Gill:
1. "It is this last custom that is here referred to: and if regard is had to what befell thee apostle at Ephesus, when Demetrius and his craftsmen made the uproar mentioned in Acts 19:21 this could not be in reality, but only in the purpose and design of men..."
2. "If 'after the manner of brutish men', the Romans, I have fought with beasts at Ephesus: which I was obliged to do, or deny the Gospel preached; what advantageth it me, if the dead rise not?"
3. "Instead of its being a glorious action, it was a foolhardy one; and if he had died in it, what profit could he have had by it, if he rose not again; or if there is no resurrection of the dead?"

### John Wesley:
1. "If to speak after the manner of men - That is, to use a proverbial phrase, expressive of the most imminent danger."
2. "I have fought with wild beasts at Ephesus - With the savage fury of a lawless multitude."
3. "Let as eat, … — We might, on that supposition, as well say, with the Epicureans, Let us make the best of this short life, seeing we have no other portion."
