# 1 Corinthians 15:33 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Be not deceived by the false philosophy of denying the resurrection and the licentious course of life that some may argue for. As the poet Menander astutely wrote, evil communications have a corrupting influence on our thoughts and actions. It is vital to guard ourselves against discourse that goes against our faith, hope, and love, for such conversations can undermine our holiness.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The tendency of the denial of the resurrection, represented by the Epicurean maxim just quoted, leads him to hint that this denial was not altogether unconnected with a practice of too much intimacy with the profligate society around them."
2. "These words (according to the reading χρῆσθʼ, which has, however, hardly any support) form an Iambic trimeter, and occur in this form in a fragment of the Thais of Menander; but Clem Alex. Strom. i. 14 (59), p. 350 P., says, πρὸς γοῦν Κορινθίους...ἰαμβείῳ συγκέχρηται τραγικῷ but this may be a mere inaccuracy."
3. "The Apostle may have cited it merely as a commonplace current, without any idea whence it came; and χρηστά seems to shew this. The plur. ὁμιλίαι, points out the repetition of the practice."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Evil communications corrupt good manners."
2. "Intimacy with the profligate society around was apt to corrupt the principles of the Corinthians."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "Be not deceived - By your false teachers, and by their smooth and plausible arguments."
2. "The sentiment of the passage is, that the contact of evil-minded men, or that the close friendship and conversation of those who hold erroneous opinions, or who are impure in their lives, tends to corrupt the morals, the heart, the sentiments of others."
3. "It is always true that such contact has a pernicious effect on the mind and the heart."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Evil company doth corrupt good manners."
2. "Alas for the ill - luck in mortals that brings this honest man into company with those who have less regard for religion."
3. "In every matter, indeed, nothing is worse than evil - fellowship."

### John Calvin:
1. "Evil communications have more effect than we might suppose, in polluting our minds and corrupting our morals."
2. "Nothing is more pestilential than corrupt doctrine and profane disputations, which draw us off, even in the smallest degree, from a right and simple faith."
3. "Let us, then, take notice, that nothing is more pestilential than corrupt doctrine and profane disputations, which draw us off, even in the smallest degree, from a right and simple faith."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Be not deceived. Do not be led astray by such a false philosophy of life."
2. "Evil company. Evil companionships."
3. "Good manners. Good morals here."

### John Gill:
1. "Be not deceived,.... By such as deny the doctrine of the resurrection, and by their reasonings about it; or by such libertines who go into the denial of it, and argue from thence in favour of their licentious course of life."
2. "Evil communications corrupt good manners. This is a sentence taken out of Menander, an Heathen poet, showing how dangerous is the conversation of evil men, and what an influence bad principles communicated and imbibed, have on the lives and practices of men."
3. "This the apostle cites not out of ostentation, or to show his reading, learning, and acquaintance with such sort of writers; but partly to observe, that this was a truth obvious by the light of nature, and partly because such a testimony might be more regarded by the Corinthians, who might be fond of such authors, and what was said by them."

### John Wesley:
1. "Be not deceived — By such pernicious counsels as this."
2. "Evil communications corrupt good manners — He opposes to the Epicurean saying, a well-known verse of the poet Menander."
3. "Evil communications - Discourse contrary to faith, hope, or love, naturally tends to destroy all holiness."
