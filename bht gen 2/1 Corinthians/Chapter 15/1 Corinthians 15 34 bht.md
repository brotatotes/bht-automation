Awake from your spiritual slumber and be alert to righteousness, urges the apostle. By doing so, you can avoid sin and the ignorance that comes with it. Some among you do not possess the true knowledge of God, and this ignorance is a shameful state. It is important to confront and reject this lack of understanding in order to grow in faith and knowledge.
