# 1 Corinthians 15:35 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The objection raised here is one of doubt and skepticism about the possibility of resurrection. It questions how it is possible for the dead to be raised up after their bodies have completely decomposed and turned into dust. It also wonders what kind of bodies the resurrected will have, especially since their original bodies have become dust. These questions challenge the belief in resurrection and express incredulity towards the concept.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The new difficulty is introduced in the form of a question from an objector." 
2. "In what manner, with what kind of body do they come forth at that time?"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "How—It is folly to deny a fact of REVELATION, because we do not know the 'how.'"
2. "Some measure God's power by their petty intelligence, and won't admit, even on His assurance, anything which they cannot explain."
3. "Paul answers, In one sense it will be the same body, in another, a distinct body. It will be a body, but a spiritual, not a natural, body."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "How is it possible that the dead should be raised? They return to their native dust. They become entirely disorganized. Their dust may be scattered; how shall it be re-collected? Or they may be burned at the stake, and how shall the particles which composed their bodies be recollected and re-organized?"
2. "What will be the form, the shape, the size, the organization of the new body? Are we to suppose that all the matter which at any time entered into its composition here is to be recollected, and to constitute a colossal frame? Are we to suppose that it will be the same as it is here, with the same organization, the same necessities, the same needs?"
3. "Are we to suppose that the bodies will be gross, material, and needing support and nourishment, or, that there will be a new organization?"

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The body is raised through death."
2. "The objection assumes that the risen man must exist in some kind of an organism; and as this cannot be the fleshly body which is corrupted and dissolved, resurrection is impossible."
3. "The question is not, what will be the substance of the risen body, but what will be its organization."

### John Calvin:
1. "There is nothing that is more at variance with human reason than this article of faith."
2. "Who but God alone could persuade us that bodies, which are now liable to corruption, will...be restored entire, but in a greatly better condition."
3. "Paul...brings forward by way of objection...what appears at first view to be at variance with the doctrine of a resurrection."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "But some one will say, How are the dead raised up? and with what manner of body do they come?" Two questions are asked here. The first "How are the dead raised?" is answered half scornfully.

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Granted that Jesus rose from the dead, for the sake of argument, these sceptics refuse to believe in the possibility of our resurrection."
2. "Death itself is the way of resurrection as in the death of the seed for the new plant."
3. "It is a spiritual, not a natural, body that is raised."

### John Gill:
1. "…but as denying the thing, and as objecting to it as a thing impossible, and impracticable; suggesting it could not be, it was a thing incredible…" 
2. "...that such whose bodies have been burnt to ashes, or destroyed by wild beasts, and digested by them, should ever be raised again. Such a doctrine must be past all belief."
3. "Will they come forth with the same bodies, or with other? with earthly or heavenly ones? mortal or immortal? with bodies different from one another, and from what they now are?"

### John Wesley:
1. "How are the dead raised up, after their whole frame is dissolved?"
2. "And with what kind of bodies do they come again, after these are mouldered into dust?"
