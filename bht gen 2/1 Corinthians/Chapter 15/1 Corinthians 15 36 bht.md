# 1 Corinthians 15:36 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The objection to introducing new concepts weakly is unfounded; sowing a seed implies a necessary destruction. Just as a seed must die to bring forth new life, our bodies must die for resurrection. Skeptics' intellectual pose does not equate to true intelligence. Death is not against nature; it precedes life. The corruption and dissolution of the body through death are not obstacles, but rather prerequisites for resurrection. Trust in God's plan, even when it exceeds our comprehension.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "But on the other hand, it seems to me, there is an objection to the introduction of a new matter so lamely as by ·ΩÉ œÉœÄŒµŒØœÅŒµŒπœÇ."
2. "The emphatic œÉœç does not necessarily require any other agency to be emphatically set against it, but may imply an appeal to the objector‚Äôs own experience."
3. "Its life is latent in it; but is not developed into quick and lively action without the death of the deposited seed."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "The seed which thou thyself sowest."
2. "Death, so far from preventing quickening, is the necessary prelude and prognostication of it, just as the seed 'is not quickened' into a new sprout with increased produce, 'except it die' (except a dissolution of its previous organization takes place)."
3. "Christ by His death for us has not given us a reprieve from death as to the life which we have from Adam; nay, He permits the law to take its course on our fleshly nature; but He brings from Himself new spiritual and heavenly life out of death."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "A man was a fool to urge that as an objection to religion which must exist in the undeniable and everyday facts which they witnessed."
2. "The same difficulty may be started about the growth of grain...These facts would be as improbable to him as the doctrine of the resurrection of the dead."
3. "The objection was, that the body died, and returned to dust, and could not, therefore, rise again. The reply of Paul is, 'You may make the same objection to grain that is sown. That dies also. The main body of the kernel decays. In itself there is no prospect that it will spring up.'"

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "Every time thou sowest, thou sowest something which is quickened only through dying."
2. "Paul is not partial to metaphors from nature, and his references of this character are mostly to nature in connection with human labor."
3. "Die. Become corrupted. Applied to the seed in order to keep up the analogy with the body."

### John Calvin:
1. "We must not here form our judgment according to our own understanding, but must assign to the stupendous and secret power of God the honor of believing, that it will accomplish what we cannot comprehend."
2. "He shows that the resurrection is so far from being against nature, that we have every day a clear illustration of it in the course of nature itself - in the growth of the fruits of the earth."
3. "Corruption, then, being the commencement and cause of production, we have in this a sort of picture of the resurrection."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Not more truly does the grain require to die in the ground, to yield the bread we live on, and not more certainly does it yield it when thus first buried in the earthy than must this mortal body die in order to live again, nor more surely will it then rise to life."
2. "That which thou lowest, thou lowest not the body that shall be, but a bare grain, it may chance of wheat, or of some other kind."


### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Thou foolish one (Œ±œÜœÅœâŒΩ). Old word (Œ± privative, œÜœÅŒ∑ŒΩ), lack of sense. It is a severe term and justified by the implication 'that the objector plumes himself on his acuteness' (Robertson and Plummer)."
2. "Sceptics (agnostics) pose as unusually intellectual (the intelligentsia), but the pose does not make one intelligent."
3. "Except it die (ŒµŒ±ŒΩ ŒºŒ∑ Œ±œÄŒøŒ∏Œ±ŒΩŒ∑). Condition of third class, possibility assumed. This is the answer to the 'how' question. In plant life death precedes life, death of the seed and then the new plant."

### John Gill:
1. "Thou fool,.... Not transgressing the law of Christ, which makes him that calls his brother a fool in danger of hell fire... but out of zeal for truth, and to reprove the stupidity and folly of such a bold objector..."
2. "That which thou sowest is not quickened except it die; and which is more especially true of a grain of wheat: our Lord observes the same, and designs by the simile his own death, and resurrection, and the fruit following thereon."
3. "Which shows that the dissolution and corruption of the body by death is so far from being an objection to its resurrection, that it is necessary to it..."

### John Wesley:
1. "That which thou sowest, is not quickened into new life and verdure, except it die - Undergo a dissolution of its parts, a change analogous to death."
2. "Death is so far from hindering life, that it necessarily goes before it."
