# 1 Corinthians 15:37 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The remarkable metamorphosis from a decaying seed into a thriving plant is a glimpse into the concept of resurrection and regeneration. Just as a grain of wheat, once sown as a bare and naked seed, emerges as a magnificent ear of corn with marvelous properties, our bodies too will undergo a similar transformation. Though not the same in terms of physical matter, the new body will retain its identity and exist with different, superior qualities. Death, therefore, should not be seen as a loss but as a necessary passage towards a glorious and renewed form of existence.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Before, the death of the seed was insisted on: now, the non-identity of the seed with the future plant."
2. "He names the plant Ï„á½¸ Ïƒá¿¶Î¼Î± Ï„á½¸ Î³ÎµÎ½Î·ÏƒÏŒÎ¼ÎµÎ½Î¿Î½, having already in his eye the application to the Resurrection."
3. "If it should so happen, peradventure: not, 'for example.'"

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "No longer without stalk or ear, but clothed with blade and ears, and yielding many grains instead of only one." 
2. "Every such germ ('seed') 'shall have its own body,' and be instantly recognized, just as each plant now is known from the seed that was sown."
3. "Progress is the law of the spiritual, as of the natural world. Death is the avenue not to mere revivification or reanimation, but to resurrection and regeneration."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The body which will be raised will not be the same in the sense that the same particles of matter shall compose it, but the same only in the sense that it will have sprung up from that; will constitute the same order, rank, species of being..." 
2. "It is taught that the same particles of matter which constitute the body when it dies, do not constitute the new body at the resurrection."
3. "The design of this is to make it appear more remarkable, and to destroy the force of the objection. It was not only not the grain that should be produced, but it was without the appendages and ornaments of blade, and flower, and beard of the new grain."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "What you sow is one body, and a different body arises;" yet the identity is preserved. Dissolution is not loss of identity."
2. "The full heads of wheat are different from the wheat - grain, yet both are wheat."
3. "The mere seed, without the later investiture of stalk and head."

### John Calvin:
1. "It is not to be wondered that bodies rise from rottenness, inasmuch as the same thing takes place as to seed."
2. "From bare grain, God brings forth so many ears of corn, clothed with admirable contrivance, and stored with grains of superior quality."
3. "He adds, 'to every seed its own body.' By this clause he restricts what he had said respecting another body; for he says that, while the body is different, it is in such a way as to retain, nevertheless, its particular kind."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Not the body which shall be."
2. "The new body is not yet in existence, but only the seed."
3. "We sow seeds, not plants (bodies). The butterfly comes out of the dying worm."

### John Gill:
1. "The possibility of it may be seen, in the quickening and raising up of a grain of wheat, that first rots and dies."
2. "Though it will be the same body, yet with different and excelling qualities."
3. "For as wheat is buried 'naked', it comes forth, (or springs up,) with many clothings."

### John Wesley:
1. "Thou sowest not the body that shall be..."
2. "Produced from the seed committed to the ground..."
3. "but a bare, naked grain, widely different from that which will afterward rise out of the earth."
