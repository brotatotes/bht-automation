# 1 Corinthians 15:38 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
God is the one who determines and gives each seed its specific body, not man or any other factor. The resurrection of the dead is solely God's work, displaying His power and will. Just as each seed has its own distinct body, so too will each soul have its own body, tailored to its qualities and greatly improved. These bodies are not only unique to each species but also specific to each individual, arising from the very substance of that seed.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "ἠθέλησεν, willed...the one act of the divine Will...giving to the particular seed the particular development..." 
2. "But the whole gift to the species being God's, to continue or withhold, the pres. δίδωσιν still holds good."
3. "ἑκάστ. τῶν σπερμάτων, to each of the (kinds of) seed;...ἵδιον σῶμα, a body of its own."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "at creation, when He gave to each of the (kinds of) seeds"
2. "So God can and will give to the blessed at the resurrection their own appropriate body,
    such as it pleases Him, and such as is suitable to their glorified state:
    a body peculiar to the individual, substantially the same as the body sown."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The meaning is, that such a form is produced from the seed sown as God pleases. Paul here traces the result to God, to show that there is no chance, and that it did not depend on the nature of things, but was dependent on the wise arrangement of God."
2. "Everyone shall have his own, that is, his proper body - a body which shall belong to him, and be suited to him. The wicked shall not rise with the body of the just, or with a body adapted to heaven; nor shall the saint rise with a body adapted to perdition. There shall be a fitness or appropriateness in the new body to the character of him who is raised."
3. "In a manner similar to this, the body will be raised; and the illustration of Paul meets all the difficulties about the fact of the resurrection."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "As it hath pleased [καθως ηθελησεν] . Lit., even as He willed; at the creation, when He fixed the different types of grain, so that each should permanently assume a form according to its distinctive type - a body of its own."
2. "That wheat should always be wheat, barley barley, etc."
3. "Compare Genesis 1:11, Genesis 1:12."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "God giveth it a body even as it hath pleased him at its original creation." 
2. "In the vegetable world the Creator has shown inexhaustible resources in point of variety; how easy then to give to the body at its resurrection other properties than those of its mortal state, without destroying its essential identity?"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "A body of its own (ιδιον σωμα). Even under the microscope the life cells or germ plasm may seem almost identical, but the plant is quite distinct."
2. "On σπερμα, seed, old word from σπειρω, to sow, see on Matthew 13:24."

### John Gill:
1. "It is not the husbandman, nor the sun, nor the rain, that give the grain of wheat, or any other, its verdure and beauty... but God by his own power, and of his sovereign will and pleasure." 
2. "The resurrection of the dead is God's work; it is an instance of his power, and of his sovereign will... all that glory in which the body will arise springs from his free grace, and is bestowed upon the selfsame body, which was carried about here, and laid in the grave." 
3. "As every seed has its own body, so will every soul have its own body, though greatly different as to its qualities, and much improved for the better, as in seed sown."

### John Wesley:
1. "But God — Not thou, O man, not the grain itself, giveth it a body as it hath pleased him" 
2. "to each of the seeds, not only of the fruits, but animals also, its own body"
3. "not only peculiar to that species, but proper to that individual, and arising out of the substance of that very grain."
