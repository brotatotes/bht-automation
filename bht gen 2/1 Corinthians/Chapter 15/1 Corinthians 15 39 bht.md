# 1 Corinthians 15:39 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
All bodies are not the same, whether earthly or heavenly. Just as earthly bodies differ from each other, it is no surprise that heavenly bodies also have their own distinctive qualities. This concept can be extended to include the bodies that rise from the grave. It is clear that there is a diversity and uniqueness among bodies, regardless of their origin.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:

1. "He implies by the word that our resurrection bodies shall be in some sense really flesh, not mere phantoms of air."
2. "As the kinds of flesh, however widely differing from one another, do not cease to be flesh, so the kinds of bodies, however differing from one another, are still bodies."

3. "Now who that saw, for the first time, the little pendant coffin in which the insect lay entombed, and was ignorant of the transformation of which we are now speaking, would ever predict that, in a few weeks, perhaps in a few days or hours, it would become one of the most elegant and active of winged insects?"
