# 1 Corinthians 15:40 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Just as there are celestial bodies like the sun, moon, and stars, and earthly bodies like plants and animals, there is a distinction between the qualities and glory of each. The brightness of earthly bodies is incomparable to the radiance of heavenly bodies. This illustrates the vast difference between our present bodies and the glorified bodies that will be raised in the resurrection.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Not, according to our modern expression, 'heavenly bodies', for they are introduced first in 1 Corinthians 15:41, and if we apply these words to them, we must suppose the Apostle to have imagined the stars to be endowed with bodies in the literal sense: for he is here comparing not figurative expressions, but physical realities." 
2. "Nor (as Chrys., al.) the bodies of the righteous, as opposed to those of the wicked; for in these there is no organic difference whatever: but, as Meyer and De Wette, 'the bodies of angels', the only heavenly organisms of which we are aware."
3. "δόξα belongs to the ἐπουράνια more strictly than to the ἐπίγεια. In Luke 9:26, we have ἐν τῇ δόξῃ αὐτοῦ καὶ τοῦ πατρὸς καὶ τῶν ἁγίων ἀγγέλων."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Celestial bodies - not the sun, moon, and stars, but the bodies of angels, as distinguished from the bodies of earthly creatures."
2. "The glory of the celestial - as referenced in Luke 9:26."
3. "Glory of the terrestrial - as mentioned in Matthew 6:28, Matthew 6:29, and 1 Peter 1:24."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "There is a great variety of bodies. Look upon the heavens, and see the splendor of the sun, the moon, and the stars. And then look upon the earth, and see the bodies there - the bodies of people, and brutes, and insects."
2. "Do we not, in fact, see a vast difference between what strikes our eye here on earth and in the sky?"
3. "Beautiful as may be the human frame; beautiful as may be the plumage of birds; beautiful as may be the flower, the fossil, the mineral, the topaz, or the diamond; yet they differ from the heavenly bodies, and are not to be compared with them."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The scoffers who refused to believe in the existence of the future body would hardly have admitted the existence of angelic bodies. To convince them on their own ground, the apostle appeals exclusively to what is seen." 
2. "The sense is, the heavenly bodies, described more specifically in ver. 41. Bodies terrestrial... grouping men, beasts, birds, fishes under this term."
3. "It is to be observed that the apostle makes two general categories - terrestrial and celestial bodies, and shows the distinctions of organization subsisting between the members of each... and that he also shows the distinction between the two categories regarded as wholes."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "There are also celestial bodies not those of good angels, but what we call the 'heavenly bodies' sun, moon, and stars."
2. "Bodies terrestrial embracing all that distinguishes the organisms of earth from those of the heavens."
3. "But the glory of the celestial is one."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Paul now rises higher in the range of his argument, above the merely terrestrial bodies."
2. "He has shown differences in the bodies here on earth in plants and in the animal kingdom and now he indicates like differences to be seen in the heavens above us."
3. "Experience does not argue against a glory for the spiritual body."

### John Gill:
1. "...though both sorts are bodies, yet their qualities differ, and there is a greater glory in the one than in the other."
2. "This is another similitude, serving to help our ideas of this doctrine of the resurrection of the body that though it is the same in substance, yet different in qualities."
3. "...it shows the difference there will be between the raised bodies and the present ones; which will be as great as that which now is between celestial and terrestrial bodies."

### John Wesley:
1. "There are also heavenly bodies — As the sun, moon, and stars; and there are earthy - as vegetables and animals."
2. "But the brightest lustre which the latter can have is widely different from that of the former."
