# 1 Corinthians 15:41 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The given passage sheds light on the manifold splendor and individual beauty that exists among the celestial bodies. The analogy drawn between the differing glories of the sun, moon, and stars suggests that just as these heavenly bodies exhibit their own unique brilliance, there may also be distinctions in the glory of our resurrection bodies. This notion emphasizes the diversity and intricacy of God's creation, reminding us that each element has its own inherent splendor.

### Philip Schaff:
