# 1 Corinthians 15:42 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The transformation from death to resurrection is a remarkable and significant change, just like the difference between a fallen body and a risen body. The metaphor of being sown like a seed beautifully captures the idea of the body being committed to the ground. However, the risen body is completely different from its former state and is raised in a state of eternal and unchangeable incorruption, free from any possibility of dissolution or decay.
