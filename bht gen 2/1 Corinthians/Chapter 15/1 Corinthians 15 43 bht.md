# 1 Corinthians 15:43 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
These quotes highlight the contrasting nature of our earthly bodies and the bodies we will receive in the resurrection. Our current bodies are susceptible to dishonor, weakness, and decay. However, in the resurrection, our bodies will be transformed into glorious, powerful, and incorruptible forms. Our mortal bodies, which are humiliated and weakened, will be exchanged for bodies that are honored, strong, and free from imperfection. This transformation reflects the divine power and goodness of God in giving us new bodies that are suited for eternal life in His presence.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "In dishonour...in glory" - regarding, as throughout this argument, only the resurrection of the just.
2. "In weakness" - the characteristic of the lifeless body, which is relaxed and powerless. 
3. "The powerlessness of the corpse, contrasted with in vigour, viz. the fresh and eternal energy of the new body free from disease and pain."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:

2. "The garment of incorruption": like His glorious body, which we shall put on.
3. "Not liable to the weaknesses of our present frail bodies" (Isaiah 33:24; Revelation 21:4).

### Albert Barnes:
1. "It is sown in dishonour - In the grave, where it is shut out from human view; hurried away from the sight of friends; loathsome and offensive as a mass turning to decay."
2. "It is raised in glory - In honor; in beauty; honored by God by the removal of the curse, and in a form and manner that shall be glorious."
3. "It is sown in weakness - Weak, feeble, liable to decay. Here disease prostrates the strength, takes away its power, consigns it to the dust."

2. "...it is conceived in sin, and shapen in iniquity; it is unclean, and born of the flesh..."
3. "...in the resurrection, it is raised in glory; in perfect beauty and comeliness, without the least blemish, defect, or imperfection; nor will there be any part of it that will occasion shame..."
