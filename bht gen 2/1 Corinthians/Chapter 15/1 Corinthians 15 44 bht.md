# 1 Corinthians 15:44 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The body in its current state is described as animal, requiring sustenance and subject to the limitations of the natural world. However, in the resurrection, a remarkable transformation occurs. It becomes a spiritual body, not in essence, but in quality. It no longer relies on earthly needs but is aligned with the spirit and soul of man. This new body is suited for spiritual service and finds delight in spiritual things, resembling the nature of angels. The extent of this transformation may be difficult for us to fully grasp, but through the power of Christ, it becomes a glorious reality.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "If there exists an animal body, there exists also a spiritual." 
2. "It is no more wonderful a thing, that there should be a body fitted to the capacities and wants of man's highest part, his spirit."
3. "The emphasis is both times on á¼”ÏƒÏ„Î¹Î½."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "a body moulded in its organism of 'flesh and blood' to suit the animal soul which predominates in it."
2. "spiritual bodyâ€”a body wholly moulded by the Spirit, and its organism not conformed to the lower and animal, but to the higher and spiritual, life."
3. "It is no more wonderful a thing that there should be a body fitted to the capacities and want of man's highest part, his spirit (which we see to be the case), than that there should be one fitted to the capacities and wants of his subordinate part, the animal soul."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The apostle here, by affirming that the body will be spiritual, intends to deny that it will need that which is now necessary to the support of the animal functions; it will not be sustained in that way; it will lay aside these special animal organizations, and will cease to convey the idea which we now attach to the word animal, or to possess that which we now include under the name of vital functions."
2. "Not a mere spirit, for then it would not be a body. The word spiritual here stands opposed to the word natural, or animal. it will not be a body that is subject to the laws of the vital functions, or organized or sustained in that way."
3. "It will be a body without the vital functions of the animal economy; a body sustained in the manner in which we conceive the spirit to be."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "The expression natural body signifies an organism animated by a yuch soul...which characterizes the man as a mortal creature; while pneuma spirit is that phase which looks Godward, and characterizes him as related to God."
2. "In the resurrection - body the pneuma spirit...conditions its nature."
3. "A body in which a divine pneuma spirit supersedes the yuch soul, so that the resurrection - body is the fitting organ for its indwelling and work, and so is properly characterized as a spiritual body."

### John Calvin:
1. "Now it is the soul that quickens the body, so as to keep it from being a dead carcase."
2. "For as to the soulâ€™s now quickening the body, that is effected through the intervention of many helps; for we stand in need of drink, food, clothing, sleep, and other things of a similar nature."
3. "The energy of the Spirit, on the other hand, for quickening, will be much more complete, and, consequently, exempted from necessities of that nature."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "it is raised a spiritual body, not meaning a body simply of finer material than the present, but a body whose animating principle is 'the spirit,' or rational nature in its entirely purified and perfected condition."
2. "a body all whose organs and properties will be adapted to the inner and higher nature whose handmaid it is to be."
3. "If there is a natural body, there is also a spiritual body [1] the one no less certain than the other and simply an advance from the lower to the higher."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "The resurrection body is not wholly Ï€Î½ÎµÏ…Î¼Î±. Caution is needed here in filling out details concerning the ÏˆÏ…Ï‡Î· and the Ï€Î½ÎµÏ…Î¼Î±."
2. "But certainly he means to say that the 'spiritual body' has some kind of germinal connection with the 'natural body,' though the development is glorious beyond our comprehension though not beyond the power of Christ to perform."
3. "The force of the argument remains unimpaired though we cannot follow fully into the thought beyond us."

### John Gill:
1. "It is sown a natural body,.... Or an animal one, being generated as animals are, and supported with food as they be, and die at last as they do." 
2. "It is raised a spiritual body; not as to substance, but as to its quality; it will not be changed into a spirit...but the body will then be subject to the spirit and soul of man." 
3. "It will be employed in spiritual service, for which it will be abundantly fitted and assisted by the Spirit of God; and it will be delighted with spiritual objects; it will be like the angels, those excellent spirits."

### John Wesley:
1. "It is sown in this world a merely animal body - Maintained by food, sleep, and air, like the bodies of brutes."
2. "It is raised of a more refined contexture, needing none of these animal refreshments."
3. "Endued with qualities of a spiritual nature, like the angels of God."
