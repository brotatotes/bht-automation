# 1 Corinthians 15:45 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The first man, Adam, was created as a living soul, given life by God like other animals. However, the last Adam, Jesus Christ, is a life-giving spirit. He is not only a man, but the fulfillment and antitype of the first Adam. Christ possesses life in himself and has the power to give life to whomever he chooses. This includes the promise of a refined, transformed life even for our physical bodies in the resurrection.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "The words quoted serve therefore rather for the illustration of man being a ψυχή, than for a proof of the existence of the spiritual body." 
2. "The whole complex of his suffering and triumphant state seems to be embraced in these words."
3. "He was a πνεῦμα ζωοποιοῦν, even while in the σῶμα ψυχικόν; and is still such in the σῶμα πνευματικόν."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "In contrast to 'the last,' Paul calls 'man' (Genesis 2:7) 'the FIRST Adam.'" 
2. "The spiritual body is the fruit of our union with the second Adam, who is the quickening Spirit."
3. "As He became representative of the whole of humanity in His union of the two natures, He exhausted in His own person the sentence of death passed on all men, and giveth spiritual and everlasting life to whom He will."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The use of the word 'soul' in our translation, for ψυχὴ psuchē, and נפשׁ nephesh, does not quite convey the idea...more properly denote that which is alive, which is animated, which breathes, which has an animal nature."
2. "Christ here seems to be called Adam because he stands in contradistinction from the first Adam...we derive our immortal and undying bodies from the other."
3. "He was constituted not as having life merely, but as endowed with the power of imparting life...Christ had such a spiritual existence such power as a spirit; that he was the source of all life to his people."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. "A living soul [ψυχην ζωσαν] . See Genesis 2:7. Here yuch passes into its personal sense - an individual personality (see Romans 11:4), yet retaining the emphatic reference to the yuch as the distinctive principle of that individuality in contrast with the pneuma spirit following." 
2. "Hence this fact illustrates the general statement there is a natural body: such was Adam's, the receptacle and organ of the yuch soul."
3. "The period at which Christ became a quickening Spirit is the resurrection, after which His body began to take on the characteristics of a spiritual body."

### John Calvin:
1. "Moses relates that Adam was furnished with a living soul; Christ, on the other hand, is endowed with a life-giving Spirit. Now it is a much greater thing to be life, or the source of life, than simply to live."
2. "Christ came to restore our nature from ruin, and raise it up to a better condition than ever. They are then, as it were, two sources, or two roots of the human race."
3. "The second Adam...could quicken others — a quickening spirit, not only quickened passively, but quickened actively, such a spirit as could give spirit, and diffuse life."

### John Gill:
1. "the first man Adam": he calls him, as the Jews a frequently do, אדם הראשון, "the first man"; he was the first man that was made, and the first parent of mankind, and the head and representative of all his posterity.
2. the last Adam was made a quickening spirit: by "the last Adam" is meant Jesus Christ, called Adam, because he is really and truly a man, a partaker of the same flesh and blood as the rest of mankind; and because he is the antitype of the first man Adam, who was a figure of him that was to come.

### John Wesley:
