# 1 Corinthians 15:46 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The law of growth is such that the natural always comes before the spiritual, as shown in the progression from Adam's animal body to the spiritual body of Christ. This order is seen throughout history, with the lower life preceding the higher and the imperfect making way for the perfect. The transformation from the natural to the spiritual is a divine process, where the impure is replaced by the pure and the vile is exchanged for the precious and glorious.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1.  46 .] But in the natural order, that which is  animal precedes that which is  spiritual (  τὸ ψυχ  .,   τὸ πνευμ ., not σῶμα , but abstract and general): as in 1 Corinthians 15:45 , ὁ πρῶτος ὁ ἔσχατος .

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Adam had a soul, not necessarily mortal, but 'a living soul,' and destined to live for ever."
2. "Still his body was but an animal-souled body, not a spiritual body as believers shall have."
3. "His soul had the germ of the Spirit, rather than the fulness of it, such as man shall have when restored 'body, soul, and spirit,' by the second Adam."

### Albert Barnes:
1. "The imperfect is succeeded by the perfect; the impure by the pure; the vile and degraded by the precious and the glorious."
2. "There is a tendency toward perfection, and God observes the proper order by which that which is most glorious shall be secured."
3. "It was not his plan that all things in the beginning should be perfect; but that perfection should be the work of time, and should be secured in an appropriate order of events."

### Marvin Vincent:
1. Not first - spiritual - natural. A general principle, illustrated everywhere in human history, that the lower life precedes the higher.

### John Calvin:
1. "It is necessary, says he, that before we are restored in Christ, we derive our origin from Adam and resemble him."
2. "Let us, therefore, not wonder, if we begin with the living soul, for as being born precedes in order being born again, so living precedes rising again."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Howbeit that is not first which is spiritual, but that which is natural" 
2. "by an ascent from the lower to the higher, as is the law of all God’s works."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1.  Howbeit that is not first which is spiritual, but that which is natural  (αλλ' ου πρωτον το πνευματικον, αλλα το ψυχικον). Literally, "But not first the spiritual, but the natural." This is the law of growth always. 

### John Gill:
1. "the spiritual body, though the more perfect and most excellent, yet was not first in being: but that which is natural."
2. "Adam's animal body was before Christ's spiritual body: and afterwards that which is spiritual."
3. "it is first a natural body, as generated and nourished, as weak and dying, and it is afterwards a spiritual one, when raised from the dead."
