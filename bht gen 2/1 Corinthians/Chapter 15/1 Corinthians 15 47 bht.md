# 1 Corinthians 15:47 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The first man, Adam, was formed from the earth, and his earthly nature led to sin and brought death into the world. In contrast, Christ, the second man, came from heaven as the head and representative of all his spiritual offspring. His divine origin and heavenly nature set him apart, and he will come again from heaven as the Lord and Judge of all. Just as the actions of Adam affected all whom he represented, the redemptive work of Christ has a universal impact, offering the promise of eternal life to all who believe.
