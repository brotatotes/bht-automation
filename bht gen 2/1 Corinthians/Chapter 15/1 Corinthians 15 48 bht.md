# 1 Corinthians 15:48 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Such is the contrast between those who are of the earth, driven by their earthly desires and motives, and those who have received a heavenly nature, a divine principle from above. Those who remain earthy are confined to the limitations of their earthly existence, while those who are heavenly experience a transformation and embrace a higher way of living. It is a reminder that we have a choice to align ourselves with the earthly or the heavenly, and the latter brings us into communion with the divine.
