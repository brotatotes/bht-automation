# 1 Corinthians 15:49 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
When we bear the image of the heavenly, it refers to the holiness and glory that will be bestowed upon us. This image is not just about the sinful nature being removed from our souls, but also about the transformation of our bodies into ones that are free from infirmities and death, just like Christ's. This transformation begins in the present through our spiritual regeneration and continues to be revealed as we behold Christ. Ultimately, this image will be fully realized and perfected in glory when our bodies are fashioned like His in the resurrection.
