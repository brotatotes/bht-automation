# 1 Corinthians 15:5 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The appearances of Jesus after his resurrection are related in chronological order. Peter, one of the Twelve, was the first to see him. The events described likely take place after the resurrection and the appearance of Jesus to the apostles. While Matthias may have been present during the appearances, it is clear that the focus is on the core group of apostles. These appearances were not merely visions or isolated events, but actual sightings of the risen Christ, verified by credible witnesses. In particular, Jesus appeared to Peter, who played a significant role in the early Christian community.
