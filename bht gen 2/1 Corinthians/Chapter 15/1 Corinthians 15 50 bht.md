# 1 Corinthians 15:50 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Our current bodies, fragile and subject to decay, are not suitable for the kingdom of God. They are composed of changing particles and are wasted away by sickness and death. These bodies would obstruct the worship and activities of the heavenly realm. Therefore, a significant change is necessary for us to be prepared for heaven. We must be renewed in respect to our bodies, transformed by Christ to bear His image. The resurrection body, while still a body, will be spiritual and incorruptible. This change is vital for us to enter into the incorruptible and glorious kingdom of God.

## Choicest Commentary Quotes:
### Henry Alford:
1. "Not only is the change of body possible, and according to natural and spiritual analogies, but it is NECESSARY."
2. "The present organism of the body, calculated for the wants of the animal soul."
3. "The pres. sets forth the absolute impossibility in the nature of things."

### Jamieson-Fausset-Brown:
1. "Flesh and blood" of the same animal and corruptible nature as our present (1 Corinthians 15:44) animal-souled bodies, cannot inherit the kingdom of God.
2. Therefore the believer acquiesces gladly in the unrepealed sentence of the holy law, which appoints the death of the present body as the necessary preliminary to the resurrection body of glory. Hence he "dies daily" to the flesh and to the world, as the necessary condition to his regeneration here and hereafter (John 3:6; Galatians 2:20).
3. The resurrection body will be still a body though spiritual, and substantially retaining the personal identity; as is proved by Luke 24:39; John 20:27, compared with Philippians 3:21.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "There must be a material and important change in regard to them before they can be prepared for heaven."
2. "Bodies that are fragile, weak, liable to disease, subject to pain and death. They are composed of changing particles; to be repaired and strengthened daily; they are subject to decay, and are wasted away by sickness, and of course they cannot be suited to a world where there shall be no decay and no death."
3. "Such bodies as ours would not be suited to relish the pure and exalted pleasures of an incorruptible world... they would interfere with the exalted worship, the active service, and the sleepless employments of the heavenly world..."

### John Calvin:
1. "What I have said as to bearing the image of the heavenly Adam means this - that we must be renewed in respect of our bodies, inasmuch as our bodies, being liable to corruption, cannot inherit God's incorruptible kingdom."
2. "Hence there will be no admission for us into the kingdom of Christ, otherwise than by Christ's renewing us after his own image."
3. "Flesh and blood, however, we must understand, according to the condition in which they at present are, for our flesh will be a participant in the glory of God, but it will be - as renewed and quickened by the Spirit of Christ."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God." 
2. "Humanity as now constituted, 'mortal,' 'corruptible,' 'weak,' etc., cannot inherit the kingdom of God." 
3. "The kingdom of God is 'incorruptible, undefiled, unfading'."

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Hence there must be a change by death from the natural body to the spiritual body."
2. "He ate and could be handled and yet he passed through closed doors."
3. "Paul does not base his argument on the special circumstances connected with the risen body of Jesus."

### John Gill:
1. "The body, as it now is, is not capable of possessing the heavenly glory; was it to be introduced into heaven, in the condition it is now, it would break in pieces, and crumble into dust."
2. "The human nature, or body, so and so qualified, is here meant; either as corrupted with sin, for without holiness and righteousness no man shall see the Lord, or enter into and possess the kingdom of heaven."
3. "By corruption is not so much meant sin, or the corruption of nature, or man as corrupted by sin, though it is true of such an one, that he does not, and cannot inherit incorruption; the incorruptible crown, the crown of glory that fadeth not away, the incorruptible inheritance, reserved in the heavens, those riches which moth and rust corrupt not."

### John Wesley:
1. "But first we must be entirely changed."
2. "Such flesh and blood as we are clothed with now cannot enter into that kingdom which is wholly spiritual."
3. "Neither doth this corruptible body inherit that incorruptible kingdom."
