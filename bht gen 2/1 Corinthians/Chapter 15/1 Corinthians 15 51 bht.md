# 1 Corinthians 15:51 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
Behold, a mystery revealed! The truth, hidden until now, is made known to us through divine revelation. We, as believers, are united in this understanding. Though not all of us will experience physical death, we will all undergo a transformation, shedding our mortal bodies for incorruptible ones. This change, whether through resurrection or instantaneous divine power, will make our bodies spiritual, conforming us to the image of Christ.

2. "To this, we may reply: (1) He is speaking of Christians as such - of the whole church that had been redeemed - of the entire mass that should enter heaven; and he groups them all together, and connects himself with them, and says, 'We shall not die; we Christians, including the whole church, shall not all die,' etc."
3. "The sense is, that all who are alive at the coming of the Lord Jesus shall undergo such a change as to fit them for their new abode in heaven; or such as shall make them like those who shall be raised from the dead."

### Marvin Vincent:
