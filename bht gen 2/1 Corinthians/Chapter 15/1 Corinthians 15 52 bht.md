# 1 Corinthians 15:52 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, the change will occur, a sublime expression of all but instantaneousness. The last trumpet will sound, summoning the entire world to the judgment seat of God. The dead, even the very dead, will hear this symbolical event. The amazing work of God's power will transform the living into saints in a trice, before a man can shut his eyes and open them again. This will be the last trumpet, with no others to follow, and it will awaken all those who sleep in the dust of the earth.

### Albert Barnes:
1. "In a moment - (ŒµÃìŒΩ Œ±ÃìœÑŒøÃÅŒºœâÕÖ en atomoÃÑ). In an 'atom,' scil. of time; a point of time which cannot be cut or divided... It will be done instantaneously."

1. "In a moment...the change will be sudden and instantaneous, because Christ‚Äôs advent will be sudden."

### Philip Schaff:
1. "in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye a sublime expression of all but instantaneousness."
2. "There will, indeed, be an interval between the 'resurrection' of the dead and the 'changing' of the living saints for 'the dead in Christ shall rise first' (1 Thessalonians 4:16), but so brief as to be but as the 'twinkling of an eye.'"
3. "at the last trump ('the trump of God,' 1 Thessalonians 4:16), for the trumpet shall sound audibly, it would seem, as the signal for the winding up of all present things, and we (the living) shall be changed."

### Archibald T. Robertson:

3. "Symbolical, of course."

### John Gill:
1. "The change upon the bodies of living saints will be so quick, that it will be done in a trice, before a man can shut his eyes and open them again."
