# 1 Corinthians 15:53 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
As the apostle emphasizes, our current mortal and corruptible nature cannot enter the kingdom of God. We must undergo a transformation, either through resurrection or a change without experiencing death. We are to put on incorruption and immortality, like clothing, as our current bodies are insufficient. This transformation is necessary for us to be admitted into the heavenly state. Our mortal bodies are to be clothed with incorruption, shedding the rags of mortality and adorning ourselves with the radiant garments of immortality.
