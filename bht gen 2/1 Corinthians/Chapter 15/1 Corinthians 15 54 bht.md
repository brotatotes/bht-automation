# 1 Corinthians 15:54 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The prophecy of the Messiah obtaining victory over death is fulfilled through his death and resurrection. In the resurrection, all believers will be raised from the dead, and death will be completely and forever conquered. The prophet expresses this as an active action by the Messiah, while the apostle cites it as a passive accomplishment by him after the resurrection. The prophecy belongs to the times of the Messiah, as it states that God will cause death to be completely swallowed up. This means that death is not just conquered, but completely abolished forever.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "And when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written (Isaiah 25:8), Death is swallowed up in victory." 
2. "The apostle departs here from the incorrect rendering of the LXX., and keeps nearer to the Hebrew, which runs thus: 'He hath swallowed up death for ever,' But since this idea of 'completeness' is often rendered 'unto victory' in the LXX. (as Job 36:7; Jeremiah 3:5), he avails himself of the phrase' here, and all the rather, as after describing death as 'the last enemy,' he delights to view the eternal extinction of death as a glorious 'victory' over that 'last enemy.'"

### Archibald T. Robertson:
1. "Whenever shall put on" - First aorist middle subjunctive with οταν whenever, merely indefinite future, no futurum exactum, merely meaning, "whenever shall put on," not "shall have put on."
2. "Is swallowed up" - First aorist passive indicative of καταπινω, old verb to drink down, swallow down. Perfective use of κατα- where we say "up," "swallow up." Timeless use of the aorist tense.
3. "The final overthrow of the king of Terrors" - Theodotion reads the Hebrew verb (bulla, for billa,) as passive like Paul. It is the "final overthrow of the king of Terrors" as shown in Hebrews 2:15.

1. "The Messiah shall by his death, and resurrection from the dead, obtain such an entire victory over death, not only for himself, but for all his people, that in the resurrection morn, when they will be all raised from the dead, death will be so swallowed up, that it will be no more."
2. "The prophet expresses it actively, it being a prediction of what was to be done by the Messiah; the apostle cites it passively, as being accomplished by him after the resurrection, and considered as a part of the song sung by the risen saints."
3. "The Jews acknowledge that this prophecy belongs to the times of the Messiah; so they say that 'the Messiah shall descend from Pharez, and in his day the holy blessed God will cause death to be swallowed up.'"

### John Wesley:
1. Death is swallowed up in victory — That is, totally conquered, abolished for ever.
