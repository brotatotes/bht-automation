# 1 Corinthians 15:55 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
In this triumphant exclamation, the Apostle contemplates the defeat of death and the destruction of Hades. Like a venomous beast, death stings with its plagues and pestilence. However, through the resurrection, the souls in Hades are liberated and death's victory is abolished. The power of sin, symbolized by death's sting, is rendered powerless as the sinful nature of the body changes to the spiritual. This exclamation of victory celebrates the triumph over death and sin, as the Apostle rejoices in the assurance that death's sting is ultimately defeated through the resurrection.

### Philip Schaff:
1. "The challenge to 'death,' to say where is now its 'victory,' seems the natural sequel of the immediately preceding words, 'Death is swallowed up in victory;'".
