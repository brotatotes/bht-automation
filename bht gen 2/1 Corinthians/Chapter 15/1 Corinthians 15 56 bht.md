# 1 Corinthians 15:56 Commentary Help Text

## BHT:
The sting of death is sin, which gives it all its bitterness and misery, like a poisonous and venomous sting. Without sin, death would have no power over us. The law reveals the strength and evil nature of sin, exposing its dreadful consequences and aggravations. By transgressing this known law, we commit a heinous offense against the great lawgiver, whose power and authority we disregard. We are unable to resist the sting of sin by our own strength, requiring the power of God to deliver us.
